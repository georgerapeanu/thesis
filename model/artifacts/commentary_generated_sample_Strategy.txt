?! A good typical +2.03%} It is considered in the Ruy Lopez for White, and it gives up the pawn.
I "Indelt" I ever thought, I will win this before... Weak of this! Maybe o-o-o, at least, Ba3 or d4 improves the bishop pair. But he want to play my first mistake, because it is very vulnerable to white... but this would be very useful in this case, wrong was NOT to follow. On the relatively, BOT FOW 10.Nh then attack my center pawns at the same time, and the isolates black rooks.
He decides to oblige his knight on d5, but i also wanted to connect my rooks defense at this moment...
This was pointless. I was worried about the White e-pawn. In this case: just lining up the long diagonal.

He scoud. He played this because I only penetrates the black king then the storm towards the black king. Well, white is one piece and a pawn ahead...
Black moves Rook to b1 and I move my rook across to a3 and queen to a3 on move 63 to stop the pawn hoping to protect the King and then to queen the pawn.
Unnless more attractive defence was positioned with one of his pieces.  I don't have the time to play my color bishop
Winning the whole game, and blak can still cost white a finier game.
Puts the bishop in e5, also reinforced the pressure and also opens the f8-a8 diagonal for his queen.
Giving me pesky five circumstances for free.
And here she comes.
? threatening to fork the rook and with the queen.
double attack on the bishop.
Playing your attack.  It's now clear that the King plays defensive e5 square would be clear.
There might still be a Captainngaging tactical target, but for...
Declined continues to develop a piece.
Normal development. It prevents Qd7 and if d7 I can play e6.
Trying to block my rook
14. ....... g6 - all in here!  I will now come to boast his rook.  I have to take least this knight.
I'm not sure what I fail to do here, but I'm complaisantly concerned about this move, I wasn't sure how neither of us was Rd8 or Qe4 would happen.
! I want to get my black bishop to safety.
Preparing to advance c3 with aim to Be7
17. Rd1 - after the exchange of queens but that need be.
This game was one of the lastbackones and I live for any mistakes. I have had the time to improve the game.
but black tried to pin the knight, the positional three wasliefening from black 7...Nxc6.
Chasing the king away and putting the queen to recover by losing the bishop (though maybe a pawn is attacked). Here,b) (correct option is still 7. Bb3#
I kind of taken the unprotected pawn at the side.  This move gives black the advantage.
He wants to have to hide my king's way
...and he can defend my queen's pawn, which looks solid. Good. White could have been offering to trade queens, but the trap is that it might as well come.
Gains a tempo.  The game has a bit of clarifying this series behind that repames. My only chance for moves to start the bishop behind it as best, although the White knight is exposed; There's no way to prevent the whole check if Black moves his king to d1, but if White wants the Queen I then he can capture c2 forcing the most likely not ignoring it overlooking the bishop at this point.  Black wins anyway and is up two pawns again!
Here, I think white has an advantage which is the sicilian advantage here, especially when he opened the lines in front of the rooks. Black will need to keep his queen trapped, with tempo, I'm thinking this would have embarrassed a pawn.
Keeping the weakness on the h3-a1 diagonal. White's rook is now in a nice position! The king is looking intact by a2-a5 diagonal where it stands open Rc3 defense. White should not even have taken his pawn on f5 with Nf6 because of Nd5+ check, or if the rook retreat f3 (the guy if Ke4+, Kd1, Nc2, d2 is forced) and now black is in no way out of this situation.  Bc2!! Pretty very favorable in the way.
This was a clever move, forcing the king on the 8th row.
Computer prefers 3...Qa5. Latzy selets the classical responses after 4...Qb7. Petrov can lead to an eye on positional system after 4...Ba5 5.d3 Nf6 7.a4 Nf6. Probably, the only line here is bad for White and after 4...Qd5 working out a defensive move that opensments with 4...d6 6.a3 Bb5 7.c3 h6, 8.c5 with to undertake pressure of the center square (5...Bb5) 9.Nc4 d6. Its better for Black - playing 3...Bb6 because of the move 4. Nf3 should not be the threat of Nh5+ 4.Bb5. The Paulsen defense of the Queen created is at b5, and doesn't look pretty well as it is utopular now invasing the queen's escape rare to pressure d6, but does this developing attack will gain the f-file. Ultanother risk of the battle, it's about the opening. The real respect of Spentals line (jano is the Exchange variation).
Developing a second piece. I would rather notice my 8th move that my opponent would gain a double pawn but maybe, trying to get rid of that one by playing Be7  9.g4! already i didnt want to open the e-file for my rook
Not an utilising sacrifice, if I get a focused on my pawn structure he could play Qh2+ followed by Rg2+ Bxf3 thus regret the lead.
15 ... Rh8+ leads to 16. h4+
Why not want allowed the Queen to escape from a very ugly diagonal? My plan was to take my Queen and even make it an escapewhere: I will play fxg3, and go d4 or g4.
...black is forced to defend, I have backed up my protection against the WIE. So, trying to move the King to f7 anyway.
he moves his knight...
So I take a risk, true, he'll take the rook on f8. I had 3 moves to check him, and perhaps exchange the queen on h3, putting my rook on a5 to fork Henry and my king. I suppose he'd kick me off with 18.f4 or so did take the and recapture with his C pawn. I want to try to get my Queen to h6...
If he falls into the trap he will distract his kingside
More importantly by White is my idea now that I need to. The better move might need to get the king out.
now the results in trippose on b1 to get a check
white tries to defend the push and rcale uses his queen in order to prove a fight of further.
opening up the a-file and taking aside for a f2-knight.
Fritz really likes this move because I wanted to allow white to open up the position on e3.
trying to get bishop away from the defense of f6
You could castle. Next move would stop the pawn from f6 to h6 to get rid of the bishop this post. And then a bishop is going to b5 to exchange Rooks and take the 2 square crucial rook
preparing to castle.
And I decided to remove b3 once.
This move is nuisance because the d-pawn controls much t square for the knight allows the light-squared bishop to support the rook from the d-pawn advance. However, there is little else to be targeted for b7 than d6.
White brings his king out to the center while at some moves to help pressure Black from the queenside. This weakens the kingside structure.
The idea of that diagonal was to develop the light squared Bishop and planning Nd8 piling the queen's power.
I still missed this line at last but decided not to place my Bishop on e6 to attack the QB from a6 and attack on b7.
and now the white bishop has been an inusion.
! At the expense of the queen check on a possible square which was later on. black much miscalculation, but this has brought black's king to safety. Moreover, on but it is not adequate.
Defending the bishop, but neither of an impressive knight shields the f7-Kf8 bishop.
Black just has an odd game. This variation proves serious of a Tal, that He wondering since he has brought so much time to regroup at some point.
trying to keep the king in the open way. Bxb6 is now a good idea to play on. The text is the bonus of a pawn!
White forces the exchange of the bishops. Better is 19...Ba6 protecting the black king but I was expecting 19 Nxd4, a loss of my entire board.
totally trapping my rook
When you are down material and don't see how a strategy caused him to simplify but don't get away. The finishing very sufficient game from their last pare! Thanks, you for watchings, it was applied to apply came out when and make mistakes and hope you are in trouble. On the other hand, because we'll have a down in material if you were to think about having your refretently more active pieces together, always let you go back. The computer suggests ..Re6 which could lead even best to a draw. But please leave a comment.
Principle of mukhander and I get mated.
connecting rooks
My petone has put his B, king and ok move.
...so I do scramble to the question of 'again'' again.
moves his bishop and unpins my knight
?? This is not the strongest move that Black should have had seen the modeldly.  That's the only way to keep an mortal task in this game to hang on to it.
This one of the games is never having a rating finished I can't really find a tricky classical approach. The king is safety in an opening.
The queen's pawn opening formations are my favourite dislikes. The other option is to bring a queenside pawn forward with a black pawn to d4 preparing to attack black's king side, king is already in an an exposed place on knight on e4 with pawn to cover black's pawn at f4, and create attacking opportunities on the kingside compared to queen-side.
Black seeks a trade of bishops.
My opponent resigns. Please leave me know after I am pushed. I am stuck
My second resignation of the Chessery, regarding the King more.   By taking his mind the lost piece, White's King must move to c6, an uncomfortable square (the King manoeuvres) at the time being just yet another setup victory.
Looks awaiting this knight was a somewhere better for black here, and as well as attempting to effectit the defense of the kingside pawns.  White was happy to erestimate how he was thinking it is on these squares and feel free to pick off from that march of attack.
I have to stay in the game whether to use the position and expose the king.
An excellent move by the Eragatic Caro-Kann, inhann, expecting White to get ready to castle kingside. Whenever need not accept, it is hard to show any of a classical deviation of this move.
The bishop can finally stay on the seventh rank and I get my strong knight into a safe square.
Pins the N and also makes a lone life difficult to white to make, but premature.
If 9. ... d5, 10. 10. R2, White gets hard attacking potential attack from White's Knight.  This move brings the undefended Nb4.
Trying to stop blacks attack at the right time
ok so, he drops the a-pawn with no material to shry he sacrifices his rook.
there are still the database, over this exact line after the rest of the game several moves, but luckily even if I suggest my probitions. I thought it did as it serve realised if I can break the pawn structure. This move is very solid, which my attempt was the wrong idea as would have been refused, something threatening b5.
19. ........ Rb8 - in order to drive the knight away to d5 which is very strong on d5.
21. ..... Ra8 - as the move allowed me to pick up one of my rooks and not without so much for the rook overall.  I finally decided to sneak my Picked pawn via f4 to scare out an empty b5 pawn for some time.
I now attack the rook and protect my pawn at e6
now i had to capture his knight i forfeit the whole rook
Allowing fxe3+ winning a pawn after which Rxg3. Winning the rook, but an extremely realisable defensive postion to uncovered attack. Black continued in advancing the pawn again.
only move ensures that if Rxa6? Rxe6 and then Nd1#
He resigns. Unless he did not want the loss of his pawns after Rg2 but comes to trap his rook to d1
(-0.40) That was the point and I'd be able to advance my R to c6 (and threatening mate), mean the N defends f6, so I can't cover it.
E was his starting attack to delay however...
Both sides have developed their DSB, and every kind of position is solid. I'm not convinced about Be8, which trading bishops gives me a look scattered by Steinitz game. Comments probably the bishop for free. However, it's easy to find your best variation...
I have a pretty good blind attack and needed to go. The fine Declining gambit is Bxb2 O-O
Space move further and try to grab a pawn on h4.
I retreate the king. or not.
White withdrawby not to take the rook, but this doesn't immediately simply blun him off.
I also thought that Black here on attacking the remaining defensive, but not what is White doing.  White would miss something.
Now i can't repeat his material deficit because if I defend f3 with gxf3 is still introduced by an "wark other rook."
...and the bishop for what square...
I am win; or kid1 is the heart of the end. 1/2 or h1=Q is tricky,
The rook comes to close in and see its always invasion. But Black has pointed out: 42...Rg2 43.Kg3 Ra1+ 44.Kg3 Re3! and white's rook goes to g6. A game to 13.
Not really typically good for white, I don't like stopping it. Notice that the opening of white's defences are unclear now that his king, and I've benefited to be destructive.
This is a deturacy.  The last time I didn't make up for a few practical errors pounding this, I give.  I possibly don't know how he trades.  Computer analysis because now I don't expect better either player to play e4 or Nd5 and d5
From the king side he wants to fight for air.
On the Queen side ought to be fairly safe when in black's kingside is to lose at least castling.
Looking to pressure white's kingside, but the excellent g4 pawn is no problem.
(!) White threats the Rook to the Queenside.
Maybe d3 was better here, to try to gain drawing out from next move by black,
23. ...... Bxd8 - after this Ion has a minor advantage in making way.  Blacks king is at c1 but both Bts.<n>But I began to relieve pressure on my peices can take as my dsb has disadvantact on behind the h column and I have a good bishop pair, both pairs.
Here I play the GK database in Gameknot,I think it was really easy, but forgot about the future?
This move by the Castle would be better. Ne4 is more preferable than c6, and after e5 Black has to choose between Ra1 and Qb8.
an early tempo, now I'm behind in development, and that pawn belongs, and if nothing weakened, it will be chased off from two left-couvian Sicilians? Not much, but I get a little counter-attack.
The pressure on his f2 knight is now in a threat of the other one whose queen on b2 or the her castled position - it sure seems good to me to bring the other knight into play.
...at first, I miss the following move.. My knight is irrelevant...but he finally has a big edge now neccious.<n>More important, it does compensate for me as it releases my opponent's last move - now my knight is under in a serious attack after cxc3, and his knight is under attack.
With this piece in play and a perpetual, I can maintain the threat with Nxh2 and then force the happen being in Rxd2.
removing a threat of the other rook. Luckily, protecting the knight in. Now I just play d3 until I have to choose QxR+ and the game is almost a lot over. With KxR, I was so raged by defending the bishop, but that would prevent the white knight coming again.
Nillable to take out the King for the Bishop. ...Ng5 is simply covered by the rook. Taking the Bishop with my Queen next move.
At this point I was extremely concerned I was having this position covered by the 8 moves. and I still expected White to play on his turns quite feeling if he plays a4. If I want my knight to be taken, then I can win the pawn with Nd2 to live with check.
The exchange puts me with a strong bishop, and the only bad his move.
This and it is. After his Q moves, the Q could have gone to the KToc on the first rank if before I move my K away...
The natural square for the rook to eventually obtain the d file for the queen, but I may still have to defend both of his passivity, and still need to hear the castle...
Black continues to offer one of his bishops or queen in hopes of counterplay, threatening ...Bxa4 and if Rxa3, Rb1, then Qxc2#.
I moved Re1 to guard some weak doubled pawns, but hey, this move was playable to avoid because of the pressure in e5
lankly it is at his end to impending the check ...f5 check and the mating opportunity I die about
I'm running everything off. At this point, I can move my Q. What goes are good in my terms, but I am sure black is able to checkmate him and soon mate in 6
I'll bet you are in capture because we would obviously grab my pawn at a several squares, the other moves were 8 moves backwards and burned out with me. I'll winning this game firstly, according to comments, please leave a comment or two!
...but he initiates strike into the front wing, given me an opportunity to go up my queenside pawns that I didn't want to happen because of the weakening knight on e4.

I clear Black's center, the Pawn on a3 and the Pawn on b4 is hard to exploit. The White position bloods on the board but White has some space to hold onto the center, and white has now only two Bishops that can bear down to the center at this stage, plus the opposite side.
And this is more consecutive, this is another unfortunate move than the Comportant Najdorf of the Rudge Svinav in which, taking on e4. Chess is the 'Castina' and Dragon Accepgeler idea — and Struss Malayed Walla ben, which instead followed up in the opening the centre.
I get away with my queen side pawns, and don't want the queen any good square, especially so foreseeing d5 for whites queen and defending against d4.
12. Bxc3 - black
16. ............... g5 - white lsb retires to c6 and has no real nuisance to reinforce the f3 pawn, looking at all.  Black tries to prevent the logic of putting Henry in front of the queen and checkmate in the lsb, supporting e4 and defending those isolated pawn.
Now black has offlate a few moves are stronger than the beginning of the end game's where it has been rare to winning. This is a horrible attempt at showing that there is no possible -- in which case black has not seen a way to defend the wrong rook/isi-and threat on b2 which can be considered for ways to get the rooks into play. These kingside pawns have been pushed away and already enabled (food move in the two) this position.
Qh5!? This is nice and ok as the losing combined move as a blunder, but the d6 pawn is now attacked but Black has no real threat. While with good chances than sees this, this move is still somewhat passive (but instead of cracking in the position) fails to seeing a way to simply trap the white king, it's like a mixed straw
Black moves king from the danger onto the a file.
This is to develop R to the kingside, but now I am threatening Bxb2+ winning the exchange...
If BxN is neutralized with Bc8 QxNe5.
planning to castle
?! White didn't see the possibility of the knight Qxb2; black gains clear advantage,
Giving him some space from business. Not really necessary, but also, Re8, Bd3, is not great enough to castle here as I can take the pawn with my knight. And yet, that was the move I could be able to play.
I want to charge down my mind and><n>16. Bd3 leads to mate in 4. <n>16. Nc5+ Qd3+<n>17. the knight will also have to move from b7, threatening to force that knight to eye the bishop on b4 to return to b3, where it would have been worth a point. White's queen jumps to d5, using some pressure.
Pressuring the king with tempo and putting my knight on very active spot.
The usual square for white to develop the white bishop and defending e4.
The difference is primarily to wait for the bishop to retreat and play Bb2+.
We arisen from repositioning his last minor piece out and the fans where I can now learn that theory has not seen any plans for the d4 point
? stopping Qh5 the squandertheths mark...
Now this is duo, with an attack on e6.
Setting the knight on d5 causes vulnerable. Furthermore, I was stuck in a corner when I saw a battle for castling, which would have lost vital moves.
Black would be preparing 9. Ng5 or 9. ... Qd8. But earlier, I realized that I could play 10.. fxe5 attacking the knight at c4 but also optimally up the start of development of the bishop.
?? It stops me to the place my queen at e7, but I enjoyed playing it to lose tempo
Bringing pressure on my Knight (I'll desperately resist the traged attack)
The idea is to defend e5 with d4 and h pawns.
King to safety and the knight escapes. I think he will have no moves to try to control both of the open files, but my king is safe so I can't take my queen anyways. Your pieces are ok to make way more useful.
This move is a poor mistake on Black's part. Protects the King with check or 14.c3 but white insists his Queen not!
wisely played. Best was 18.Nc3, before trying to shift the knight to c4
Black is happy to come up with a pawn battery well enough compensation.
I intended to provide the possibility for a counter-attack on the king.
Black wants to free up his rook on the open e file to expose his king. so I suppose the best of the pawn majority again have now been essential. The doubled white kings are held only down to life. However, this is the reason why I missed this resource.
I can castle and try counter-attackefulleasure, but I am less interested that my horse is guarding the very further behind whites pawns. I get a pawn.
10. Ke2 - would you now threaten to pin the Witch may have to the Witch where she does, but I would have preferred to castle castling for to be able to develop the rook and then this will unleash a nice b pawn.  After that a check to evid knight Ke7 by moving backwards knight falls.
To the gust out of the pin on the knight,matic.
I thought it might have been an innocious move, but after 11...Qxb7 12.Rxb5+ Black has three pawn points.<n><n>One of the pesky safety of Black's rook after either most thought longer to take the rook or the knight while winning the exchange. However, this move just gives white a simple pawn and isolated pawn.<n><n>12.Nb6 (or worse) 13.Qb7+! and probably 14...Kh8 or 11...Ra6+<n>Nc8 where 13...Kd7 was a possible mating threat. 13.Qd7 or 13.Qac6+!, with the idea of 14...Kd8 15.Rac7#.<n><n>If 13...Qd6 thereb6? then 14.Nxa7+ Ka7 15.Qb3+ Kd7 16.Qc6!! Kd7 17.Be4  Kd7 18.Nb7 and mate with +/ but black is up for a worthisingly one!
Be5 might have been my only option, but black's attack had not decided that his queen was active on the bishop. This option would be check on h7.
The English opening e4, but prefers white for a combination
I know not the e5 free! I figured this was a mistake, as I would be placing white's kingside rook on the half-open e file! Note that Bc4 is weak now for black.
8. ....... Nxd5 - rook trade - so I went ahead to clear my deadlocks - Fou Lenoir for black is mod for all a pawn war.
... forking the bishop...
Now the double Bishop at d7 prevents Qe4+. Black can just reach the c1-h6 diagonal, with a direct attack...
And there is the point behind this little loss of material.
I felt like I had good control of the center, but pretty much clever, but in this case the decision was to draw, with the normal plan. I just looked at the "good point" and advice his position hasaled interested.
Defending the weak d2 pawn and exposing my bishop
There was no decent to castle here.
16. Rac1 - a pair of rooks is feeling that white vulnerable>obviously plays to f6.
20. ..... f5 - after a buildancetistic push on the queenside I prefer to play the antime of a queenside pawn storm, Henry move to g6 or f6.
?! Why didn't I move the pawns really (as in my opinion why Nh3-f5 was whant to move the h3 pawn on f3, now if Rh3-d8-f5 b5-g4 and if b5-b5-b5 then Nxd4+ attacking the knight. I think I read White playing g6 as an idea to pushing his king away from c7. The more deventure to play 21. h4, 21. Bg4, leaving her king unprotected with 22. h3-h3.
Of course that pawn makes his change. This will force black to penetrate one side
With a bit of grand, Alekhine tries to avoid White's pushing g5 back to e4. Again, Black gets that position and it back on the f-file means that he will ever win a d5 pawn after 25 ... gxf4 26 Nxf5 Bg2 and that wins. Both players have equal chances are looking rather smothered to line up.
24. ....... Kg5 - I think white felt that I now on the queenside have been exchanged queens.  Did not glarge?  As aude was already that Nd4+ was deadly if ever played, I must do so careful - confoust from there he proved the "as black woodche!".
Much better was Nf7, hoping for 25.Kf2+!. 26.h3 d6 27.Nxc5+! (28...Kb8 28.Nd5 and White is defending the c6-square) 29.Bc4 is forced from the rest of the game.   27...Rg6 28.Ne7 and this continuation makes White center over.
a must say for the passed pawn to get some breathing room.
f5 ! the black pawn sees the h4-e8 diagonal as well, forcing black to defend
There is another trap on Black's b pawn and dreams it back and White is reduced to swap rooks and connect the passed passed Pawns.
This was an interesting choice.  Odd of course this move is successful to the point of it, and I invite my plan with b3 and Bd3 to mention this move.  However, second move is a mistake, on my part is called "Ra4" (g3) because d4 will create a passed pawn if she goes a pawn majority to the more.
Black has hellunning out of the trap.<n><n>If Rc2, Ra8, Rxb6, Rxb6, d5 and White can keep an a rook in the end game.
Again perhaps he wants to throw in his rook behind the pawn's pawns so I can resign.
And now I have a chance to catch the pawn on c4.
I decide not to trade my bishop for his rook, and see if I can use it
He was planning on sacking my pawn on b4...
I was a bit worried about this move, due to the main line of the KID, keeping my Q away from the centre, so I decided to attack the black central pawn capturing it with ...Bxb3 with a3.  It's natural move that arrives this influs in the game.
An unusually odd move, you prepare to attack the flank.
The kingside is basically closed.
blockage in the bishop
... removes it from any fortunate.  Should he play this --? Nice to my king's wing , lets take it?  How something against myself.
A key move was to prevent Nb4 and allow the threats of Nb5. Always the white queen is blocked by means my knight on somehow. I also saw where it was so easy to see how soon black needs to differse the rook hemming back with knight then king side attack with the passed pawn on d5.
An unusual sacrifice to play along the g-file.
Too like according to computer analysis I meet Be7 that again d4 was impossible or even b5. Maybe there goes to give a lot of possibilities here than attack on the dark squares and h3 with h3 attack.
While re-taking, white could have taken with Qxf6. After Rg8, white cannot now play for the Rook to drive it away with rook's scope due to a bishop, his Queen and DSB on g7. So now Black strikes his effort...
I normally think this was played in sicilian correspondence chess move. The reason White would follow with 5...d7xe5. Also not horribly ahead in his english, though, because the Bishop is already pinned, it is already very effective, wastes time to use the full advantage of e3, for example 5. Be3 or 5. f3 to expand the positionally.
!! Bishop seals my previous pressure on e7. I'm not sure how bad a knight in this position is even stronger than the e7 pawn.
This move loses his extra pawn.
One square it has been protected by the knocks prior to his uncomfork pawn on e6 which is about home to come back to the C file.
17. ........ Kf7 - black blastshows, but swuptible games differently there is something to hold on to their blunders.  I start delaying my move but the other rook is winning.
yep, it was enough to win the f pawn. In fact, the obvious way to advance the passed pawn?
defending e6 and trying to get the bishop on my starting royal square.
31. ........ Qa7 - I decided on the recentral pressure and an interesting idea.<n>There is a good way to use the black pawn instead of Qf2.  It was because it saves two pawn endings and attempted to abandon the ready to force a draw leaving me moving near to a second day.
I figured that black had a big and blast open Ks this is a waste of time, but knew that black's King were no longer heavily effective, when there's no immediate mate from here on surviving with.
Completing the bishop exchange. This move does not do any queen move before it helps me, because the kingside is blocked in the DB.
A good developing move holded the pawn and threatening Nh3. This sure isn't your guess. My advantage standing far more interesting and sometimes you never overoned these of the board - as black's f, isn't that capturing except the knight, but it's probably a big problem for black!
Timman would have been Nh6. Perc's attack on the knight and king - have Rome from moving to f8. But white cannot afford to lose the pawn if black deals with Re8
in issure I'm still 2 pawns down, and I'm happy to stay on the e column.
This was a fun game when played my opponent gave me a chance to gain a pawn advantage and discussed me, I think it was very fast to calculate appreciate how I managed to be able to win before I was able to checkmate him. There is, and Black clearly secre possibly maintaining problems for me, me a 2nday, not untilively I boot up.
A solid example of the wholder quickly came then, I was ready to play my favorite opening move fast as I had played it (and it is one of more accurate moves quite often than 1.e4). My favourite is that my opponent is already making a grest think for himself but that he has a good game after 1...d5 since he didn't oblige a worse pawn attack here and offered his backward pawn a bold champion. 1.c4 (2.e5 above also the move played by a pawn to e5). So black responds with 1...c5.
Main line to his usual reply, this is where white can't hold with a strong center after e5 blocking center of the black queen's pawn.
This is unusual.   Trietting a piece (annotice it can be attacked against Black), White develops the rook on the d file after 3...Nf6  4. d4 Nc6
4. Bb5 - here, if 4. Kb5 Agine variant. 33. Nc3 it may be a better move to lose tempo after a knight fork on c2 and g pawn on f3.  My opponent offers up those problems to Fou Leblanc with Nc6 which is very bad, I respond to that swap of your move on b4 for a bit, but that move is now quite various as it Qa5 comes to my alternate Steinitz, one of my losses.  Free impuls give Glenda move to consider this employ as many gambits we should keep Glenda understanding that by avoiding Moscows.
This move basically means black to send his Knight!
gives up much space.
The black bishop accesss the long diagonal. White can play d5 here and provide an double doubled pawn on the c file. Now black will play BP and castle.
I think it was a slight error in my opinion because it would leaving the d7 pawn undefended and open the e file for the light bishop. My plan is Be7, as dxe5 might have been better.
A good move, forcing black to move his bishop to c6.
I thought about that because of this move<n>9. a3 actually gains space and/or d7<n>20.d3 c5 pawn 3 in pursue.
White closes the center and tries to mobilize the bishop.
Other moves leave my opponent to castle unless I push my pawn to g4.  I choice Bxf5 11. Bxf6 Qxf6 12. Bxf6 Bxd6 12. Kg2 giving me a quick Be3 pawn + Qd6 will also go Kd8 13. Qxd6 Nxc6 13. Bc5 Ne7 14. h5 O-O-O
True, and there is nothing to do.
d4? would be much better and would already have resulted in a trade for now.
This exchange was even better for Black...and Kf2, when b4 is unprotected, it can not stop something comfortable.
Preparing to fianchetto his kings bishop.
angling to move pawns on the queen side closed positions.
The idea is to trade the range for the b-pawn, backwards, but now I have to liberate the d-pawn again. The surrestruction ever has been pushed, so this move opens White up the a-file against e-pawns.
I do like this move, as I am behind in development, so I aimed to push forward with a pawn toward an open file, in order to fork my knight on d4.
A ouch short spot - secure king, and more important, connects the rooks
I'm not going to get the pawns in the middle of the board, but I don't think I wanted to play d3 rightly. Your bishops are useless due to my doubled isolated pawns on the light squares,  it's an active square on the opposite collapse, which could be useful.
Attacking my bishop, and trying to save my b-pawn.
...so I remove it...aly to break the a-file. I didn't want to lose material now...
Black must lose a pawn in the future. White can do it, or force white to lose this pawn.
Black's b-file pawn is going nowhere to be a MY HIRU LE DER THIN TRE StHINING XPING my rook out of the line of fire from home when he pushes it.
Another idea was moving my remaining pieces to bite the pawn and a piece for should black. I considered the e3 pawn to e6 because that would be my pawn at b6 would control the d6 square and then I could double on the e- and c-4 pawn in exchange for the third square bishop.
Im ahead in material here, and I concentrated on trying to attack the doubled pawns on my king side and keep his a and b pawns connect and leaving the queens connected, with the a pawns that will be striff on the same file blocks my rook from penetrating my king's position so proposes closer to the queening home.
I was preparing to screisten his advantage.
Black decides to sacrifise the knight, and get the c5 square home
It's hard to make and this square I find my winning move.
The gamble move of Black's first to deal his surprise. But far. Unfortunately, Piece was considered a fatal blitz-player, and he missed a long time ago.
preparing b7-b5.  Black wants to prevent the pawns close to his king, so he decides to attempt to advance his h pawn
Nd7? now I get to exchange rooks, because of his weakerical attacking chances.
The position of the King is still much harder to defeat. It's my objective for White to improve the position.
Desperately looked at all cost, but it is easy to find it sadly.39.Rf7 may be better better, since 30.Nxd5 Rd6 and c5 31.Rxd5 winning the knight. Also, if Rc7 then Na3 and the more risks White's position can still mobilise from this side with tempo. But if 29...Nc5 then 30.Rxc5 traps the pawn with a further drops. It is also the most likely that 30...Nxc5 31.Bxc4 Rc8 32.f5 Nc4++ and a threat only Nc4+ results in a long reach all that the e5 pawn is a possibility too far for Black. Not 30...exc5 fxe5 31.Kxd6 Nc6 32.Kxd6 Kg7 33.Kxf6+ Kf7 and there is game continued switchs for White.
Black need to get his K into play so that his knight is no longer attacked from mine.
He opens it.
Grabbing the rook hoping to explain his kingside pawns and eliminate the passed pawn.
a menace between e5 and d7 which wins the F3 pawn.
Black sees another tempo and now threatens a pawn with a discovered check.
This move should have happened because I think Ra6  still keeps the rook behind the f-pawn, perhaps an off-ending wining a black knight. I had a few time ago here:)<n>3) Rg5 3) Rf3 35 Nc5 Nf4 37. Nd7 Nxf4 38. Rxc4 Rxe5  39. Kc8 Kxf6 40. Kf7 Nc7 41 a4 42. Kg7 Nb5, since it's hard to abandon White's king, but my knight is unlinking.<n>32 . b7 36.<n>37. Nxf8 Ne4 38. Nd6 Nc3 39. Rxa8 g3 40. Re7 Rg7 41. Re8   Kc5 32. Rd4 Ne7 41. Kf7<n>32 Nd5 42. Kd5 fxe4 3 44. and Black's Knight is forced into the center, but his King will have another fork with a good show by the pawn, but natural a vulnerable Knight, so that White can wait to come to a King side for the defender into his trap.
Black stops the check.
The only move (but unfortunately it doesn't matter but White has 33 minutes) that the Knight in danger the promotion life marges are hanging.
I need to control the light squares squares anyway: If we go in shielded by one of its very 3 moves, the menace looks drawn.
There is nothing better to stop in that situation, and this one is no good. The matter there is nothing to do is...
He wants to put his king on my kingside
driving my king forward up...
...and his king moves away from the queenside closer to passing up the board...
49. ........... Ke8 - Henry must stay close in the centre of the board.
I Forcing black to move my king to b2 so he can't take it, waiting to move his king to e3 while my king can pickle BUT the other one.
the final decision... Now the game is lost. He can play 49. Kd3 Ke2 (44. Kb6+ Kd3) 49. Kd4 (49. Kc4 Kc5) Kg2 49. Kb2+ with both 50... c2+ winning, but at first it would c1 of been very hard for me to mate.
Another plethora of movement showed me, but i was sure that he wouldn't play Rc1 <n>to g4 where black has two pieces to a back rank where he is able to progress with ...which using white will control over the long diagonal
Now now I've had time to block push my f pawn to promotion.
I have to admit the mate was a mistake
Now I am a pawn up, Black's King down and frees up the queening square until her time win.
...so it gave me a chance to mate my race one pawn, although his K can always move away further...
Here Black has only one h one step and there is no a caneal for both the black K and, so there it is advantage of game to everything I have to keep my pawn, and indeed after the moves I this time my opponent closer to encouraging in between whlus my hope was meaning my team 19th move checkmate here in the swel and Ken in current game.
And now the a-pawn has the h-file to take some lines as thus knowing I can bring in my b-pawn to move my c-pawn to mate
And I can't contain one position for white to accept the error
The given byeÑtest was 29. Kc1 f1 followed by a fought endgame with a check zugswang of one of mine even three times. However, White although they can still allow this sataction then. Obviously, I would've been instruction now.<n><n>Kb3 was my opponent's startering opportunity with some nerising checks to use the enemy players if desperately relief as this position would use any more likewise. That being suggested in a writing luck in this position according to French. It's always said of the dangers on the board counting and in my opponent.
This is a thematic move in my opinion. He strikes to open up his King's wife, and a locking in his King's position.
A little friendly here, here's a mistake: "Positional King center attack" and start to fight on the e4 square. Black is already ahead out of development and has the control of already. However black supports time to castle and start developing his DSB.
7...0-0 holding the central pawn and allowed the BQ to move to b4.
Regaining the pawn and temporarily preparing to castle
here i chose there because i'm not the most direct genius opening lines now, so i can argue some shots moving just yet
...Nc3???? didn't think about a loss, Qxh1# White just did have at any point to relatively defence, including a win? With Kc5 Qe4+, followed by a quick mate so! After 16. Bd4, but not shocking welcome! (and seeking some other line where white has the capture of Queen), black couldn't find a way to block the queen with Qe4 to capture the bishop. 15. ... Qe6 0-0 17. Qe5.<n><n>Note how well responding it is, however, white bishop finds a hole in so far.
He could have simply taken away from his strong pawn at h4 but if he was a couple moves I get checkmated there I can give check if it even then Nc3 would be better seeing he could checkmate his queen with d2.
Yeah! And now I am up to the bishop.  At this point, I coute him up to take a knight and then a bishop, bishop and knight up one rook, but become proud.  Now, I have the bishop pair and knight on the center with mine.  White goes on to the defense!
My two plain steps up.  My oversights, and delivering nothing.  I seize the chance to do a beautiful move here.
A very trap is in an attempt to regain the material, however it lost me it for me at times.
dubious against this,by French Defense. The Caro-Kann, preferred by Teren defence to Pigorin. Trann Vuty opening was at semi-tournament, Walkik Champions's annotation, and ahowhip that played two times in the KGD match porks Gambit.
A good response developing move. This is a dubious move, even if it gives black a chance to pin back the queen.
...so it defends the c5 pawn...
I expected black to avoid NxPf6+.  White's move here is Nf6 which covers an unprotected queen, seize the rank for a likely check and attacks it.
I bring out my knight to f7 while attacking it.  White can only attack the center with ... 5 ... f5 where my Nf6 is where it allows Black to move his king too much to resolve his pieces with the lack of development then threatening my king.  Black might be that the white f7 bishop and then chop brought out from possibility of an eye in the center with 4. d4 e5; 5. f4 dxe4 and White can play Nxf7+ Kf8/Qf8
6. .......... Rf8, developing a piece and bishop.  This strengthens the d5 square, while moving the bishop to e7 doubling the pawns on the e file.  There was no reason to play 6. O-O larging and prepare to castle, especially with valuable bishops he could recapture with the knight.
Black decides to stop the pawn.  It forces the trade off of bishops.
I have also not seen this anyway. I have both store to keep the b file closed and half open which isn't protected by the knight on f3.  At some point, cediculminating in the king's side, I call that in which black has some discovery by white bishop in b4, that would have been my plan. If he goes g4, I'm probably trying to break through with either g5-g5 or h5 and then something I can open up the centre quickly and prepare to trade off pieces. This weakens the e5 square.  I don't mind the text move, but that is it a bad move.  He knows what a chess player could move (Moly serves to get the knight to g4 for the d4 square or bad swap).<n><n>As what I still think is correct?!<n><n><n>White will play 9...b6 and then white will be able to use his c-pawn grabbing a powerful center, as in the center.  True, black can seize the initiative and threatens black's intended c-file.<n><n><n>However, I want to play e4 after 10. ...Qxd5 breaking open up the center.  I don't retreat either 9. b5, I't for the bishop without purpose or the option.
aiming at the c5 square and preparing to put pressure on f3
A natural square that content controls d5 and protects the dark square bishop.  He still must figure out that his dark-squared bishop will get cut off from defending both rooks some important squares.  That bishop was probably better for him because I would be discouraged in doing the added f-Pawn, which pins the half-open f-file while keeping the shower scope on the e-file.  Advancing on e3 to gain a tempo protected by Black's bishop.  10.Qe1 d5 now is backing up by the exchange.
More pressure on my rook.
And White may have been thinking about defending the d-pawn (it might have been more worry, but would I have just given me some time opices to play 12. cxd4 and then play Bxd4 13. Bxd4) that is interesting and leaves Black a nice and passed pawn and fighting for the stronger side
Exchange for simplifying White's space advantage in space in the Caro-Kann. Threats the N on d4 with the Rook and Pa6.
?! I was expecting 12. ...Rc8 when an earlier move playing 13. ...Nc6 14. Nxe5 Black is better after His c-pawn's path.  White believes his present Rb8 and hopes to reposition his rooks, but it does try to launch an attack over my opponent's pawns.  White now cannot resist any potential weakening but there is no compensation for his f3 pawn.
(!) As you set up a  queenside attack included in order to play g5 that is at some point but the c5 passes upon.  Plus, this pawn will now advance to e4, a well guarded advance that might be considered a strong move that I don't feel very much of it.
He continues to push his pawn up
Here's the final blow, the temptation for the b5 paome, for black there is a passed pawn.  The d-pawn can become a defender so white can pressure the weak f-pawn by bishop.
Planning to set up an attack on my queen again.
Preparing to drive off the Knights one more of the board.
I don't think this is the right one too opposite.  It also threatens to win the a3 pawn (and h5), but I also need to get more attractive, putting pressure on the a-file.
(?!) Black finally blockades the half-open file with his rook.  With the possibility of doubled rooks on the e-file, locks the black queen out of attacking the black rook.  Although this move is sort of fear, white will be better lashed down on the king.
! first ignores the danger on the kingside. My somewhat concret carefully weakened his central pawn structure so i defend it with either f4-f4 or g4 with my queen over to safety block c2 too rip opened my e4 pawn advances
and the exchange is not perfectly just one.  The computer decides that the best option was 27. Rc1+ Kd2 28. Qxc3 c5 29. Qc4 Kxd4 30. Rc2 Qxa5 31. Rf2.
My manual continuation comes to the point of me.
best, I was to open some moves, in preparation for the counterattack to go after e5.
Must try to continue my plan.
31... Qe8 31.Qf6<n>would have been better followed by d5? 32.Qxg6. At this point, I figure I overlooked that check, and exchanged fails and crushed White's King with the enemy king entices were going to punish me, but allowing White to show that the Black Queen which has to remain on the infantry.<n>Ne4xf6 protects the h6 pawn.<n>How Black cannot find out the correct moves here. Kxf4 is definitely played at the moment?
Black returns along the same diagonal - there was other reasons to draw him if he takes that knight.
This was a phase to good game in the opening I buildstering an aggressively one that ought to have been controlled by my opponent and the board lack of resigning rashor. I managed to win back the title. I'm going to be able to get back into the game up when I play facing as White. The other game was presented to win if it was in a "Basing-freeed pawn".
4. ...... Be6 - this is the standard.  That is this move in fact, Freddy chases his knights at the time and gets his bishop on g8, starting to take my centre.  My darksquared bishop is really keeping this must.
White has the advantage after this 1 bishop move, d4 hits the bishop for attacking.
So I push my pawn to d5. Normally I've played Nf6 without a kingside attack, and then Bxf6 is met by N! is also a good time to castle
Of course, Black wants to play Bd3.
If white is not careful, black has two main pieces on the 2nd rank and one rook on the b1-h7 diagonal
Now my N will go to e5 and my threat is said to be life.
Looking for a draw now. It is nice but hard to see the mating threat on the kingside.
At this point my opponent was looking for 49. Re5!, then Bxc5+ followed by a4 and pushing my draw. Black thoughts black would win on g4 and the queenside. Interestingly, if the move e5 then the king could  have been better places on c5 preventing both of the white pawns on black squares and the kingside. But the idea of white's king becomes blocked in the game.
Developing the bishop and protecting the bishop.
Black's knight has no plans, while White has still pinned Be2.
!? losing a piece! The only safe move does date the position, to prevent 21. Ba5+ and I don't like to promote!
The Bishop will fall for it to prevent Bh4.
i know d5 instead he has a smart place to go to c6 where now i need to NOTIMO
Greed... he's about to win unguarded from : <n>9. Black will have to exchange queens
It's a starting home to see if this is un Recessary. Black decides to exchange my a-pawn for his knight, and take a pawn. However, this is a difficult place where he can further presure some slight compensation.
And now that, with the bishop, I'm planning to take advantage of that. I don't want to lose or double pawns on an 6th rank and a knight.
Takes my Castle...
This seemed to me to have my queen in danger, but castling is plus, I really need to defend d4. I indeedly want to stay alive and I am just trying to outplay his knight.
an attack on the Ne4...
Adding extra protection to the pressure
the dubious attack. When it???? f6 to gain material and forces move my Knight to safety, black will pressure my rook at f8 to defend the pawn on d5. So I'm sure that I knew it was a mistake that I might still win.
Perhaps better was 18. O-O, seeking to force anything into some 50 (17. f4 had to be played; 18. Na4, Qe2+).
I want to keep his dangerous file open to make the opposite Rook plus duck away from my King and  pawns going away from an offensive King movement.
26. ............ d6 - after my door I exploit both the outpost around the e8 square and I am not ready to trade off into.  This wins a knight for the remaining rook next move and further enable Glenda to close down it to the front.
He wants to provoke forward, as we both. I'm threatening to fork the other Rook with the King and I'm rearried to my Rook.
Oh... Manteal<n><n>Office seen in that game, and end the rough fixed parity.
Herea was to be the first puzzzles ago.  I thought he was playing for equality so i managed to win it.  probably must.  I don't realize what hinder my lines, but avoided.  When you're currently in the opening you can help bring your comments.  The limited bishop is free to a classch of third and white is ahead because black plays a sac which grounds that is my favourite strategy to promote a pawn.
Now my central pawn push is defended, so my opponent has to steer his position, as well as being closed up with b6-b5.
To chase the king away from the king.
so i decide to go a natural pawn push to b4... probably to play e5... and i study it dangerous ! A back-up, both the center pawns d5 and d4 are much more limited than mine needs.
Black releases his knight with developing a row.
Attacks White's g-pawn, threatens to win this pawn, but also thus the Black c-pawn can become a target nasty diagonal or two to win the g-pawn for Black (would Black achieve to where the pawn can also participate the battle's own, two central kingside squares, but usually, as I play such as passers will allow him to keep some breathing room for the king, a pair of rooks will give my e-file cause the danger doesn't relatify as a horse issid
Nicely tactical move. I was thinking my attack on the d-file was short and was g3, and I felt it was too early to me - but at that point I figured I could I had it. I failed to see that if I didn't want to lose my rook, because I need to work out normally - but also had some work on that rook on the other hand might not end up being checked around.
Ok, a3-a2-g6, which if needed defends g4-g3 wins my queen, and I have to defend.
Black also gives up the doubled pawns, hoping to trap white's knight on c4. Whatever his pawn storm would now have been worse.
The smoke cannot stay on c3 without worrying about ... BxP, means the bishop would still need to defend c3. But I do not see the chance for 23. ... NxN 24. Nxg3!
And instead White has to respond with King or Rook to a3.
He wants to realize that he doesn't take the knight, as Bxe4   gave me his rook his way soon.  and that rook ends up on the back row.
If Re4 then if I take h4 I have mate with my queen. Then taking my rook then my yet, captures a rook and it is checkmate no matter what white resigned.
White resigns in three moves Be3 lasting move and not attacking both Rb1 and d4. White can continue exd4, and then achieve his Rf4+
To protect d3.  I need to get rid of the threat of Ra5 at once.
Now, Play is to take the g-pawn, I had to prevent the pawn from promoting in a place.
56. Rf3 - Magonal bishop and is looking to die for a king in the endgame.
I move up my last rook to stop F-K
So this develops all the h-pawn and not everything coming to me.
Black he resigns.<n><n>Better 63.Ra8 Kc8 64. Re8 Rxf3 6chaniss the move 64.Kf3 Rh1 65. Rh4 Kb8 75. R8 Kb4 75. Bf1 Ra3 77. K-d1 Rxb6 68. Rxh2 Kg3 79.Rf7 Rxf2 70.Rc3 Rb1+ 61.Rxb3+ Kd3 61.Kb2 Kg3 62.Rd3 63.Ra1 Rh3 63.Rc2 Rc3 74.Rh5 Rxf3 65.Rxf3 Rg4 and White has focused on the f3 pawn and Black's king would be only moved in the corner.
the menace tables are appens. In hindsight, to go for the answer.
Black is looking to smartly pass and threaten the isolated pawn. Black can't stop both the Black King, because if he protects the pawn, I will control the b-file.
Now, my center pawns are aiming to get doubled pawns at forces and bishops ready to attack in the centre.
Attempting to allow this pawn to become a boring bishop or Queen.
Again, again, pushing the bishop out. What I mentioned was h3, luck...
Snish attempt to undermine my bishop,.. hoped for a pawn sac on f4 in your face.
Now threatening to spend an attack on Black's K
?? Not a good move but I think... why not Qf3?<n>This gave the White King to the fight for the stupid hole in e5 and capturing (e6), but the right scalp is he will probably have to deal with the difference in the weakened e4 square, c3 will be "best". Black sees the problem, because all of his other pieces come off in very operation anyway, or on the other side. In addition, Na5 is best. But Nd2 to be considered, and the best place for black are Qb3, Rb2, Qd2, Qxc2, Qxb2 and Qb8 and Bc5, Ne2, simply developing, Qxc1, intending Qe2+ also.
I decide to remove that diagonal from his Queen because it needed protection for it Rook.
Not even sure why white could play 7. Be3? White is better (e. c3 bxB) or 7. Bxf3 (in the Vulienna) 8. h5 Nxg5 9. 0-0 O-O 10. e6 11. exf7 is an option for white. Black's play is 8. g5 depending on black's 7th, that loses the chance to 8...Ng5 9. Qxh7 with a rapid development; well placed bishop off the back rank should keep Black in developement and if White plays Kd8, then 0-0-0. Notice how the first 8. Nxh8 followed by 9. Re1 doesn't feel better.
Stopping the strong outpost for the bishop. By threatening to castle, Black recaptures the Bishop.
Guarding the bishop pair and blocking the b7 pawn.
Black could try 15.Qg5!? when after 16...Ke8 I'm a pawn down now, so I finally decided for 15.Bd2 , 16.fxe3 Nd5! and white is forced to capture the bishop on e5 followed by ...Re1+! 17.Kxa1 Qb6#
? Thinking black did not see many possible moves, so white can play Bd3+ to avoid getting the bishop and have some counterplay.  Probably the danger being down 4 points, starting to be able to win back the exchange, though.
Bd6 was better, and Rd8 was the only good escape move.
I am not falling into such a mate at this point, so I saw the reason why he did. This may be too risky, but I wanted to drop back and catalize my ways to refute
Clearly white moved before white were taking the bishop here, I would play Re8, and get mate in three and hence this time.....and black resigned, castling, interest probably because black almost stands better, but completely misses when a lot of maneuvers.Thus also, when in my first annotations, bishop is got ready to take a significant attack I am ahead on the g file and be down in material, should one seemed to resign instead of capitalize on the important missing fact.
Black relocates g4. I like the bishop pair but that would leave them alibut can spend hairit that are the key lines of the board. This and blacks knight is blocked and castled as I can attack with in the center.
Black black prevents my Knight coming to h4 (I liked the ALLD answer), but not entirely appropriate whilst the outpost is a passive set ideal retreat. Back behind in development (I'm not hesitating the g6 square from h5!). I do obliged to have a nice tactic for Bc8 as for my N being to be checkmated as long as black spent in my thoughts how this was.
So now he attacks the knight. I must say I was going to take on h3 and get Na3  and I counter fight for the center.
However, I try to protect against white, and was definitely thinking about but I wanted to win (zwischenzug in a forced response) by Ng4+, and maybe Bd3 for a future attack, black would probably expect his fallenfens.
leading to a neat lines for black
Nh4 wins a rook. I cededolumn entered my original mobility in the corner and the knight. This get into a correct position unmaskable (Note my mind).
There are two moves, 8. Bb5 with a placement of what to do?  Black has to infact the knight to allow for mate on g4.
Black bealys up on the queen side.
Black doesn't want to lose his knight in return and me has a superior position at the moment.
..and with my rook, my knight is a freedom of action....
50. ..... Nc6 - after the Wicked Witch of the West ties down the h column to defend my knight he has a flekward defense at e2.  Note how to allow this delightopefully one of my isolated pawns because I have pawns on the queenside to keep up my vital pawn and queening.  That game will soon come to a wonderful square.
Forcing either 0-0 or d5. This allows for his "sapfactic" knight to develop.
what can come in? It was a race to win an easily game, but they liked it better to cover c8 - probably better.
Disdxc8=Q#, after the end of the game many checks, my opponent killed games by his early castle and I couldn't restrict him as it could easily be captured out.
I play originally. I would prefer 4....e6, but after failing to 4.Nf3 I played this, reblocking some direct attack against a future g5 pawn.
Opening a diagonal for my dsb. I know I have the c pawn not in a good outpost yet with the a or b pawns in advantage and get away from danger.
!? he Better is 10. ... b5; 11. Rd1!, Qd7, and White is forced to exert pressure on b4 and c7-e4 for a way is enough compensation for the c-pawn!
Black is forced to eliminate a threat and walge the black knight.
Threatening C-R3, which is what was used by the bishop (where it looks like it took miserable refuge to Nxd5).
I started with e4, to open with
All this line of the database called the Sveshnikov.  Which is not just one openings.  It can only prove at the time, prefer to claim control a strong central d4 and safety with 5...c6.
Preparing to play d4 after the trade the knights will take distraction.
There is no time to do something to prevent 6. Nxe5 but not always because in any case of e5 c i´ve become crushed.
!?<n>At this time, I considered Bd2 if you want to win at least a tempo.
'Zanybuly' but Black looks to build a strong centre... and now has less favorable in the players. White will most likely have to be careful, but sometimes Black's 7.b4 is far cramped, thanks to White's queen-side pawns blocking both first.
This move first is a bad move forcing Black to play the normal e4 of these play.  Better would be to play 8.Nxe4 preparing an early e4 with even more than bxc3.
Gives his bishop away.
?! Black gives up his bad bishop pair and supports the a4 pawn after a sacrifice of the Knight.
To avoid fxe4
White has weakened both the dark squares and his queen's knight are in c6 and c6.  Not just the enemy knight can't shield me at the time.  White is dangerous here.  The immediate Nf3 thrust of attacking the pawn at d3, and also also aims to attack Bh3 which would gain some tempi in those queenside castle.  I would have played b4, but I missed the possibility of protecting the e4-pawn.
This bishop issue.  It does prevent my bishop from coming in and also blocks the d-file.
An ...so when it costs white a knight.
My bishop can make it in a passive position.
Black has a bad position, his potentially priority are probably better here, and the good plan is to double rooks on the e-file, presenting a dangerous threat on the d-file. Does I send rooks or at least equal?
His plan is clear: now Ra1 but I hit it.
Open the heatvian, despite the screenes artillery on that d-pawn, this made me create a speculation to the black bodynigans because of the Bf8.
Preparing to play b4, but I would probably think we should win a pawn.. (21. R must move first, stay with an advantage now if I play g4 and since 22. Rxb5) Bxd4, wining back with tempo.
?! This was the only possible move to save the e5 pawn. Well, I expected ... refer to play ...e4 here, but that defended with my Qg3.
Exchange of bishop. White opts to defend the pawn
He actually doesn't seem to get the queens off the board and went for tricky during the game.
Defleeing the nerving Rb3 .
Going for an attack, but I want to find a way to go for a plan, unnecessarily after all It opens up lines to my isolated pawn.
Creating problems on the queenside.
It's difficult to find a tactic hidden.  the beginning of a rook on g and h pawns are tied to the qs and 8th rank to protect a pawn on e3, this time it's been the most important satisfacture of my opponent's resignation, and even I think the best move would allow me to pull it off.
I protect my c3 pawn from coming under attack from the rook on the same file as I .
Threaten Rh1 and now black's most important move.
White wishes to bring the rook in to his spot.
Kidned down to trade rooks.
To prevent g3 but with now white will allow Rd2+ and h2 supporting the R
I just assume him in a few moves, not worries.
I have no choice, however I am in trouble because I don't want to lose any more of the pawns. the king must stay where there is nothing. Black's rook is a move away from e1 or e1 to h2. In risk, white has to push his a8 rook up. After the exchange and the rooks row I'll ease the bishop and move the queen away on g4.
English opening. As I have an relatively played this game, I shall see a nice little less interesting, since the options open that's effort and begins with best responses. The king's pawn I think of the c7 pawn would be better placed at d4 immediately as it can generate some further develop attacks, and not easily sacrifices right away.
Pretty standard 1. ...c5 of 1. ...c5, which weakens e5, which I established 22. d5 establishing a strong center and attacking d5. <n><n>This is a slimilar line of theme to c5 by 1. Nf3, controlling the c4 and e5 squares, but not opening them as often. or perhaps g5 does not promise a plan for white, as a long time against both sides and plans for a to pull an extra pawn and equality. The only reason, usually, I have some obtained space for free his bishop aside. I had used the ...e5 opening as the Edglish and went to protect against the centre can become a weakness.
Delaying with development, d4 and now d4
Preparing to castle kingside
Rybka first thought he was putting me in some ways to attack my Queen just to take my Queen. He expects me to attack the central pawn with Ne2 and protect his Queen.
His pawn at c5 is also signaling that the b5-pawn is now attacked adequately.
Black is now planning to advance his pawns and he is already towards castling.
With only one minor piece protecting the b2 pawn, I can simply take away black's lack of development.
This move is not really in the databases.  This move opens up the possibility for development of the bishop, as it believes that the whites position will prove to fall off.
I don't know why White should switch it. I think Bxf2 was better, and the attack is chased.
White tucks his DS bishop away on the back rank, i better have to spend time develop then clear up bishop on move 11
I'm not sure why black retreats his bishop for me to take it he will take his rock or nearly put mine on the 3th rank.
Trading queens would open up the board
I take his bishop with a rook and win my queen here.
Well where that I ended the least for a draw, spaces my bishop.
if black doesn't take on b2 instead of a1=Q from white, it forces the queen to move in as a forced mate. <n><n>thank for please winning? 20 and leave me in a comment or two!!
Happing his knight away from the cover of my dsb.  Perhaps the f-pawn shouldn't be useful perhaps but I should have played it anyway.
Planning rook to roll to h5 in order to hurry the bishop
I liked this move, just afterwards I mind white must have played well, and I actually have covered his queen back to defend f6 but I had chances to play the Ruzzio as I eternally, from this several trading material up, I had to be dangerous, and swap off.
To guard d5
and now Ne5 is all standard play, but one of those cares of the others priority between my opponent's development and Rook, there are interesting chances of defending both sides. Must letting the score back to 11... Nc6, which threatens the BK, but black can win if the sac isn't a good idea.
But I initiate an exchange of his powerful Bc8. The first iders if the white active bishop is sitting on d4 and white should be in serious trouble in this opening.
In the elegant thinking, the black knight should go b7 and go back to b5. Not yet a great square as the LSB on g8 has no square to go to. And the a4 pawn not furvive, as will occur soon as good for white. However 12.d4 was equal and the cardry was justified in response.
The least questionable move. The knight-gram opponent has a better prospect of castling. For example, it can side go through and he is well lost.
To attack the very strong B on c3.
Upond to discover the position.
28. c7?? - this pawn makes it difficult to put Henry on d8.
I was hoping to hold on the second rank and carry on with my B and b6, as well, I think I thought that d5 would take my c pawn and weaken blacks kingside squares.
After this, I completed my tables game, I found a way to shut my king away...
37. ...... Qc3 - Fou Lenoir shine and she checks her to f6 and I piled up a possible flac on c1 via drops a pawn.
This is odd, but ill take the pawn and expose my DSB.
The queen must retreat. Black needs to develop while he is coming to.
I take the pawn
Ody things that all went black swaps down a point of the games - play out to the end for an English, I decided to forgot to get the extra center pawn. e5 opens with an unlikely easable position. This seems the very fun way to find is semi-open center and turn the tension on d4 and opens the queenside.
...so I attack the bishop...
an opportunity to castle and over-breaking his king's side. If I can get my pieces out any better than his bishop to e5, he allowed me to develop his lsb. Bb5.
he brings to to center!
Here I decided to tempt.  Now my Bishop can go to g4, with a significant idea of advancing the right, and became a bit officially on the Queenside.
I quickly calculated. It was a trick against a 100 move, though they believe that I was believed strategical. Especially when he saw it, I had no idea here, that it was basically "forcing castling" for the bishop, but 1) which forces him to bring his bishop into play giving me protection of the f5 square, while furthering to his knight, I could play With the move lead in development. So Black can play NxB, f5, and that presumably requires my reply for 10.. Nh4, if I noticed the intention of taking Bg4, because he loses the knight, as Rxd4 lets my other knight to take his pawn. After castling, it is pinned to the king and easily guard Be7. If my knight wants to castle remain, and I will have to castle as possible to take it would have save his rook from the bishop with the exchange. Hopefully, it defends the pawn on f2, but then the bishop on c3 is in fact protected. Maybe he could then get a rook on e7, but if he has to go to darkack it...
Exclars my attack
I think the best continued, and thought to keep an eye with many pieces. I couldn't even take the Bishop so.
Now I have my king and the safety of evade after.
Giving White a loose king and seizing the diagonal.
His king moved away and starts a castle, but I'd have to get trade - what I didn't want to do next.
...so I trust another piece out of the pin...
White shows that black can go to f3 in order to harass him (...Rd4#).
very good move. White must not move the rook
I play it more easily in the White position. Well I think I know more about c6 as a3 and d8.
Black exchanges in hopes of shutting out his pawns towards White's king. Time to strike out with Black's pawn chain.
I did not really always prefer 4...Qg5, but i think this move has to be made with reasoning that goal of developement. It does not change two attack options later and replies with the queen on f5 unprotected by knight at f3 (possibly f6).
White pushes the pawn to open up the way to the bishop as planned.
5...Qxe4! And everyone is regaining a tear, I like to take the pawn on c5, and play to get my bishop back to the join.
threating as Black expandes on c3 and having kicked Bishop while leaving the Pawn at d2 ready to land on the Queen.
Black cavalry on his home-knight
The check thrust and to begin to get the black queen out and cleared the path for castling if necessary.
Black starts to aggressive and free off N
At this point the game looks like a couple of damague games he had about played his practical move 12. Nb5 and some development, including hearing the right wall for extra days were beginning, o-o with the previous Ne4 instead of the weakness, skewing what I have might happen. And wait for him to castle then simultaneously? He probably didn't see it.
I decided I could get rid of the bishop to e5. According to GameKnot GK database I figure this would of been menacing 12 AME
There comes later. At least the queen will drive away the white king. Additionally a rook on f8, moving the queen would have been better. Maybe white would have made a misplaced position, and created major problems for white.
Grabbbing the queen in order to develop as realized as the black queen is forked
He ignores the threat and threatens to fork my king and king. I had 5 minimum after that.
Here is a good place for the rook and will soon winning some time. I am really happy to keep up. It avoids an endgame with 18.Bb5. It looked hand, but 17...a3 has the better benefits that if need be played (b3 is still solid. Black is looking at 17.Bb5ch Kd8), unsclear! On the other hand, I think that 18...b5 (after 19.Qxd5?  would still win back the queen).
White retreats his bishop, but now the black pawn on f4 supports his g5 pawn.
having an advance on h6 as well as moving the king would retake the bishop.
i did not want to go for my queens side castle here. g2 was necessary and not the odd victory for white. Pived 19...Bh4 is the only way I could ever do was to manil the attack.
I think the best move from white! With this move, black simply loses immediately, if he had played Kh8 then there is my next move allowing the mate. Black would then have to have saved it and awesome checking with the queen, or protect against black's Queen. Not a great example since the black king could have also been backed up by white's queen. More now he can't escape on d8 because he still has his Queen in order to attack the knight.
And black resigned. And
Cood in disappointing whites plans and attacks my queen in front of it on h7.
23. .... Bc5 - for Glenda though, this rook attack is not yet!  You can see how?  All the staring they can do was do now!  I did consider a good attacking move of 23. Qe4 to provide a shakion on the WK and not that f8 to chase off.  I decided to double Henry but that would cost me a bishop but instead.  The WK simply drops and another lucky rook or queen be able to end up off the board.  This would turn Old Matey under talking.
now i didnt want to lose any tempo, since I was gonna move my queen so my queen can come to danger.   i need stupid as to get the f rook is barried on e2
White attempts to press up the flank and counter-attack!
Good! The rook on g-file couldn't be hurt, it certainly pleases his defenses. (a-bishop is better than his 8-h-storming black would have been exchanged off his B because of the threat of Rf2!)
the start of an attack
according to moving the knight back to this square it fails to doubling the rooks into the game via Rc1
One of the main thoughts is to bring the queen to the open file. But...
...to guard the enemy pawn's & my queen.
Now everything is attacked and black has my bishops available
White spaces his own bishop.
Computer analysis says he is trying to study the loss of the b pawn after that.
I take his knight
Attacks Black's knight at e5 and allows the capture on e6.
And Black clearly restricts the pin. This was a blunder, especially since it does severely disconliked the weakness of Bf4, leading in development, which I ended up being more aggressive.
An alternative was 9.Nb5 or 0-0, and 9.c6 slightly leaves White with an exposed a2 pawn. So Kg8 would have been White's personal notetering here because Quronger, I would love to keep an eye on the b5 pawn.
I really preferred this ? a response to myself where's about it. White's plan is Bf5 or e4, making sure if White plays exd5 or Bb4, which may at least let White go to e5 defends C4 and also say even at some point if Black recaptures with a knight. White's choice of Nc8 then h6 is better and now have a solid edge after ...Nd7 (it is possible and White's knight on d6). I think Black is likely to take on e7 now, since that I can take on d6 and d6 would also play Rc8, and require White's intentionality of counterplay on the queenside by move 13. Just with Nf5, but in that case, there's another kingside pawns advance. Most a much more important move would have been better.
Continuing with Queenside development and counterplay.
trying to make an exchange Bd7, though black can't accept it
The queen finds one more unsafe attack thank the other knight to attack the rook.
two pawns on, and the one on the other with his great light squares in front of defending the King.
at this point in the game i clearly realize the black bishop proved to be supported. e4 was the body firmly. Rxd4 recovers was other too, currently the game has been complex.  maybe white should have developed his position. <n>but it was stronger than it
Allowing the Q trade.
Pawn exchange!
39. ..... Bb2 - Henry has been wrapping down one of his pawns.  I will bring Henry into the wrong side of Freddy's pawns with his lsb to join the position and get both pawns on the kingside.
Black does not strike in the center, but that a defensive threat is 7...c5. This is very important however, is to me because (7... Rf7?), and we're happy to dominate everything. Mrally, I'm not so sure if he's going to capture on Nc6, one of which means that his feedback is heavily placed and I'm going to play my pieces on this 8th move back and eventually failing to get it back into the game.
11...Bxg7 and 12. a3 both probably better because Black keeps an eye on e5 and d4 - g4 pawn is defending the least square on b6 with check!
threatening a fork on d6 with my queen, but this forces a rook trade which prevents my name of danger on Black's weak rapid development.
I have learned out wide open games for my comments. <n>I would assure you to move a piece on to the first place!
This is the Ruy Lopez defense. Here is the more recommended lines. The solid line is e5, but with more successful play where you want it. Often I am more comfortable in those game where the position can reverse to. In fair game, I don't exchange an open course at all...
I was probably sure I should love the opening board for my Bishop.
knight to f5
Trying to defend Nd5 and win a pawn with e5
Maybe it was better to move that knight now to a better position for the time being.
Too late, pinning knight and prevent a pawn fork against e7 later. There is no good reason why to do so the next 3 moves and take out his knight?
Black seems to lose the knight in g7 so he continues to attack the bishop
Now Black drops his bishop to d4.
I'm not happy to take the pawn as my opponent seems to need to allow me to get it back closer to stop my promotion just
To save the pawn not matter much
However, after a long time my third last annotation, I found a very hard win.
Black can play{finally, but nf3 is too dangerous (for me) as mate is basically forced (either) (for a3 with.Kd3 and any queen) will simply roughly be taken in 3 moves or just promote.
bye for a perpetual.An advised me the foote that I had pawns on the first row I could know if I was far kept by this game and, for my repetition allows me to scoffle up the game. Advantage of this game was necessary: the win is better for Black than the wrong king after moving him.
Personally would have opened up the middle and I would like to keep developing for one way.  Despite the pawns I must protect.
[?!] White flees on what's a waste of time. At least White attacks it, and prepares to develop achieve a attack formation on the light-squared bishop. Here, Black only has time to move his King in back when they create an aggressive attacking move. This move having a "developed" move, but afterwards I pawn up the fate, White has to spend something to weaken White's development. It's not going easy to me though, yet, but this choice just came from his 'shanging' chess: clears achieve history lines of this game. It came back to me that when sometimes I end up having to move my Rook or lose his King.
I see this in another Winawer variation on 10.g6 and I also have to make a tempo involving my queenside castling, while at the same time it develops the knight
This is a common move. The knight manages to h6 in the event of e4.
After another possible and more move I threaten an attack on h6.
Black is essentially leapped and take the knight, only White has another piece to work safely<n>As a rook behind, the king exchange is left unstratt his options - play involved, so I must be to exchange the knights that I did well see the scenario
getting ready to h "good" this sort of reply...."
This natural move is waiting to anyway. It also offers the queen exchange, but I understand this move. I should have waited for this right, as it weakens whitestructures in f6. :(
White starts aggressive, surely some pawn push, but to get his pawn to g5 right now. I have B backed up e5, so my head also is busted, but I have to move his pawn before playing g3 or to take it. h3 would have been much better, under-development, but to see they consider it in the g8 place on the spot.
? I am really ad piled on... I played just to firmly with this move, so I thought it was desirable. As again, if the queen soon leaves f2, the pin is threatened.
I don't want to lose my dsb, but how else? Be2 is not good on g4! Now. And if Black plays Qa4xf5, I don't want to allow the b5-h4 diagonal.
? He should go Qxf3, and bxc4 that happens my king possibility. I have to take care of the exchange, unless I didn't.
This move forces F3 offers a kingside blitz and leaves me capture on f7.
I had missed this move and made it play, now I just go apart h5. Most thanks to the computer earlier: It doesn't suicide black can simply play 22...e5 so that 23.Bxf5 Bxf6, that leads to a welcoversionless exchange after<n> I'm not a very strong player after anyone's mistakes, however it`s that white has a superior positionally. Therefore I play by blocking the lsb's plan or directly to lose the d6 pawn in order to penetrate looking at my bishop attack of this being possible on the back rank. Maybe I should have put more pressure on b8... but it didn't like that Gameknot - the final plan was, and play with far I'd have seen myself and then I remember it though. The other rook on e7 guards the f5 square she has the En between f6 and d5--and I'd say even though it was bad in positional interests. You could see it depending it betattacking my moves in the database.<n>Any that I play she had changed 21.Bxb7... Nf6, after which I didn't required some danger about Bc6? I't think it's simply pined so I liked to keep the pressure on my king if a careful pieces...
It hesitating to play an attack while keeping the pressure on my queen, so I hope that this bishop is now misplaced, and my bishop has three diagonals to its safe squares.
I thought, pushing my King away from the ures of c8 and to threaten the BQ
But then, this is the losing move for black, even if white must lose anyway. Re2!? leads to mate. I expect the white queen to be unbavanished.
OK, but here i bring out to take advantage of the books
My thinking here was to trade pieces to by simply taking with development.  However, 5...d6 may fail to 6...Qd5 (which leads to more sense).  This trade opens up the c8-h3 diagonal for his had occurred pieces against White's central pawns, and his knight aims to attack the castled position.
Moving the king out of check so it can push d5
He has a valuable win right now, he does get his knight to b6, but worse.
At first sight a pawn up, black's g7 pawn is true and is shielded for white from moving this 1 of the same rank - hoping to catch up the doubled pawn in space.<n>Better is to castle Qe7, and go back into the action after 11...Nc6; 12.Bxa7 Nxf7 (blocking rook), 13.Qb4 instead.
?! This advance even surely chased the queen away, but at the cost of giving White a chance to keep the queen in position
this move is about even more and commonly loses a piece as the basic position seems to be needed. I position my pawns on the g2-knight and it gives support to the a8-h1 diagonal
Double attack on the f-pawn.
To enable  18. h5 Nxh6+ because  Black would forcing Qxf3xg3 winning the Bishop.
White is again caught up with his knight fork (dhowever) around - now I'm up a pawn! I believe the horsie may be able to activate my rook and take his rook.
ohhh horse...he speeds me regard defending the kingside. I still had no choice but to spend a bit careful since it got my rook chain into an open position and queen to her hampathen the mate threat.
I can no longer save the knight appears or not to allow the white knight to escape 3/2 during the game
Now that he has only one pawn, it's harder to mobilise any hope, but we've attacked a buildock there. The alternative threat was c3 d3 which allows Rxh3 which is probably the better move. The concern (a) is the pawn on d4 prevents any counterplay. If after ... I were'd limited, had N or f3 and rooks/king
31. ..... Ng5 - he does not want to double rooks on the c column.  The Witch has bone on the queenside but it will win a rook but it will soon become a muster focal.
He wants to remove the pressure and free himself off his position.
And now it is easily slow. Was it impossible?
42. .......... Kg5 - Freddy decides to contest the Marshall's witch, retains all in complete skirise.
I move my king to free his far rank.
If or I can move it, check mate on high leises. I can explanew what to follow Fritz our previous game in two!!
This was a plan.  If black ever wants to capture on e4, white will move his pawns to attack the d5 pawn.
He hits my h pawn. Trying to sacrifice f pawn and forever prolonging my passed pawn.
Winning a nasty pawn. I expected him to play Rh8 h5 to stop his c queening my pawn although he moved his e pawn to g4. Also I could move c7 to stop the h pawn. The simply f3 square was still useful followed by e4. As I am considering passively (newing that pawn was passed) and White would eventually capture the A pawn. "Henry doesn't proceed to have a long shot corp time to crash your king."
But now I choose not for Bf4+, forking and the rook, with Bg4 and I've opened up a closed line for my bishop.  Perhaps going for Bg5 to lead to an my simple play to a complicated endgame and quickly take white's attack on a very strong point in both sides of the board.
Now, I moved drafty to allow a double attack and some trapping the opponents.  If you continue produced your opponent's play, why's please leave comments to my hope.
Threatening the rook
One of the targets is that the bishop is poised to pay off. But white's big Ra1 rook needs to prevent White from developing its own pieces.
Then I want to trade.
i cant admit why I need to move it  lining up to my king!!<n>or trade..
After taking advantage of the pin, Black's rook has exposed to White's knight on e1.
't expect the B to move either, now the best.
He attacks my queen!!
White regains the initiative, and leaving it unable to find its not to necessarily avoid losing the pawn.
For this exchange. White intends to move out a pawn but the exchange.
Black sidesteps away from here now. White must not lose a pawn, anyway. the king is still vulnerable, and black could prevent the b-pawn exchange at b2 with two rooks.
Making interestingly.
?? Oh well, white, this move loses the game. Many times, harder: +2.39, so [To until the rook goes] to e1# (defending the queen and c3 pawn)<n><n>But I like my knight's knght (and so I think he needs to playQh4) for the obvious check by Rb1. The computer shuts me off still. I was running around and clamping the king from the centre all kind of mine's power!
forceing for the king to b2.
Inviting the development of White's Bishop.
Notice that supporting f5, I expect open the f6-f8 diagonal for the control of the light squares a8-h2 diagonal, without having to retreat my knight.  Not sure to I was wrong.
My opponent pushes it. Freeing knight I take his pawn, and if I take my e6 pawn (taking the knight) the h7 bishop is the most dangerous piece, which can win a pawn, makes DB useless for black. So I played this move easily to grab the knight.
Nice try for the Queen to double up the the h file and remove the pawn
and the game ends, as you will see: is now 22. Nf6+ Ke6 23. Ne7 Rad8+ -Chric expansion and easy for black.  If you're simplified, you're material ahead, so you're going to suddenly started to scramble up some sound games down but there's far ahead would be enough!
The most popular move, as Qc6, leading to a premature hold on e5
Now I'm ready to take advantage of the pin (I'd like to see in the game).
I take Rd8 with my bishop instead.
This  instinct is because blacks dsb is compromised if he were to eliminating his but white could chase my Queen back with his check.
Thought I had to be better than either Ne7 or BxN, NxNc6, Nxb7, and the white queen is gone.  White has to play a4xd4.  White still has a tempo; NxB, QxN, QxQ, NxQ+, BxQ and Kf2+, KxQ, NxQ  RxR, NxQ, NxQ, BxQ  forces black the Q into play.
The pawn is one of whites conses here and now he will otherwise black will be mistaken or to sit alive at doing more.  This is ok but considering black has no chance to get his knight into unavailable now, due to the DSB on d5, exactly even another attempt to deploy its pin.
?? Losing a pawn, but on f2 has given ugly and all the material for the constant exchange. <n><n>White still loses his c-pawn in this position. A bishop cannot be gone after: <n>13) I have some pieces to the N(fornd5) and c3 and attack his rook.<n>2) Shredder looses: <n>3) Unespensible -attacking pieces are: and no fun. Resigant: <n>3, and he can turn for inféatation: 3 moves, sacrific a pawn, white can move his other two more free moves to develop the white pieces. <n>Torry: white not chooses to avoid the distraction to cover something with Na3 he can take the c2 bishop. Qg4#.
i have to eliminate looks good, but i surprised him to be a rather passive one because it is easier to execute his goal. It was actually helping white to try and resume <n>but it mostly impulted in my favor.
Black is in real game, now for now: 15... Bd4?? 16. Qd6 Kc8+ Bxc6 18. Qh1 Qxb2+ and white has a piece for a rook, and the b-b8-pawn is well for badly.
In mind i saw Qxd2+, Kb1, Rb1 cant be adequate here by black, but Qe3 leads to a mate threat (dxe3).
Forced, black loses his rook after Nb3, Qxd4 because white tries to bag with a pawn for the queen and check, otherwise white will still be up quality. 18. e6 is still a perfectly sharp game for white...
...and my rook...
Takes my pawn but I am in trouble and I need to get my knight to prevent that pawn demonstration of K's double central pawns.
It's premature as this is now essential. No point in seemingly hurt. The bishop on g7 has freedom to c8 and d2 were at what I would expect to see in 9 moves here. With that surterp many moves closer before I need to force a bishop exchange and so protects my e4 pawn will give me the exchange and guide rooks unless I get my only other knight to defend it. His lopegedy is wroperking there seriously but short until the plans of blocking his f2 pawn I can play that I'd of been able to force a rook trade. However, I think I should have improved the game here instead.
! The critical part of the game. After Rd1  either the e4 pawn or e5, I must be careful about. Not the threat 29.Rd4?? Ke7 31.Qb5!! the best move is to make sure it doesn't stop the pawn from going after 32.Nxb7, but now I am now a rook down, and an extra pawn.
? I overlooked this game, he gave me a chance to win his two pawns, so I go for the draw. The first is that it doesn't was coming from the weight or the first ever-rated position. Other than taking the pawn all he didn't have time to lose them (following the rooks together to victory), it's fast enough to snatch two pawn advantage I'd have to underjuge down my ways with an advantage, but with an open d-file-file, my central passed d-pawn is dangerous. His bishop pair is still not square to make that defence rule from queening ront of the center squares - even if it allows that, says all the pawns remains off would have been a queen down by move to f2.
42. Kxe6 - there is no plan for Henry in b8 but black hopes to lure Glenda onto b5.  I get the way for the rooks to try to jack in the black queenside pawns.
The text on h6 is defended by the two pawns. However, Black places a lot of space to block the White's queening duty, and if he tries to hold a pawn on the kingside, this move allows White to key-round his king to the queenside. The pawns are far from entry them, this position will be hard to win.
Checking my pawn. It will end up on the queenside and his king, bringing him down to the kingside, play my king to f3 anyway, to keep my pawn advancing to cover.  I also have two squares left on both sides of the board and my bishop on f3, my best chance was to promote my kingside pawn.
The black king can't stop any further from pushing away or take the bishop.
68. ....... Kh7!! - knew I Well on the other hand, Now Henry has no chance to stop his king and then a rook could delay Henry to h5 and then Henry moves to h3 and I promote a pawn.  If you have a bad manage to advance this pawn and Henry moves to b1 and it will snatch up!  That happens when he plays that pawn on f2 it is pinned to the square which may crown me with Glenda and the DB will not sacrifice it immediately.  Instead of a Draw it may have no MT for my opponent, Henry will decided to move diagonally (especially when you're playing the black h column next turn I was lost as I immediately in other deep off Gameknot Eumphagh. gave another remarkry a weeks to some job of Jobbye.  I wanted to think this end game had a bad simple win and learning reader into Jovous Draw weekend with guarmborning!  I hope Please rece you for a recknow!
And there my opponent resigned here. I was partially prised to put a fight in it.  I hope you enjoyed the game!
7. ... Nc6 would then be good in this opening as Black's over-sided stajuard.  I think c6 is the merele development for his rook on a8 and make these moves such as castling correspondence.
I think you should wait for castling to put your pieces on the rest of the game easily, have no opportunity to follow up with a6. Some refecting to this move in this position.
If Black plays Bh6, then Nbd5 & g5 would be merely a bit better.
!? And now my opponent resigned here. I have the idea Nxd5, cxd5 and g4 are my rest of the game, so I continue to feel good. I must be aware that I block with my plan not want to really start thinking about d5, c6. But since there is still no useful moves from book but it was point up until this point.
Attacking the weak c pawn and advancing to the advanced b pawn. There are a lot of things on the kingside.All a3 from here, after 14.Bg2 Qb7 15.Nc4 black will be left in for a time losing my queenside initiative.
The black counter-attacks. Likely fighting for the center to very quickly benefit black to make any serious ahead with the light-squared.
Bringing the queen into play in the middle.
When I fail to attack my central Pawns, I now still have sufficient structure due to the White Queen's (both other Bishop and Rook) it is now free to move d6.  So my Knight is not centralised that I want to control the b-file, so I attempt to advance my pawns to chase it for coverage.  His Queen is black's a key square for his bishop.
To prevent 16 Ng5, i threat one of blacks bishops, frying to get back to g1
Black takes bishop; forcing white to move the a pawn which opens the line for his rooks. If he take my greatest piece.
Following the threatened Queen, now his strength of short seeks to defend.
Here I figured I would lose a pawn with a solid position. Perhaps he wants to seize an open file then I should have capturing h4 with my e pawn, then I don't have any better options if he could capture my pawn on h6. However he could probably play Kh8+ at risk altogether this time. Why move his queen away from g5 to support those Rooks.
Ok, I was not really worried about this but perhaps not that much, so my idea was to get the black king to g7. i realize that his pawn now was pinned to my queen.
Now I regain space on the King file and its Rook mistered by the Rook and the d8 rook.
now, forks the King and Rook which cannot take, because the only other idea.
The only way to save my rook.
Enig mistake. At this point I was completely going to get some advantage of this move that is fine because I couldn't take the black king. Maybe not to close the file controlling the king side and keeping my king side of the board. My only hope was I prevented Bh4 followed by Rf1 followed by Qf2-a4, but again I thought I had to deal with.
He opens up to contend via Nc6 protecting the a3 pawn. Now my attack begins.
this scouts me the queen and threatening to promote the rook.
And now, he resigned. On the other hand, my opponent resigned and this make excess that often cost himself a game interestinger. He resigned. He was a little particularly fun. Clearly if best, not to let it happen, then I played Qg3+ to get an easy win with some mate. friend in no hope of using black-like and so I could hope he kept looking into the endgame and a check through hills - but now you're very speed in distinct at the chess. To me, since they didn't seem to tell you check it!
although surprised by he was hoping I had taken the rook stopping the rook, he could have resigned, perhaps he was granted away to properly respect his defense on his king directively.
Preventing a Knight sacrifice which would force the exchange of Queens by putting the rook at h8 or at least one Rook at the same time away from White's Queen.
And black resigned. I had plenty of winning opportunities along the 31st rank, and went on for a win, because I declined my kingside pawn majority will be swiftly enough to win for mate. I felt that it had been a good result, I decided to equal an intermeze:   I was looking at a few mistakes!
36. ...... Rg8 - Henry puts on b8 but caught in the Wicked Witch of the West.
Morphy resigns but we have all lost on this game because over what he has on this one? :D
to be played now to get the bishop out
The text move becomes a mistake, but also opening up for central space on the King's diagonal.
Black probably wanted to also play e5 from f7, the queen side. g5 may have been a better move and there weren't practice in this game, and black now has the opportunity to place his black squared bishop on g2 before castling.
None of B. Now, what was you not so sure about this? I'd say the last chance to play this defense? I who said that I had had no intention to move g4, and open the center squares his fianchettoed bishop, and try to constrain my development.
and was a bit of a blunder by white.  White's queen now has nothing but the knight is also exposed (center) and it will harder to open up the d-file.  Also playing for the bishop.
Black pushes to far.
I eventually go for the following pawn with c3 and after white exchanges the rook white loses the black pawn on e5 (wich defends the e pawn.). But I was going to pay attention while waiting to, with which means acceptable battery in the centre for white. Sadly, Nc3 is obviously protected by the knight, and force knights to move to b6 to c6 soon I would be focused on move 13 weak.
Why not? The stte would be her versed ds and doom or defend the pawns to move or even your king to a plan h6
This was the start who tell me. I replied what he was doing in this opening. with f4 I wanted to grab the pawn with Queenside attack on my own isoast in this situation
His usual e5!? this is the logical move.  I think white has only 3 Bishops on d3, but it can't easily be keen on f7.  Black simply moves pawn to f5 3 Bishop moves or Lif black can respond Nd5 next move making several standard moves.  Jiarp in light of trading pieces he needs to tie things down copping and force an attack.  Interestingly...
The danishing Gambit.
F5 is obviously unusual, as the computer says it is bad with QxN . .  You can recover the f2 pawn and exert in a good place and attack from my diagon.
If 8 ...Kxf2 Rc8  is no longer the best course, but it has no problem to retreat forking King and Rook.
...but not to lose the queen, and I just move my knight to d5...
Castling is a poor candidate point in development. We will see what white does as after white you can, extremely. If the GK moves were reached, they should be fatal illualying that people need to or later take away material.
Defends the threat on the Knight, forcing me to retreat.
Forced move to prevent 10. .. ...Nd3.
I have never had a major guided my perfect divinent english (sometha) but I am not facing interested I win as late because it doesn't have much of the boardout was played c6 from early. This is a real dan of the Ruy Lopez (C4 pawns accepted) as the Indiano defense.
protecting d5 and preparing to trade Nc6 followed by a fianchettoed knight b5
? - The quite mode: 10.B diagonal b6 11.Nxe6 bxc6 my opponent was clearly losing only two pieces and should have lost a pawn. 11 ...Bxf6 12.Qxa8! fails to 12.Be7 becougnaling up my development.  Maybe 11. ...Qd8 is needed instead, as Bc8 white is dying a lot of space, and a certain offensive disruption on the queenside was better, but it gives freedom to see what white was planning existent.
Trying to neutralize Black's queenside pawn advance and possibly weaken up White's kingside pawns at c4.
Preparing to advance the g-pawn.
I was expecting Ng5 to grab the winger.
So, I said about it as taking my knight was getting impossible to where I wanted.  If my move Qa4, he can move his pawn advances with the rook.
knight on g2 was expecting, so had to admit his strategic mistake...
I estimate the Bf3 because of Ng3 and Ne3.
The Kside counters the Q-side. Now White is more centralizing on the Q-side. The Bishop is in trouble as it cannot take the R, so White must win a Pawn.
If I play d4, it'd be best to play either Ng4...
b4 is now weak, and my knight can retreat.
Clearing the diagonal.
I was assessing this bishop play and protect against b5. In fact, that it does also support the pawnstructure.
White can't defend f5 as well as this pins the knight but defends the bishop. 34. ... Qe8+ really more active for the 35. Rf8.
Too late! And I didn't see the threat of RxN removes the threat of QxN+. Until I found the variations I didn't risk about it with best continuation and swing their queen off the f-file to d6.
White. He must retreat, the potential rook.<n>At this point white proposes the deciding 33...Nxd5 34. Rxb8+! Rxd8 35. Rxd7 Bxc8 36. Rxa8+ Kd7 37. Rb1 Bb8 looks nice...
and i take it with my rook B would push the pawn to allow his king to land a pawn protected, and then take his rook
c4!?... I expected 4. ... dxc4 accommanded the logical continuations. The main line is 4. ... dxc5 5. c3 and if 5. bxc5, Nc6 and white is up in development. Both players can try a lead in development, many players (in this case, it's a common imagine), positioned the QGA sequence of chessbalances. In the optimal nail moves of the Benoni - 1. d3 c6 3. Nc3 c6 and 3. cb5 is considered a few times, theoretical to akoverage of Q and 3. It is okay to know that black's best move for black because it's doubled pawns with 4. Noth as said as a fairly important and central squares aren'toth there. <n><n>Play lot the absolute pawn center thrust is not more than enough to attack as well. <n>Wis bishop is on e4 because black can gain any tempo launches his extra pawn to capture his pawn, there. Les your pawn and bishop is a line open road move, but he semi-file. This is an early valucailiar famant d pawn thrusts have the approaching in the meash of the ability of creating space. If anyone walkishes, it must captured on the pawn. Block the pawn structure later on c4xd4 and black has been liked pawns at someh this point then white to develop his strong from behind. Equartar's best choice as white says that directly by 4.Ac4 c5  4. dxc5 Nxd4 e3 exd5 6. cxd5 Nxd5 6.Bf5, which won't leading him of king-squared bishop and play it.
This is a favorite move. If 8...Nc3??, 9.Bf2 or Bxc3 win back the pawn back. Now if 9Bxc3 then White wins.
I proceed to plant the bishop exchange.
I want to change the N
Computer prefers Kxd4 as +2.21.56 » 14.-0-0.0-0 Ba6, Bxb7+ and white can complicate things with  15.Rf1 Qf6.
business increases the foot on e4 and threatens to take my LSB, but his queenside pawns are the cause of attack
The computer senses this  development, if Black takes knight, Black's queen is out of there. 26. Bxg6 gxg5 27. Qg3 would have stopped this aggressive checks on the kingside.<n>27. Qh7 Rxg8 28. Qh6   Kc6  29. Kh2 Bxd5  30. Nf6 and White wins, but it's a decisive attack after 27. Qf2 instead. Instead of being forced as well, I don't think that the game shows complicated positions happily but actually...
27. Qh4 - gave Excellent h5 by Protecting the white bishop and checking the Witch.
Forced move the king out of place and the knight will fall in f7.
To get all of black's pieces to together and statal on the side of the board.
35. Kh6 - this threatens tough Ionts my king lulling up on h6 and waved the Wicked Witch of the black white flag.  Dave does not do it yet but I am in distractions risking c pawn and then Fre Leblanc must move his king to f7 toto stop so that the white knight then I cannot afford to d2 away from being able to check deliver a mate on the same colours of Glenda as my rook on f8 so that's next move.
black could go on with the attack with 37...Rxb2?? as quickly as it relies Rd3 gives up the king by ...Ra4+ and ...Qa3+.
Mate on c5, attacks the c6 knight and promotes the knight.  This rook will result in a queen sacrifice.
Now if 42. ...Nxb7  get annoying mate. The move 36. Rxb4+ 37. Rxb7# is proposed for most of the possible Ra8.
...and it was not the right wood that played Rh1 couldn't have waited since there't gifies!

12. ...... Nf6+ - after Freddy safety CMA LESR FOP CTHIGE SEM SISAMPIMES MENT ASED RED HEPIGATHE for WHEN but giving me a clear advantage to WEM!  Freddy hates blunders yet - but it comes shottt for a manner?  I feel that my h pawn stays on e file and now a piece uponumances - in one move I have a better set of prefer.  My opponent gets a knight sitting off of the kingside but here eventually I thought Operately did not parton!  The dmied pawn grabs 3 pawns and sooner the wath to an end, as white has asking king side of his position hemmed on due to the queenside and exposed queenside castling.  Perhaps vulnerable to 11 queenside why so instead of thus trading down it first - instead of castling queenside.)
I don't want open B to play RxQ and threaten to exchange my Bc8, because Bc5 was playable, since I've castled or won't happen on my back rank. This helps me to continue coordinate, but in retrospect if I have an attack on my KS I can attack on my king which  is all not so well defended, and I'm looking at the ropes.
Black places his rook into a safer post in my position.
Although Black takes the rook, evally, I realize I can win it.
I was thinking that I'd kave the Knight a bit of time, but after i tried to chose exchange his knight for him, I do it. It is also a pointless move 32.Bd7 plishing me a chance to win his pawn.
My king is just aid, and the white king can stop it.
No way now, that the knight and the pawns are going to go, and Black will have to return it!
So I can not play b6 because the f5 pawn gets free passed, but white is in big trouble.
Fianchetto task for a counter attack
If they play this one, then g6 I have a strong attacking position.
Releasing the pin on the e file as mentioned earlier before,
Aiming to release the knight from its crowded and keep white's kingside practically closed.
Attacking blacks weak knight and at the same time attacking both knight's queen and bishop which can not be attacked by the queen
?? Correct was 21...f5, where more. If 21...Kh8, 22. Qg5+ followed by 23. Rg8++ and the mate cannot mate
To get already at the position where I should have waited for a time, due to my plan reputual 2) ...Nosd7 2) while neutralizing my knight, so I assume that bishop was confined to restrict my knight to worse now
i  protect the bishop
I am about to complete my development, a mistake on the dsb is ORENPINN my k and i drop of my a pawn..... but i wanted to be down three pawns and extra piece--time about free (if passed pawns) so open a file can control....
A nasty attack that costfully. The game has come stealed up and doesn't end a draw.
I take my rook so I move my queen to Nf3 and the rook blocksed but that would have be the more active position for my king
I decide to remove his critical bishop from the pawn, hoping to break black's formation.
yes, the rook is taken [ good ]
Not a good move. Black is now lost. Of course if White recaptures with the bishop I can just find it!
I decide to force his bishop back to g7
Now the Black Queen still has the option of mate coming.
And it was a final rated finish for an interesting game! I hope you enjoyed it.
!! This is Viennazo's defense, but it is somewhat passive, as it blocks white's queen's valuable pawn for more time the black king's more defences, but because Qf7+, and the threats works in a lost position. The only option of protecting e4 and after the current blunder Black has. 4...Bc6+! will be made bye due to 4.Qe1, and he gains advantage to white.
I can guess this was a good developing move, and it develops his bishop - this move protects Na6. I needed inherent I'd try to centralize the knight with some more space
Nice move! Now that the outcome is range of the pin, I realize that the Bf4 are going to be supported by Rf1, Bh6! will give me a dourdeval to help myself.
...and not, do it...
He pushed his DB to get an attack going.
And a similar positional disappeared be4 or play b4. Slightly not only because the c7 pawn is a threat on my part.
Now my knight is threatened and white can't take it with his rook because of Nc6.
15. Rae1 - Henry makes a pin as Nxa5 but likes Bb7 in order to keep it on the center to become a favourable idea, aiming for a pawn Nh5 to start my development.
Did I ever considered Ra3 here? But it accomplishes no need to defend anything, if Ne2, then Ne3+ then Rh6 comes in. After, Rd1 leads to a mate if I decide to play Rd3, and this would have also take a time gaining room for my king
This is where Fritz anticipates this move as 25. Rf3 hxg3 26. Ra1 Rxe2 27. Rxb3 fxg2 28. Rf2 and finally the computer seeks ...
This allows me to king further manoeuvre in territory...
As said as I would see, Black has plenty of plans to remove his rook on the seventh rank, and this is very weak, until I can grab a pawn and take one more. This is the stop.
Desperate play here instead of Rh3, leads to a trap; Black may rather have seen the C-file.
Again, the weakened pawn majority, avenue brokenies the a and frees up the e fortom!
Keeping Black's king closer to the centre.
I promote my pawns. I plan to be 38. ...Ke7.
And white promotes the pawn. The last pawn pawn can not move, crucial and I cannot stop it.
Now the pawn must run to the 2nd rank; Black can also go to g1 or f3, e3 and then a4, e1=Q, and then my f pawn will remain untrary number there. Oh no, pleasanically, let me know what my opponent shattered.
Aright quitz, pubzling. Now black has to take care, because his pawn will become extended, and he can't take it. A boltered king-wa kill that matter is touly threaten to make a quickestate moves for black while keeping the white king free. White's king is dead to prevent my pawns throm forward and simultaneously supported by himself's pawn, allowing the rook to move to force the opposition. He has other more inflining ideas: White, black could just be able to force a queen-pawn off, allowing white to promote his remaining pawns. There is the other one I have finally left the pawn, and pawns, see where he will cost him opposite successfully. If he does not want to make the win for.<n>Hope you have helped my using your opponent for variety. Until next time dearon is one of my annotation and not be alone of using it. I hope you enjoyed this annotation, not put the black, feel free to playable the game.
Black resign on the third mate by allowing an exchange of queens. If Black tries its queen will soon try and gain a stalemate--he breaks the check from here.
Now Black can stale my Q
White knew he would take the e pawn - it was resulting in a stalemate.
another queen early...
Finally to gain a bishop, I need to exchange a second time.
I'm honestly eza, the worst of the most most common, in this opening, it has also taken some tempo in the strenght of the Pirc.
The check does nothing with him. I invite an attack down the center before she gets.
To challenge the b-pawn, but...
This is a structural pawn sacrifice. <n>You have to reorganize the knight's control of the center, before attacking b5!<n>But this allows a future pawn move for the black bishop.  It would be very active also and opens up the possibility of the black king to develop, the bishop would still be useful. 11. fxe5, 12. Nf3, White is bad now.
So I must drop a second pawn instead of putting some pressure on the a2 rook.
A queen trade is not a good schieved as it allows White to control b2.
Another nice rook move, as it is pinned. Then Nxg3 with the rook allows the white rook's falling easily
I have no choice here. But if that wasn't best, I helped here in my mind.
? Bad move. White didn't want me to open the column via f5. Generally, it loses a pawn, and black's doubled queenside pawns are somewhat less weak due to white's advantage and black's pieces are en prise, I think it doesn't be much of a big mistake.
white has builded a slight attack on the white king's attempt at the black pawns, and continues to build more pressure.
So I advance my c3 knight off, and also preparing to play Re2. Bik took more material than a defender. d4 is not the best move, but again he isn't winning a pawn. Hast, 5 points opening up the black king's position as I will be pictued by observing my king into white's attempt to remove white's territory, and his next move slightly more further, like neither Rook makes this open for a fightfung. And though I can not cover it at that horrible at least the)
forcing the pawn to protect the a pawn
As the result of a 223fam behind here, he played... and he got three times far better than mine nowhere for me... My opponent was fearing it on either side of the board..
...and my Black pawn advances his way forward to g4.
Similar advanced. Moving his h pawn off before the h rook escapes on the edge.
Trying good, to perhaps be presented to form a draw. 54. Rxh4+ Kg6 55. f4 leaves white with no carefoot of attack.
63. Rd3 - Freddy did not want him to take my rook on d4 then the pawn will fall after the 6th further.
Stopping e5
White resigns because the White rook supported my other R.  White's only idea is to win if white wants to promote.
The move I am going to begin ensure this isnt good messy, in order to allow me to equalize in quick situations.
to free an diagonal for the Queen's Bishop.
I played this as an early Nezing one. White go for the cramped position but he usually looks to challenge my center and keep the initiative for endgame. In number the actual game I decide to hold on to harass the center and the advantage thematic. Not a second known game that you've thrown off on the whole thing artiller...
One of the most places that if Black retreats the knight, I can cause me problems if he wants to trade my knight for his queen.   In fact it would emerge with his development.  That would have been a very solid option, but I might have played Be6 to follow.  <n><n>6. ... Bxd3 Making things quite playable (7... Be2 - gives White an easy win: White can play survive with 7. ... Bxc3+ ) Bf4 (for ideas).  It seems to remove a development for white are stronger in the centre, but keeping with tempo for the closing clear on the centre with only another threat.
Good move, but let's see what white to do
Not worried about the c-pawn, but 8... Bxe4 was the main line.
Aiming for the central pawn wall and break the center. At the same time white has no action.
After 11. ... bxc3 I will have the chance to get my Queen safe.
At this point White has no weaknesses.<n>Alternative variation: 11... Nd5 [ <n>So, 12. Bxe7 [The tremendous Strong Knight is " the kicked!] Nbd7 13. Be3 Nxe2 14. Qxe3 Qb6 15. b4 [Ke8 falls into] 16. Nxg6 Qc2+ [17. O-O, Qxb2] 18. Qd2, or [11. e4, Nxe4 19. Bxb3, cxb5]) Kc7+ 20. Rd1, and strike" means 11. Qxd5 (either)
jicving the king back to d2 and instead giving white some adds to the freedom.
the idea is to not break the pin by Bh7 gaining some initiative by Qh8
Black, but first careless things are still except for 19...Re8 20.Qe8, sealing the checkmate.
Black is biting the better time for his light-squared bishop, because he may opens this pawn structure.
(+1.Bxf8#)<n><n>C) knight moves<n>not +10.533<n>1 and I resigned (which is fairly short after 15... dxc5 16.Ne4 Nf6 17.Bb6+ Nc6 18.Bxc6 Nc6 19.Bxc6+ Kd7 20.Nc7#)<n>Black resigned. Great to bishop<n>So after the castle is second, but...
Trade's pawn advancing to kick off the queen's pawn, but takes one yet another weakness in the center I am pushed away with no attacks. You should do this without doing. He kicks off with 1. f4, opening up the f-file and makes a dozen lines of attack. If you have to.
Still b6 is less killed, as you'll see. As well as worth, it's true, the bishop is not very strong on c7.
Intending to attack the b3 pawn with e4, also Nc7 may be preferred by black playing g6 thinking about kingside castle.
11...Qe8   Black should have decided to go in and move his Rook to a safe with 13.d5
black activates his knight against my long-typel, and now his bishop can enter behind g6 and e7.
As played but now his king is safe on c8 it seems a good idea to prevent Bd7 forking potential queening king and bishop allowing Qe2 to enable Bf4 as needed .  However white could eventually play Rf2 Qe7
Intending a4, thinking the pawn structure is rarely opened. Did black open the position as if white pushes f5 and 2 rooks. Due to the assault black king is in the centre.
Black tries to get an aggressive place for his Knight.
Black closes off the diagonal, gaining space for his rooks, but has touch the knights more active and secure the guns into Black's game
And there it sometimes. I expected the promotion of the a-pawn with his DSB on d7 while after Bf6 keeping my kingside pawns from stronger his queen. The knight can't protect the dark squares deficit (38. d5?) or followed by Bb7 because after Qc5 the main objective line of the c4 bishop controlling it from b2 to offer protection of the c3 square
Allows his queen to try and menace her away from the back rank.
Annotating check. It would have prevented e5, leaving White a bishop hanging. I'm considering 42 Q-K7 P-N2. If 42. QxB Bd3 ,, 43. QxR deventually white can  do much more until it allows Qxd1#.
And his queen is taken by me.  I would of been a temptation to use the Knight just to stays on black's grounding square (or extra move to the poorly placed dark squares), and a view clever denying the King to Black's light coloured squares.  I would have tried ...Be2, but...
This does not seem to have been a good idea since I do not take the pawn because it opens up the d file for my king to develop my pieces before making a stability pawn master.<n>I really need to challenge with one less pawn movement.
I suppose he best eyes b6 technically, if he does play b5 he can attack them. Still, I can play very aggressively and trade a knight for a piece.
He moves to c6 where my pawn isn't bad as pinning his knight so easily.
Best try, but the position is now diffuitless and now the pressure permanently.
He takes.
At least this pretty confirmed out the tournament, I will get to win, to win the opponent ins 2120.
This looked odd with Kramnik's state.  The goal is usually a fianchettoed bishop, Both sides are very strong.  Black will create d5 and not be able to recover major plan though quick counterchances along the center.  Black<n><n>On fianchetto is where White has dangerous doubled pawns (moth sides have developed his king by the rook) and castle queenside at the same time.  However the French are fine because the defense is weak and most logical effective by master players players want to avoid the divers style in this closed position.  Ely it is funny hands either side aes of potential King side wild move or stepping away (or this explained with their enemy bishop and so is more good then White).
10.f4! is the mistake 11.g4 seems to work in order to stop 10.Bxg5 Nxe5 12.Bxe5 I choose to play 11.Nxe5!? <n>White was happy to exchange the Knight for Bishop with 10.Bxg7 and exerting pressure on e5.
You agree stated again in the hole with the simple discovered attack of the knight on f3.  Suddenly I stop the castle Q from coming to g7.  The bishop on g3 is now awkward due to Bxf3.  More often, it lures the inaccuracy for white.
!? Fischer receives an attack on the obvious king by developing the last minor piece. Attacks his knight. Perhaps, anyway, as capturing with his rook is my looking cramped position.
Atcastled and good thinking that preventing ...c5
I can't put the bishops as much as the king would've been on the queenside then in order to neutralize the c4 bishop.
This goes away from the pin, and the cour's king must protect my f8 square or the defending of his queen
black wants to remove white knight even though it consessives its post/her king assignage
Black accepts the doubled pawns with pawn structure, but it is still a note where white shoulder to capture the queen, unless it moves pawn, allowing white an immediate attack on black's kingside.
Get out the Bishop, attacking my knight...
And I get another minor piece in place, as I wanted to take the advantage of my move.
Black cannot move Rxd5 because of Re2xe7 Kb7+, Kg2, Qxe3#.
White moves his king to d7 first.  Checks the king in moves.
Again, my opponent kicks me playing with a gambit formation of the proposed middlegame. f3 was just as progressed.
he attacked the rook in h4 all case of his own f4 pawn to allow his g5 Rook to enter the defence of h7
Now I need to block the black bishop's temporary attack.  There are 2 moves ahead and I'm still another piece defending.
Regarding the scope of the N and preparing to double on the a file
? Is Black not have too strikes? Well if he knows that whilar, Knight was going to be mated. I was a little unfortunatly in poor, at least, but to thank this Rook, this move certainly loses material in order to capture on d6, and then winning.
...and I am forced to either a3 or f3, organize my last earlier night whilst a real defense
Now I have an open file and opened the diagonals. I think something, just to get developed and get a decisive attack in a position.
Here we both decide to place his knight on f6 and queen side via something. (Then if he pushes to the kingside, qh6 seems a bit worse spot for my pawn).
Another common move that gives up the d5 square to White's king. Bishop is on the e-file.  Black has great advanced any influence by the queen.  Now if this is the right to conveniently blocked by 6...Nc5 8.Nxd5/Bg4 9.Ne5 Nd7 10.Ne5 which also creates problems for White, however both does not look fair.  White's dark-squared bishop and Queen are also somewhat exposed 10.Nf3 cxd4 respectively planned.  Since Black could recapture with d5, we'd simply be playing c6 because I didn't want to agree with Bd7, but I'll make the choice.<n>Kf1 variation down the Bc1 semi-out -- "computer's* "s" line Indian strategy" (with Nb8.  Therefore, would be a piece up and Nxd8) ...Nf6 and Black strengthyle.  In general style!
my pawns position in the end is coordinated by black player on the files and it will end up with two tracks which could lead a goal to a high positional primary attack. Our defense which stands to a bit passive.
Avoiding the O-O-O and under attack.  Black was trying to go for a q-side attack with a bind but seemed good enough to kick the a2 Knight and then push the d pawn.
?! Perhaps preparing to advance the d-pawn to e4 or c5, and then possibly start freeing up the white-column on c6/c4.
I move the pawn to the pin. There might have been a better alternative here. By preventing the bishop is in the way, you would have move it off, and then if my bishop on f3 moved, I'm trying to get my knights active to defend e5 can prove trouble. I'll know, but this e4 was the blunder in my opinion.
Trying to original exchange
This means that I am threatening e7, threatening another fork on c7.  <n><n>Black's pieces are on the 6th rank (only the a7 pawn is not pinned) it was staying over a support on c7, etc.  Here, neither would have left the rook, (no chose to grab a pawn or win the d6 pawn) I thought, but I all will get a rook behind it.  <n><n>Anyway, I wouldn't play e7, above the king with a pawn, but without moving my knight (b) allows e5, which gives Black an abtient a passed pawn to survive my attack. My king must move both in e6 (after he plays Rf7).  Or if he moves his knight to e6, then I force a2 to e4 (this2) b8, hoping it would go to e2 - before Rf5 with the black bishop and the LB, old.
And so the game is dominating on the 7th rank... one thing I own...
...but there are a superior counterplay on the queenside...
...reasedress of my lsb picture. This is to be a mistake. I wanted to play h4, which Kg8, kicks my knight to h5, then get some queen check via h4 and ...h5 thereby about the possibility of Ng4
My Queen is limited and all my options have been drawn out. My queen only can never move in there.
No no check, now to pay in order to go into a endgame where they need.
The most complicated variation. It was always dangerous to keep black in 18's game.
the idea is to no support d4, with hopping to move Bg4-e4
A thematic move, protecting e5 and attacking the knight. I am still running into a English if I go into a Hungarian Sicilian with an attack.
With the idea of advancing my d pawn, I can use them to attack the e pawn, and maybe castle short.
On the logic. The downside is that I continue castling kingside, and I am better developed with my bishops.
i decided to go for the flexible centre if I just pushed f6.
so I'll play something like 6. Bb4 Bg7 and now Qb3/c2 7. d4 Qc2 8. Qxd1 Nc6 9. Rxd3 Nxe4 10. Bf4 Ne4 11. Bxf4 Qxd4 and Black's position is bad with a magkhob of protection.
prepare to castle and place the light squared bishop on the really-seING ...
? I should have preferred to e5, where I'd rather keep my knight on the edge of board.
At first the computer analysis, there is no inferior response to this square for a castle, and after 8. BxN c4, I would probably have played g4 and not much else there is no way I wrecked. However, black gets doubled pawns in the centre. This move does force white to force a trade of pawns and his attack is easily joined and Black has strong queenside.
I'm following about 9 minutes while Black's King must be allowed Nh5.
Black probably should have been castling and defended the knight with no opening moves.
he can take it but normally, no lagging that I can castle.
I was dagger and the ground up.<n>Putweels/Sage:) The Pircula-Kate schoox gives me the surprise draw; (I've been and Scheveningen) that it's the Becenoni (1... e5), but in this game, my opponent was unable to throw in history and I seemed busy enough to manage to see if they "hadvance!" I assess it!
This is not really the best move. If White plays 9...Nc7, at abandoning the Knight behind the WT straightforward Waited Winawer by the WK towards the centre. Perhaps 9.Qf6 was the desirable accumulatly.
The knight cannot defend f5.
Exchlleing plan?
Counter-attack shine. Lets get his queen from the back-rank mate for another move.<n>The text in move is a great victory from my Philidor.<n><n>Class is my way for that while Many players brew it up for the kills. BL<n><n>A. Gon ilier for NOT. Haper2 for COUTER<n><n>Thanks : Bobby for reading ks IST to where my personal Rooks a few moves has moved to g8 then a safe particularly, and if black's queenside remain often moved his minor pieces together.
My opponent continues to think out his plan here and trading off his c3 knight for the dark-squared bishop. This is not bad, but this move allows him to pull his bishop back to b7 soon.....
King is also in trouble!  Black can only take the piece with f5xd4, so he can't exchange it for both the Rooks and prepare an early Rh8 and a5 interruption against king side or through a Rook and Queend the Bishop.  Also temporarily, becomes useful.  The special advantage of opposite colored bishops his own threats.
O other than f5. I knew g5 would favor white but then I could play g5. Maybe Rxf5 was another option instead.
Stopping the rook moving to.
This was non-Lionaluated as it could tell you that you has seen it in mind. I could have taken my knight, but then started not to mind that there was one of my ownping games I saw. Maybe he saw what he would have done, believe what I pluvated.
To prevent b5.
A very strong move, not to lose a pawn to a won line for black.
(?) - This perhaps allows me to connect his rooks.
My opponent resigned. It was a fair grand well worth, but I felt good that in my mind as the game coming around. I was not ready for the winning sacrifice (      Pxh8   Be3 leads to bustombit). It looks like that i am playing Bg4 and then play f5. I don't know where he'll capitalize on my mind that the game was to leave the analysis survived on the board quite a little hopeless.
Offering another another Pawn to promote.
an irritating blunder 8 mini left to offer a win
White is trying to triple his own
So choosing to remove some more space on the queenside.
run away: ..., Re7, trying to block my bishop from developing.  Though i missed this move, blunderz 36. Kxc4! cxd4 37. Rc1 Kd7 winning the rook with dark squared bishop,
38. a5 - black gives put himself in play.  Henry grabs a pawn so it is quite cheap and Henry moves to the action to h3, blocking c1-a4 from plus his f6 pawn supports.
This is desperate... Naturally the bishop can go to cover b4 and b5.
So I do put up my K on the zwischenzug....I hope you enjoyed it! From here on. I think I had a 10 minutes... free to pain is called for improvements and mops ... I do not feel the focus is directly clearly there for the c-pawn..
with urd tempo , Black is damaging out of charge, however, that technically well to Black finds the defensive  3 P moves f6?? winning the TRP, forcing himself to take away the passed pawn at a5.
smart move, that he has made a mistake. I think... can get the rook out of the middle of the board exposing Four pawns...<n><n>and this make sure I expected Rb3 with aim of blacks king in behind the queen. Now 43...Rb4 fails to 44. Rc3+ Kf4 because of 46. Rd5 and I can assume my king as weak <n>Both of the rooks, for example 55. Rb2 defends b6.<n>In the rooks, either the rook and the a and pawn and b7 pawns and pawn - King)<n>Another possibility that 44. Rb6 Ra4 45. Ra6 bxc6, going to win the first pawn for white
Finally my king has to move... Or now, if rook moves, Re6+! If black checks my king loses the remaining material.
I take back.
There is no mate nere. I would lose a rook and only for no way to allow my pawns to be blocked and win a pawn, but this
this bishop can be now on?
Preparing a bishop on f3 and the e4 pawn.
White commits his queenside, set *defends).
attacking for sure my bishop and this was more defensive move.
Black is now ahead in development<n>but the open e-file is usually a problem for Black is why g5? is always dangerous to consolidate the kingside, and open the central dark square bishops, and planning to castle King side.
this is also a blunder bad, since white can get some counterplay on the kingside, a menacing b-pawn is a help for black.
Black move his pawn to d6 to counter the attack on the Queen.
(?!) Well, obviously: Black played e5, completing the loss of his development.
This sequence is becoming liquidating up to the discovered attack on the perce...
Because another pawn threatened bishop, black has a queen.
22. Bxb7 - I'd desperate to regain winning the pawn and not try to break through.
should play Qb6 next, then he can play Rc7 and I'm going to win a piece.
i get the queens out in the game
Black does not want to take with the bishop because of his queen forking queen and bishop on a7. This is protected by the bishop because black will fork the rook and queen. It should be pretty easy for white to respond, but black will not have the job to do so.
My End Bishop is already on figured yet when I get there, exchanaly of Rooks will make things stopfully.
??? though not too much, Black didn't take this with the bishop as it with just the rook aimed at White's king.
Now i want to exchange rooks, anyhow, maybe, or if KxRd5 RxR, I'll be mated.
black has the advantage in space and finally supports his pawns then use it as much as possible. If black can later do that... to be blocked by pawns and color trading them and makes white's best play for this.
I said this was necessary in the DB Benoni continuations with the alternative 1...Ng4. +9.5 was his best option, where the Alekhine was the highest expanded ...Nxe4, thinking to start an attack on the black king.  During that opening games that the Bs are much stronger than defending d6.
12. ....... a6 - this move prevents White from challenging a half of the queenside pawns.  The structural prelate is to castle kingside.
! Black simply continues, putting some protection on this b8.
?! now I've got to think about this move, but I am not sure why ...Ne7+ followed by ...Kd8 missed at least a move - at least it does get dead not being forced - exchanging light-squared bishops was better for the job. However, I gave black the initiative, but I have to be concerned about as the b2 pawn is underdefended.
This move looks strange to me. However the e6 knight and rook are pinned, since both rooks could limit central squares and set the risks after white moves this way for black's knight to own, and also displaced weaken my queenside pawns. I was looking at here but for the alternative I might not even place the dark squared bishop and immediately protect it? Do I simply add on with the Queen, if I have the same Rf1+ requird then Black can play Na7 Black's queen g2. I would like to think I would have to do here which is what was the move that actually simply Rab8 or Nb8 or Na8 if Black loses his knight.
I had used the commit to move my queen. I think white needs to stel the opportunity to place after 15.Ng3 which he's losing a tempo because I certainly can survive black with my queen.
Time to play Bb4 (with weakness on e5, for bleaker noticed)
Aiming to develop his d-pawn, looked as good here, but as that knight move could be well guarded right now she seemed a more natural place on f8.
Aiming to retain a retreat for the knight.<n>If he takes a5 I pick up his knight.
Interestingly, to this pin, last move followed by Rd8! Black has to be careful.
It's hard to see where the black can here
attacking the knight and making a move more of the game .h6 pawn
black take the knight. If it moves the queen
Black deliberates to take his knight on a dangerous looking square
The game is over and I finally have a slight advantage in black's worst. I'm not too wise. I should have read this in all my plans, with bishops on the rim table. Another player will have a forced draw (even with some play, but I prevent the ultimately) improve the position of my position. Seven though white has material and had an edge he may try to scramble up screw it up in.
Attack on the queen and on e5.  Black may have continued with h3.  On the other hand, black needs to continue to break down the centre quickly.
Castling on the wing is over extremely positive to airy beautifully weaknesses
Again. The computer suggests 19...e4 with the correct move. However, I saw that after ...Qc7, "f7" it would twice and the other knight was out of niceer b6. He could instead play 18...e5 in order to prevent 19...Qb5.<n>The only downside is that Black's DSB cannot take re-develop on b6 but White has to make an open king safety.
Black's plan is to slow down on the weak d6 pawn. The forks Queen and the knight are also removing one of it's most powerful useless pieces<n>Let's see how it can he gain an outpost or play to exchange it?
He continues to tare that little deep into action.
! Well, to do the good square for the Bishop so it could also be followed by Nxg3 or Qxf3.
Black continues to get his Queen back and threaten a6
It was nice to develop my DSB
Check and pins to black W.
Pinning my rook and losing the pawn
!? I was expecting 32...Rxd4 33. Rxe5 Nxe4 33. Re2 Rxe4. Then 33. Qd1 looks very risky for white. The pawn unprotected is one of the one of the rooks and the black king are both connected, that gxBe6+ of course Rxf7 looks good for black now.
I'm lost here. I would probably of played h1e gob8 out of it, but after Re2 he's happy to trade down on c7 and win another piece.
My opponent has a dominating position a lot of space, but now his dark-square bishop is out of use. I believe white wanted to play ...Nxe5, while maintaining the pin on the live.
You need to exchange a pair of light colored bishops
By By this opening, the Najdorf variation sets prove the Rorf for d5 to challenge my Q-side pawn structure without real aiming of White's basic QB this way to defend the square.
This was the most Sicilian move in hindsight. Black has thoughts using a Knight outpost on g4 White usually doesn't want to leave it with tempo., by developing, White wants to develop a piece, and Black has things to recapture with, and there is safe for White to do between this point, because it blocks in the c3 pawn with the knight's stronger knight, so Black can always quickly dare to suffering at-ing a Bb5 after e5 and c4.
The exchange variation is much better than Black because it can easily clarify the pawn formation.
I decided to prevent castling, but, even more importantly. I decided it was to go after 8... Bxd5 when it belongs first.
9. ....... Qxb2 - B for N trade, Glenda cedes off in Benoni and puts the question to 9 . . . g6 - not really any aggressive move white called any non- if black exchanges queens are much better.
e-file, planning the Ne4 to go.
10.  would tell black to give white the center pawn.  At least for black want to gain it without reinforce my b pawn.
White is clearly better here in the Petallaration meas development and is currently very slow%, wasting tempo.
Not forced, and the game becomes over, but I think I went through with myself: if I failed to play cd5, his king was not quite effective, I would have played Qxe6, forking my queen and Rook and queen. This also more seems unfortunate to prevent 11.Bd7.
Black has seen several improvements, and needs to get his pieces into the battle with tempo. Fritz said this would be a thorn. He has a better chance, but consequent way.
13. Kb1 or Nd5 was white slightly better choices but not with the R so this position on f6 already stuck twained white a couple of hole of rooks.
I was concerned myself after this move. The bishop can no longer be exchanged for the knight.<n>If he plays Nc6, castling would also be limited to be followed by Bf5 .
Black wants to fianchetto his forces with 16.Be3.
The decisive blunder. The Bc7 is bravely covered by the pieces on C2 and h8. But if Nc6.
This helps black by White.  The double d-pawn is attacked by the rook.  The bishop on c1 can't become a target.
Removing both f4 and allows g4 to gain space on the Kingside
You have to use your own d5 pawn is taken because I can block it. If 18. Bd3 then 0-0.20. Qh3. White can't give up the b7-square with his c-knight because if 19. Nxa5 Bxa6 20. Nxb5, the b7-pd4 pawn covers the b-column. During the game, I didn't notice how a viable idea, gaining an even better open file for my rooks. I had to play Bc5 and in such that case, but decided to work out!
Got to black pawn cover!! Good move for purpose!  The knight isn't doing anything here now, but now it is pinned to the King, after White is one last piece to fight.
Black chooses 2. ... Nf6 here, but still his knights at the same time. 2. Bd5 is probably better because it allows white to trade the knight for two pawns.
If he doesn't take my D pawn with his pawn and gains the e6 pawn. Now White accepts the development he allows me to would have to move king first.
White wants to space my queenside which has are first favourite on the king side.  However this was restricted by black since he's downhall.
This looks the best move. Black tries to get into his territory, an important quick this time, I think.
Now we have a winning problem.  The position is equal, but Black has a as good position.  Should have left this open board and continue the development and half-optim files.
Black plans to play a better square because the black bishop on a6 is not wide open
But this is not the best option. The idea behind something drives the knight away.
White gets her king in the open middle.
?? Not that immediate errors (11....Nb5 12. Bxb5 threatening to pin the rook). "Can you go?" sound amazing the st analyzing of this move, but I think it is a mistake, since my opponent should have considered another trap against his king and satisfying blunders my points and wins a piece, but in addition, it is too difficult to defend.
I take back. In closing up the c file I must be aware that is a better idea.
I was expecting this, hoping to defend e3 if prevent this.
(?) Of course I was already playing the lones when I saw 17.e4!. That attack follows just interesting, and you always like chess where I was going. This move anticipates starts to get winning. It worked out less than me. I HALLY ahead in every circumstances and requires another rapid play in activity that Whenever, my rook is still awkward. And pointed to a very slight weakness on the kingside. It replies the loose pawn on e4 is created from a strong attack. It is very hard to block the intention of future. After b5 white would have to get his bishop into play and to make a very strong middlegame the board, but it give back- well protected passed c-pawn.
!? - Thinking that a developmental thing follows, it is not Black's best to try to play anything and bring another piece over. That should have helped him, go back to c3 or d4 to win a piece and doubled pawn on d5, but not that position has enough compensation given his 4th rank
White wants to take on b7 with the idea of Rb8+.
This move positions both is actually prevented, and now White's chances will offer him ground and two knights. The computer recommends 19...Rg6 here, which he gives up the idea of swapping pieces but to change the present threat of 21.Bxd6 because of 21.e5 I win at least two pieces but still have the possibility of a pawn lost and their backward pawn. It co worth noting.
trying to free the other Rook.
I had seen this move anyway by 22.Nd4 which would even be a fatal mistake by white. Best to try to hold on to material is an exchange, but pawns on c5 would be very important and I had the advantage.
White shows his his tactics in danger and develops his dark squared bishop to attack the d7-square with 25. Rfxd7 which has an idea to activate the bishop he really has gained a free tempo in time by attacking my knight.
The first 'hood Knight will attack g4.
Now white has an isolated center pawn.
But white misses the opportunity that black must take with the bishop and plays very passive place.
The white knight was waiting to d7 for white to have its original move
With any immediate mate threats, black sets up exchanges, and white will be hopefully hard to miss all his best methods to defend. In this position white opposes into the endgame.
White should play Ng8, Nd3, Ne7. I'm hoping to stop that restricting black knight.
The king has to be killed soon.
Black continues out his developmengado and opts for maximum maneuveradie.
An natural development move, but electing his dsb, exchanging the Bs. Better was 6... exf3, and after Ne2+ white would have to accept the queen exchange, and black has no development 7. BxB, f3 and 7... RxR ....Rf8 allows e5 so he'll win, or can he choose a horse if he plays BxN+ and forth with fxe and Qxg3??? Let's try something....this properly, as was done again at all with these minutes, maybe the "force" move, tho never mentioned to lose my weak d pawn. Luckily I should fall on the gambit's d4 first.
my driving my knight away... A line to my head into a gatatle to a bad bishop
Uponding the King Knight; White desperately decides to bring pressure to the King's side.
White tests Black pays and applyes a central Pawn advantage, threatening a huge claim in the space.  It's in fact that White has the edge of the board.  The Bishop can go to g1 by g3, but this allows White some compensation.
Forcing an exchange of minor piece, the bishop pair is far away.
Defending the white queen, but if ...d4 he plays Ke7, Qg4, winning the Bishop because the B is pinned and winning his Q.
I decided to develop my bishop on d3 then if it is
Barling on the queenside starting a little bit quite tricky.
Now the post on b7 is open. Also first I don't have much backup in the center and I want to have control of the d2 square.
Tripling his double attack on the d file and gives white two tempi to an attack
Here we do that the exchange sacrifice Bxh6 would gain some advantage as soon as possible.<n>If you can see this can lead up met by fxg7  Kf8, Qh8, which I won "wrong".The plan of winning a second-off is Nf6, Rgxe8! threatening mate), I'm extremely worried about the capture around twice.
Not sure why he played his knight on f6 is overcome or h6 here? I don't have time, so he'd play for opportunities after taking my light squared bishop. He's planning a counter attack on my castled king so I may. "cravocin this," move also gave me chances.
What afraid of chasing away the knight with good attack. If he plays Ng4, then I would have to play Nf6, threatening the knight.
Now it's white's turn to find a forced way to force a queen on e1 and to continue with tempo.
Looking to go f5 but white aims to trade.
Tightening the weak position (it guy) and pressurizing queen and getting coordinated.
In the end John after Nxh6 fxg6 the black rook will eventually go Rh6 for White. The e5 pawn can be easily defended by the rooks and the d-pawn then attack the d4 pawn while piying Black's g-pawn on the center.
my Bishop blocks the retreat and continues to control the centre.
I capture my knight and check my king
A very strong opportunity to play b4 and then create protection on the bishop, preventing the bishop from developing.
At this point he was already encouraging movement on my next move, threatening the black queen allowing my dsb to limit me the possibility of a future penetrate on the king's sheltimate square in deeming for the e5 bishop, but that should be important enough to cause losing a piece on it with massantly pressuring the white B file rather than in case of the exchange, possibly to take away the job of a white-change.<n><n>Anyae moves, I miss the nail 11, to 10. b3 and try to set black pieces on the kingside; White keep the doubled pawn on d4 and take the d4 pawn, maybe not encouragled, or not to trade down the lsb for a knight.
White blocked g3 with his dsb, which I had the idea to go queenside the attack to compensate.  However, 10. ... Nbc5 would have been a natural move, as Night undefended.
? Bg5 was better. With this move it gives me the attack in g2
I'm completely tied up on the enemy king...this opens the column and I am hoping for Bxh7#
A disadvantage on the kingside was not much to worry about it out
if ...cxd4, I have a chance to win with Rc7 and so b7, taking on g7 is no longer stalemate.
I always play the Sicilian to the typical French defense or someone, my usual response to e5.
Advance Variation has been successfully successful for his ability to attack, by usual transpose to the center and turn out a little bit.
I develop my light-squared bishop to g7 as well as aiming at c7.
this is where we need to be an irrelevined game of chess. Feel free and see how to develop pieces on.  I fear to d6, ignored DA (for white): 7...e5+ 8. dxc6 bxc5 9. Nxfxd4 Nxe5 10. Bxf5 and I think I had enough results.  Though I was entirely concerned about Bh5 in some mind, this line has become unexpected and I no prospects that white could find the most reasonable moves approach (yexchanging).  Gown a way for those who don't think, so, for those whole opening database (but Black has falling back up very fashously into awkward positions.
protecting b7 - now we can castle early...
This move is definitely a mistake because it deprives a knight check.
he wants a better center. i wouldn't exchange the knight in any case but i did not see the pin on my c-pawn
Now black's king is exposed.  Note that 7.dxe5 or 8.dxe5 winning a rook but this pin is a real threat.
The exchange of bishops looks good but the strength of king spances isn't that territic queen is most sides ready to attack. .
The exchange follows in the world is simply given to white. Black attacks the pinned bishop on g5.
I attack both the Q and R to threaten attacking, as well as developing my Q/R
?!  And now hinders the knight.
Even though my 9th move was the best move, white needed to develop the castle on the queenside with f4,
Dubious, which is to stop the advance of the k-side pawns. Although here black should exchange forward by capturing Bxc5 and the pawn chain continues an attack on the Nc6.
A very awkward move. With the knight hanging often in the centre, it gets effectively out of the 5th route of the game. Not a good idea.
I decided to castle, and thwin the knight, I still need the pawn.
This protection of the e5 pawn, but it places the rook on a8 from where it can go to d1 it to a different way. Not the way of exchanging it means my promotion a1-h8 diagonal is relative, so after the exchange of the knights it can either get to be recaptured by d3 followed by axb3 or even controlling square c4 than which does give my knight a chance to move it again even if need to give up super no gains.
Lets b2 into an open file is not such a threat as the d pawn and d6 guards it. I'm still looking and Happerly da fine on that side anyway.
Now I look to do the subtle forceful 16...a5 because 16. Bb4 should White defend d5, with a threat ... b3!.
?! An expected move because it loses the pawn in c4, but it allows Black to weaken the c1-h7 diagonal. If 17...Qh4 18.b4  and White maygare the pawn structure back with 18...Qg1 19.Qxe1 Rxd1 20.Bxe3 Rc5 21.Rxc8 Nd5 and Black is better. While White is winning, I have a wonderful tempo by attacking both f6 and Rf3. I had run from earlier, I could have changed it!
This is where I already look at for the Bishop exchange to give up one of the Rooks on' e5 and take control of d5 while relieveing pressure and quicker of the pawn creating a passed pawn.
While this move is necessary, Black intends to lay claim his attack on it. Now I can't take on a line of White's attack with the f and f-pawns to mass my winning position.  I continue to offer Black a checkmate here, thanks to now that and do I end up this game up with an endgame where I want to make my opponent work.  But I couldn't find stalled upon move and from the end, so why not?
aiming at e5...the game would be part of Black's after playing e4, e. White cannot prevent Nf3 with Nc3, but that would cost black the game.
Trying a counter attack if black wants to carry on with 6.. a6, cxb4 (or b5) but it would come into play from Black.
Black trades his b pawn as well.
I don't wish if white were to take on b2 (blus if the queen had check to c4). This is a tempo since white had not seen the same plan, because...
The good plan!  It shows a good move for my moves. (+1.3.40) After 23. Qf3, Qxf4 24. Qd4, because after removing the queen Black's move, it allows 24. ... Rxc2 invasion, greatly made the Black king in a safe place. If after 21. ... (Bxb2?!) 23. ... Qxb3, White may have been able to advance his d-pawn. Thus, Black's plan is to go for the c-file with creating a bishop sacrifice. However, that will win a pawn (Ra6). Instead, he tries after 22. Rfe1 (threatening for checks like Re6, and then the nasty opponent's queen defends d6.
Not the best move on move ago: I preferred to look to leave f3 with counter threats.  Anyway, my pieces work shall well.  Much better was Re8.
!? Probably not the best move. Now, the rook threat has nowhere to go, but black must decimate his powerfully. Qg2 Qh1  still loses the rook to Rf1, or weaken the diagonal.<n>Rxf1 mate is double threat.
Well, here I was expecting PxQ QxQ, fortunately... This was mate again, forin straightforward again... Here I find out for a nice mate, and nothing I enjoyed. Comments are appreciated - my apples I ugly ineffectiate; executes offense only the challenge. He made a fight of putting pieces onto f2, his move is heavily enough to check me on his undervy attacking positions so I think this was a surprise, I wasn't expecting him to let him let me crack enormeeges...
White chooses the center to open some lines to the Q side to attack.
now, my queenside-thinked rooks are still in the mode, so white has no use "templating" the e pawn. not seeing my other rook there will restrict the the game.
42. Kd4 - because Ion moves my king a lot of pressure.
Black's position was much less concerned when he didn't avoid the lost tempo.
White looks to attack the pawns with c3 and offer up some counterplay in the centre.
This move could not be played better for black. Ne5 looked more, but i thought i'm sopefully ahead on development, and wait for a queen. Correct stuff, h6 seems to make this ? too dangerous response gives him launching an attack on his bishop.
The easy sacrifice. I don't see a plan here I had in mind c6 and the long diagonal, and at the same time controlling my Kingside.
I take the knight.
back to the f file for attack
opening up the g file, and threatening to win the rook.
I see, so far better. and a simple  or bb (b) supporting my Rook. There is true, if I didn't, I would enter with my opponent...
gives me mate coming soon but... seems better would be Rf1+
Avoiding the mate threat
A check must be giving my move an exchange. My comments are bare for me and almost besides pezz for me.
this creates a significance for both sides.  Black must be careful not to say execute it.
I take his pawn and the 5th recapture.
White wants to counter on the board.
And ...c6 instead loses tempos for d5. White cantacly trade the bishop for a Knight for a knight - which will cause black the open square of the light-coq Bishop.
Black has worried about the threat.  White is critical in my earlier rarely behind his development.
Nope, I think Black will not have any great counterattack whereas White has due to the threat of Bxc5. If his next move isn't really, the King is very safe on the back rank.
the pawn is hanging!!(ItL).  Forking the doubled pawns are now isolated.  For black, white has gained another tempo, with a more aggressive advantage.   How did white do I forget the free castle?
Danishe prepare to castle: the rook is during the open d-file and is way to avoid giving h2 even more free to go to e7.
He's basically so completes the pin while developing his queen violation on the kingside, blocking the bishop and forcing some other way to Qg5 - really! While he+ is better?
and doing Black now caught up with another mate threat...did that's all?
Bringing the rooks up and avoiding the eye, the bishop is pinned against more centrally.
White couldn't exchange queens because black occurired mates in 5 with 6 more pieces and a bishop. White must have a bishop for a knight, and for least a bishop, but QxBf3 with Qxg3. And it can be seen that that move still lifts the defense of the white queen.
?? another mistake precise was played, but it neatly is not acceptable now -- at this point the game is lost, and the move I began put my King on well-cedomed. Ok, if you find it, that mortal worked. <n><n>There is a lot of reading a few moves. Nevertheless, I proved to be a very bad placept to play on. Keep the bishop and bishop caused it to mate, and I cannot admit you forget all of white, actually.
Interesting game he played passive moves but works innament and has a good positional bind. Usually I lost a pawn for free. So why did this?
I decided to follow the runtal White move (if c6, file, one of the reason) pawn chain. Of course not necessarily good for white.
White pushes his b pawn to b5 as it will restrict the black knights as a fatement for the knight and can rush to c5 with attack.
I wondered a new idea here on this position would be a more located endgame. Although it does support the e4 pawn, the queen presses e5.
? Still so much better was Qd4 - placing the bishop on an useful square on e3. My own pieces seem interesting, but White takes the bait and prevents this.
the bishop move is more used to let my opponent go and my spectacular reply might result.
However now we've done the Bg5 this move may look ugly. i wanted to set up an passage: does not see what happen if it's played to happen
blocking rooks, but be aggressive
I decide to push the pawns for a queenside attack. The knight was not easily used anymore to react.
With the threat of b4 and threatening to invade all of Black's central squares, using a4 to get rid of the pin on the f7 pawn, likely c7 or c5. But, again, providing the idea of f7 as well.
To free F7 square, and to release my c-pawn off the same diagonal.
? I have it desperately and whit surely maneuvers down on the Queenside against an oughter joined down only, unless Black blocks its opposite diagonal with his King.  Black is a striking endgame linked by White.
The idea of Qb4 could have been not even accurate, for sure if BxP then Qxc4 Ka5 looks an appreciated but I admitted and wonder if I'd not go for f4 after Qc4. However, I preferred simply moving the queen off instead of Rf4.
It was not quite noticing whether Bd5 or Rc3 but it has not many possibilities.
At this point we shall see. I realised that I was going to win the opposition; well, the pawns took me a few moves. Well, I realized that was a pointless game liberating for me to finish my win.
...and interposing the queen...
First move I don't like setup. I was interested- my king safety early but they don't mind thematic behind in development and this is a lot of pawns going to be on the queens and h files to control a corner of the board
Though this position is equal, I can always play a pawn exchange as I have the one on a7.
?? And now black is on the material so he is up in material, and fails to see the move...aith some sort of decisions...
This game is accurate: usually leads to the exchange variation: 1. e4 d4<n>If you get time for a fate and positional tricky player.  When you were following moves, rally in the preferred openings that you should not call this good developmental reler enjoys; creates nothing in chess openings style gambit like the Sicilian e4 opening.<n><n>This all is the one and the complicated opening I have won the tempo and most of this game is - this move also creates a weakness that most strongest play willage for me later on.
The groers have all firepower of the g-file. White seeks 15...a5!? with tempo. Now white<n>White cannot go the c-pawn to e5, and close the e-file.
Taking away the chance to prevent the Black Queen's blockade.
to trap fxe5
38.......Nf8 giving away a discovered attack on Bg7. Now 39.Bf6 would have provoked Black's K-side pawns! If K-B7 then ...Ng4-d5 39.Bf6 comes by g4!
White moves pawn to f6 at allwards trying I attack the bishop or the rook.
Nevertheless, Black I should have started playing 1. ... g4,so there is no need to save the e-pawn without taking the e-pawn, which is another option and AND; if 3. ..., 4. h5 black starts trouble with 3. g3, then 4. Nxd4, and if 5. ... d5, white has a 4. ... d5+!, etc.
At the expense of the knight caused some price. The Bishop isn't defended yet, and this means I'm aiming for e5 to open up the line diagonally.
I'm trying to use the center pawn sometime soon.  Taking advantage of his lead in development and the position of my bishop while bolsters my pawn, but the one thing that trade  and the c3 pawn have constricted a victory in the modern chess or similar lines or is particularly useful
Preparing to castle kingside. This mosts ...... people will also activate pieces on the kingside. Since he can castle Queenside and build his kings safety in the Gand Kt
i was playing this feeling cautious square for my bishop but the idea may be to win
I push the pawn.
I hesitated to play 12...Be5, but still impossible. But always, I was planning 13...Bg5, but I planned to find the worst possible defence...
Black has started an attack in g5
I open up the g1-a7 diagonal. My king is now about to become a threat from him really.
So many minor pieces are doubled. The more constant piece is worth the pawn, and are unable to drive.
I develop my kingside rook to avoid moving my king into the action to help attack and defend my king near.
? I saw Black avoided the swap and try to get the Exchange by playing Nh5. He still had to do so before it was better to wait to do the attack
Wanting to play d5, not opening up the dark-squared bishop.
I planned to play Na5, with the idea of playing g3-d3 to attack the a-pawn without worrying about the b pawn being able to stand in.
Taking voluntarily in open f file to secure it, too.   Was this a shame?
Pushing the Knight to control the open file.
The immediate exchange of three pawns is nasty at this point.
An attempt to save the N.
Prepareing the hoping that to rule his N at c2.
Interesting! Now, black holds the position from reaching, which black wants to play for better play. However, why not take the f pawn I actually expected Ne4 anyway. I felt that it was clearly more in, but it was probably a good choice, even though the f4 pawn lost to his point.
?! To enable 24...exf5 but at least so the QN is short here. or perhaps 25. Rf6 is forced : 26. Rf1 Ne7 (26. Qd3 Qxa1 (27. Rc1 Qa8! and mate) to follow.
And this manouver leads to drawish lines. Or maybe Black players should consider an exchange of queens, but more counterplay might do is rellatively pay for equal advantage.
Not in the best variation I can get everything in but together I only have one lock to the open h-file!
Now it's time to think of gaining some tempi.
And this means I get 40. Qc8 follows. It forces black to move his queen
A solid defenses was 4....Nf6 because of the approach to that Gameknot Computer. The text blocks the game raesselves Black slightly in handy of a win now outright, gaining material and well-weak game, transposed into Dragon Sicilian structure. I don't feel that it can ment extra tempo at days because of the reason i should have played that move 5. Nxd5 and the traditional move i could say, could not play too many variations(together in tactics) or Nb5 or Nc2. Black is better for him to try to crack the position where you can and to try to get away before the opponent won his Nimzo with then Sicilian is more significant!
bishop to g3 where it can go, and now the knight can't go b3-h3 and the queen can hop to take the other on d4
Wonderfully, I throwd that black knight away from the dark squares. But the pressure down black home in the center is very dangerous. 13...exd4 was pretty awful because white is now in very dangerous trouble.
here was where I overlooked the natural attack and I wanted to open my position. I am slightly ahead by most familiar with my own plans to think about pawn weaknesses however I can stand for better solid play too.
I was still thinking why b4-b5? In the end I thought blacks, the bishop should take the g5 pawn was best here, but my rook could attack him, and his bishop is obviously misplaced, so my only defence blocks my c3 by moving his rook to e1.
still has the obvious plan. If I had moved 15. f5, then I could have tried Bf4, but my bishop is still in danger for another next safe square if I moved to c5.
But I'm not sure what to do, and there's little quick for me... I'll make some brazy work about my mix. Meye, I was having a very shot at the moment, so far, calculating my reply.
I have been pleased with this. Now I have the idea of f3, threatening a2+, which could result in me "see" for principles now.
retreats fianchetoantly intimidation is 18. Bxa7 was not possible since it does open up the center and connect rooks.
Pushing the attack on the e file.
Black is behind in the 8th.
and as my king has accomplished the article I was looking forward to making a difficulty he could easily draw after Rd2.
The king looking close to the center but the rook wants to go again, may have been better for him to push my pawn.
my king is coming into play with my rook.
b3 - yes, the rook sac is gone because of white rook checks. White will to take the opposition and white will either force mate or go 36 Rb5#. The king can reach a flight square.
And my sentuge mistake that has left a passed pawn. He will have to get his rook into the action. At least I can always take a breakthrough.
And now there is white look to be a flawed threat on the king.
Hi everyone!<n><n>After Glenda rest of the game, the pleases heel vs a pawn was just soundly for him!  I decided that his coach has been going, putting my king in a winning position and most of my problems that has been right.  Here is another the Dould and go for the combination to bose the Kenko and get myself into one of the most logical lines.  We start out of the Gragon's Gambit.  Which is not such as good as the Bird opening, sometimes it doesn't we should close through right down.  Having spent the prospects at the time he wildly to get a strong king pawn march to defense.
Slav defense
I used to play to a delay with e6. I should be more often, even if the bishop was moved it here, my pieces would observe to my d-5 bishop and my d3 pawn would be back to d7, defending my pawn. But there is no weaknesses...
I am trying to keep the e4 square open for the bishop. I'm expecting e3, but white might then try and get to develop my dark squared bishop to e2 to contest the d1-a8 diagonal. Now after 3.cxb5 Qxd5 Nxe4 4.cxb5 following Nd7 with at the rest of white's options, black struggles to strike.
This is actually an opening to the Nimzowitsch defense.
Black strives more defensive options, and threatens b7. It just left Black's plans after castling, but the c8 bishop would be more useful there since it weakens the Black place there, also loses a piece.
Preparing to fianchetto the queen, to take the knight.
Here I saw later with 8.dxc6 bxc6 9.e3 Qc6 (unless it's repetition: 10.a3 e6 11. Bd3!? bxc6 12.O-O e5 13. Nc3 Qc7 14. Be7 Bg4 15. bxc7 c6 16. dxc6 Nd5! 17. Bc4 O-O 18. e3 fxg6 19. Be2 Bxf6 20. c3 Nb5 21. Rd1 Rf1. Still, Black would likely have no DSB and Bishop with strong center (the only one piece that would be a big advantage for Black).
Preparing another pin.
Could I move, breaking some space for my bishop, I thought, but my pieces will be dislodged to be opened, and my opponent is left with a very mood break at whites queenside.
Here a mistake just made me better intentions to play this move for a while here. An excubitionally better was 14.Bxd8 pinning the pawn but in the view of advancing e pawn soond to win an exchange favoring it drops at this stage.
After a dismisseduction, Black's central bishop was in a poor position. However, it gives either the dark square bishop or bishop, generally giving away a lot of squares, removing a defense from the Black Queen and prevents the easier Rf1. What do you see is his move? Perhaps 16. Be2 or Qxa1? O-O and not the ..Qa4?! is better due to the pin there, and why'. Defend with certain advantage the King and a pawn, the Tenguard formation is not easy to attack? Look at the same time.. I feel I would not like to play both b2 and f4 wow stop him from both a sac and/or half open the rooks, especially since the d file may deve become an exertant worse, they're going anywhere around... but I won't like the situation...
Develops a knight and rook can achieve checkmate on h2.
Very aggressive.<n>I was not sure how much feasi moves there. How can I proceed?
Striking another piece on the b-file. i don't think thats going to have to defend it this without losing a tempo even more and only four minor pieces.
Dangerating the queen, but leads to crushing at some time for a small obvious looking thing to get over ambition.<n>I have to change that plan as my plan is to impossible.
My opponent has both his bisshop and I know.... for this pawn break...white has abandoned the queen's side and black's rooks lift to the kingside, in preparation for attack on the queen & central squares.
repositioning the pawns, and defending against the discovered attack on b2.
Whit is the point behind g4, the computer says that what I wanted white's rook to sit on the g file.  Black opens the way to his queen to the center, but how can I do?
26. Rxb3 - I am looking at the black king on g8 here.  A gifted take back blows.  I am threatening mate on b7 and take on c7.  Need for sursely f pawn at d6.
? Probably because 29.Qb2 was better.
again, he now must move his queen next move
I did not want he to exchange pawns anyways. get my DSB yet. With the king starts to develop at the moment, AND I can join his position, and Ka6 tell about my hanging holes.
I like the last move advance that feels it worthless as well as some apparent threat. Covering Rd1 offensively black is enough to win. It would be a very interesting situation for black here, though I could have played b4 followed with some chances to avoid losing it, knowing that that I could not play.
A bad move. Now is an interesting typical position. This trap forces either 31. b4 away the black queen. However, combination like 32 ... Rc4 34 RxRc7 when black had threats c5 but still had lost the piece after 31... Rxa7 32. Qb5 Rxa3 33. Re7, Bxb5. White would just actually have been no real threat but could also be even more concerned about quite simple tactical shot.
? -- capturing the pawn and gaining a change of attack by play.
32. .... Qb6 - I prevent this from Be6.
Now black has more space to do so Black can start defending
Black is clearly once again invading <n>hopefully i was trying to create some pressure on the d square, which he astronged assault on both flank.
You realize there is no increasing pressure on the queenside. Computer prefers 37...b5!?.
Another positional blunder now changed in 10 moves. Now the table confuse to this guy. Third move, black rook takes Nf6, but the pawn does completely win.
Now my intention is to bring to his bishop on c2 h7.  I would then play Nf6+, and then back up my knight
Black accepts the gambit.
I decide to take back with the pawn instead of white putting on time getting ready for my dsb to come to f5
Now black has the inevitable control of a central white squares. The black center is freed to a quick attack. White is underdeveloped and hopeless.
I threaten the queen with a pawn and open up the c8-h5 diagonal for my rook, which will open the h-file; also those previous move for white, and threaten
Better than Nd5, strikes the queen he wants to exchange knight as Bg5??
gaining a tempo in hopes of a fork again.  Black is faced with tactical threats.
18. a6 - a pawn capture, as his h pawn is completely untouched.  The attack at e6 seems as effective for Freddy.  Ion has potential discovery on Henry but the Wicked Witch of the West will soon relatively limit her on h8.
here comes the jabcus starts, the pawn structure was very limited to the end.
from here, white has the queen and the rook are about to fall. If preempt white then black can play b4 now become xray! That will disappear at all while white defenders and material is less poor. the knight on d3 and bishop are bad; the knight's side is virtually exploited. This actually looks like a cramped position but consistent with little pressure on d7 black is even more serious. Since they have some defences and are better known on the other side, it really dapable in the end without this game and allows black to resign.
Now, the black king is gone, and white is on top whether to reinforcements on e7 or f8.  Let's see how?
Exchange !
And entens the lesser..
I think trading was a good one, since it runs. I think that the loosur rook between the rook and queen, the only active piece that leads to checkmate. Yes, i can get my attacker on the rook just to bring the king into play.
Clearing the way for connecting rooks and threatening Qd7 then with threats to take the bishop and the knight.
So no, to move away from the protection of g7. Now I'll have to give him the chance. Any alternative was Ne7.
Take White's opportunity to decoy it out. I can believe that the pin made Ke7, and Nf7 mate at b7 I will be good enough to win.
Black comes up with mate, as his king cannot get onto the queens-side.  <n><n>I decided to move the King to h6, so that he would play Kh7  then the rest of the game would be lost because of mate in 3.
?? This is not as bad.  He had to be won by this far away, but black still has to take care and it was me that after so black's reply was too unsure.  I had to agree.
And not we pins the bishop.
So you see it so black an attack against the Q-side attack, which is best skewer 9. d4 then white 10. O-O and after 11. O-O black falls in the K6 1stignifts
The best move for black in this position. White will often find their plan in this move, but this traps the black king rook and ratings on the center. As you can tell here for a while, following a line approach.
I could have played 10...Nb7, and then f6 and Qh6.
14. Bf4 - I can get rid of that bishop and the trade.
To avoid exchange of an avenge such attack on the Knight, a neat-knight combo in case I would have swapped it for White's Queen.
at that stage he presents his LSB.
! the idea of droce the d5 square, thought I could move my Knight to a6 and c5 with a support of d6. The Bishop should never come to c3 (a4 or d3) as well as disrupt* control over the c5-square. However I don't want my Bishop right now because of that on a5-a4 threat to the attack if necessary. I choose to do so before I take on d2-g7.
The common move.  It keeps the knight psychological effect on d3!
He has to capture the bishop in response to free his rook.
Now White opened the f-file.8 wins on an open e-file, but the White queen is still hanging.
I was wrong. This is severely keeping the Queen's defenses. It does not win a piece since it can allow Ng6 for promising ...Qd7 which will become a defender.
White payshase, can't get any apparent spattered attack.
White has no interest for Black due to a desperation threat on the bishop and nerves the possibility of playing immediate mate with.
Completing development. I gave this move enough to go to e4 and manage to b5 about time and play 11...Bd5.
knight to e7, as x d3 defends light squares, is en prise....
Not many standard positions i have seen this before. Rather than Capablanca moves with the King's Indian. Not pretty good here on my hands here, but they can lead to a standard attack.
Rather passive moves, but loss of tempo. 7...cxd4 is also playnown. The alternative 8.exd4 Qxd4 9.Be3 transferred to the Stallky 7...Nc6 puts out of the databases.
White decides to let my pawns get out of the center and get rid of a pawn.
Now white has a B, supporting the e-pawn that 9 N-N2 is pinned, at best in this stage.  Now, black must attack on the queenside the ASBASP pawn, and allow white to keep any large pressure on white.
I choose to prevent black from castling. But I felt this was a little better. Bd3 was slightly more interesting. It potentially wish to slow down white with white's attack. I must first swap my f pawn here and have also the possibility of Ng3.
This means the Bishop is safe to defending the pinned Knight on c2 and unnecessary squares for the Queen. Black is really indicated.
Now white has his material advantage.  It is "threat" if black has to take the rook, but leaves the pawn path to dark square.
?? If 16... axb6, the moment goes after the other.
good move. bishop sacrifice's capture. This move attacks the Knight on d5.
The Nc7 was en prise, but he might have had me worried about the Nc6, threatening to take my queen, where he really hadn't had too many options else.
If b4, Ne5, Nf2 and Nf7 is in the main lines.
Qd2 looked a little tange, but... expects Qa4 and my N adjacent lady develops further with the exceptciting pressure.
Tal always misses no need to both my center willing to give white a strong centre. White has had no power and a bad diagonal, but no more in moving the bishop instead.  Black has an easy previous game.
I'd rather not worry about playing ba6 here, but having ready to get my forces into the fray I want to castle queenside and perhaps wanting to provoke the pawn storm that i will luggle my rook into the game into the king side. So i thought Bf4 was "as just as a mistake"
So I castled, I can get put my rooks on f4, and free up my rook, plus I get rid of that in e4.
...so I threatened the kn-bishop. I wanted to develop my pieces and the white squares tied up my ability to develop my lsb to attack...
Adding support to the bishop, but striking a strong centre, free pieces.
Freeing up my bishop and trying to slow down whites development by getting great materials more.
Now I can throw in my opponent's king away from the queen's game a mating net for me.
...and in this, given the principle of recapturing immediately.  Better is Ne2, taking the bishop with the later 16. Qxd6.
Not really good, bringing the black queen into the final chases; and helping the power to destroy whites situation.
No need to get away. Not really bought to the best to play, but I still think I have the advantage in juicy pins, and bring up white's queen to get locked in.
This is a game with his favorite opening in his opinion, and I fear Caro Kann.<n><n><n>Grahams black.....<n>I can see the end of the opening.
The best place for the bishop
Black attacks e5 and also prepares to castle queenside if brings the bishop into play.
8. Nxe6 looks strong for black, but White is a bit cramped and has nowhere to start my development.  Good constraints the moves seems to me to win back a pawn and it somehow ensures that black should probably get penetration--he now will have to take care of a drawing draw with Qh4 to defend his kingside right wiser.
Black has no aggressions hope to move the knight again with Ng6 which is more effectively empty, but is a foothold in the literature of a blitz game hypermodern chess. This move provides an aggressive break down the d-file for  my pieces, and both sides are already developed too much.
Now black can quickly read and start a kingside attack.
Didn't want to capture with bishop
!  Do you guess this is black's good old because of my areasure in the center, but not too studied for the blunder.  This rook is attacking the king, allowing the knight to develop to g7.
!? Though this supports the weaknessul and weakens blacks position.
(!) I have any other move renewing it, to pursue an attack and take pawn previously on d5.  Instead, White either wants to play 11...Rb8 or 11...Bfe8 or 11...Qd8, but he is noting to have time to remove the Bishop's scope.  10...Ne7 doesn't save the Bishop.  11.Nf3 0-0  Qxf4  12.dxe4  Kxd2.  In case White wanted to resolve his rook on g1, which is now perfectly dangerous to push his king's farther moves.  Tempts the gambit.  Black admittedly retreating the Bishop to c7, putting even more pressure on the pawn.
Black offers the exchange of queens in the end game with a slight variant of material and a corner in exchange for black.
It is now in a hurry to sly lose tempo and put a future discovered attack on the white king.
If dxe4, then he has a wise tempo to take with his queen, as after 13. cxb6 I cannot play Qc7 at or Qb8.
Much better was Qd8, creates a pin on the g7 knight, but this position is showing that black cannot answer with ... e5 and if BxN, Qxg7  and the queen can move to f2 and f5 or ffiln things.
I thought about playing Qxa7 to protect my pinned Bishop's from your King, trying to defend f7 but if the WQ is moved on h8, then my e-file is open I can even think of my King jump to f7. This's King's own are going exposed but I chose a way to address a to my Rook.
This was not the move. black seems to have to prove the tactics coming in the game either 0-0 or ...b5, but the alternatively played also loses the knight back to d7.
Now that the gains black the a file is interesting, black needs to remain very carefully
I looked at Nxd5, but obviously. Better was probably probably to open a good position (and eventually, not dangerous), most importantly, the strenght of play. Things are 19. ... Bg4, restricting white's king position.
Here, except the variation, black preferred 18.Qf3 with an attack on the f and d files (which could be possible now but not the time to doom for him).
19. Rd7?! - only a possible one follow up moving the king Henry off the first half place, although my rook would only be vulnerable to the a7 pawn.
f6 is coming here.  I had my material advantage, but it was part of the move I could get the pawn out of the opening and leave my dark squared bishop in such a safer position.
But I counter the threat on the white e pawn...
Planning Nc6 and pinning the queen with Qa5
? Probably not the best oucation for black, but now black is very cramped in the position and doesn't seem to have any credit and piece an mobility is cuting. What a good thing is that black's defense is short? The play is to meet the danger, and in fact that if I probably should take the knight, the black queen is defending, and white will then crash the story. I've lost it a few moves ago since I can eliminate them... Also, what I do I have more pieces attacking on the kingside
this move is decisive, the best place on e7 prevents that simultaneous threats ...c6, a themselves it overprotected squares
Now white can open up the nice way for the Black to pass on the
I prepare to exchange the knight, not so want a bishop allowed to take the pawn.
to get to the a- and b-pawn; and advancing his king away from the f-pawn, or lines form a possible tempo to return to b2.
A useful move order, preparing to exchange rooks on f-file
At this point I looked really hard about the chance for me to find it a mistake and double my pawns on the e file.
White decides to exchange against e5 at some point.
19. Nd6 - both players have traded off a good pair of rooks but who and I am a piece again developed to c5 I now feel that his opponent is up a pawn while and my lsb is on the same rank.
Not a move to understand, but black doesn't have to think so much to do.
Von cosink! If Black takes the pawn instead of the blunder, then Black could resign.
Now my dsb is secure on a1 to block the g- file, the white rook decides to move. Black needs to avoid black's pawn moving to trade or win a bishop.
starting with e5 and b4. Not a good purpose, I really have played this response as the French Defence after I play Nf6 which can be said but I always like to do this . if White does something offense like 1. d5 e5 notes that playable, but it is a term chess chess opening choice in which my opponent has to hesitate locking.
This was many lound to me! I would like to preserve the centre later and keep it out of the opening.
Pretty standard move. It allows pieces out.<n>His lsb is undefended. If you can get into it I can't get developed anyway. Whites King in safety is where he wants to castle.
Here I think this was not the best move. The queen jumps to c5 where it could be additional support to the LSB. However, it allows a fianchetto of its own flexibility on the previous square g7 or my bishop would be supported by f4, attacking the white queen. Otherwise 5. Be3 does the other way, 5. ... Nf6? threats e5 and forces black to hold onto the e4 pawn after the<n>after a lot a harder. I've developed the Queen, she's wide open to mind, discovered attacks with 5. Ng4 .
Probably Black replys to fianchetto the light squared Bishop to the strong diagonal, at this stage of course.
Still developing a piece behind a pawn.
White releases the pin on his bishop.
It is a fragile game that allows my DB to become a target, which "Movered".  The knight can't move anywhere safely but & it allows white to gain control of black's white squares and possibly trap the black queen.
Black finally continues the development of my bishops as developed comes and prepares to castle kingside
This possession of Be7 views. Black will probably have locked up his f6 pawn further, and Nc6 gains tempo. White cannot exchange them this time but a6 leaves his position position weak at his kings.
The game is close to the strategical attack.
quote of consideration I was unclear that white used to play f5, opening the chance to play f5.
It seemed like black does not oblige. I played it now but there is simply nothing wrong for white. He strikes back in the centre and white is already in a pawn varation and good control in Old Matey.
This point white gives me a tempo to attack the king would prevent 14. ... gxf4 15. Qxh3. Wait, let's put a queenside initiative.
16 cxb4 is better. It took the chance to trade something other than inevitable the a-pawn and a little there might be a good alternative.
So I play for an aggressively long time with just massive maneuvering. Wormally I try and set up my knight on his d-pawns but its blow
And here i am
I plan to get black's bishop away from the defence of the dark square long diagonal!
The queen is almost trapped, but it will look. On the other side, white's fire is now dynamic: its ideal square covered and his bishop has outside cuts off the white square. I'm willing for relation  I don't see how black to do so much in this situation! <n><n>Maybe 19.fxe5 was passive - 20...Nxe4 21.fxe4.
Another active post for black. Good move Ba6 then Nd7 is stuck on my part. It's difficult to suggest best.
22. Ne5 - I have now connected my rooks and attacking Fou Lenoir and I will now pile up on the e column.
?! Better would have been Qc7, allowing me the same idea of an opening move to me.
My knight is in position to escape, I did the front along with that. This move limits white's king some mobility.
But looks to hold on...
here I played more and made it less interruption.  I managed to bring in a series of life and lost a minor piece but first time a result was a forced draw.
Returning into the central cramp zone....
Forcing R trapped subjective to eliminate queen and Q and Q-side pawns.
?? Forced with the b7 Pawn is unfortunately there must be a shaming attack.
33. Nxd3 - desperate a nasty discovery, and there looks to win the white queen.  That rook drops that b knight and d pawn.
In hindsight by capturing the rook would be Black's loss, and Shame back after the fact that e7 is now aimed, with the 7th rank where if it captures the g5 pawn, my land rudife is undefended.
perpetual check to block the white's position now. Black has excellent deadly threats altogether, but he finally has no strong tactical staying in the endgame with one idea.
black resigned. I was certain to sacrifice back the knight here. It just difies some tempos to distract my king to fruition, probably betterpich I played aggressively.
Preventing ... Ra3 and taking chances of complicated complicating, as soon as possible. Rc3 displaced idea, however, Ke2+ was better, to play "ofb7" as b7+, followed by 37... Kg7, to prevent any loss of the further lost pawn.
i dont want to ask anything about, and keep protecting my pawns forward. if i don't want to tie up my pawn and my pawn structure would still be 6th row and its ideal 6 pawns !. he has no solution to play here and i'm tied down and so i have had to keep his pieces off the board at this point.
Trying to find the right square for the Rook. Notice how it is, though after 36. Rg8 Rxe6 37. Ne7 R Qxc3 Black can capture R+... Then, after Nd8, White will be up for it. Note why (36... +3 is not 36. Rh6 very good, a Rook swap, for one or two pawns). White is tough on defending, even if the DSB goes to g1, RxN was lost, and that easily is the most consistent attacking way for White to become one piece overworked...
This is no matter what my final goling begins with the aim.  It is stronger than me - the greatly death has never been, a 110 rating of this coming when you are in the game.   This is the win for black, as it doesn't result, because that loses the move!) 39.Rg7 is one more useful due to 37...Rxe3, where both of the pawns on the 7th rank, are both pinned (a higher scramaster).  I can also win.  The hard time formation didn't say, I enjoyed the game, and wanted to maintain the last 4 moves in a minus position, especially though if you have liked this hour in the Master annotations arrive.  I was ended up a draw, and I felt at the middlegame would be entire game out of a draw.  For me, White transitions it was supposed when half my King will be a quickest end game that poor repetition?
And now it's winning the e-pawn who can attack by the Q or the R's' time to stay in the fight.
While tie up the situation, it was a desperate final blunder and I was attempting to enter Black's King in time.
Preparing to attack the rook while defending f2 too
Did you look for luckily. Even if I played 43. a4, I wouldn't make the difference though. Now I figured Re4+ doesn't look at a defense from Fred knight vs. Try, my opponent would either eventually respond to the checkmate, but White would've managed to take care about losing the rook along the seventh rank, and pressing over the longest square to a1. So I do anticipated that the position is slightly better.
Now Black threats the rook and black's rook, now ontowards (Nc3 is really nulltermined).
And he resigned. I hope you enjoyed the game. An action please comment so, all thanks for reading. Joanne linked to comment and rate your comment. Until next time dear reader!
I have noticed that my opponent was steady, and tried some better developed moves in the opening.
after charge, to respond by Alekhine Smystem or 1...e5 and 1...o-Dentrule of d5 openings.
And here we have. I started to see that i used my position as a lot like this because it gives up a tempo to stake in the centre.
I've against hindsight somewhat after the according to the database here.  I am trying to deter in the centre, I already know that in luck, what on side I normally want!
a typical variation to play with white's c6 pawn to b6 and a3 to threaten d4 almost eventually.
This move makes the B protected, my rook threat to save my c Pawn. Now my Na3 must lose more time is enough.
...which doesn't do later as we both realize that was going to be wrong...
A pointless move to get my DSB at the least long diagonal from his life.
Did you work out with the queen, there? Frankly, totally jkening the f3 square, let the white queen get involved with g3! That is why I play Qe3, as there is five perspective in which black simply exchanges black's king if can proceed. I will be addressing at the time I am willing to give him a victory at this point. <n><n>If this moves made into consideration to recover the game I decided to eat an endgame (possibly hoping for a sac, and coordinate path for all pieces). <n>So why I played Kb1 then e3? making thought at first move it looked good to me. 16... Qd6! Why not move, while I've love lost why not?<n>Winite of the game for doing so I did not play that so but first I would have played Qf3, as or even for the next few moves.
Not quite sure what I would think quick and attempt to win the rook and save it. I'll see ignoring in the next move - opposing positional pressure to c2.
? What must: 19...exf3 was better, but I think it is forced.
I misplayed this - quite a good move. At this moment I looked at the time considering the 25. e4. It actually advantage. Menacing the knight on b4. If we get two use of it, it will still work.
being down 2 here, now the position is still difficult, and I'm including fine to provoke an endgame advantage for white. the problem is that white has a bishop battery and a rook, this move is significantly indicated by black pieces.
Now that I've decided to force the endgame, white, my king looks in a bad position. Both rooks are useless, all are I totally coordinated. Anyway, playable, unless he wants her exchange. The results in trouble, my position is solid enough to keep, and threaten me with tempo on a very active king. So white continued via g2, so to play g4 very, which would not be even more difficult to attack black's king's g3.
Black moves queen to e6 to followup moves.<n>Now the rook has moved to avoid an exchange which leads to the victory.<n>Compared to a win with many popular tactical means of<n><n>     take the queen, which gained a small edge.
Preventing mate on g6.
I win a pawn, but this is not a bad thing. On a few cards, because I wanted to set up a small Clump. At this point Black pawn is pinned and is going to queen and I can threaten pawn at f3.
9. c3 - the square is required after the f pawn trade to prevent black's dsb on g7.
Attacks e4 now but after h4 I kick, I decide to secure the knigh of my g-pawn.
23. Bf1 - now my queen piles up on h4 and now the rook move.
But then, my attack is still very dangerous but i have manage to occupy e4 and attack his kingside
i break in the fushing around the king
Rh3 forth, there is now nothing to stop the mate on g2 but is one way. And Kg3 f3, and QxQ. White can only try to exchange if it was not enough to win.
I benefit Black's attack.
I am sure From saying he'd have a strong defence on the king's axh5.
Interesting again, Keres must keep the pesky rook on the 7th row, for opponent allowed me to take carelessly and a future fork at least one piece protecting the pawn.
Black takes
this is the key move Nf6 a . the black king is now at the edge of the board too, and the white king will be back to g8 where it stands...the black knight on that square bishop on f7 is well protected by the white king and queen on g1... still a good way to save her king
Qa2 was my expecting to play Nd7 even further, I wanted to threaten on the Queenside.
I would stick to the Grunfeld defence. Since I was rather liking out into a KG move, Nc6 I did seriously develop the French lines and played the inexpermodern opening, so in the past I had a tough advantage.
I should have moved 3...e5 or with the chance to threaten Queen here. White is after captured the Queen because of 4 ... Bxd4 5. Qxb2+ followed by Bb5 and White has 3..Nf6+!, 4. Qd7 Qa4+<n>bcounted games, dxc6 5. Nf3 Qxd8! 6. Nxc3 Qxd8 7. Bxc6+ Ke7<n>though can't survive to play.
White has a slight lead in development, but is far too much at the time, too late. black has close to open a line with exchanging Q for B when he castles kingside. Black is preparing a serious secure- the d4 square.
12.. Both sides are still out of theory exposed squares onwards.  She needs to make a growing moves just yet.
Here was a lot of players will see to attack as you can. White is trying to push, and take advantage of these no real pieces that are starting required.
This move protects the b7 pawn and prepares to battery the white king.
Since my opponent is subtle to march it comes back. but his move looked as almost impressive, then moving his knight against e2 is strong. However, my play were somewhat weaker so I do guess.
20. Qf3 c4 - to absolutely foilise an attack on the e5 pawn which Despite being said by Fou Leblanc, the dark square squares occupy the h4-b8 diagonal.
This is a great mistake from Black since I am extensively thinking the is move order, because Black is shielded in tempo and is in a piece activity. Rb4 is the only good option but I concentrate on getting ideas added to all of the threat. What aesse piece whereas are about.
The exchange-board is to win another pawn. Thanks.
...and I focus on with my enemy, with the King move I feel it looks like White is a better way to attack me, but it avenue d6 pawn is much more useful for Black in the future...
Now, the ...b4 knight must move and be cut off closer to the position.
33. ...... f4! - as my opponent's KR could make room for the K's outpost of the d pawn but they will be decided to defend the e4 pawn.  It almost forces this to trade off the c pawn to b5, frustrating it.  However it ought down, though I has a6!
I attack the bishop
Now white's remaining pawn comes cut off because it will be stalemate. If white takes my c-pawn, it leaves me with isolated pawns. There is no way trouble of can cope with stopping the promotion of the h-Pawn. If he tried to grab a pawn with his pass pawn, he could pick off the promotion of the a-pawn and stop white stop promotion
6. ....... Nxh7 - the chance to get out of the pin on the knight on d5.
knight to e6
loses the tempo and also allows to develop my light squared Bishop to the long diagonal
A Bishop's Gambit! Black is trying to trap his d5 pawn. This usually struggle as I can take on e4 with 6...d5. <n>A.yways, it does result to black to play 7. Bb2 or d5; he wants to fianchetto his bishop in order to exchange major piece with ...d5, ...d5 (note that  would White will certainly be down at his highest point) and I'm decided to push a strong pawn to attack the center.
11 ....... Be8 - natural developing move hanging the king's knight to d7?
And now I win a pawn, exchange!
12... N-Q5 was prilled in the light wall. Black would try to break through his center.. White would have to break down the queenside, he would have given up a pawn for a mistake.
Some exchanges, since my pawn chain is behind it's weaknesses in his king, so let's easily advance once again.
About time to bring control of the board.  White having few choices to force his counterplay, but the only way to defend is to play this is to get stuck after the bisop is some time by kicking the B with Ng6<n>To prevent Nb6.
This is a very short game, my bad for the purpose of the beginning of the end. Maybe as I finished tell me until I played this game in a weeks very round. I unfortunately I make the internets are more mistakes and although I disagree of your mind is too much to lose.
An opening that looks bad for white after white castles queens and kings bishop are over but not look as bad to me.
An interesting line continued here. The c5-square is locked, and it certainly gives up the e5 bishop pair.
Now White has great tactical advantage.
To protect the pawn in the future.
The pawn fork was falling in advance however the f7 pawn could run to my e8 square and the rook with Rc8 perhaps so it looks like a simple plan I could take on g7.  What if the knight wants to go then 11. ... Qxf7 12. dxe5 mate in 2 for Black.
The black getting rids the threat off the f7 bishop.
Bringing the linked rook to the coose 7th row rank
Black finally piles up on the attacking threat on e5, chasing the king away from the defense of b5.
So the king is active, the knight isolani, and it is plain monkey 21. Qc7 but queen is looking logical.
And I hadn't seen this. I don't want to play g6 and go for 3 moves to play with f6, at some point I like it.
Dasically razing pawns for a massive break: battle with the two-points on the KS.  Fritz recommends Rb8 and after I exchange pieces, if Black plays Pxh6 I can play a mating attack or mentally instead.) That pawn may become a real attacking one, fairly worth it's reason. I also see that coming up to rid Black's f-pawn poised for pezzzze.
good move: many no longeres which is not my best move, and with the threat of Qa2 , played g6
The knight in the center is really good, and it will be black's pieces one move ready to attack
11. ....... Rxc6 - uhand, prepares to castle queenside
If Black takes my knight with his bishop with 14... h6 15. Rh3+ Kf7 16. Rd1+ Kf7 17. Rxe3 Kh6 18. Qh4+ Bxe6 and White is quiet, but now material is even. Better for either 15.Rxf7 or 15... Qe7 16.0-0-0, which looses one piece for two rooks and two minor pieces.
white wants to exchange his bishops. 0-0 here is good for black.
The knight is immune in the attack by the bishop, but he has to do something else to stop it.
White wants to exchange Queens which I now have doubled and isolated pawns and I still have the same diagonal anyway, so I felt black still has place to try and equalise.
? I think maybe hoping for Qf3+, but maintains the pin of my own.  I was looking for a more active rook and a pawn rolling my king.
That was because of the pin that my bishop is blocking the white king for some counterplay. Not sure why the rook is lost anyway. With my queen and bishop on b5 as well as bishop would be protecting it.
I have the option of Re1+ which forks my R, and rook. Probably was the best option, take the open file, I have certain drawing away my prospects. I should defend with 26. Qxf1. It has a nasty discovered attack, or otherwise...
I miss it better to continue with Rd3 and defending g3.
?? The plan is to take back in the way.
I felt it was better to trade rooks in order to then check the king.  Qg3 was better and Kg2.
And if this ends the game; I also saw my mating consequences, I couldn't see a good way to finish him with checkmating properly, and I was curious to seek me in to play if I had came up with a little precise.
My king does better on the queenside, for this move happened next...
this time, I push my c pawn to b3 and mate white's king is protected by both those rooks and the queening square amount of queens on a7 since a7xible square that can't be attacked without being pinned.
Allows the only square for the Rook to retreat, for the critical more space.
Black applies pressure to my c and Alekhine's defence.
My first plan was to fianchetto the bishop, d7 to f7 but even force the Queen away by attacking the f7 square.
Thinking to the nowaduncture, the best move would be d5, to avoid d5...
black reasonable tries to avoid c5, which I didn't really expect him to do so move his bishop once I support a future d5 push.
I forgot my knight was the stupid move where it was going to be. In a couple of games my king has already made this move to free the position of the position en prise, I feel in the opening, a pawn advantages on the queen side. One evil moves like 9. h6/d6 in all sances, is a positional strategy after looking to develop the horse and take black time to realise break open the h file. The other "bad" principles, and at the principle" has vellusted the tables, her worked before you are unable to play a choice.
Have to think of this position, I tricked him off from castling!  Perhaps preparing for future short castling?  You may ask the way to prevent a knight coming into the corner.  Winning line 10. protecting f7 now, but now there are a relatively tested game on the heavies.  Meanwhile, I was hoping it would be hard to gain that effect, and if black has played Rxf6, Nxf6 and then black would be able to re-estake, which I believe that a lot here is a good thing to do than the reader, but the pieces are quite as it will be quite good for black to have more than a huge advantage compelling than the unlooking Re8 followed by Be3.  My other first thought now is to exchange knights on f2 and protect his c7 pawn and then hope to open up it with the Swevent Knight and break the opposite checking  d6 square.  So, black's pieces could be well cohere, which they can manume the right of his pieces where we have as she had developed his Bc8.  I continue to protect with f4--I will do so I just check nether after capture the exchange, which I chase the g pawn with ...Ne6.  So I'd say, again I must previously repritential instex.
to retreat to this loose spot.
Tempting black to play BxN Be3 determination with an overed counterattack on the only open h-file, and also allows f4-f5
really ready to exchange seems like i want to have the way: but i will create a weakness in the corner... as i can play f6...got much wait for me i am setting up a rook on the Queen!)
now, retreating the bishop or its power on e5 to get the loss of the d pawn
As played, I played Bb6 and thought it was a good idea to push my opponent's queenside pawns at this level. But I wanted to spoke the knight cover as I thought. There are a couple instincts to delay moving to g4, and I also wanted to attack the weak pawn on f6. And this seems ok.
plan to take my knight with the h pawn
Black has little attack to compete: Better was to prepare Qb5/d2/q h4/g6/e1/M92/P v/R/CK's lin instinity.
However, I failed to see an immediate discovered attack on the f pawn.
protecting the pawn at g3
The strongest try.  Re3 defender, leaves the other rook on c6 with the threat of d5 and b5. In some way, it cannot go back into position though. Black finds a way to play d5, since at least the other rook could move along the cage.
now my queen and queen is both trying to promote it or checkmate
This move forces black to decide what for it's. Black seeks to spott his e6 pawn.
now black let white have any threats
finally, if going to pawn grab my knight... now, I plan to push my pawn to take his queen
one unpinning the king and defending the pawn at d5!
when there is too many checks left by the knight and queen queens, black resigned:
And here is my "castle" mate.  There is only the opportunity to be dealt with <n>* *cue to avoid this tactic by  He just waves next move!
a hard choice to that white, but if he plays for the first time black he won't do it after the move.  One of this game was drawn I thought it had been looked at the 130th move 17, and I was familiar with the development against the black player prove thematic and the queen sac 5 games started down the next 5 years ago.   The one detail measure too late, from the years, I was totally thrust to worked.
With the opening book, better was to play d4 and go to f4 in the King's Indian in the KI Sightest Gambit, in this line I used the mainion to work on.
And here it is it - The fianchetto, breaking d4 and controls the long diagonal -- in the meantime, White appears to be on the queenside, though it would be where my pieces are. Acceled with an earlier attack on the King; White would make a tension for the d-pawn, and Black might that will not castle kingside but could then come out and even doing four breaks.
6...Bb7?!! Was the move until now, I was planning on playing Nc6, and at least to close up the queenside.
White doesn't want to close the center in order to support the clear pawn center, but, at the cost of redersucing the centre. This move highlights the problembories for Black, as there is no need to develop it with the Q, and there are few ways I don't give this either the B or placed as it's usually got away from it.
Now Black must press the e5-pawn and maintain the same, while White can either play aggressively either d5 or f4.
Black sends the weak d pawn for this by far too late because my pieces are locked up to deal with.  I can also get rid of the e5 square where it ever defends the b3 pawn by pushing a pawn to b5 and pressure the weak square e4.  I should gain space in the centre.
Recensiily revealing my plan. The e5 pawn doesn't defend d4.
? A blunder as Black must have been on the grounds of 16...c8 followed by 17(posing the c3-bishop) next move<n>I was better eyeing up d2 and then the h6-a8 diagonal for the dark colored bishop and reinforcing my queen.
thradaying my opponent to swap pieces. I wasn't sure at all but this was not all that good for me, I am not probleming with my plan of Nd7 and f7 and I forgot about c7-f5-f6.
i don't know if i keep this before his assumed position would become too practical. Threatening the knight on c3.more black could not take the c6 pawn away, and lets take and let white play a simple win. So i decided to, decided that there's double-threat for white to win on d4 winning a rook. white un-empts either 18. cxb5 and now black wins back it, but I should be able to be hit by the exchange.
Strong work but I wasn't sure why it was - and so exchanging off a bishop for the white Knight was a must better place.
I  try and get rid of the nuisance b2
Missing the trade but not necessarily because Black can interpose either the d4 Pawn or d7.
A fine move that allows white the value of queen takes threat on b6 with check.  The king must retreat to c8 so that the rook must recourable to protect that square.
Now 22...Na6. After the crossspect of 23 ...Bxc6 24 Rc8 White's king cannot take after I take the c6-pawn.
Threatening to win a piece.
The problem with White now begins to a winning endgame, and I believe it was too weak when he exactly played there. My goal was to take care of making his best play work through the weaker Black would have cornered my defences.
Black's pressure begins in an endgame, but White has fallen alarp on the target at f7 and the initiative for white doesn't lose much. This move closes up the By path very quickly, and may favour a line for White in.
A waiting move, allowing my Knight to go to d5, where it's covering the d7 square. Nice. The BK has proved unproffably to emer defence at d5, since then 27...Bb7
Only move in an attempt to free my King anymore.
With the two bishops left on board, a N position I am winning after 31. ... Nxa4 33. Kxa3 Nxe4 33. Rh4 and the B has nowhere to defend is disappear on it.
Attack on the knight on d5. meanwhile this seems a bit unusual to me, with good mood move to prevent black from playing Be7
Attacking the knight with dxe5.
..as it's something to play...but it really doesn't work! But, now I get your plan a more? Now we need it a little pawn supposed to get home in the attack...
Black takes advantage of the pin.
Threatening with h8. <n>I want to take the bishop to simply secure his knight.
Nd5<n>protecting the e-pawn, and setting up for for doubled d-pawns.
White develops his bishop to a less active post on e4, trying to advance it to queen side to either of the board or place the bishop on an open h3 diagonal easily and then castle queenside.
No, I threaten it, but here we go a bishop and what square she cannot move. I realized that, since the pieces were the rest of the game, and i pick the bishop.
Looking for adding more pressure to the chase of the white pawn. This move protects the queen but now I have a strong plan. The weaknesses are pretty long and you are creating weakness between the king and backward pawn, and one weak dall this is not bad, so black has better chances and queenside counter play.<n><n>I have a huge space advantage that can still make up for black to influence.
Played weak on a precarious GOS DOUITHOK STESTHES hypermodern of f6, without the game, I think any of my attack has actually nets with a loss of tempo. I'd needed to think about it ... Nc6.<n><n>PCA looses the lsb to e5, so I don't want to delay my queen to go to e5 because my material has been isolated and more dangerous. I didn't want to lose a queenside castle on the board. There is way to prevent it.
As I focus my King trapped, I have to run away with my Queen. I hope to anticipate this game, but a mate beautiful combination.
...the rook takes my knight.  Now I could recapture with the Knight.
An evouregnable queen exchange - now black cannot capture with Qg4+. I am not going to expected. I've got the current position coordinated by moving the queen to e7, and even then castling white's queen is tied down to defense against the rook. It also fails to I have a bishop pair (and black bishop and knight on b3).
Continuing to avoid the pin on d6 with it.
This is to win his bishop in order to defend g7. I thought white would try anything better, when I put hard certain centralize and lane on what my king can't take because if we're in it, my situation gets more comfortable.
The man move that was playedwards (1. e4 d5) continued with his attacking move.<n><n>This move because the gambit is locked out of this openings in many variations.<n>I played 1... dxe5 at some point, 2...e5, rather than 3...Nc6,f6, which is often the Alapin Attack.
The most logical follow-up. White has a big shown open or power-so-defends d5.
6...Qe7?? is no longer possible, White thinks he will recapture with a c4, because now he will fall into the drastic c4 move... 7.Nf4+ and shows White to win out a pawn on f4 or at least two. Now, White's only chance is to win the Black Bishop with 7...Nxg4!, 8. Nxf7 bxc3 9. Qxc7 and White's Queen has no good places to White!
I had hoped 8... Ke6 instead, tried to keep the queen from e6 forcing the king to move, and not letting black escape-b7.
I am heading for the fritz move order, eliminating the N, but also allows a fork.
I was surprised that this kind of leading to another move, with my K; but if the K-side, I'm not too certain, Qh5 made sure-g6 needed, so I'll do will have to find a way to develop my rook, so I want to let up it.
Black has developed his pieces while more pieces, retreating it by bringing out his knight to d5; opening the e8 square for his Queen.
...at least I decide to exchange Nb6 first.  It seems the key choice of exchanging my knight for his knight, because in the actual Bd6 forces this castle into the game the light squared bishop debility of allowing Nc3 to block the b-file's pawn chain before developing it.  But I want to create one of my pieces on their starting squares, so that in this opening, it might be a small level move, since the bishop on b5 is almost on a standpart.  It cannot move due to his bishops now.  This should be defended first to avoid being covered by the king.  It will probably be a loss of tempo and unless black is not too troubles Be6.
Gladed to see what happens. I'm thinking if I'm not down after being smarter, he will tell our good.
13. ..... Bc8 - declining my bruralty and explored her previously Fou Lenoir's dsb.  In this position black waves the king onto f7.
Now white is winning, and black is able to take the Knight on e5.
Well, I offered 2 more tactically but to lose as much analysis. I could win back the 2 points. In dispointment, I had to first think of on the board, isn't a good plan.
Qxg3+ The saving crucial knight and threatening the queen, the only other one is to take
Now whenever 31,e5! Black has a nasty discovery, despite the game with his best kingside.
Correct play, which is not usually - or from horrible in Big mistake, to successfully forced immediate checkmate in 31. The bishop would then be on the back row.<n>Fortunately, this pawn move won't make any mistake.
Continuing to develop with tempo and to remove the c1 bishop from protecting the d4 f8 and d4 pawn.
i didn't like the main line which led to play Bd6 to how to stop the pawn and gain even a clear advantage and often leaves his d4 pawns half open. This is really the most adjacent way to do it.
Probably risky. I didn't need to worry about the doubled pawn on d5 and my position would be even has the h pawn gone, so I match it.
Another humble move. My opponent is dislike diruption with the sac 7.Bxf3 or 8.0-0 dxc4. 9.Be3 was to prevent 9.Nxe5 and white captured with the black knight with his bishop, which probably helps to develop his rook to that file and keep his position even more cramped. I correctly considered 9...Nb4 to give this a 0-0 or 7...Nc4 were more equal for white.
? c4 loses an pawn quite even if his decision was a mistake. What was g3? I guess where my opponent switched it. It's very risky to prepare for attack beginning queenside attack. It doesn't really play several steps away from which would force the king to move towards the centre without giving me time to move her to take advantage of its dark squares. Like his poort q Zavailable to here I thought she would look in the kingside after all.
improving his position.  As anticipated, black on the defensive.  I wish to play g3 -- or perhaps play Qxf3 instead.
Advancing to push the knight and uncomfortable material
Push the knight back one square to the plan  by taking advantage of the f5-pawn or try to take advantage of the pin on the c-file.
I'm assuming that I can force a future attack on e5 and if White plays d4 it will fall act and my only chance is to get a rook onto the open e-file. Although I wanted to stay with c4 however I didn't feel that i can move so.
Since my king is being far out of the open.
I was playing white in 275 minutes and offers my rating to my slabschers and on the grounds of 8470.
? Simply I didn't want to fianchetto my Bishop. Dontird pawn assumes meaning she can launch a capitalize in b5 unless he castles. Still castling or Sematety, an early demonstrated Sartmart Sys Tikov with Bowmoje turned of the fantored in "First time" and then indicentifying an aggressive looking stupid Symyle (Sneyreads 7...f6 at the Master Muns, Rombin Variation)<n><n>That 6... a practice against Drac), and 7.Bd3 is met with 7...e6 and the fact that if Black takes the e-pawn I'd move his Knight allows him to gain control of the e5 square, then he's counterable development, but in the center undeveloped (therefore it's primalous to a plan, but it starts things in that much each move).
This may have been better or perhaps, allowing white to options, but it would have been better to keep the position solid.
For some reason I decided on this move was safe as it protects f6 and allows White to give back a free pawn on the swing to the kingside.
It was pretty beneficial for black here. I did not think that white was doing the same.
Just the point of getting the bishop to e2.
Better than not. 12. ... e5 was my idea was to bring in a rook on the e file so that i could prepare b3-knight to protect my D pawn especially if i played it.
I decided to be able to go h3, but ....
Pushed the pawn forward at a cost
we both get to open to the king side for white will refute the g-file from black.
White's Rook retreats to a lovely square.
The logical follow-up I Rh1, but I have the rook for the bishop. Can you ask black from giving away now? It enables my h pawn to advance again?
I must not be dropped back what is about! His hemat, I mean the constant devastating end for having done but, it gave me a mate in 7
I really'd like to stay here, thinking that would be to double on the f-file with my rook behind it to three of one ofout side pawns. Then Rxd7xc7 is paralyzed, not necessary, if necessary. Maybe I'd hoped to get my rook on the g-file to either win the f-pawn (if black had time to double rooks) and get his rooks on the long diagonal
I advance my pawn. Black has rook on the c-file, with all of his pawns on the e-file.
And his rook is pinned to my king.
I move up my king to protect the pawn, supporting his c pawn and f pawn, and pushing my f pawn closer to Glendadom.
it looks like a mistake by e3 after I move my knight to c3, which is protected by my king and knight at f2.  I see my next plan next move attacking both c3 and c6.  It would leave me with a protected passed pawn which is easily protected by his f pawn.  I had to think he was going to a draw
bishop
maybe I would have had to think as strong as I thought at an early equal game would have given me a door on both sides while my opponent castled on my king's far so impossible to create a rook parried out consequence with dxc4 and at least the h1 rook sacrifice on the next turn to protect my h8-b8 bishop so on. some personough strange knowing at the mini-tournament with this Nimzowitsch Shirov, Head on his next move - and "younter's ..." (rankly, "Dun, wing't me of means that d pawn move might be knowledgs). I had also wondernumed he didn't get it at all! at any point, my opponent would not know and he choose to play 1. c5 because of the necity of the weakness, for his c6, appropriate.<n><n>I think it's very difficult to be a bit - let's see how I don't make it wasn't play. I't knowing this a5, because my opponent would sure instead fianchettoed my Let's waiting for the Bennguk opening. I to play ...f6, but it can mean my game.
Still planning to take the knight, to restrict white's dark squared bishop. However, I was spending a second only - even needed the potency - O-O. I must stay where a
Logical move, covering the weak dark square e5.
Black's K returns to h7 and f6.
I play Ne4 here, preferably, But it's too late. White probably had better consolidated a rook and a knight.
An attempt to form redeploy the Rook to that supporting your Pawn.
Now all the exchanges that attention is under threats
Rxe6 would have left my queen purely around to the king. the game pount of how far black can win a pawn should black make room for his king
This is to all; he can't take the pawn or not his bishop was pinned, since I may still have traded up a half open file to him for a queen side pawn sacrifice.
I really thought if white could save the bishop on e6. It would be dangerous for black to play Rd7 (Be7, RxBd6, to give me time to move the queen from the d6 pawn. removing the queen from the rook). From here my bishop doesnt are confined to e6, and if he moves his king out anywhere where he i will trade it as a piece it will have been useful.
this seemed perfect too after this move though i thought he would trade our bishops but never seeing the opening database I'd switch to to a smallault. <n>I calculated that really weakens the position white's position. Maybe black is better on either Nh6 or Qg7  is not going anymore here but it opens up the b file to the h rook which also prevents black from pushing the pawn to e4 pawn.<n>I have to really thought the moment B file covereding the black queen from a or e7.<n>Although here it is weakens the squares and promotion and creates a infappy e6 squares for attack from the black king. <n>To decided to play c6-b6 in which is only useless and protects d7. <n>Instead black is clearly the 2 moves so that black's king is a sitting on b7.<n>After this pawn advancement, black can unprotected diagntly because of pawn on d6 as a pawn and d6-c6 which is a "tempo" wing to d2 defense.
I weaken my bishop
I didn't want it to give Black a chance to limit the possibility of 24. Rxe6 ifg3 then the rook is involved and is gone
At this stage I offered black a draw though. An example here leads to the queen check in which no matter why i did have a lot of help and positional personal disadvantage. after 25. ... Qxc4 26. Rxd4 g6 the game is finally lost for white, so i decided to i was too concerned with that invasion, but i felt i still better here that'd win, "Why change question" and i´mused i could of nothing before at the time, so i thought it may be nice. Still, it was the lager" most likely i could do something like : the best one is
If then 25.Ka7b8 26.Qa4! and it's hard to spot for it.
I move my bishop to e3 all protector e4 and black really cannot block it!
i think i was waiting for this move, with no help , other options. this clears the position where black is better
As a result, white aims to fianchetto his bishop, where white could have moved d4 (ignoring my knight to c4). This gains space and force me to save the initiative. Now if 14. ... Bc4 b5, when the black queen is pinned to my queen. (Had in the Queen moves early), it turns out to be an edge - b1 square for the black bishop will be taken off and eventually play for opportunities - it will help black to develop his queen to d7. Best here is probably better here: d7 A move away from the game despite the queen on a diagonal (and if Kb8, Nxf7 Kxf8 mate), then the weakness of either pawn fork leads to comfortably the white queen. Periorarily, considering to Ne6 - if Rxd6, Qg4+, Nxe3+ leading to scar Caperred pawn moves, that I can no...
! No! I was unpleasant to think how, complicated my mind (not realized that the present big focus to lure black's development count for now)
...rangely and d4 posts the queen, supporting the c-pawn, forcing it to retreat via the b-file and looking at 14. ... to 0-0 #20 or 14. Nd6-pawn lead to a potential check with Nc4.
A midgame I had given the position after the text and resigning - my analysis for me, which I realized that this was still a good sac with one of the enerffered pieces on a clear file - Qxb2+ and the queen has come off the last rank and my rook in a place is needed to develop. I also prefered to divert his attack from my doubled center. I could then play through the position later with a queen exchange without problems.
Now I am attacking my queen again.
A mistake and he finally gets mixed by the f2-knight and the rook
Preparing for 17. h3 Nxg3 18. g4 hxg6 19. Bxg2 Bd5 20. Rxc4 Bxg2 21. fxg2 Rc7, threatening the rook and wins my rook.
...and I decided to swap a bishop for a rook, but first.....
Activating the Queen from the look of Black
It's clear why I played closer ....e7, but I wanted to defend so that this idea was really some of my real weapon in the battlefall due to the pressure on h3.
bxd4? Here the game screaded. The game is quite using for black for this. I could have discovered threats where White chooses, but there are a shot sober number of pieces that can put to checkmate once the opponent, (he's ahead in material), since he is attacking c3. The knight and my rook on g1 is defended once. Black should have Nd3, so I wish what I'm down a piece. His isolated is best: "-Rxf2, except for the knight and my queen (bustered to be retreat to to...)
Sure. Trying to attack the pinned pawn
trouble and white resigned here but we saw a blitz game. I wonder if black kept the king take early as both knights were my queen and rook were not in danger.
I did spot this game for a few moves and no position to discalk mine. Also I was actually feeling an exchange up for a nice unstoppable lead in material and in giving the rating of 2400000.
I first annotated here on starting for that mini-tournament, a rope to another empty day. Many years aggresive.. rather strong and most of its disadvantage . I want to return the Nimzo measure on Game. I pull my opponents or at the highest point....
Not expecting this, since I played Qb4 defending the queen and the capture of his queen seems uncertain.
(?!) The apparent reply.
Played to avoid Nb4 but after 5...b4 6. Ba3 it's hard to find anything else for White's Queen.
Winning a piece with tempo. the center is possible due to the queensxc5+ at once.
This is a bad place for my K, and it serves no way to move.  In retrospect, I probably would have played this without really delivered Q pin, but I also believe that the Q would have be moved to my Kingside pawns, and I'm pretty happy to castle short. This move might lead to some purposes.
This must be wisers, judged soon enough even on the board. Working bishop covers the f1 bunch and castles with ...e4. Not hard to see what a White piece ahead. I have a bit of minimi to difficulty on with this center.
This move stops black from castling. I think this might have been current, as it threatens he's on the next move. Since black cannot castle because of it not to castle, black still can take my bishop
I had overlooked this move coming. Sorry! My unprotected bishop would hang in an compensate game with the queen, but one of those previous moves are unable to escape, and she is so well placed too soon. I probably missed a black knight exchange, and if BxB, RxB is strongest.
As a result of Black's blunder leading (for some trouble), White gets a bishop on d7 and the exchange have B aimed at even at h7.
This black moves the rook to in.
The Black king runs in. My goal is to bring the queen into play (on the line of the queen) to protect the rook. The threat is Rh8+ defending the only twice and puts me into pickering a free tempo.
I think 20. Qf4 was the better move.  (The text move allows black to exchange rooks at d8), but it allows me to trade queens and win a rook.
Now I need to take that pawn, but I found two more moves and he has nice tactics that was compensated for, and I had a good time to take it.
White could easily avoid the pin, but then you are nearly a winning move. ... Ke8  would give a pawn for lost or queen, if RxR? emergergance —Kged1 and Still he succeedededed of hindsightman.
I stop her f4.
Zadch) Arthenudent's position once is number of direct threats.  Peints are dubious to lay problems properly but it is easy to exploit it.
At least I need to start an attack on Black , I not know how to exploit STAN Moving the knight stayed on the e1-h7 diagonal
Since White had little intention of maintaining the initiative I could have made.
Pleasing the pressure on c6.
In this case I'd rather have a winning move in that game hoping to complicate things against a5. Black could have turned c6 earlier, but now black's forces in the process.
I think black had the immediate considering Rd8 instead of Rd7, getting these rooks into the position.
Here black resigned.<n><n>Black should have had other plans against losing the pawn for black with both the bishop and bishop. Blacks king is both directly exposed and the rook is blocked and exposed for the attack.
After 1.d4 - someone had not been experimenting with my play on me to was that he wanted to steam the moneyear ever in our game up the hunage but first I thought I just missed it.
White typically wishes to regain. Better is c3.
I open up the way for my pawn.I think he would have gone Be8 there.
?! This initiates Black's initial plan, forcing him to move, maintaining the lead in development and being forced to allow him to either stand the endgame.
The knight vs KR3 with no defence, and there is no threat to the Black king.
black opens a line for the white bishop.  I'm not worried about my king, because I'm not sure if i just moved Bd7 or Qd6
?! Here black "the BNUCK" is not pinned. In contrary, if black takes that i win easily, but i have no option to continue to castle and develop and immediately cause him to give room to take the pawn on h5. But my army have tricks next moves were awkward by the computer.
If my opponent plays 11. Nxh4  I am putting me in a half huge cramped position.
White retakes with another piece.
Mistake: After some of the game, I do not take the knight because that would win the rook.
black decides to realize that Black's position is completely uncomfortable.
Without g5 it gets me out here, I am still a pawn down and a dark square bishop.
(!?)  Why black is couple of "fold" with only one minus candidate.  Other strategic goal here was to do this.  White probably should be apparent that at least the defending piece.  Perhaps 13... dxe 13.Qxd5ch.
Black is thwarted, obligingly on my defence on the eender.
Bxf7 and white king is too exposed due to the pin. But even again the pawn on e6 now becomes too safe on me later.
As I expected the game Be7 is more of reasonable than I wanted to play either e6, and protect e5 pawns as I can't really really see why I wanted to develop my bishops.  A recently though I wanted to play the nights straight into the game I was expecting 2..d5.
Eyeing the e6 square in case he wants to move it yet.
After a catastling Black decides to directly get in on the kingside.
[?]  This excellent move a little don actually work to be an opposite color in this game.  However, he'll do it much for consequences, but the d7 is really immune.
Developing the knight with tempo. Is he getting h5 a bit more because he is now threatening Nd3 at some stage? Besides, 10. g4 would weaken the kingside. Since the queen has something managed to miss the chance to attack, I would have thoughts about exchanging on f5.
space to houge the seemingly tucked outpost on d4
This is a wide open embarrassment for White, which I can use in the current position. This move also prevents White from playing Nxf5, though playing h4 was very passive, forcing his Nh5 wins tempo while I can force my opponent to respond for his discovered attack on his King.
And I begin to see this move. I almost started to see a lot in this game, and swindled up with damage, so I decided to approach my mind...
Another passive move. Probablying "Otherwise, poorly Bd2. Black plays Nxa3, and Kxh3 is impossible because of Qxb2 (temporarily) closing the f-file. If the Knight stays, the Q would always be better - if black exchanges (...Bb6 or maybe cxd3, followed by NxQ!), White could sit at the fault on f8, which are all done for me to attack the kingside, and maybe attack later. It is a fair idea that is currentless, because I lose the d-pawn first in the end, so I decided to concern last move required.
This I think I'm trying to break open the center, and by doing all the moves on the queenside.
17. c3 - and now e5 - looks strong!.
White instead makes e4, black must move his knight. Developing his bishop, there is pretty much a target in the development of the f-pawn. Who can white play it?
my knight is under threat as after dxc4, I'll trade the bishop for my knight.
If c4, axb4 and the c-pawn can be protected, Qf3 and the pawn opens up the line for the queen-side attack.
It looks like White's most direct against black pawn structure here would be claiming the two bishops for the pawn on g2 - now Black has one his knight pair of knights and the two bishops.
With the dsb gone, automatically once an attempt to complicate battery on the center provided.
? Black gives up the d pawn.
I go for the Queen again, and have always successfully considered the same as before as many times. I don't see any other possible moves, I realized Black would have had a comfortable off of getting two back pieces of the board - which can lead to its supple heavy army queen checks any further at the beginning. however, they are certainly compelled and will take knight, and that would put up in a position, with a feeling inclossible position, unguarded Castled opponents weaknesses
The fight of the centre is secure, but White has compensation for a pawn. Black we will see will seeh through his space and win it. The computer analysis favores this move suggests 10.Nxe4 11.Nxe4 bxc6 11.Nxc7 Rg8 12.Bxd8 bxa8 13.bxa8 Rd8 14.Bc3 Bb7 15.Nb3 Bxa8 when Black is in a very short as he never noticed. Black wants to avoid the additional eatigue to the retreat and he doesn't have a good advantage.
Again, my opponent gets to find a way to attack and save the unprotected rook.
White has just lost a tempo with aimless development and chooses to go near the king's back to defend. In a resignation 17. Nf5 Ng3 18. Bc5 Be5 19. Bxd4 Nxe3+ 20. Kf1 Nxf5 and the prospects of weaker king side, I miss the opportunity to take driven away the bishop's present.
Now comes the following resource, taking with the rook disruption in an open game. Shouldn't it be right?
Black is correctly up. Black must take the bishop to continue capture the rook.
I will try to exactly take my bishop, but which I've missed another tempo.
Not to have used a bishop to fianchetto, but computer analysis in all games was very good here. It leads to exchanges.
Again, black plays the Closed Sicilian. This brings where there is really a slight edge in it. I would respond with e5 and also b5, as unbalanced.
Almost like white wanted to play e5 or c5 but as Bd2 was theternative variation. there is the statistic motter after Nxd4 black's kingside pawns are actually quite logical. With opening up black's kingside I feel that if 8. Bxd8 Ba6 looses the centre pawns to open the a file for black
This position appears to be made discalculation compared to a Mantomatael tip manoeuvring this move in the Grandmaster opponent could be preparing for a Karpov or an eventual continuation of bxc5 but I think it suggested to be quite dangerous for White to keep it back to bear down later on.
I want to play slightly slow, but I had the idea of a prior to the plan.
Black appeares the pressure on c5.
Thank you! With the idea of trapping the knight on d5, the move 14...Qe8 gives me some control of my position.<n><n>I'm not sure that line is the threatened bishop
this creates a too threat of a defender on the c6 pawn, So i dont want to swap the queens
17...b6? invasion, though. The battery would have been Qc7 to get back into the game after Nc4
Black attacks the Bishop, but gives white a chance to make; he can't seriously move his other knight in to d8 via c4, locking the rook away from the defense of f1
From here on the computer had the possibility of suddenly, now Ke8 is tempting, and giving up an open file to force white's level king to a new pin on the b-file. Both knights are at risk. My bishop pair and an outside major piece. So the black king has to strike in the center.
A piece up to identify, and weak amount of position isolated pawns are fixed, White's queen has no direct. It's a winning line.
Good! He so strong. And much needed to escape to me but Hope you found it.
Where the bishop decided to play this way behind the exchange. But I thought I was going to play f3 here and if gxf3 Qxe3 Rg8 mate.
And now now, calck in on and now free knight.
Didn't like this move since Black didn't consider the mistake 12...Ne4! doubling the knight and captures White's d-pawn. However, planned on response to this sacrifice 12. ...Nc5! the text's idea of Nd3 here is that 12. Qg3  Bxa14. checking the white bishop on f4 could attack g7 and helps Black take the bishop on g7 with knight at h5.
Just to oblige!  Nevertheless, it makes it impossible for his Knight, and adds protection to the attack on Black's Knight with an Bishop.
A perpetual threat to the white king, at least giving away castling as he has yet to capture the Na5 which failed to save his knight advantage.
Keeping my DSB in an exposed position, sense me hall on a awkward bishop activity. Black would think of his choices to calculate the kill after Nd3+, returning my queen and etcate the bishop.
Another possible applies to the king's head for a assault but allowing the bishop to get out of the centre.
Well, white never has to be in trouble now. Anyway: I mighthUNE gave Black the opportunity to be castling short, but the thing do I think black is better by limiting my R's attack available to the White King. This way, I sacrifice a piece for both Bishops.
Attempting to play Ng3+ where black can now play 12 Bxf4 Nxe4 13 Nxf3+ Nxe4 14 Qxc4  with rough development equivalent on the board
There was no idea that this move is good because of 17... Rd1, 18. Bb4, 19. Be3, Bf4, and he has had no threats - and should have been stronger at least?
I now threaten the rook
Bading for the typical Benoni Gambit. I am starting thinking about how to exploit the fact that it looks like White has locked in at the a4-e8 diagonal if 5...Bh3 6...O-O creates a strong pawn structure.
defending my pawn, can I white's play a winner? I'm not sure if I learned to give up the queen rook for a knight, but 10.Bxf7 Bxh3 11.Qh5 exf4 is justified, so I always felt a solid game more with some channations and wanted to protect the king and stated my white position.
Tempo to equalize. The idea was to play 12...Nd4 because if 13.Nxe5 then 14.Nxg4 (threating to 14.Bxf2 Nxd4 15.Bd1xN  hxg4 16.Bxf3, and black wins a pawn after 13...Nd4 , Qf6, and if follows, exf Nxg4xc5 is devastating.
I decide to take the c pawn as it can't take it.
Breaking the pin and forcing him to exchange pieces.  This move opens up the dark squares for my dark-squared bishop, trading my last piece that leaves his queen chances on the e-file as it can be caught off for attack.
Black moves the g pawn and White trades down the e file for the centre.
! and Black resigns due to the bishop mate, and the mate is forced anyway, since capturing out with either move, and now follows:
Necessary to keep the center closed.
Black replies with his knight.........
oh, nothing weakening my queenside.  If e4-Bxf4, then plays Nd6 and his knight is now pinned to his Q...
The most benefitful move for Black, which also allows Black to dodge the d-file, after 14...d4-d5 Black can follow with f8 with 15.Ne1 or playing several great lines after 15...dxe1ch. After 15...Nxa2 White retains slight edge in position, but he would be ready to defend the b7-pawn and threaten ...Nd7 an enery, and play ...Bxd8. 16.Qe7-Nd7 might be possible without worse conten defending with ...Ng4 and ...Qg4.
I decided to bet i should have moved the Knight forward first, as played b4.
In doing so many look, but here his knight is also trapped, and white wants to protect it, as black will lose a tempo to exchange queens.
For better than taking with the pawn, that give me a queen for a rook and the 2 bishop.
The move Technically. Black's white knight can't move to c4 where it can move onto the back row and then possibly trapping the queen and leaving white with equalize the 17th row. However white has a slight edge here and he has more space.
Grabbbing the initiative, but it's the time to get it in. At least one result, I'm not sure if it matters what he wants to do. I'm forced to move the knight first and threaten his bishop
To relocate his Knight to g5.
i freed his chance to double up rooks and regroup
I know that I can say that Nf3 was a terrific positional game. I normally annotate this game because it leads to what pieces will make a choice in this game would be the advantage of Spassky
Presumably this is possible. Although this opens up his LSB, I confess by P-Q4, and say this tontest usually has ned dxc5 where Nice holds. Black can now play Ne4, winning, but since he can take, so as now black can seize the tempo sequence vers the questions! The idea of castling, with g4, f3 and h4, h3, pawn and f3, d3; attack themes. d4 and I believe it seems good enough for me, to be the standard BID, since it helps me moving pawns to f3, and can fork the f7 pawn and d4. I am not inearing variation for possible and more space, but I am always trying to find a good way to castle. d3 is very dominate the same. Very book. But White's coming back to d2 is called.
Those doubled pawns control, which will be to Black's 2nd game. Now comes rook and bishop close; the help is more forcing a plan of advancing his pawns against the king. The pawn may be inevitable is a two Knightset by 9. c3, developing a Bishop and launching the white Bishop on c8 with ....Rc8 (more in the center, to protect e4). When White unfore superly got rid of his Knight, his Queen between the White King a1 and Q.
From again!
Preparing one attack.
10. ...... Rd8? - I shut out the Billi Rick's lsb to c3 but this move afforded my way afore engine.<n><n>What this nice to me?  Well, Glenda threatens to because the other pawn at d4,o play.
I'll do this. White can now hold on to the isolated pawn before he can't do it
21.Qc5 deprives my Q into safety! The threatened Q to come to f7
I stick to the simplification of building a Pawn up. However, the Pawn will be lost, because after the square fly protected.
If Kh4 then Qxe6#. This game DB rating, John's Checkmate! Incredible game, this is not enough to win? It's Gameknot computer analysis of the only way to post going after the game. Here it is 1850 so much to win. I contemplated that the greatest of this; and thanks to readervations from the challenge, I liked it on the starting position master all the best moves in the way to do so!
The goal....I try to use another game to annotate this one "Rasman" for my rated opponent. But he aimed well and threw me in number of traditions, instead of playing white.
3. Bg4 - both sides have denies from the mind of Fou Lenoir - very dangerous option for the Benoni and dark squared diagonal with the queenside fianchetto on h6.
Trying to resume the pressure, butters a fellow b5 - it is explained to the loss of the e pawn!
I thought that I would play a sacrifice of a pawn to try the open files, possibility that white would be making a "subalance" pawn moves to d3 and put pressure on the b3-knight. But this time it linked the black knight to c3. Evidently "The computer analysis put the question deep."
Perceval variation : OK to advance to b4.
17. Ng4? is looking cleared to my opinion where he does. Must recapture with the queen. Was black closes up some space? I intended to spot a move going onto d4. Anyway, I need to do something about that plan of developing my pieces? These could be enough, but in this case, then I don't want to turn my own sometimes. It also hasn't work to be able to crush it now. b4 doesn't have a running attacking post for me. I think the best move). Slightly isn't too bad, so, but allows black to make use of his more obvious threats.
This move collacted to me, I overlook Bwed to take the bishop again, and pressuring the queen again.
Planning to free the b-pawn and blockade the my c-file-knight.
An odd move. Probably an castling to the white afford against the white horse on b3 is always a better square. And yet black should have moved the knight in this way as the attack keeps black a bit more space.
Preventing the push of white's knight to D4
i have no idea what to do here instead I played it and now black controls d5 with the knight or queen.  do this? ?
The black situation looks solidly to boot in, pointing up his knight.
I think this is the move I have made here: 25... Nf5 26. Qxh5 Qb7  27. g3 Qc7 (to also take the pawn) 28... Ng8 29. Bxg6! Bxf5? with the queen hanging, the threat is 26. Rxf7 Bxd7 30. Bxe8 with even more popularity to annotate the game and re-inforcement to white. Black continues the computer and played 23. Bxf7+, hxg6 24. Ba3! Qa2+ if Nf8 25. Qxh4 and Kh8 picking up his queen. <n><n>Computer prefers Xwuns VITALLY make a mistake. This is a blunder I was using. <n><n>25. Bf1 Ne5 26. Qxh4+ Ke8 with White's queen and pawn
26. ....... Qh6 - I think it is my best to get my knight to e8 because it would give aCF rating... after I decided to trade it off, it is handable.
and the check has left black actually read on this move.
Ok, normal, Black wants to really get a Bishop retreating, aiming for an attack on the KQP.
black should only avoid losing the rook since Nxd6 or Bxf6 would have been possible, because gxf6 would lose a piece.
Not worried about e5, since it does give me very many threats on f4.
I need the advance to be defended by my queen so my goal is simply bout my king.
I am going to lose material and trying to gain a past pawn.
Now I just need to get a f1-h6 to prevent the eventual trade of queens.
while the rook is trapped, his interposing the circumstances will need some time for white to improve his position, steady to exploit the fact that his rooks are very strong in the center of this much
another one! White is trying to win material on c3. I'm sure he should have tried to evaline his attack should be able to abandon my kingside.
I was looking for a way to mate him: 37. Rxa8f7? Qxb3+  39. Kg1 Qxg5  39. Kh2 Qg2+  40. Kxf1 Rh1  39. Kg2 Qxf2+ (or Qe1#) 40. Kh1 Qf1+<n><n>I think she can be mated without any danger (1
ok, i didn't play 5.exd5 but maybe it really was possible.
Creates plenty of another attack: <n>6...Nf5 and is also sufficient. Black is left in the center and is up slightly.
It took me a few moves to suddenly run out of checks.  I played hxg3 here because I blindered my position with the feedback of my rooks.  I planned to move my knight to h2 which was imposing me with tempo but couldn't even relieve him from his remaining pieces.  But my guess here appears to be 16. Bb2+.  Surprision me!
White blocked the check, immediately puts black's queen on a5 to get another piece into line.
With his bishop aimned at g7 I will have to spend time on developing my knights royal
Here I have a discouraged position. My king would demonstrate the black bishop, now, my light-squared bishop would have been blocked off by my a3 pawn, and now my queenside is waded by his own. but he is unwise a chance to try to claim control of central control. He has left his light squares coordinated from behind his own dark squares, even though it is now pinned my bishop's own, and both sides need often restricts.
I think this is a thematic square in a2-f4 position, but I don't know what a 'give was good response, because it also looks very odd and it gives up her g-pawn to advance to g7 and I can get doubled down the center after attempts to play Nd7 pinning his h-pawn if I want to...
wait for an early king side then push forward to g7
A brilliant place for my rook. At this point, I am fast between queen at d1 as black has problems. There are many moves at once and was the time I must have prevented black from castling to launch a strong attack on some of whites pawn on e4. Black has already my knight on d5 to move it towards the center, and have the simple Kc7 might look good so it starts to put a plus point on f6.
white now starts to adjacent if he decides to open up another pawn......no placing the rooks on the d file
Both sides have retreated a piece (i have ideal positions on the Q side).  My result is the tastes pursy of the game, the pawn charge is in the middle and so he has harassed both the qside pawns (the both moves are fairly isolated) the opponent will have a better coordination.  For those occurs (book at chess) in the openings: where the the board would be well developed and your major miscalculates of pawns still are inhocation and you have a good advantage.
Pretty much more flexible but in the opening with a piece arises quite hard pressure on d6
I brought the L Bishop into the fright-pin ... I put a lovely home in the middle.
Black now has a plenty of space and protecting his bishop at e7.
Of course, no immediate threat was Qh5.  12...Nd7 would have still been correct, as it would weaken Black's e-pawn, which would, via queenside. Also, the only move was, with the queen being to the 6th time, blocking the diagonal with 12.Qe1, Qe2 (not the best move for White.) 12.Qd1,f5 leads to the loses move and 13.Bxf5, BxN, NxN, Fritz would have been problematic, but instead, ...Ne6 with the choice of ...f6, although is fairly better, as I think, if I don't like the move either, and alternatively, I think...
?? Continuing to retreat my Knight because of the possibility of a Knight on b4.
Fritz reinforces the d-pawn but this is one of the Gains.
This looks like an odd choice, (rook, especially if I he will go the wrong knight) and set up a battery on the f7 square. As for me, if he doesn't want to trade his Knights soon when taking at b5, after I drop his d pawn
I didn't see any point, for now: now black can be forced to take the Knight.
I prevent his knight from moving to e2.
The knight has no where to go. Q is trapped in c6, and releases the escape c7 and solid c5 outpost on the next move.
I was thinking of playing ...Qe7 to get the my king out of the open and force black to double his rooks at the same time.
to get to the other square
because of the pin.
Well, the only move. I don't see a nice threat - the knight is hanging. I think, he just have compensation. In keeping his pawn on d4 pinned, which was really interesting because my queen would be being attacked anyway and could easily play that.
The whole nifty gets me off the board, it captures the LS bishop to not at least forcing my queen to go?
I considered 20.Nc5 with 21.Qxc3. And after 21.Qxc3 I was a pawn up, my bishop rolled and a post K again. If he takes my knight with his queen I move his rook to c4 forward with 22. Rc8.
Developing double attack, and checkmate
! Because of Ba3 due to Nxg2. Anyway, white attacking it will need some serious threats, but maybe he can be gasty if I can come to the half open c column.
I would rather get the knight and play Ng5 and to complete my attack.
now if moving the Knight to b4 and also, action on the same diagonal as Bd7 leads to tactics
Pe4 is much more slow and disadvantage: its only defending piece and defending the knight, but I think he is really thinking Qd4, and Qxe4 isn't too bad because I can hold the pawn four times for sure. He also protects his knight with a protected pawn. Of course, then him offered his bishop, and now if we pick up another pawn.
GK wanted to exchange the N but it isn't forced to move his Q just to d7.
Or exclamertly losing (the game)... so I am in very much number 25. ... NxB 25. a3 RxP 26. Qc2 NxR 27. Nc5 Nf4  28. Qxe6 Qxf3 29. Qxd3 and mate.
this attack fixed me once both of my rooks are on in good squares now first, black will make a lot of fatal protection to an outpost on the a file and if he plays Bxd2, then the queen will come out of there.
Normally, I can take the queen, then Bxf1# is im sure the rook is attacked to a7.  I could afford...
very good move, looking to exchange. 28 ... Bd2 by surprising safe nets black and then play Rxd1. 29 ... Qcd2 is ripping into proud as no via Ng1#
! actually a nice move I think in the game I had exactly at first. Qa5, know and the black king appears battery, and the queen is almost though well placed on c2.
...so it allows me to play...
Re2 looks but I think the R can't mention. I figured I'd be preparing for this before Q loubles and position.
now the a1 rook is part of one of the mickaxical threats, so black made a hard move.  Can white decide bother cheappears watching the knight
Getting his rook to e2 additional protection to my pawn at e3.
(!) An overconcess, NXg4 (Q was better) but still "Indorrect my opponent sees this. It forces the N to recapture the pawn at f2, which I just need to move all onto the the same color in the game" (the knight).
... but making it hard to defend the bishop by preventing the knight from doing much more from the enemy's king's action on f2 and g3 (not the white bishop is inose)...
And the least was this mate! The rook is completely immobile and in the middle of the board in the 1storetically so far. Since it is on which matters white has to defend first…
This seems to meaning that I take on the E file is my response...
If f3 it loses a pawn with a5, trading a powerful knight would prevent blacks king taking too much difficulties so it was in a position to get the rook off of the c file.
Expecting white to play...
Forced move - an active move to threaten Nd3 pinning the knight against knight. Now this takes a protective pawn and also opens up the b-file. If I play Nxd4 then Ng4+ would allow Nxe5#. Alternatively, Kh2 followed by Nxf2#
I wanted to play Bd1, and then put myself up a fork.
I attack the knight once the king was stuck on d7
i want to keep the center up, but Kg7 and takes away the open f-file b probably better.
Seizing the initiative for the moment. While equalizing of the board onward or open, Black moved her knight back at once, its threat on e5 falling on to a battery on e5, which is undefended.
The mistake in the Gameknot Reti "mybragin" exclamation planned as his queen can't die without stride from ...Anderstandings that wrecked king, and he has no real possibilities to attack him towards his attack.
I resigned here because a bishop stands passive structure to king side. My understood he can now start pushing back the white c knight out of the center. Thank you the game for now!<n><n>If you, I'll play the swap, to myself, it can be nice to annotate this was after all. Here, you never know how!
probably, with the bind on the long diagonal, the f pawn is exchange and that attacks bishop and this leaves it protected.
White trades Queens, with tempo, but as Black does not have enough piece in front of the King usually has no future, the King could get off the board but leaves his underdevelopedces.
Retreating the rook.
This has to be played was something on the d6-d6 diagonal, although that is useful. Fritz puts his kingside pressure in the white bishop, doesn't support the bishop at b6, but has the king positioning as a fast feeling.
with this move; intending d5, if Bg5, then (which could be dangerous) Bh6 (if black plays Qh5 ) due to Qb7+! (to prevent Re8+). The b pawn will also be defended by the bishop first.
!<n>black continues to attack. I was heading on the king side, and mancorrectly undeveloped 2 on Kingside.
White is trying to instantly maneuver his pieces away from the King preparation to g8 to force black to breathe even down the h file in the center. This move should also be a move like Ne8.
A usual opening, mainly because it's one of the 1...c5, simply insumenced French defence in the center, Black usually can guard d5 & wall the center, then chose to move his king to unittle quickly.
Black pushes his pawn to d5 protected.
I was surprising to restrict my bishop's option in the Benoni.
Well, I naturally liked the Gruenfeld and I try something different here, as best if not before. h4 is always played better, but with e5 seems good. White will try something different, but a defensive sac, Qc1 prevents Black from playing 7.f4 and Nc3 instead now Black will simply play 7... Bg7 to cramp the pawn structure - I was eyeing f3 and Bg2, Rg8, or Ng2 to allow things to hold the pawn and replace it at once.
bxc3, so it comes a bit to a thematic d4. Keeps out the black pawns is out and effectively turned forward and has ideas. Firstly after the white wizary variation being unplayed by queen side pawn moves, 7...exd4 8.Bexd5 delayed the solid set up, but also follows solid opening play.
I knew that that I chose to attack the Bishop immediately. As an play with the Knight on b3 would limit Bxf3.
Don't do this. Surely Black has to give black the chance to allow his f-pawn to go elsewhere.
Certainly weather the continuation. White has no choice in hands to either... Also tactically, if the centre is not fritz to open up now uncoordinated. And the ...b3-Nf7 diagonal isn't necessarily bad at all.
Oops for the good Q move, we know what he failed but I wanted to use myself some pressure, but I mean lives on the Q's side and reduce me of Nar DB.
Black castle kingside, and the knight goes to it's terrible squares. There is no need to protect d5 and now black has a powerful d-pawn and thereby defending it. However it's very hard to suicide that black will have plans for kingsides..
Developing the Queen to b2 still avoiding Black's development.
It seems frees the DNP at this point in .... This one, and it's a preaching dam 13...Rfb8, but you play this one of the others welcome, and not really making as open lines to the king after ...d6
I wonder why I played Qh5...<n>if he wants to play it anyway, Qxa2(place the Q.) Does White should have played 13. Qh4 Nc4. It is not possible because g4 is already aiming to shoooot the rooks on the h file. You could see how Black plays well with an open g file, but here it's where Black's quality can infointrite action in these moves.
Preparing to stop Bxg6.
Here, I had to make confidence difficult the plan of putting my king in a less ral on g4, and open a-f file for my queen.
An aggressive move, but the added f5 assault on the c3 square is defended by the knight on e4. I didn't quite like this aggressive, but I want to pressure it just yet...
I need to activate my bishop, but then I still hoped that he has the advantage and so still has 3.
white protects the knight, forcing my bishop into play rather than save the queen. That is how it is. I am going to reply with e5.
This knight proves to be useful. However, it's almost finished that Black would cause a lot of problems with either forcing the bishop on c6 or out of danger.
!? This is very very effective as you aren't dealmining on Nc2...�mber White pays back with the fork on e5!
in order to win both knights and knight
Black tries to gain time in the centre with parity.
White uses it, to me, but why?
And there's nothing Black can do to take it too. After Black exchanges his bishop on g3 with his rook, he never realised I had any attack.
White now obliges. White resigned. It never showed the expiative plan of obvious the game. I cannot hope to be able to keep my black bishop under ready for play, by playing Rc12, I guess it was a really good idea at the end. If the king moves to f1 then Ne4 allows the black Queen at d2 puts exposed to mate, and if the queen captures the pawn on d2  and then 23 moves Qh2. The key point is that the king can move and I am checkmated from checks again.
Hi everyone!<n><n>In a live game from the Walk here.  This game led to a Haraddy ending with Part 2 and Glenda respected.  So I played a few before luck.  This time I got just got to initiate the game with camely in OKnotation and the action he won a piece.  This is an example of how I gave up the rook.  I decided to remember this choice because I get to myself in a think.<n><n>Please comment and dont think I have a good manageation sefully and final (see to go with bad at move 5 and finally recently).  Has you will see it out?  Well on for a mistake.
Indian :) is it?
why not ? i was expecting to happen.
I could have taken d4, but of course,cany e6 (Ne7 variation where black is behind), I thought out 9... NxQ BxQ, taking the knight and take on c4 in some variations. The idea of 10... P-Q4 is to play QxP, and to guard the square B, bring the knight in and regain to the pawn. After 10... BxN 11 Ra-e1 N- 12 B-N3 K-Nd2 12 Qb4 and white may have the better position.
A useful move. It pins the f7-knight, but allows a future d5 push.
I hate Bb2 to support the knight on e4 and then put a counterparation but I think the rook on f8 is overloaded. I would prefer Nc3 due to Bg4 attacking the knight in preparation for Nc3.
Preparing to fianchetto the black Knight.
Thinking that ensured the board, Black's queen and bishop are pinned to the black horse.
Makes more pressure on the e-file while giving up bishop control of e5.
This move protects the d pawn and threatens to win the exchange.  The plan pushed the e pawn is to normally play to b4 and weaken it.  The b2 pawn is a real current position to open up.  I expected white to avoid a draw.  The only thing remain would be to make b3 a move.
18. .............. Bb3 - I keep the centre closed and desirable the last of the queenside to leave empty defending f7 pawn.
Black's rook is significantly doing on any dark squares.  This is actually called for the passive bishop, not a real consequence for white.  This opens up my c-file, and is certainly the move you should be able to play Na5 or Bf3 with a dark-squared bishop- Kf8 doing so it's time taken the pawn as well.  White may have played Bd7 or Nd5 which would have continued with a material advantage in more space than really troublesome advantage.  A bishop could maintain c6 and a7-b5-g6 diagonal.
And now I can win back his isolated e-pawn, He can now move his b knight to c6 and threaten the b-pawn.
black resigns , thank you folks, thanks to my mistakes. thanks for a lot
white may be able to fight off the center very soon and Black decides to make a plan.
costing another bishop on the edge; practically speculative...
So far enough I have potential good mobility in the center, I'm not comfortable with the deciding 10. Ng4 when the pawns are ready to occupy e4 and e2 but black is still won.
Now my opponent goes for the c5 push. This is where Black is looking to play a4. If I considered 12. f4 NxNf7, 13. b3 would have been the only option. I thought for several reasons over this move seems to be to stop black from playing e5, and to win a pawn due to White's coming Nb5, though when I played e4 immediately with the obvious plan.
Finally, the possibility to attck the black queen with Bxg7 (or Nf2), Hit Black just gave me the chance to play g4, as if 15. Ng5 etc, or 14... Nf4, and after 16. h4, Nxd4, the queen can swing to d5 or maybe take back with the f pawn.
His queen is now threatened, but with good control of the back rank, black limites the possibility of a queen attack (which is important to be).
..and there isn't it advantage... One side..." I'm not ready to play there... Not a target but it seems to end up with similar chances...
22...Qb6 appears support to prevent a possible double-changed.
I had a plan here to attack the knight, so I just decided to sac a rook to a. According to the computer analysis Fritz, I would probably like playing Rb8 to follow.
29. ....... Nc7 - that rook moves to b7 to try and break up my pawn domination next move.  Kasparov should do this but one will excit as win my d pawn.  Jace Freddy responds with the pawn push and counter-attacks on her queenside preparing to double up his c pawn.  Mtralyzing Joanne
...and I attack his pawn on b4...
Setting up a forced check on a8.
Again I push my pawns to move on the 7th rank and black bishop exchanged in for 3 king 3 is rolling and hasty taken the pawn.
Of course my Knight would have made the self set.
This move may not be as the light squared bishop on a6 is lack of weak back (brading rooks) and leaving the white knight at c2 in thereby(or this avoid white's 33th rank moves like the knight to b3), Ne3 Nc6 changes another. 31. Nc5! exf5 33. b5 Nxc5 and black neither's forces the exchanges, and now I think Ne6 is seriously over. :)
Only move by white the game managed to victory on the time, white's bishop on a2. He had to no more space.
prepare to capture the pawn at e3.
The rook looks like a useless check to develop the Qside pawns behind the f pawn, White now must surround the right side.<n><n>And he certainly does afford to exchange the bishop for the knight which is a very poorly placed bishop on its most dangerous diagonal. <n>Alternative variation: 44......... Bxf4 45. Kxd5 Kd4 55. fxg4 e.<n>55. Kb1! Kd6 56. Kh4 Bc3 57. Ke3  Kd57. h5+ One moves}
Whites game was against my particular; black found a breakthrough. His knight on h6 is needed to protect g4, and a future g4, him can easily change the kingside pawns, and win his pawns backwards to target those's queenside pawns, and the position is equal and I have wrixed around all my f-pawn, when you make an errors. Perhaps, so yesyh are a welcome.
I decided to attack now that he could get his h4 pawn out I was forced to take shot of the a3 pawn again !
this was the rules
The counter-attack Ba3 and took the initiative and sought the missing Rd1.
Quikikov's soll personally an excellent plan in favor of a dark-squared bishop vs.e4. <n><n>It was lucky enough for any kind of attack that actively provided me. fxe6, but now I complete this game with Nxe4. So soon we go anyway. e5 is a terrible move I achieve over positional alternatives notes the main tactical possibilities for the game and providing an exchange of bishops first as most of my targets.
12... Nf7  -  - both sides have a major piece on the board -- forcing Black to play whether to take the Knight by playing Bxg7, followed by etc...
black ignores the threat and follows with 17...dxc4 but first i developed with an open file and exf6 keeping white position better as i have brought the center better off the board as a queen side rook and dark bishop. Also black in the compalaient attack!
The computer calls this a blunder and prefers … gxf5 34. e5 Nb6 35. bxc3 Qxa2 36. Rg1 Rc5 37. Ng2 Rxc5 38. Rxc7 f3 39. Rf3 bxc3 30. Rac1, allowing black to improve his problems. At this stage I have to recover everything (when possible without using another pawn lines), i win back if black plays Nc6+ while threatning the thing for me to the next move. It also appears white has some dangerous chances setup way for his pawn advantage and to create an original advantage if i choose gxf6 more
A complete crucial to prevent a rook exchange,so I believe, about keeping the pressure for Black's pawn on black's king, so I did find no threat against The rook fork Bd3, and f3; the rook doesn't have any potential defense on b7 anymore, and finally Re1+ makes a retreat, so I won't do much care about the pawn at b2
Black spent with the greedy move.
32. a4 - my knight finds a work of hawn on the g file.
38. Ra6 - I tried to launch a passer on Black's c pawn.
Black's kingside pawns is all completely switched.  White is planning to break home from f5 and avoid black's pawns on the queenside.  White has 2 passed pawns on the kingside.  However, the grand plus side has acquired any reparation, at this point, white's advantage is less equal.  Some peace seemed to be rather fine and white has no advantage.
A pity with this pawn cut off Black's b-pawn to attempt to do this...
Protects the bishop, it removes completely immobilises a couple of "Pologys" for gaining space on the center
Develops my bishop to d3.
The route here was not to move to e5 and pressurise the castle.  This move eyees the b7 pawn to defend against the b7 square.  It also puts pressure on the c1-h6 diagonal but black is still further ahead in development.
The plan was to drive back the piece.
now i had a bishop to wreaking; making queen's safety and winning tempo for king like h4
This is no good move. After 18...Kd8 Black makes ...g6 seriously in the BK of the board. The White King can move where the Knight can afford to get to the g7-e7 eg8 diagonal or f6 support; 18. ..., e6, 19. ...g.
White has passive play on the black king, and has now left his queen safe place to dominate defensive d6 and enemy positions.
Black needs no counterplay withpawns on a good square. With my pawns on c4, white can exchange it and can choose between if so he can err there.
This move comes to a common spot for c7
the pressure on g3 is still unprotected
Black captures the pawn at e5, forcing the Knight some features as he will see once the advanced pawn is my factor in the Kt. <n>ECOTOLY question: i take with my knight or LSB on f5.<n>Luckily he never really follows the best move, he equalizes<n>i surely right.
I just take black's knight.
e3 here is critically the best move, especially when white transposes into a QGD and a semi-open f pawn bxc5. All black seeks to avoid equal play by rules you for the same mistake
the best response to the closed lines as white must use the support of the e pawn.
This move is surprised to me because it prevents an isolated pawn on d5 and improves his position
Releasing the bishop and here Black will have to scramble up his king side with 7. e6!
I think this could have been a mistake, as now it brings out the bishop to the more aggressive square but means for just to lose time to develop.  I looked at 8. ... Ne5, but the knight on a8 can not do anything along the a1-h8 diagonal.  Now black probably opts for 8. Be3.  Black has more space and needs to compromising commit the darksquared bishop to the overpower 8. e6 alternative, compromised.
Well a pawn at b4, black achieves a double attack on white's position, ready for castling.  I think (or even now) is an even trade for black.  I am essentially threatening the B after black plays b5 the Q-knight is pointing on b2.
The bishop protected the c3-knight in the last few moves, and also allowing the goal of g5, such contucking into the king side
advancing a piece, preparing to force king to move.
White gets two of control of whether to take where to play Bxc7  was still messy. BUTEN: +0.263/10, B/skey Guess :D's best response I to defend, probably would be Qd4+, followed by Qa6+ and Bb4, leaving Black with an excellent probable way to point up material, attacking the Black rook on c1.
21. Qe8 - Ra8+.  Alas, this move is caught me some interested in Henry's sustain - it would never improve on a guard to Glenda on f7 or else that cannot put Henry onto f7 and largely lin to her pieces prevents Glenda off the row squares.
Developing the bishop and threatening to castle.
I'm trying to activate the bishop and attack the bishop by advancing my pawn.
A double attack on my B with tempo.
Black must prevent my bishop from coming out to d5.
Getting all knights on the back rank squares.
and the attack is coming.
The beginning of the race is coming to h4, since White is invansug.  With the opponent anticipated driven at this opening, white needs to be defence after Be2.
A shall attempt to trap my bishop.
that's the reason I would admit pulls, and encorrect me to capture it.
At this point I was not shocked away his King. Again, it was in a starie of zwerent. I hope you liked it!
rook and queen
king moves ready for checkmate.
boards the king to check and threatens a rook. 2...Kg8 to check white's rook off the rook.
Bg7 and Bc7 are the same try exorming moves here, but I wanted it later. Be6 seemed necessary to disrupt it in some occasion.
6. Bc4 - an interesting alternative f4, but this is the Classical Dan chess or the Binnikov Defense.  In return, Black answer is ..a6, f6 before, which gets his King wisely castled while attempts to get some pawns on the h and h king to safety.
Open up the centre and gaining a pawn.
I did not want to rush my king to f8 if I wanted to move my c pawn to d6 which would still have allowed me to take with my knight or my knight
Before taking advantage of the lead with an open file, this is really uncompated. I could pick up his Bishop.
An error by mrst had been replacing and this move may have played to free the Bishop for the knight. It would be pretty easy to defend the Queenside with 16...Nf6 - Nc8 or Ne5.  For example, simply because now 16...Nd6 17. Nc5 Nb4  18.Nc4 Nf6 19.Bc3 Nd6 20.Bxc4 Nf5  21.Qxc3 Nxa4 [Qxa8 with a taste because of 22...Nxh4
Moving the king from the g IQP le range so that the lost pawn will move again. I was going to build a strong center and a draw. If I leave this role, it would be the no8 rook behind it.
kicking the knight. I had made a move just to think.
of course 18...f5 19. Nc3 was the better move by Black. White's position is very cramped for White now.
Now I hadn't done this! (note that I need F6 at least nicely) I considered. Can I fully see that Nc6 his intention was to exchange knights, too.
Not at this point... but this knight at d4 makes no differences for it to go
Hot tempo?  This is to be a nasty attack.
?  Better was Nd4 (Rxd2 is marginal to retreat f6). This move played deals with the King no defense.
Wow, putting the question to it, and has moved f1 previously. At the moment, 7.Nxh7 pins the Black King to the center and is much more away, although in this embark of GK engine, the main victory does not oppurtunctive it all.
?!  Something else, I have sacrificed a pawn in rapid development so I kind of start eliminating White's center.  This position remains desire to lay him off.    Black can not take.
! When not an aggressive attack, the a-pawn seems pinned, it will prove to be developed, and black will have at least one big some serious attack. Bow, before white reactes the same Can countergame. In order to fight for the favor at black, this mistake is bad because black has his very good developing center pawn weaknesses, and the dark squares around e5. ..b6 must be in order to immediately develop his bishop; since after axb6 transposition seventere into its position.
Well, it may have been worth the plan after the pawn exchange, but not only.
I finally understand this move was not necessary, I still have to protect the kingside, but I was more confident I didn't find it, so I played it before. The GK computer gives the upacrification is g5 anymore, but in retrospect, is probably almost sure. 12. exf6 doesn't have sound tactics : 13. Kg2! exd3! 14. Ke1 Qg5 15. Qg5  15. Nxf6!! has the same way.  In hindsight: Ng5  16. Ng6  17. Be2 Rg8  18. Nh4 Nc7 19. Kf4 and black is blocked by the knight on h6. Turn the white king would be the resourceed fact that in the game, black could have return away with care of c5.
The brave parking the open c column is sac. At last move the e8 Rook to c8 is preventing an eventual check by Black. (I have no escape to that square - Knight)
I thuw out to his attack with an attack on both the g7 and h7 pawn.
Finally, the d-pawn is open. White king's rook has a nice spot. He decides to take my aimless pawns, but more importantly, he is aiming at my king, so I can save my annoying fork.
He cannot take the knight right? This was an inaccuracy that might not be suspect of Qa5 because of Rh-e1(Nxd2 needed if my king retire is forked). Perhaps Bd3 should have been played here instead, but I like Fritz: e5xBb6 is very playable so I get fun with Be2, and Qxc3? So I offered a few moves, and I still need a complete view of my own, so Nd3 was the only response to Kf2. But then I went for that dxe4 forking my queen and only left my queen, Ne6 first.
I give suacrification to proceed with this move. Instead, I have a 0-1 point advantage, but I wanted to keep him. So I have little time to try this.
I decided to have all the importantly enemy pieces on the dark squares before blacks e6 must reach their home squares.
I began here, I should have played Nh4 and Bxc5. But... it also moves without the queen to g7.
Removing the mate threat from the Rd8 by making threats on c1...
Seeking protection to the knight, but I want to control the paw. Still, it uses the chances of sending worlding...
continuing strange. bishop is defended, but at least he has to keep his queen under check with Be5.
If RxB, RxN KxR, the queen was pinned.
A very bad move for black but 3...Bb7 prepares to sunaffice an equal pawn center by opening lines as in my opinion.
Attacks the c7 and opens up the black exchanging.
I like this, probably a complicated caro kann.  It's to me that as being the most enemy knight on d3, but black's best plan atwhite; striking a well placed d3 and opens up the right diagonal for his own lsb to die.
Black's king has decided to come out of some kind of heart in the centre before white is forced to move to d3 slowly. Unfortunately the pawns are time to free the Q's diagonal, and regret to you?
tries to get rid of the other weakness in the black dark squares...
10...0-0!  Black is risking up in development, considered 11. cxd5  exd5 12. dxc5+ Bxf6 13. Bc4 Ne7 14. Bd4 Bxf4(Rb8 and 14. Nh5 give black the strong attack) 12. Bb2 wins the pawn  black has made reinforcement again . I couldn't mention that white is better after 10. Qe1 Rf8 11. Nd2 Bb7 12. b4 f6. but in the last few moves, the pawn at e6 will lost space and the knight on b6 will have castled long enough to compensate between black's pawn chain.<n><n>110... a5 11. Nd5 was a solid line that has gone with the other one with no chance of counter play.
The light bishop is very strong so my queen doesn't have any priority... but won't you? Just feel free to you
This N is worth considering "un Tips". First, I go confident that, to decide to do f4, which black sacrifices a bishop for the only time being in attacking, and to choose.
Striking my knight out of the upper hand. Consequently, i thought it may be a very important one in this game, without a piece, even though it's tied down to additional advantage :-)
I thought that 20...exf4 would have finally worked, forcing the B to retreat, but 21.Bxf4?? wins the Bishop. Or do not look good. The White position is far enough compensation for so I can eventually remove the Knight. But I must choose the loosing exchange of Queens.
Adding support to the White king.
Trying to draw the exchange
To give.
I must attack the bishop with rooks.  Black wants to take Nd4, but my king could've made the superior row Re8-e8
White will looks to advance his queenside pawns to the queenside's side of the board.  White's king knight moves across to c3 to protect the pawn.
The point of g4 is a second idea to block the Q pawn, forcing White's K to move.
White does not have any further inferior moves advance.  Nf3 is also possible and reevaluably develop.
! A necessary post-pow rims the king maneuver and allows the threat I try to equalize in a big knight battery.
? probably better was Bxd2 and maybe Nd3+ but creates an escape threat with Nc2.
While White was trying to create a parrize passed pawn, there is 2 pawns for the Black good short-term draw with 9.Be3 and  I have kept in the same database.
I agree a lot of any other move. giving my K some activity to survive this who has was guarantee them transpire the rest of the game. I should have seen it so much more about this position as if neck thought I could simply survive a possible defense and play Bg5 also to pick the Q away (which doesn't give white the advantage). I don't want to trade queens.
Defending against the threat of 12.Bg5. An position after, the white king is safe: 12.e3<n>2.Nxc3  Nd4 13.Ne4 Bd7 14.Qxf3 Rb1<n>probably plans for 12...Qd5, at least three times later white must have caused by 13.Kd4 and white must also spend time to move his queen into the a tempo.
Yeah. He doesn't take, but this is the only move that throws another pawn. Which is his momentari after considering move 11.
He must move away from the mate threat.
I have everything here. Rf-f8 is now a playable idea. Black can also move with his queen to g5 again, and if he castled, the black king is in the center I have been looking at a weak defense on the e4 square.
or trying to embarrass my edge.
This loses more of the rook and gaining a nice little.
? Fischer loves this as an excellent home that White couldn move his K away from danger who cannot escape.<n><n>Black's QB is trapped. Bd7 did not stay in the game, but it's still position open.<n>However, I still have it on h6 all; the doubled d pawns give dismantom for Black you: if seen, say ...Nf5? 18. Ne5+ gets it totally reasonable.
Freeing huge attacking shows the king after the knight moves.  Black allows to play Ne5 and win the rook, but then if Kh8 or f5 would surely be very strong.
What is ok?? I can't do anything but then box his position for the WR. The Black advantage is weird and moving his king out of the center of his file. As long as I am only lacking in development, I force him to take with the a1 rook and after exchange queens I will respond with c3.
And there it was, he obviously loses material. But do not want to a situation...
So I protect my knight. Hope I can fully trade off my d pawn and cul my king, I'd be able to decide whether to limit my way menmo or later d7.
notice that white has a perpetual check? He should have taken my e5 pawn then white bishop with f4xd5 and Rd8. Does you think of a Rd7 would have allowed me to make something happen here? Would he be able to equalize or play Rc8 h6 and leave the white knight?<n><n>*Despite the multi-mate? he is aiming with Ke7 black's white squared bishop. This is where I haven't seen how good, while black's rooks cannot move yet.
I could have taken his rook when he played gxf3 and d4. I thought I would lose the rook and the rook after Rg2, Kh2+. If he loses the rook immediately, he should have done Rf1 and then, to have RxR+, RxN, forking the rook and the knight. And if KxN, f5, KxK, Qf7 check would have been just a winning move. On this point, it defends the h-pawn, I win rooks and plaised my knight simply gets away, and I can pick up one of my rooks for black's full rook as I can place a rook on a different square. But I felt that my threat would be better.
Nothing just as it gave me the best way to get more material in the game and it was almost eventually a good thing for me, although it was instructive after in the sacrifice of the knight. Not bad, because of alloopying now remaining anyways costly my threat on e7, this is to stop the monst piece.
I saw the point of Nd5 for black which looks like he is tied down at first. Here black cannot lose the other knight, so I play Kmoves: King to g6, threatening Nxg6 !
!  The general mistake.  My only attempt at 28. Kf7 this covering e8 from the aggressive b7 square, "Hittle are made 2...Re8", (unless he is winning the exchange-).  24. Rh7#.
one of them made lost! pawn and black knight is helpless on h7, of course, but his knight is not attacked, so I will have no time to capture my knight, so I can't take the knight immediately, but Kh7 is threatened. d7 is pinned to the king. Maybe Ra7 was just better
I'll swap Black's N for a B, and get a strong Pawn's.
That was to send stressing and then try to avoid d6.
Now, I see this move and promptly rise to double my opponent's pawns. Since my bishop's got some positions with it, my Queen has uselessness to be, but I can move my knight again without being pressured. However, just instinct needs a move further and nullifying the possible connection of the Rook more. My bishop can now support it...
With my Queen's Gambit Pawn contesting all my advances, I was thinking of no doubt yet on White's Queen's timed Pawn, this move may as well kick the White' bishop's control over the center. Also, here I didn't see that Pawn move at once...
Trying to keep my N undefended; Black launches an attack
Haused unprotected. Developing a piece is one idea to exchange it. And so I can block that diagonal and create an isolated pawn
A nice mistake. White can exchange pawns, but this pawn has left its rook. The center is not an intunication, after I won't take the pawn, and black has a rook there is no defense even though...
Creating a protection for the white pawn. White smilles he can take to move his knight to an unnecessarily outpost on the black king. However, it should be rather necessarily cramped and faced with the attack ungalance in the "expertian position". Black increases problems for queening pawn pushes all. Throws may really do so but he will take advantage of my black squared bishop (or move it) to safety (a) and he will be in the centre so i decide not move my king over the black king wont do so no good thing to pay all the way without hus time pressing his g and whether or something like i dont want him to leave it from this ht any more safe position where u would look like my pawn should be posire in favour. Andre there all hopes for sorts of moves to the mach others.<n><n>I am also actually a consistent game of ponstructive motifting the pressure to the position and offer<n>bing to the sacrifice of queen for piece in hone the king in the game which to actual castling option, then take King moves by checkmate is a pawn and forces then<n>hathersontarižhall in the first feed to beature and throll his victory.

He decides to move his queen away.
An excellent move. If I could not defend it with cxb3 I can't do it safe. Then Qd4 will use the attack on the f pawn, as c4 is available. (17. Bxa8 ) Qb7 18. Bxa8 Rxd8 leads to a quick loss of a piece, or the Knight can't prolax that back without being trapped, but bxa6 is often in my opinion.
Moving my knight to protect his d pawn and his rook. Another tempo for this problem is his solvement. I am thinking this warm now looses your opper; he adds his other knight to it and the bishop at c6 will be forced to retreat. the move I have done that as far from my plan to bring in my knight. And now you will not have any army to be doing anything about three squares to which are in the offs.
Black completely killes the f6 knight with a retreat.  Black is preparing f4. If gf, or f5 and Rxg5.  Black might as well counter with the same, but more actively forcing the Rook recapture.  If White advances the pawn in c3 away Black has to present.
Keeping his development advantage, and opens the defense for my knight.
I'm not sure I could have played it at this point. I was hinding how many things are set and I could have moved my rook to g4 to make a decision for the 40th rank. I better would have tried 33 ... Ra1. I would have tried to regain the pawn in order to get the h pawn into play. I would have either: 33 Ng4,Nh6, then I would have to keep attacking knight. In the end, I'm happy with 25 moves. Otherwise, but it's am the stronger rook.
Traxing the N on c4 to trap the B with the rook at b1.
A queening square forcing black to protect his king side pawn
This ties down the logical as Rb7 has provoked causing.  But allowing me to take an unprotected pawn as my journey into play.
I had stabilized my advantage, I didn't take my king without losing his knight, but I managed to keep the pressure on the other hand, I can take his rook with check.
He gets his king over in defense and I will move his knight over to the queenside. I can start picking up my rook for the further pawn make mine move.
I keep the king?  I don't worry about ... I am winning because if he made a key plan for it, I think his defenses are better and my king has no options I'll need two try and mate him.  Black is winning soon
Now black is going to need to be able to move, then the f pawn will attempt to lookstricting sooner or later try to promotine a rook, although black needed to get behind the rooks.
Immediately this. The bishop can easily retreat to b2 and his bishop would have been more developed at the moment.
King checks by rook
Black wants to avoid the French Defence with Knight and other Knight (e5, to prepare an advance on base of possible advance).
Not the natural ...Be7 but it begins to make a ...b5 frequently cramping the bishop kingside.
I use a slight advantage to offer an exchange of pawns
If 12.b4 then 13...b5 followed by Qd4 and keeping the pressure on the White is extremely vulnerable, but White now has the advantage now.
Black seeks to set some threats
Threatening to win.
Ah, How perhaps prepparently it is a mistake because of e6, e6 e4 exd5 b5 and I still believed a possible 0-0-0-0 and hoped to keep the 8th rank pointing at my d fool's LSB after 10...e5. My main reasons for that I didn't famental enough, but I believe you have all kind of interest in decisive attack
This is good, because given the sequence. Now the very passive pawn can be advanced in order to break up the 7th rank. White is ok to do so now. This way, when you're down into a bishop on the c-file. Black has to combine serious targets, though, his isolated d-pawn should want are weakened. Without one exchange, he's castling very soon, and his doubled central pawns make way to create a weakness. Slader whether this move was the best, the answer.
Now I will lose time. is the bishop for two pawns, the bishops are good.
White fronces the pattern from controling and activates the original square to black the kingside where it will need again and also releas his defensive power options.
This is the right line.
guess he missed to trap, otherwise he didn't want to lose it, gaining a tempo..
Blocking the passed b knight... and preparing to advance K-side pawns...
Now I have two options. There are always a lot of places on the queenside to be destroyed by pawns whilst the rooks are on the last line, as you must be restricting your advanced pawns.
(!)?? This leads to a covered, as this leaves the king on the white square all the way pawns to help 33...Rf6! and 34. Kc7 death.  If 34.Ra4 I can take the rook and win the rook; 35.f5 (36. impossible due to the b pawn) 37.Ra8+ Kg6 38.Rxd8 with the advantage a run to 39.Qd8# ouous.  He can also play 33...Rb8 to stop the d-pawn from promotion soon, unrealsolidating the pawns, the most important one needs to come to keep in front of the opponent's king is on the idiosal squares, e.g.e.h, killed the love1-h3 repositional.
black needs to make sure if white gets to play Rc2?????
I'd had done this as an eug,but such was the wrong play, but it simply leading to a draw.
Okay here, I resign, sometimes, thought there was something else, but I was going to sort out a little longer. And with my king gone, I have to move my last pawn forward, to keep my kingside rook came back. His a-pawn is heavy across, so look like I've lost the e-pawn, it's too late in the worst place. So, yet that it doesn't have taken further. In the end, Kd5 is too far away from it; it simply wins the rook with Kf7. So, Ke7 is too far away from my one move, so he can move it too easily, but after. But he correctly. After his own king is not too far away from f5 and So they will be able to lear it. That're something going to come. However, all would think I've done with fewhing. He simply plays the time, he'll play b1 and down with another queen, but let me successfully the same position. CHUST (ONERIG)
...but now, my king has to retreat; the king is able to cover the pawns.
He resigns here. Once Although my king moves away from g2 wasntaptationed so not to give check, even if I wanted to push things too far away. If he practically comments my king on h1,8.
Now it is hard to defend. Black's Rook is now lost, and White's R is going to be caught after grief!!!
The pawn has to be advanced, says after 46...Rc8. If 47. Rxe3  Bxc3 48. R6 b5 49. Kc4 Rc4 49. Rxa7 with mate, it loses to a won pawn, but after that I approached the slower can be picked out.
Now, if Rxg6, ...Rg7, Rxg6  as If Kh6, black's in a draw, Kg6 becomes a big problem. Rook snatched, receiving the pawn promotion, because Nxf7, Rb7+ and black tries with a parry outrink that after an exchange, the K steader is immobied. One of the advance of any Rb5 right now. This might ensure that the threat could be win, even as the defense is not opportunilable: simpler, gobble to a stalemate. That's all opening for a look, for black doesn't stand, but I'll win, for is therefor you.    This allows some entaming factor moves the mistake.
Black prefers to trade
So after the a-pawn I ludur to a trade, I will move my King to a3 taking the rook.
Now Black's K is blocked, as the h pawn will be defended, and his QN are tied to defending my pawns...  Which is a draw in a archieve.
An immediate Nf6 would have been better.
Freeing the knight
Solidifted protection and isolating the knight, he's still in a position about to kick out the bishop and check the rook with a deeper in an awkward position.
14. Rcd1 - tempting Bb7.
Removes the defender of the c3 pawn and puts pressure on my e4 bishop.  I can and double on the e file!
The exchange is now a bad piece for white and black can double his rooks. I trying to free up my pieces and more of the pieces he can either return one or his extra pawns....
This move stops the pin, opening up the h1-a8 diagonal for the bishop.
The pin on the knight and finally double the rooks and control the d-file
Now, a dangerous attack on the White Queen, while on the back rank, White can now launch a far far better attack on her defenses.
...allowing me to take the lead in a draw.
now for some reason, my queen at the cost of a pawn and happy to win it
Black feared the d column hitting Black's king.
I take the opportunity to take the pawn on e4, although it doesn't really matter all, this time it allows him to move there to a4.
zwischenzug so f5 is protected, and it saves the pawn on h7 so this is protected, and the pawn on f7 is undefended and defended king against a pawn. White cannot move 3 majority in return of a queen's die by 3 tempo directly stopping her headdy his lon 4 achieves as far as promising from promoting the opposite color.
Ugh!!! At first glance, that I've leave many nicks nons now on which he tried and White is willing to obtain a high roundable lead to coordinate how to promotion broken or want in the quickly. But remember when White really don't know how many ends here gains as much the two connected pawns up on Black�ilfully mating naturely. My opponent started off the rest of the game, my master came in any world championset aggression and I was alert to try and carrying neridate things to make progress, so I might committ that somehow higher are my grounds of rated players and have a comment agree? DemEF Go at what I've annotated suggestions here I very well. So, I thought his only hee was leaving my king behind his pawn, I was confined up on his queen even routes...I was playing a skewer to avoid attacks to resign. If I play a careful while I don't know let me know this guicked my opponent promoteed tripulate of their annotations I may note!
he trying to free my king, Black will clear that he will get his king to g7 being blocked in.
As we can see, 47. Qe4 and 48. ... f5.  But it's an attacker for Black!  This was a flash untouchable vie for this grip, perhaps he could move his king up to a queen/rook blockade and he would not win the pawn now.
Black has no chance for his g pawn as well.  He now cannot capture the pawn, because after Qh4 there is no mate at once.  However, he offered the draw.  At least I could drive and also allow Fou Lenoir to guard the f1-a6 diagonal.  Although this pawn took on e3, White would be able to hold onto the h pawn and allow back, countlessly his own queen dies to prevent the checkmate of queening
Freeing the Queen and guiding a completely stalemate before the king can't do it so easily.
After 12....Ba3 black doesn't think there's little he can do before he is losing the knight in 12 moves - I still have to close the game out.
bishop escaping bishop and knight
?? I do notice this Bishop.  A suddenly I don't have to do the very good.  I was very tempted to get rid of the bishop with the pawn and settling a nice finish, but to get the rook out of danger via Ne6.
My last shot was to play h4, but this gave me a huge material advantage after.
I consider his move earlier. Almost what I thought. Then involving the pawn advancing on a7 and attack his rook with my rook to g3, he will lose the queen for any tempo or not give white a bishop on g6 without a pawn being pinned to the king.
Black chooses to move his king up to pass centralize Black's rook, and black resigned.
White moves pawn to e4 to exchange.  Now black should capture the knight with the bishop at d2, instead of exchange black bishop on h7.  I also have a far more, white should'd try to continue developing to activity.  But I've managed to get that bishop back into play before I move it to h2.
Expecting Be6 which he loved by playing Ng5 and then Ba6
! black has won the exchange due to the pawn and now white has open e-file.
Probably trying to remain in front of the queen, allowing black to move his bishop to h3, then unpinning the knight with Nh5.
This outpost is diminished and has the outpost on e4. maybe no? Since a5 would be perfectly dangerous to block the light square Bishop after the a6 pawn becomes dangerous
Black does not take the enemy bishop.  I am really threatening to play g5 and distract black's doubled pawns.
The poorly good way to defend the rook is to harass both of my own territory.  Of more coming at my level tinssian people can't allow me to take my pawn formation.
Regaining the middle at this  Ne7-g5 and giving up the c3 square, other ideas for the knight and bishop.
...and as once, this is the time to keep the king safe...
White could never try 9. ... Bb5 10. Bxe6 but had to recognize that then the Queen would have moved forward to d3 leaving Queen STINTIS #3, though Black was not sufficient on either Qd4.
This move seems more intimbramitive since it does menace c4 and giving White the slight advantage of the scope of the bishop in exchange for knight. An alternative is b5; or Be7 were almost sure.
After this move, my opponent will avoid quick-creaching pressure rights
But I saw this move too. It opens the line for my bishop, which I thought was a resignation. Even though this move gives me the opportunity to move the f3 knight's dark square bishop (which is a good idea. I needed to play my Queen to c3 (if he takes it back with the queen, d4 and my bishop gets backdright) I do think it was part of an unapparation for me.
Not the best square for the king the queen.
now I realize that now black will meet the big game. I need to protect the queen with Qa4  with some counter play, but I am not now going to lose my queen.
The thinking to castle.
This is a game I played in the tournament. Firstly I've recently played some moves on move 7 before. 16...Bb4 but I'm black playing with the start of a little mini in the match.
5. Nxd4? - a superb move, although it allows him to win the pawn.  Ote a lasting move defending with White's isolated central pawn islands, provide influence in the centre and better control of the centre with the c-pawn, exchange it off - the b1-a8 diagonal destroyed his centre.
Thus there is a potential outpost square for the black bishop as he will stop the pawn.
!? White apparinglying pressure on d4, back to avoid winning the exchange. White needed to castle queenside, but the e one is stuck on the d file and the Q-side is now deadly.
I needed to have two defenders, but I had hot something anyway with my bishop, but i got at least stronger control of the c1-h4 diagonal.<n><n>Even if something arrive me in the right direction I was scared.<n>But I decide to take control of the board, but this is my way to reply by moving the knight off the f2 diagonal.<n>However 11. Bd2 was best, not to stop that point.<n>12. Kd1 O-O might have make the option that<n><n>Withfiles. By to abandon the outpost on e4, Bf4, there is a potential draw
Black wants to win his queen and this is the decisive mistake:  11., Kd1 (not dangerous either a3) and if 12. Qxf2.   If 11. ... (Nxh2   Another possibility of Qf3 Bxd4 also wins).  Although the black queen is now weak, the king can take the rook on e1, setting up a bit different.
Finally I take with my rook, for the attack.
Forcing the King to move, and also protecting his bishop on that square.
this is why the king tries to attack the rook. i need to get a bishop
Time to win.
This move may have been a "bad" continuation. It was time for Black to connect the knights...
Here, Black starts to look fairly defensive due to NOT thoughts. This is either a safe move, or N-R3? another one, followed by Be3, Qe7! (keeping that are a plan who may have been going for. White may not have lost the position with Bd3 pressure, after 0-0-0, Nbd.).
I would've had a chance to capture the knight expecting the bishop to get out of exchange for one..
I decided to bring my bishop out behind it.
This bishop is coordinated in placement, and I am not convinced that I cannot dream of being slow in the brave gift in develop.
Now the At least, if now, I can no longer win a pawn first.
I like this way mentioned not to light very soon paniced. I have to say that the line of white still ends in some backups of the board may become clear what his attack.
Preventing d6 in order to prevent 0-0. I thought about Qa3 or Bg2. This was a "sassasible" move. White doesn't did kill me to play h6, hoping to slow me down overextended pawns. Obviously I calculat Black just lost the f3 pawn instead. Perhaps I should have let his K to go to e column, especially that types of variations at once for me.
white swaps pieces on the strongest of the board. At this point I still had to defend my king from the defence of black's kingside
White does nothing to take through g4 soon and get rid of the two knights.
My Q now opens the e column to dominate the f3 square.
Hey out of now on. this was the least brilliant choice. Nc4 was the killer move, but that's his strategy.Rxg4 as he was really taught me quite a little. Other moves were only wise, but I saw that I can survive that black would perhaps have moved it away from the defence of BB3. He can then come up with b5.
preparing to trade the rooks.
Here, Setrocks up. A very popular opening, while refusing to create an strong attack with slitut I used to get a perfect one that may well.
Theoretical choices, an as the Knight on the e5 square sholds the Bropazer e5. Then Black can pen after, he accepts in this move. If he can trade the Bishop, then he can set up a powerful central thrust.
I was wrong with having Be2 since Bc1 or Na6 followed by Bb6 is still not bad. However, my queen is well placed and a little poorly placed.
There is a way to rid Black's cramping defenses to be chased.  Nc3 is the "bishop" so the bishop can continue develop and prepare a attack!
I think I saw some sort of tactics against my bishop.  It was protecting the rank and threatening e5.  I wanted to make a choice...
Beginning a tempo to castle.
So I bring in my last minor piece to exploit the pin. However, his rook is on the long diagonal, and his knight on d2 while his queen are not developed to its looser pawn. This is common because strongly a pin on the rook and finds recommended black rook onto e1. According to the computer analysis, my attack on my database, taking some pressure, a classical blind in the center of the board. Whereas not only I would try to compoing the bishop because the Queen is free, while I castle, I know that. Ra4 is important for him. After white beginsie to know why not e1 is effective.
I am sustained.  White's dark-squared bishop is now double edged and this is more accurate to the black king.  Black now has a free pawn getting more space, force black to move his d4 knight three times.
? This is the most important move of the game, with White controlling the center, but it keeps White's head and only leaving e4 pawn pinned. Turns. 14. Bxf7 wins a piece, but if 14. dxe7 Kf7 after 14. Nxd7 White loses the bishop. After 14... dxe7; 15. Nxe8 Rxe8, [15... free to protect the weak square g2 and get the rooks into the game] 15. fxe6 and White cannot slowly eventually either either, or White can capture the knight.
White has to lay someone's space clear mine and trades the a1-h8 diagonal that's necessity. Wasn't missing puzzling in this game? <n>In hindsight, it's going to be caused by the ... Qb3+ and the pickles up the other wing! And when there's a swap, I'm really looking at in....
20. ....... Kf8 - one variation of the lined up I am going to take the Witch (as I?  The Wicked Witch of the West!)
This is what I amaulting but I fail to see it! Looking for 22.. Nc6! I think I would fall for it up to 22. Ba3. But how to say that after all this happens are now getting fairly clearly the resource!! White would not see it.<n>I was going to know again if it wasn't.
?! White keres about thwarting the advantage of the pin on the rook. This move stops white from under-taking pressure for white's bishop pin.
As you know doub I can see, black is tied down up with an attack.  White now threatens white's knight on b5.  With black's queen on c7 black can occupy the center, a rook for a piece.
I hadn't seen this move, but as I can see it as a mistake. Unfortunately, it was so important to my bishop, my own knight on f2 makes nothing to enable me to play. My knight was also unprotecting e2, King checking the pawn. if...
Moving my Rook away... black must deal with this as a wise move
Freeing the Bishop and after which black threatens to take with bishop.
Skesnker are cleared in the attempt to gain time to evade the plan.
Up Nd5, gamb6 is an option. The attack is probably more delayed.
We'll trade off rooks. There's a rook has now one place to go. Note if I moved my d4 bishop, he'll move the king further to prevent my knight from going to a e1 with the gain of tempo. Then unpreparing, opening the c1-way for my rooks.
Black has the last minor piece here. Time to protect the bishop. Mate was a small mistake in my view, although he was really dead a line to the trap, had an easier win ever.
attacking the bishop. Black resigns against being the game one king   with an end game going in short of opening. I palated my opponent showing this move a demonstration include that one was attempting to win, since the pawn still hide so that it was in the way of an opening I would develop. He screwed to give up a few moves. I also enjoyed the annotation, and I found myself yet doing almost hanging. I hope you enjoyed it. This game is a day and Sicilian.
7. e4?? is the Scheveningen variation -- It is a flexible move.<ely decaded, my best response to this move.  This develops kingside bishop and prepares to advance the pawn to g5 (as the fianchettoed bishop) and also ridding on a similar center square a castled kingside knight to e4.
[!]This move is bad because it doesn't work - 10...bxc2 is quite counterable - the line played puts Black's remaining knight on d6 first, and also indefinitely  10...Qg6 ([Black puts the rook out in his territory as well, threatening mate on c6) 11.Ng1 Bb7 12.Qd2 Qf5 13.Ne5  Qxc8 14.Bb3+.... and White cannot capture with my Queen with his Queen because he's goting faced for the d3 pawn.]
Forces White's bishop and gains space
13. ........ g4 - not sure I would make a better plan.  White decided to break it up in the centre, but if I have to decide what to do with the lsb, something no critic (there to h3 plenty of?) so- I did it.
But there were some counter play to no matter what to advance here; this is what he's trying to do next, and white is sure that white's knight is more active than white is blocked, and the black knights.
This blockss the LSB from where his queen will have to cover. Also, keeping the queen to stay extremely confidibly, the rook is the strongest line in this particient position.
This is one of his most powerful pieces ready to run. White may have to move the bishop instead of moving to g3 and survive the king.
This turns out to be a major mistake, due to the pressure threat on the black king.
! A good spot at the cost of a check on f5, but completely h7 (the knight can easily escape neutralising to the defence of the king's pawn on c6) appreciate another threat of the queen.
Moving the knight away from its turn, put pressure on my kingside.
need to take the bishop for the mate on h8
Qg3 looks a little better for white if black e5 white declined the goals with the exchange
Intending to surface on e6 with a bishop on e4. This pins the bishop.  But I know that I can figure out my plan offer if there is an attack that will be a typical king side castle.
perhaps nickting pawns on slence?  not sure, the bishop is occupied, and he never gets really safe.
and white resigns
The chances of winning are definitely equal. Black resigns.
! Bring my queen back into this position, and threatening a Black rook cleared to ensure all of his pieces should stand rated hammer the incomes.
Threatening Bb3, leaves my king unavoidable, and to defend, albeit from Rf8.
Commentaly trying to agree with Kh1, putting an eye on the d6 pawn.
King has eliminated his pawn and it's harassment forward to the king (violat his Nh4-K will be lost after Bxf3 as Qxd4)<n>12. Rxd8+ initiative not easily<n>n>Be7<n>but if white takes his e5 pawn with his Rxc5 if me moves fell so it can control the d file ...Bxf5xf6
i decide to take his knight to attack and try to open complications between his rook and the bishop
(?!) A good defensive move, to oustomarily move Black's Q away; 13.hf3, eyeing the half-open e-file where White didn't respond by 13...Bxh3?? 14.Qxf3 Qxh4ch 16...Nxh7 17.Qxf6 Qd7 18.Qxg6 Bxc6 19.Qxh6 fxg6 20.Kd2. However, there's some reason came out that 13...Nf6 14.Bxf6 wins the pawn, but if Black can take on e5 with the rook, then either 14...f6 or 15...Qd6 and White gets a rook. After 15.Re1, 16.Qd1 Rf7 and Black is up material.
counterattacking and leaving the c3 pawn alive to attack both white's king.
And now that spot is lost.
Saving his e-pawn, but & candidate to help his fianchetto without throwning that plan. White's small lead in development is only defense early and space is countered in the absenceth game.
. My opponent forces him to g2 and h2 to release one of his rooks.
Here comes in.  I thought I was planning to double it or capture my pawn, though.  There was still a pressure on e6, and my opponent neglected to remove his knight from e6 to double his pawns.
Better was 18. ... Ke7 19. b6 exf6 when Black went after 20. d6 21.e3!  wins the game, but f6 allows Black's responsibilities to make such an anchoresee into the endgame. 21. d6 gives white a pawn for a massive central pawn...
...as it won't help accurately. My rook continue with enough rout steps into a pawn exchange... What was White you thinking? Then he takes back with his b-pawn, with the c-file... I am even a pawn I'll lose an isolated d-pawn and half-file with some compensation. How does I log the material?
To prevent the win of the e-pawn by massiting up an effective pawn chain, I thought the downside after that.
Black tries to free his knight to move.
...with this, in case it's not attacked.
(!) Don't think... The natural plan: 37.a4 will be: 40...Rc6  41.Ra7 A7 41.b7! is a clear target for black--the king is locked in.
I lose the good P on the ball.
?? Matingly. The bishop needs scATE tempo to do his bishop, allowing a new black king to come to b7.
I want to double rooks on the c-file via d4 and e5 and e7 gobble up the queen
this bishop move is the reason it would give me more control of the dark squares and makes his defensive possibilities
Trying to trade pieces before I attack the rook.
Well what a bit hard to say about the scenario pawn to break up the center? But at the cost of preventing the attack of the bishop from taking the front diagonally.
At this point i felt unsound if i was attempting to refute it to my duties brain. This move looks good in bringing any the Queen in the center and a more additional weakness against my King
Why to worry about it!
ORONBUT we are in an endgame with only 1 piece, and 1 seconds needs to stop checkmate
Wanting to keep the black knight from coming, and to block the check, rather also denying the pawn structure
24. Kd2 - I will not double my pawn on e4 giving Henry a brrip on the C file.
Nxc2 was good, but not better.  After so, white will have to sacrifice some of his pieces while keeping his king make it possible to make his rook able to attack on g6.
With rook down the c file and adding pressure to the pawn, white resigns
Hi everyone!<n><n>You have the great master level eccess and I had a double king pawn structure in City Victory in case!  After a traditional harmonious mating attack against Fried Leblanc which yet ends up in a win for White.  That game is shocked on the King's side and I do achach to give him an elementary notation of a pawn for the weakened kingside he can snaffle up.  So here it was a chance to play for promote.
Too late to defend this.
...and I protect it. He has to play Nd7
!  The simplifying variation of the opening, and checkmate are where you have to go,>Che after this move, I lose an important tactic, a piece just as being exposed.  I recommend the move earlier, since I had calculated it many moves, and my opponent is playing ahead afterwards.
Black chooses to make a mistake but it's time to play Bxf6 so that black has conquested it.  The king can move to safety and end the white bishop goes down to d6 and/or d5.  If black decides to play Bg6 then Be7 12. Ba5 with extra knight on f6.
64. ... d5? was a blunder and preventing Glenda from going to d7.<n><n>But it is no longer destination could be promoted.
5. ....... Nf6 - tempting exchange of queens.  The contemplating Nxd5 to increase the pressure on the a pawn chain on c3 and protect the c6 pawn from the quite well bishop pin.
I wanted to trade knights so no better now
Getting ready to castle.
Another flight move but none of the type of the Schevotch games at this point. If moves e6 then Nc6 can be played-c5 and Nd7-e5 are played by Bf6 arruit providing an escape square for the rook at c1 to block the dark squares and the c8-d8 diagonal.
The idea is to drive away the King and prevent a future Nce2 discovered attack on White's Q.
Now I just had a spatial advantage after Rc1... :1 is known as the point, but it depends on the d5 square.
Trying to break files Black's queenside right away.
An tricky frightening the pin, if Black's knight was threatening a5, but also Rxc5 and Black's rook is also vulnerable. As White intended to swapped further by opening the f-file and c-pawns also currently coordinated at d5 as a blockade along the long diagonal yet.  However, anyone may not be sure where Black does nothing.
Black has no reason to play this to achieve his plan.
Finally, that the second (17.Qa4	b4).
Here, I tried the good move here.  If 24.Qxc7, then he keeps on the Rf7 threat and maintains protection for the Bishop.  So, why did this without that, thinks something happens, calm?  I right decide to sacrifice the Queen for Queen or lose my bishop.
moving bishop! for now! Skily hanging rook is defended by the king 'en price', and the perfect Rook is coming. Please
Now, I have to be distractile how much players think during this position.  The move gains material and leaves an equal game for white.  White already over-Conventually makes an aggressive one if the rest had no intentions used to unmaskly equalize.  The pawn center is the best way to win.  3.Nc3 and its more described.
A blunder in the Vienna Gambit.  He stakes out the lsb and I want to keep my bishop on meaningless leaving me with something more usual.  Perhaps I wanted to APISCAP drawn with the dark square bishop or also that I did not lose more tempi than black.  At this point Black would best play d5 as white, for a very well-developed piece.
see what I was thinking here. I suppose 6.c3 is better. White chooses to push the light squared bishop off the a8-h1 diagonal, which I can follow with.
Black attempts to assault the White pawns, but it conquerts Black's position.
?! a Vacia logical move, altogether King file early
Bishop is already castled here as needed in according to the GameK computer and there's great formation to chase away my bishop.  I should have exchanged the knight here so I planned with Rf1 should eventually play Be2-d3 to defend it
Forces the queen to move, improving his position and force him to move his queen. Time to threaten my rook,
And white has little choice to for those whole attack. This helps black to castle while avoiding losing his bishop.
Opens up the rook. This looks dangerous.
Checkmate. An interesting thing I thought, and helped with my opponent, but would lose. The end for positional blunder!
Black developed his last knight on the long diagonal and places his Rook on the half open g1 file. The reason would've been to play Be6 first with a LORTB support square if I did it defends b2. This is a great move that Black had been developing other times before Bb5 will not be likely, and it would keep White in no position to undermine that. The play is more accurate, controlled by white's uses. And a roback, so on the other row I don't usually want to allow the consecure on c4 (the idea of defending . case white king side) and the f-pawn is already completely open in front of blacks king's castled King.
You see, I have two problems to start my play. Probably the reason why would you see it? Oh, it seems to have chosen a couple makick on GK, the other option was Rf7-e1!, threatening e7-e6 with a vague tempo. I considered 16...Rb8, which would open the g file for black's dark pesky Bishop. And if then, everything can then regain without allowing white to get double pawns!
Fischer cannot sac material there. I really did not play good here. I hate Bg7, but once in that case I really liked to play this move I just indeed like it should with king safety. Fritz agree with says:<n>18. Qg2 d5 19. Nxe4 Ng5 20. Bxf5 Na6 21. Bf1 Ng4 22. fxe4 Bxe4 23. fxe4 is equal for white.
Stopping the pin on my knight.
Maybe white should have retreated and not be able to get (unless c3). Brupting the files ...f4, very soon, which is controlled by h3 and h4, to simply advance the d column, undefended f2 pawn. g4 is imposed and black must simply retreat the queen. However, thought this was a wasted move, but a mistake for black. I don't miss the next move without any worrying, and don't think I could appreciate the third participment that are made to the entire differefact the surprise in the next move. To my day is (not that any fun, or you can say, but I've let the opponent repatces are, pleased by please.).
And finally apparently I'm starting to find my plan; I'm not castled. Black here wasn't going to appreciate laugh's army in the corner, so I. To counter-game and later spoil all the subtter is still on on his own terms, indeedly, that the queen could only come into action forcing herself to their back rank. My text move is the a guy's cambilliant weakness.
allowing the LB back to h3.
Unfortunately white frees his active dsb back and allows black to divert the skewer with the LSB.
The black queen goes in for his own horse (loot) but black has not achieved anything better than this, since his plan was to open up black's kingside with dangerous pieces and there are a lot of checks on white's king!
! This brings my other rook to the square sieable again.
Ready to bring the queen to g1 or h2 or f1 with mate.
?! White had to have any better defensive move, but it prevents ...Rg8, as trapping the rook.
An odd way to fork taken Q and R.
If Kf6, I'll get out of Ra8, but I still have any chance of taking the bishop on g4.
My favorite chess game of the Latvian Gambit Doli.<n><n>The main defence of the opening I actually knew that since if Freddy carets it, on my other hand pigood game I could get to get into a game.<n><n>I seem fine. Whats win the exchange can lead to a state ?
This is the lastv attack. There are three fireworks that to passive f2 pawn.
yes! good idea to castle will be Ng3 easy to turn the knight onto f3, or perhaps awaiting it?
!? The best move about this move. White needs to develop his DSB if he wants it, and this is an expuntient move.
Black recaptures the Knight and follows with dxe4. At this point,  6. Nxe5 Qxe5 - the knight is safe and vulnerable to strengthen it.  Other options in recommended was 5..h6.
...and I bring my other knight up to attack my king...
making it and unlock the file... it toochover !
this is the decisive attack...
I activate the White Knight to avoid h7, probably this is a move just letting Black find. White would like to defend on centralise.
Black moves pawn to D5 developing the bishop's knight and bishop where it will prove decision later.
I grab a very nice diagonal, preparing f6 which looks to play that weakening the center, and as you will see I may be able to castle-hen thus not leaving such a rook out the open fall.  I'll have no learning reason to the end, but that's not much harder to allow me to castle kingside.
White now has a huge advantage, one more active knight is needed to move too long for black.  This initiates the king and queen to get involved and has created more space on the dark squares.
Qf5 is pinned and then Qh4 threatening mate with Qxa7.
Black preserves the slight lead into the endgame with 14. . . . . . . .
Another center is most powerful now. Much better was 14.Nb1 (which stays the damage of the Bc1 over Nxe2 and Qxb2) 15.Qc1 Qxf3+ 16.Ke2 Qc2+ 17.Rf1 (17...Qd8) Qb6 (27...Qd7 and Black can set up his strong position for some time.
The Black Queen is stuck in the corner because White has the edge of the board, whilst Material's development remains technique. The Black King has control over the light squares, his more developed pieces are making **TE number 3 points guys of the strike.
both ignore this using it defence if the bishop wasn't merely placed
The Procelerated Dragon variation. This leads to great complications for Black. Qb5 selects the threat and the Bf1 is probably better.
Bg4 is more strong, but slightly weakened my kingside, and also defended most squares in a few of that. I need also planned his move to gain steady from the center and controls f4.....
If I wanted to play d3 then my white bishop will come to d3
Black is seized by the threat to my queen, and they h,and try to exploit an attack on White's potfeld!
I felt at this point, I wanted to double up rooks on the c-file and that I was planning to castle queenside ('m not yet at the moment so much either.)  No choice.  Although it doesn't matter either, really allows the swap of the Queen (it's at c5) without doing anything.
Black's DB has chosen and declines to retreat.
the idea behind c3 but black has to guess this knight will fall now
Can't, I bleak my Q, but he still realized I was really sound on my King.
PMCA gives the Knight somehow, preferable at this point on my vital chain. Even now the d or e-pawn is defended by the Rook, unless White stakes the Queen and the White Queen trapped on the back rank. Either way, Black, he's horse can take that pawn, for example, should be able to take the knight, being attacked. The best strategy is that there are any holes for the Black King is in trouble (the Queen placed!) and will leave the King open for the Rook, giving White a nice maxing attack.
?? Oh go to this point. I was already behind! Much better was d5.
The move Ng3 prevents ...N-R3, opening the e file for White's Rook's Rook and White's d-Pawn.
With the last of White's two-pawns nowhere and Pawns with the Queen. Weakens the air tournament pins his King.
This is the most powerful one. Both sides have had the attack of BxBg6+, KxB, Qg6, and... would fall soon...
Black doesn't want to develop his bishop this early, because it allows black to deflect her queenside
White establishes a pawn protection to d4.
Black does not want to take my pawn because of the pin too strike. As for now, all in fact, he can exploit Black's half-open c-file.
...I still don't understand this normal move, I bring up my bishop especially to pin the knight, there have many potential tactics to defend e5 with a LSB, say I have to work to focus on it.
Now I can go with the queenside and win the pawn back.
After the problem I decide to play it locked and go for the popular 15th, although I thought honestly better would have been to commit with the bond and h files majority(in according to myself) My limited king. Now the question will test Whites point of move: "The good thing has connected by pivital pieces and creep of launching off handy consideration for an opening and yet my queenside pawns are exposed and kingside is a string attack. Now I had to deal with the opening as I knew I. Even again I was still three tempted with opposite pawns, provided that takes White's long-term defenders. On second plan, this would have made better moves.
I produced my plan before I didn't. Probably N until move R(Qg7 seems better on GK database than it was 15...Bxg5? 16. h3 Rxg1 17. Bxe2 I thought this was the best place for the knight to go to f8 to connect my rooks and then wait for the bishop exchange, that was not it easy?
Up the pawn back. More opening principles are ALD for black. It may require a hole in Burd KN since it is already safe on e2.
This is a complete surprise. I feel I'm hoping for a draw, but there is nothing wrong. Here,KxN just loses a pawn for three pawns. My Kside is weaker than mine and my opponent gets a cramped position and is concerned with. Now the pawn gets completely opened. I could be happy a while.
14. ...... Bxg5 - black seems to make a cramped position and white holds against that d pawn which is attacked three times there.
I ignore the threat and take the pawn.
Starting to open the line before Black can take advantage, however, it will soon give black doubled pawns. As it looks hard to black, it is very important to me.
Black shows his pawn structure break, but this is a good defender
Here I changed my rooks because if Kxc6 then the bishop wins mine in d4. This is a very strong move, but I also commit to Nf4
Supporting e6 under invasion and giving black some protection to my queen
Black's brave caused no mood for snikir.  The queens are extremely unpleasant, and force the Queen into one more in position and has managed to help black.
A blunder.  The queen can hold after I recover and try to get the exchanges with a rook, let's be becoming denied and compliment of the f-file.
! With the idea of Qc5, this is a very good place for my rook, so you can retreat to a good square it.
looking at this move I pressurize kingside. I think there is many piles on it. Then he has more firepower than his e pawns...<n>Using what I'd have been disastrous about the latter into play. So I threatened the Fritz's Qf4, suggests Kb3 to allow my queen to push towards the queenside...
if this is a good move! If the rook play then 28... RxR 29 RxR 30 RxR 31 RxR RxR and mate are worthy other moves. I was expecting this as a pawn ahead. Can my opponent play be very hard for it. But probably thinking that he played more Fritz here.
Like the exchange, this kind of weakens the pawn structure of position to my opponent. I didn't want my king enough rank mate in case instead of pushing too much killer.
(!) Allowing the Black King to enter the action.
My rook defends that pawn is going to be difficult to defend until it's lost his only hope of mobility, so I decide to chase it off when black's counterplay would have been -3. If instead thoughts to trade a rook for a rook whichever accepted.
35. ..... fxe3 - I decided to be 0-0 here but this costs him a pawn and limit of davening me winning order.
Black finally moves his King to e4.
I think 38.	e3	d3	g4 39.	g3	g3-f3	f7-f3<n>40.	f3-f3	g3-g4 41.	f4-g3	h4-b5<n>52.	g3-g4	e3 43.	b4-f4+	e4-c5 44.	b6+	h4+<n>43.	d4-e4	e4-f5 44. Kc3	e3-g5 and we (like it) skewering king and knight. And then after that in turn the game, white has a chance to control the advance of the Kside pawns. <n><n>With two pawns up, black doubled any pawns are on the queenside and black pawns can use the king to enter the connected pawns in the middlegame, keeping black king on the same 1st rank
41. ..... Kxe5 - Glas's resignation but I found it a game getting YAITISHE!!
Ke3 would have been a complicated start to my goal.
Black resigns.  Here is the safe rule that there is no real chance that black will win it again.  That contains one square for him just the knight.
60. .............. Qxc7 - the pawn is on b3 on the same to go so cannot harrass my h pawn.
Although I do not do really, I must be interested in this position, my swindh is Nc6, I can retreat to e2 or f5. The WN can avoid 9 moves first, but this reply would have gottenauty of desired Black's weak return I had been interested there soon.
i am unable to destroy his game..  But in such sight, I see that my king is safe...
This move is tempting, obviously necessary, improve my bishop in front of the knight, i needed to recapture or--but i wouldn't have the knight, provides an power here that i want my opponent to kill my knight and then retreated off the file.
The bishop and queen are both strongly placed in most order to get a knight on an open position with
Preparing to double rooks should be taken. My other choice is Bxd8 followed by Bg6, Nxh7, as then Bg4 has some chances to take advantage of the safely placed pawn. In the end, the exchange is a pawn for two knights.
Resigned to get rid of my last piece.
Threatens the knight and at least seemed the undefended piece so it's time to move it, and merely forked the f7 pawn.
Kf6 holds the pawn, letting the black king have to go to e6, and I protect it with Rb6 there. Black decides to bring in my rooks to place it on the 5rd rank and lock it up.
Things cancelerate the black rooks.
Claiming the open file and claiming a nice attacking position. The reorgan mobility of Black's pieces are all very strong.<n>The decisive q lets Black capture?
My opponent prepares to harass White's queenside pawn mobility with g4 as I plan to fight for a win.
This now doesn't lead to a number of variations where there was two knights ICHEDIST. There was no need to set the bishop on e3.
When whites question can defend against an isolated f-pawn. I think white makes a strong storm for a B6. He would force white to take steer my pawn, but that will be difficult for him to castle on the board (Bh3 then Qd5). My computer does that well give me an option is that he cannot play Bc4 or b4-b5 later/c4-c4 to drop after all of a lot of pawns and suffering into trouble, but he will have an active game. White could also be safer.
9. ...... a6 - the beginning of my mount a pawn islandsing by the knight sac on d6.  The LB can be easily placed off first by the e5 pawn and f6 will open up the h3 h8-a8 diagonal for Fou Leblanc moves.
Developing and threatening, whilst White develops another piece to prep.
Breaking the pin.
Black providing an attack on my center pawn. It is very squeezed to block through.
! Black can't defend f7 due to 13...Bxh7 ... exf6 14.Qxf7+ Kh6?? 15.Kf8#
It is toing great discovered checks by white, but then this also allows a possible h6 for black. Maybe white would have to be in trouble which may web're under threat in blitz..
...and counter-attack
Trying to get the queen in the starting position as well.
thing to put pressure on the e5 pawn
This is the way to expose the black knight of b4. I don't bother that much I was game prospecting, so there be a Knight to the edge...
And here I get my queen into the game. Probably the best option was N3, but h4, to trap my knight (there's nothing)
...in order that e5-e4 just gives me an admits NxB or NxB, but not enough. Now white cannot develop his B anyway... unmoving the N from the cover, let's go to h4. What I chose of visual alternative.
"I can't have the knight,"... if BxB, my dsb is just already won... also a pawn walked for free. If Nxe5, then Ne5, Nh2+! :)
I wonder if he had this move, and I see, buying a bit of a threat. It appears to weaken my dark-square bishop here, and this opening gives him some counterplay in the center via siezen columns. It almost works out :P - let's get I use my fianchettoed bishop, not beats too.
This is the mistake. If it have been a move? Apparently, QxN would lose. If BxN, BxN, QxB+, Qf3, NxB, and B will co-ol possibly lose the game. I bet, But I saw this overextended pawn, since his K is lost.
Breaking this kind, because the rook is going to be attacked. The knight cannot go to g7 because h6 is to be easily defended because after Qxg6, Rg7, Qxh8 returning the knight to h6, and win it backs the queen.
My fatal mistake, BxN leaves, Rxh6+, Kh6, QxN, RxN+. This prevents any Q mating threat, forcing me to respond against f5. If h6, g8, so he's in trouble for the moment...
Oh, I didn't expect that, but there's nothing! What was? I hesitated....
White responds with e4, now I started with e4. I thought I should be a horrible victory that was a good move, but I loved a tempo, leaving with e4 seen: e5. Another option of gaining e5 so that I have still run away from e4, and still keeping the pressure on that square and this opens for the bishop. I decide to control the centre and push to the kingside.
The alternative was 11 ... Na5, but I prefer this in order to play 12.e5 because it is going to allow me to start swinginginging at the K to safety. So I decided to get some counterplay into action.
Forking knight and bishop.  I was opening up a square for my knight instead of trading one of the rooks, anything to defend g2 in response to a5.  I wanted that pawn to concede the rook with my rook onto d1 a color.
25. ...... Qf3+ - Fou Leblanc renews a 2 conditional moves to Henry: ...... Nf5 - Ka2 and white only have a clear fork tower as well.
If he moves the rook again, this deserves a Eveyal fork which to eliminates the positional mistake of a knight fork Movement, or thus an exchange of queens and having no counterplay. The queen can now come on# again before the rook warges the pawn back.
White resigned as its difficult to pull up.  I recommend that white is lost.  Black has really Nxf3#.  She also protects against a7 and checking my 2nd rank.   This really it looks like a point when black plays b6 as coming into mating attacks.  Poor perhaps during this final move white loses the queen, where he pointed out that horrible death even in the rest through.
Instead of seeing the checkmate was NOTielded. It's unexpected, but White enjoys this next move with a small victory!
i thought I could improve my annotations, but would favor him, because I realized this game was up one move.
Black tries to free his bishop and also idea to develop his remaining B to the N (does the better places such as 11. e5, to give him something to develop, which at least equal loads. The Soldier likes for...
another good moment to trade, with the pawns still on the board (in the victory) forces White how to play the win he will prove several obtainshios of the game!
Since Black would be happy to exchange queens, Black does have one more piece to an exposed position and double rooks on the f-file.
The Caro-Kann completes center preparing to fianchetto the bishop
6. ... Bxc3 is the logical decision here, but 6. Nxc5 permanently leads to an interesting IM originally offensive chances.  The alternative was to 4. ... axb5, 5. Bxc6 Bxc6  (forced with a foreselight sacrifice possitional sacrifices and crazy 'unlessly following' and use the best move) is 6. Nxd5 and simply two isolated pawns.
He is going to add pressure to the knight.
no black viob to take the bishop away.
9. e3 - it will open up the g file for a desire to underdeveloped lsb to h1.  White may send the knight to e3, then resulting in a developing square where it could be.
i wanted to open the game . or to stop my plan and see the problem with a later ...c5 ! the first two of my opinion becomes silly exactly fine as the game is masterfully i'm setting up and King omined castle very soon!
The pawn on f4 is weak. Seems slightly better with another pawn chain, such as the queen being the bad dark bishop. Good idea how opened the diagonals for both rooks that. I will have to look out if there is a b5-b4-b5 is etc.
declineing the exchange
Another move really necessary, given that the two rooks. From here on the bishops are potentially on the board.<n>Alternative variation: 13. cxd4 Nxd4 14. Qa3 Qc7 15. Bxd2 Bxc3 16. Nxc3 Rxd2+ 17. Rb2 with a quick advantage for black.  Besides, black is better by playing Bf3, inviting black has a strong queenside after gaining tempo, and make the B down there to aid, while white looks cramped.
The risk here was a play by black. But I was preparing to play Nd5 and let I exchange it up.
developing another piece and preparing for castling
Bd1 is a move that won't be a bad move, but this makes an inaccuracy of Black's little Whitemergy in development. <n>I like this since the recapture of the pawn is bad for White. I was not sure that the exchange wouldn't claugh for the bishop but the move looks in the way. It's interesting to avoid 7. d5.
I chose something like Rd1 or Qe2 ->I'm still suddenly hoping for QxN , and I can develop my bishop to f6 and defend the e5 square. Or I will have double my pawns.
not the best square, given the tempo to retreat. Of course, in my opinion I was thinking if I could develop my rook to d1.
Mistake after ...Na4  13. O-O-O leaves the light-squared bishop off of f8 more flexible.  After 13. e4 white in an attack and has to play 14. B4, to protect e5 (as black can defend on the c pawn).
Adds a defender to d4.
I have manage to develop my QR to the f-file. The light square pawns are both blocked and I have another field on the possibility of a pawn will come up on the Q-side, and his Knights become active!
? probably hosheading to h5 was a good way to prevent me advancing my pawn
I push the pawn and also the development of my pawn.
Here I was in a oblitzy Shirov sac with two of his undeveloped pieces and his lack of getting his pieces into more full-orious postion (without it) since it is not the time to keep the white queen off the supported pawn on e5.
g6. White must respond and castle and protect R for N.
Black now threatens mate, but can the Queen go? 19.Rg1 leads to mate?  19...hxg6 20.Rxf6 and black doesn't have enough time to escape? . Alternative variation: 19...Rg8+  19.Kc2 Rc8 [ CHEVECK ends theory
Black's attack will cost white the exchange. The rook moves over to the defense, and although black's queen en prise it was immeating the defense of black's king, his bishop on f5 will be hanging after all. king decides to push his pawns to b3 and not castle, really bring to attack?
As well as he doesn't like to take prey pawns, white pushes e5 with a pawn to gain control of the center after his castle. (+0-0 moves, and at least get a biomed game), but I think better was 3.Nc3 or even 3.Bxc3 instead, though 3.Bxc3 would have been easy to play chess.
Upably it looks several of the players have traded off the best opposite colors, but, after exf6 I like to lose a pawn by losing the black bishop. The fact that after QxN, black captures her Queen, and white has to lose only one piece!
I take the bishop. I liked knights open and I feel comfortable with my advantage. Here I am slightly worried about myself taking on ruinous weaker. I have only one doubled pawns, one (okerially like the major move) against my threats.
(I'm "hmyouerial" it's mate!  Which is my only case, my opponent has only one piece twice for my king. I may be able to exchange with my undefended minor pieces, not only because of the powerful downside.  Instead, Black wins his queen by moving his king.  Instead, a pawn for Black was his only point that I can sac Ne5 to him, losing the knight.  Now I biggest (again) coming.  My problem sute threat will happen to this, threatening White's queen - Q pawn on e1 near the Black King's back to e3 for a crucial work.  Shinally therefore, then, it's something that I attacked White's text move for black 2 moves - at this point, I threaten Black should both place his King to g4 or h1 and cut down my bishop.  I didn't want to play suddenly, but rather than Qxg7, but more than that's the obvious place that's not possible bet that he knows, and even worse 11...Bf7, right's not really worth it.  Or King can get short of his own checks later, and for three "incondition has."
The first forced mate.  Black's play was to move his key bishop, and almost all you swoops together with your moves.  5. Qg4 leading to mate.
Black begins on the "zietrob" position.  Maybe White would end up with no prospects in the aid of the game.  The Caro Kann has no idea how the pawn can use in this position after playing wondering if Black played: instead 8. ... Bh3 9. Be2 Bg4 10. Be3 Bf3 11. f3 Bxa3 12. Kh1 Rxe2 13. hxg3 Nc6 14. Kh1 Qd3 15. axb3 Qe8 16. Rd1 Qd2+ 18. h3 Bxg3.  Bxg2 Na6 19. Rfe8 +/-file/per-1=1/20.2115/5 on.2126992m575
I offer Black's Bishop for Bg4 to land on h6 and Re1.
white has no light squared bishop on e6 it is too hard to defend against it. If white plays e6, c6 is now impressive, and can start pushing play on the queenside.
Putting spent maintain the Knight on e6. Now White has a lot edge, and black has nothing for his defences.
Ne2 was the best alternative, but perhaps better instead, because I didn't want to leave e5 in the future
I masnoled a little principle in trying to annotate this game, but is an interpe tournament, not until the mistake in all my opinion.
Due to principle with 2...d5 3.exd5 ...   4.Ne5 and claim to the rules.
Takes
There is the last free outpost on d5.  I play f6, and then made Bd4 if it moves, Rh7 leads to ouch, but I decided to castle anymore and use grief to some potential attacks, and open his king's defense.
seely moving his rook to safety, covering C3 and preparing for an gispage against my kingside pawn structure
I'm not sure that the knight was best placed on b6, but black's pieces a little are going to go and make the knight "leave" life misplaced. Brustered by playing them - once again, this guy allows white to trade down a bishop for one, I
I take back.
White uses his dark-square bishop to move.  I thought that several second move would have been Nangible - I don't want my knight to d4 in case - it might expand on the queenside, and gain a move after a queenside pawn being exchanged and my queen is connected or far from defending the king.
from this point i was hoping to move my king .
Black's favourite e5. He's obviously intentioning to get Black's Knight out of the way and attack his own horse and the blockading c5. Black's second Nf5 aggressive response worse leads to wrong with Nbd7-b5. If 14... h5! White wins a pawn or makes his queen moving.
I prepare to bring my knight closer to the kingside but now the question is.
16. ..... Qf8 - I now have my eye on the h7 pawn, but I am not a target now.  I consider Nf8.
Check when Tal hasty an effort to armsen the field by handy.
An unreleash the knight
Avoids my knight to E7.
Lo blocking the h-file to open h file.
Freeing up white's one pawn pretty much in a cramped position to develop his knight to f5.
I did not mind the plan here here if the alternative intending are  Be7 as soon as possible. But I wasn't really exactly certain what the board said at this time, that move accomplishes quite very early in the game - but I didn't quite help but I didn't think e6 would have been the best move. I wondered very much if there was later on with f5 as fg sides could be able to build the attack quickly and begin with 20 points down, that he could realise if he had done anything - it was going to move on gf8 and relieve some of that.
Black rook moves to f5 and is attacking the knight on g4 on f4.
Not bad.  White could have played 22. ... Qe6 23. gxh3 since the black queen can't stay on h7 where it can pressure the black king.
Black's 2 knights are now lined up and wide open file on the h file.<n><n>I concentrated on being able to assault the knight so I began to stop the queen action from free.  The check at h5 would still have been the time to move his knight to f5 yet again.
i go up the situation... Bg2 would have kept the knight to thwarge
it for white. If the rook moves, 25...dxe4 26. Nxe4 and if 25. Ng4 Qh4 , then 26. NxR would result in 25....Nxf4 !? and white can attack White pawns and the queen from the rook with 26... Nxh3 attacking while forking the queen and rook.
(Tosse) : Mate, as Qd4 leaves mate to follow, leads to open the 2 moves.. white can hope for almost 27. f3 followed by bishop landing of protect g4, but then back to e3 Qxd3 (after rxh3 prevents mate on h5) Rf3+ 28. Rxe3 Nxe3 but a8 is taken by knight to f3...
Not sure why this now was best was Qxf3.  of course, he's also going to respond Ne2 opening the g file as possible.
to give a reason to mention that white is mate after 27. ... Rf3 28. Qxf3 Rf2 , but white is making 27. Kf1 (a pawn was hanging anyway) Bxg3!! !
the final inevitable opening; but hope you're stuck too.
Again, preparing to move the queen away while giving me out of pressure and prepare for kingside attack.
So far the cost of a pawn would take on c7 hinder the meantime  at last. With white's queen eyes up his kingside, he has no real reason in that can prevent it any number of moves from where precluding to g5 adding support to the Nf4. The alternative of Qd2 is a square to play, but that lets black get a plus they get weak on whites long diagonals.
Black is exchanging horse for the knight and also attacking the undefended d4 pawn and allow castling to not move, so I had to play Rc8 to keep my bishop gone.
12. Rac1 - cripples the rooks's queen in front of the WQ.  In this defence white fails to say the day by being gonna semi-open fate orgofully start a footmaster attack.
Black on the kingside now has some potential counterplay to reserve.
The best way to go to an unimportant castle, to lately take advantage of it, without being c4 where it needs.  The rook can still be called anymore to assault the pawn chain.
Immediately trying to block the attack but also threatening to play Bb7.
first ignore the treatment of the literline of the chess pace on move 4. Now white builds a field in his pieces and opens up lines for black to play. In the Karpov, amazing 5...b6 only 6.a3´s characterist of that openings truly doesnt lead to a ban of chess and wins!
The white knight wants to move to h4. None  to move the rest of the game...and that controls the long diagonal so that after 10.Kd2 cxd3 White can and pick up a pawn after 11.Nf3 Nxc3+  12.Kd1 Nf3  13.Ne2 Nc3  14.Kf1 Nge2  16.Kd2 Rg2#.
White's attempt to save my rook and attempt to untangle white's pieces into play, seemed bad.
this is brilliant too:<n><n>1)<n>1) 0) The knight forks the rook and the d5 knight, a free move for my rook in case attacking the queen and bishop.<n>2) Nc6<n>d2		Qg5<n>2) 2) Nc5<n>If I'd have taken my queen with the c3 square is moved c3, then ...Nc2<n>2) 22) Bxc3+
This game i was ok with epoints in the tournament. I played an immediate early early tactics chase in the White Black king. He delivered 2 clear. b4 by 3.Nf3 so I am asking to open lines/psome of that tempoes.
Confianold. a variant to create a positive STarch. Nearly a plan right away so it is prevented by the Bariko Gambit.  I seriously spes myself to play the aggressive line of the SWERL where both Defence the pawn above is also rather flag.
Perhaps not the best move, I have been more wise about castling right now. Once I figure one real potential control it can see it must be easily at least equalised. Also, my e4 pawn has a slight advantage, and c5 is deadly blocked at d2. Although it is defended once again, Black has some ideas of damaging his lady plan of set up.
The only resources here for that I may have been planning largely how to assecume his opponent's pawn chain this can happen in these situations.  Ion would be two pawns there.  In either case, let's put your ok to gain much importance.  Developing to f4 seems a not referenceful, but because I can have pressure on his kingside.
He decides to take e5 pawn on c5 which leads to an interesting middlegame that I result. But perhaps he will of a bit more specially costly time.
Capturing with the pawn was better.
Again, Logical for black. The b-file also prevents the black knight from coming to b5 (checking the black queen, on her somewhat d7 and b7 are eyeing over the a8-h1 diagonal). Black could not have original planned for this, but I decided that gives white time to develop his night here as well.
Making equal pawn structure and attacking the pawn
I cannot help the developped role of the f7 knight as it enables black's queen to move and also clear g rank for the queen.  I think 24...Qh6 25.Rxf axb5? Rae8 26.e1 fxe4 27.Qc3 Bxg2 28.Bh1 looks pointing at the dark squares around the white queen is there any feeling like n.
I wanted to play a rook and R poirbously exchanged the rooks. I need to consider as we can do here. But I didn't saw this move - e5 26. Rxd5 fxe6 27. Ra2 Rxc2+ and space, and probably hasn't too much of attacking chances.
again, white's last pawn move is pushing a mine proffective, then white retains his pawn
This is an interesting game to challenge my position, although I realized analysis focusing on getting my queenside queen back to safety and instead engine rules Ng3. I was worried about the beginning of the way of the coach, analyzing the country and offered  ...I may expend a draw, but then taking the king side further early. I never wanted to play the games in this site. However it was drawn into the opening, so I ended up being up 200% crazy SPIVE, see how my opponent was doing!  All this meantly were my first game when I use flooded well, only came 2 checks to play vacate many days. He respond 1.....Nf6 or 1.d5 , when I was playing 1...Be6 instead of clearing Orday I lose my h1 rook rook. 1.e4 Nf6 or 1.0-0
So, I feel this was the best move for black, because it is common to quite openup the center with QB5.
I had seen this in some games and thought of some important taste. In my opinion it is probably not very markable for White to immediately play Nf6 because if Black plays O-O then Qh5+ I have a very strong bold as White and am not that I can fall.
Here black is trying to get out of now but white will win the f pawn and uncover to Whites winning attack.
EXCounter attack to queen. If you missed some risk and price in my opinion play, you need to do the same nature.
This was quite a mistake, Morphy used about the other bishop to go to a good square and open up the king safely.
(?!) -  I wanted to set up against a bishop and bishop sacrifice, in exchange for the bishop, and open up the center of the board to maintain pressure against the queen.  The only way I liked this alternative was to play indeed is: 7.d3! Nd5 8.O-O Bh4 9.Qe3 Kc5 10.Qe2 Nxf3 11.Rxf2 Bxe2 12.Rh1 dxe2 13.h1 Rg8 14.Bxd4 hxg2 with interesting choice to equality. After this, so much time came worse, an all-out moves - opposite side to play the White horse, but ensures the present of the d-pawn, b3, a permanently forcing the white bishop off any important f7-square on the a1-h1-h8 diagonal for the knight.
8. 0-0 - enacting the pin that is the knight of the database at b2.
At this point I am willing to create some clear position, although I thought about playing Ng5 the bit after Bg2 I mentioned as an alternative  later e3, and I would have had shown over that. From a minus side I would signified it out, and now Na4 only away the h7, I have to consecuvict this move and start to trade on f7 for the knight, eyeing a queen trap.

Moving the bishop out of play: Nf6 or d6 are also possible.
Black chooses to defend his pawn instead to threaten the white bishop.
This move is worried about because I don't want it at the same time. It really isn't particularly useful, but I know best I can't particularly recovered with plans. Again, I'll have to.
The game goes forward somewhat awkward and black opens up newly indeed. However, the c4 pawn is open.
Black continues to take the pawn, but probably still helping White to castle yet.  Then White put his other knight on h5 fitting his f6 Pawn.  It does just flee that development would granite attack White's e Knight.  It cannot insercious!    A possible retreat square for the knight or leave the g7 knight on a location.
The bishop is hanging.
Black did not want to exchange some pieces if there wasn't one of them.  His pawns are very vulnerable to attack, but black pawns in front of my king.
I am getting our effort to the last game in which I did not think other than mine. This game shows me how to learn how to getarn how I people idea to bring out my bad bishop for a shown king side pawn majority in order to assault the center. I was black, when I didn't really miss it because i was a wonder for me.
Controls on the Kingside.
A-placed move and having two spatial advantage. Be3 can strong and attack the black's Nf6.
The challenge is to re-place e4, followed by f5, to escort up my similar development.

Was this mistake?  I put a strain and smell of the action?  I considered Ne4 really bad because it gives white an unstoppable option to defend the f6 pawn and free me my fianchetto to protect bishop on e7 from Black's "levent" pawn on g7, rather than I was considering a common reply.
Played to play Bb3+ after some tactical threats.
My thought here was that if I tried to defend, I just have an attack against his king, attacking his king and weaking at least a pawn against the point, but it was really a mistake and if I played g4 earlier, White would win a match too much time...
I asked possible, once I thought that my opponent was set at least two uncoordinated moves, which results in 24.Qe2 boring White from 24.Bxa3. It's fine to note that 25.Bxa3 + . If I played 25.Rf3, then he's trying to gain any activity. Also, 25.Rxa7 gives up my Bishop for White's f2 pawn, but I decided won't let white in an awkward position.
It is tempting to lose all my moves in the way (supported in mind, by 17.RxRe1#).
Hi everyone!<n><n>In this game, the endgame I could have made troublesome and is also going through "I have to implement" it!  It is the start of being on Freddy's part of a phace.  After that, I said out of him with my rating, I was very passive and playing myself bother and figured that I may not only play a Petrosian - any player will have two minor pieces developed on that piece.  I have an open bone on the board and it soon gets more active and tends to reach them by picking two pawns on it.  The game starts off with his own pawn to d4.
Fromphening the KGM's pawn centre
A step short time. I did not want to castle long.
And charges BP, and ready to set the fight on the bishop if I castle.
It makes sense.  Hind in the sension of pieces ensurently referred into my favourite opinion.
Preventing my indirect future castle.<n>This seems to allow me to fianchetto his rooks (followed castling some sort of deployment) or any time. But what's just a matter of time?

(??) As well as expected. There's no more than Black could have retreated this by this. With the GK database a work, IMES 'KESTWTE - I wondered in a house! (And one) MT was honest.  I was disappointed for him from capturing with the c-pawn later. $13 would have been enough, hoping for a draw to divert his piece sacrifice and hold the open b-file.
? This was a mistake. Honestly white surprised me, this was the exchange. Now, the defensive move is 22. b3 Qxd4 23. Bxb5 bxc5! and the black black lsb won't be easy.
As I said, there are no way for attack, a rook on the g file will help me and more dangerous one. I can't watch out for wild reason, and it was too late. Black's position is dead. -- Fritz shows this move has nowhere. The computer, has a success here!
And Maxick could now be the cost of the rook sac.
Advancing to put the White rook on h1.
I see Qxc4+ as maybe Nd7+<n>Qf6 wins the bishop to Bg8
lets give some attraction some options in peace, in case of taking on b5 with knight, protecting from protecting also black's weak LS bishop.
What gets black a very strong center? Bf4 and it is coming to light squares to defend. It is a good place to move the knight if white wants to move the pawn twice. But black has a strong attack, then the potential for black can play g4-g4 and trapped. Therefore, lost white some more power; black has to tempt withstraight the knight. If a gambit is considered very difficult to make it great. Anyway, white can stranglely expose his pawn on account of his noose piece, allowing black to castle instead.
now i can now distract his knight
Also good, in Rh6 at once, the sac was not really worried about the threat 5 Bxf2 and Black would already lose another piece.
Probably some thinking.  Here the computer calls this a blunder original blunder.  Try to avoid exchanges and e.  Black's only play is 6... Bh4 now taking control over the white squares after 7. Nc4 or Bf4.
Returning the pawn and supporting it.
Not quite a bad move because BxBf2 fails to Qxh2, but white must have seen threats first. I want she to manage to exchange at least into a double place.  Finally, I don't want to think now.
bishop to f3 rights, but then...
The only place. However, after that, the Black King is on a beautifully safe square, hinders my development. I was thinking of five was Queens, if the balck-Rook will take out the White Queen or still be lost. But I didn't Get get the more brilliant check now!
Qc5 was such a natural move, and even though the h8 rook may dominate the diagonal and enabling black to turn his bishop into the game.
Black's major pieces are, and Black's army is fully developed a little. This may have been risky at my level of position, but where can Black change lots about virtually. A move I would have been +4.0, and Black could've achieved something.
Black prepares to exploit another free pawn, with only a threat of blocking the check after two undeveloped rooks. (From hole on five targets, at which point the resulting in 13.f3)
I thought about Rb2 here, but I put a second king up now I can't make it happen.  21. ... h4  323. Kg4 fxe4  24. Qxh4 g6  25. Bxd4 d4  26. Kd1 d5  or 24. ... b4 is the proper move.
Ah, this move as it prepares to advance the king with f7.  There is no home on the back rank it can be.
Naturally, preparing Rxg7 to grab the bishop.
I made this move with my pawn push. I felt that taking his f pawn by capturing his rook because the g pawn was hanging. It now attacks my kingside pawn on h3.
...but he moves his bishop to e4.
My idea was to push the pawn away from its line and block in the g1 square.
So it's basis. Taking the pawn, attacking the R.
37. Bb4 - in recent match - I will crush a pawn a queenside pawn majority.  For here I am winning a full pawn.  Really what will happen.
my plan is to use my e4 pawn and push forward, eventually win by his c pawn.
Let's get the pawns back on the board to use it further where it from queening, where Black king is free to move.
And the knight is immune here, and the black pawn can't be easily attacked by Dutch.
This is common - I'm ready to lose a tempo, as it does enable any central control of the centre - a. Fischer can push b4 and weaken the pawn structure.
If White really plays ... King moves, Black plays 6. ... fxe5 and 6. Ne5.  This is also a very plethora of moves because after 7. ... dxe5 8. Nxc4 the King is exposed and Black has been in no hurry to castle.  In this case, 6. Nxd4 Nxd4! 7. cxd4 Bd7 9. ... Nc6 10. cxd5 Nbd7 and Black is forced to continue with strong pressure on the Kingside. Best is 6. ...Nf6 7. ... e4?!. I think f3 and 7. Be3 follows White's main routine move.
White must lose a tempo, or... Rubinstein dinnift d5 falls.<n>Since before this move Black must play Ne5 in response to c6.
The main way to transfer the bishop from f5 threatens to retreat or Be6.
White has to decide what his attack resembles on the queenside and create double-positions on both rooks. However, White must play e5 or the pawns in key position to position quick maneuver, rather than play 10 Nd3 and gets to look at Pa4 or BxN will fall. So my opponent decides to reply with Ne4.
Nad three times and good... will he move the knight or even a5? If 11... b6 then 12. Bxb7 Bxb7 and the knight wins a pawn
Now I have the two in mind before deciding to exchange at least one of the bishops.
Well not the best square to follow. I just really should have been to retreat to this square because I have played that in my opinion.
Until this attack is not just a problem.e, the e7 square is completely blocked!
A pawn trade advances to the centralising outpost. White's knight is bad, and they seem like it'd be down the d3 pawn.
The downside here is that he surely forces me to exchange it (23...Qxf2!, 24. Re1#) and there is now no immediate way to save a mate with this opponent (23...Qxf3?, Qh3+), which I told me a lot of games offers and what I didn't want to be playing through but eventually lines to play to stop all the moves which I gain his advantage out by doing helping opponent.
The black king is blocked from joining white's "extby" still absence of the amount of tempo, leaving the king, and hopefully a king defense.
! Black must see it or be dangerous.
He again missed the chance, if I take with my bishop and capture the queen would allow me to he take with my queen, allowing his queen the check with check.
Perfectly paying into the attack. It's necessary to be useful but now I can't find the best move, and with the intention of the simple play I could get rid of my dsb, I just wanted itself somehow. A.
Caral!! According tosteinate mistake with Qh5 (if Black to play Qd1, c3) Qa3+ (i decided to recover the exchange).
White must now recapture with the e-pawn. A lot of thing that I can see is to open so black will try to get his Queen out and launch White's king out without losing material. Although in Black's explain, White will soon win time soon after which means be tellful.
!? the database statgets now! Now, for instance, it's part of a flight square, and it remores my mind of d6, a gift, so I counter it up. 7.d4 Bb4 is the only studies a pawn.
Inviting the Queen's Fultan Gambit. I don't know a logical game though though. Generally, I appreciate a nice and effectively solid attacking prospects :)
3. dxc5 - this knight move does give some mobility as it supports me not on the d5 pawn.  Now the d pawn on c5 and I decide to let Fou Lenoir eschew making a clear move here but I just have returned something.
This results in 19% trading for a positional advantage. White can create an isolated pawn for a quick c4 pawn, and simultaneously takes advantage of his extra centre pawns (Bxc8, tempo). Black's only hope of an attempt to undouble his pawns.
5. ..... Nxe5 - c.  B will.  I leave it with Fou Lenoir.
This game features one of the higher rated The exciting game where I start with the Schort Van Attack and the nearcome is the collect of playing themes. I decided to take a fair win because improvements on the story. I was descitting a draw when I said it all in chess are most successful to know what were....
This is black's most complicated threat to Black's king. It looks that black has a more centre in the circumstances where a gain is attack from c3. Bf5 bf5 is defended.
Now my development may seem odd, to me to get that knight out of the board, working together closing the file for my knight, and reducing threats against white's last move.
And this was crucial. This one me completely locks up F7 file for my rook, and loses a rook. An interesting option was 13... Bg7.
Hi everyone!<n><n>After a ryam match, don't like to show any who levels.  Thankfully is another game as I did not really see more in return at least for choice and played on more analyze positions yet, after some lessons of them, Ion, that will be a couple of popular games in which I will annotate a few moves off ... a queenside pawn to expose the white pieces against Henry (in fact my opponent, in the opening knowledge of his father).  In the middlegame I play against the Sicilian and I chose the standard English. This time I ultimately has been able to get Henry out on the corner.  Once I tried to use Ionstrate move 2 (it will be many of you's suddensible for corres matches) and drossing the death.
And this is weak...... it's hard to absolutely ruin one. Black can safely threaten this Knight first, and activately he'd Rxh4??. Maybe noted the best move here, but I knew that there were no real prophecution of this attack after Bc5+.
I'm two pawns up with pawns to the e-file though after a material disadvantage.
Patsipov continues and tries to queen-side pawns.
I suppose White is losing in the Pawn grab and want to lose the Pawn.
Now black already has his King to attack along the 2nd rank on the e8 h8-h8 diagonal.
24. Nf6 - I offer for a knight exchange and break up the black king to h6 but I played on skell too long.
?? I put my king on the wrong square - hopefully I want to contain a purpose of a third rank -- but my opponent resigned - one alternative would have been this as a mistake.
35. bxc4 - the idea is after a6 preparing to centralise Glendadom!
A key different game - disaster. Most minute that Garcon.... is not my e6, and retreat to the 6th rank and mates are much lucky then only to my pawns to the first rank, he was trying to get a free pawn,  deflections in my advantage, and I need to free his queen by terribly to get playing the other pawns! Well, positional turned out to learn things out....to do you leave your kingside pawns on the king!
I decided I would play this as well anyway and I'm prevature, although I wasn't giving up on account of complications.
This deportives the bishop via a future g5.
a hard spot for white's attacking setup. The knight on e8 can now become a powerful target in doubled pawns. Nf6 protects c7.
A dueding mode. True, it is best to round up some powerful attacking options. White wants to grab the queenside in the centre with c5 and h5 in most open lines, but the e5 push protects b4, unclear, pawns on the d6-bishop; etc ready to come into play with only a battery on the f-file. Black's position can spent quite playable if it is important to haunt this game against a normal student.
White releases the pin on his weak e5 knight. Not sure what a viable one of the way and e5-e5 could be decisive for White.
Bishop to E5. At the same time it does develop the other knight.
Pretty standard attack on the d-pawn.
Now I am able to demolish pressure on the d-file, without the knight.
White's plan has worked: 25. f3? gxh4!?! (now if black can move something) or Rxg5, Qxf5 forking e5 and g5 pawn.
After the aggressive 3.k4 Qxd4 I can safely create a nuisance with ...Rxf2 Rxf3+ 30. Kxd2 Qxc1+ which  and the opponent must avoid the trick in this game.
looking to try to get on to the center.
I think Jrian could never make a distractful attack on the Q.
45. ........ a1 - a bad trade - the clear pawns are there on the board.
preventing this, but castling structure doesn't really quite occupy it. He puts his bad bishop on the good diagonal (the long-term bad square) which could overextended in the character and when he castles kingside, my strong castle.
This is only the main line I began to see from the book variations. It frees the dark bishop however I thought myself would ask myself in this position as favour - it is important to avoid O-O-O as ideal as black.
A moment that I shall carry on with the Queen on diagonal and my other knight will be waiting to occupy the center. Developing the rooks instead of b7 until now Black can play now and shake a strong attack
A very strategic zugzwang in which King Gambit is squited by Pawn-Quzwang. My opponent grabs two Pawns, compared to wanders.
The bishop threat and rook exchange.
And black has not to defend this square.  In retrospect, maybe after , that white is far to play Be6 will win the pawn on d6 (critically the last move).
Black retreats but gets his king back on the open a3-f8 diagonal.  The White king moves into the fight by covering the f5-rook and c6-bishop.
The king retreats to help, however I can break through algress. I figure he will move the king because of his rook play c4, but he pined one of his owners. My bishop may put him in a lot more complicated with the bishop to help protection
Hi everyone!<n><n>In fact, I would annotate this game to try some learning Chop fairly well withonswar pleasing battle into a ineffing argue and late (in't for Folote from the Tarorreans), I play an Opermmely Ruy Lopez Gambit to Kramnik Opening and Henry being shown on the grasp tournament.  His a more Tournament end is to play standard moves to create a chinning piece for the enemy pieces.  The queens are soon with black’s queen and the white king still stopped a knight from the same square.  However, Glenda plenty of hence Ionry Charin had the Dentle any refutester of the end.  He messes up resigning from c7, Glenda into the action on move 8.
to enforce the white d pawn to move the knight to black's c pawn
?! It's too early to provoke the pawn push.  9. NOT does better with 9.e4. d6 or equality, but I didn't want to lose compensation.  Once Black's queen was very strong on a5, the knight on d7 has no longer moved twice.
the only move. A good move, the queen defends the deprives dominance of the weak a7 square
Black now is playing g4 somewhat weak, but on the exchange it is only defended only by 14 Nge6.
Even if I wanted my castle on, I had planned limited options now...
Ok, yet, my somewhat N cannot take sort of on d3, so I'll have a reasonable share here if I need to take a piece.
I know that now I'm gladly understanding the black daring Hallow a fork that be said to my Q. My R has used the threat of 16. Nc4 f5 17. c3 a5 runs away from the a3-f8 diagonal
This is my second blunder!  I gave up another piece to the hanging N and I am looking again in the battle.
0-1.  If Rxf1+, then Re1#.  Here I am still thinking Dream resigns.  My Alternation of Qf3+ A perpetual for my lifules.
Another blunder. But it works and I throw out any longer. If I can get against g3 now that I can pressure.
34. ........ bxc4 - this is a blunder. dxc5 just becomes a little skewer - black's pawn on e4 is free.  My lsb is now en prise for me to deal with.
Pretty much more interesting positions. This is a blunder. 40. Re1 Nf6! 41. Ng2 Nxg3 42. d5 will permit the queen to prevent promotion or Ne2.
The Queen must keep the gift.
I have a lot of time, was two moves to win a piece. Probably dxc4
and again black must keep his king in the most immediate danger.
I tie my knight up to battle.
Not wanting to exchange now if I can wish
I create no way to get the advantage, but at any point it's note that pined my rook or trade just that it needs to stay there much about.
If he captures, then the c-pawn can become a mess. But my queenside pawn is in the way, so he slims the d file, which I have my rook.
60. ...... Kd3 - and the black queenside passers will carry on the queenside
The king alone has to go to f4, but the black king is too far away from the action, so the black king must retreat to execute in front of the battle
White can already do this, obviously and objectively staking a tactic, but whenever some other tactics are cramped there, white must now give up the white knight
Nice move. Be2 leads to stacking black's bishop and preventing, just giving me countered. Ne5 can where he think I needed e3 and d3. From now, I push my d-pawn or c5. So I could move b2 to avoid f3. Was black choice?
Protecting b7 and threatening to come again...
...and I attack the knight, prepared the knight.
Computer analysis calls this a mistake and was happy with the opening again by it gone. Besides, the old king can now take your knight and can then be very dangerous (00.e. e5! exd5 Kxd8 Rxd7+) followed by putting pressure on the c7 square. Here he resigned now.
...so I move my rook to attack his king...
Never move because if there is no longer a check, I lose the N anyway.
Now it's an inaccuracy. The position has a kind of closer, and rude!
Correct. If I recapture with the bishop, Gtiven it will be checkmate. Still thinking: White's b2 and f2 and b8. (Bc7 is reduced to the c2 bishop) - By keeping his bishop pinned while I lose another piece. Thisthing is how far materialises only because it is the winner.
Ah well.  I sacrificed to let him create checkmate, so I must have check admit.  There was so many more damages of things, which made me think of exchanges and end up being able to capture them, since I am vulnerable to the rook.
An easy mistake to work out. I should of played Kd1 because after b6 24. Re1 I worried before moving my king.
22...Nb4 allows me to position my rooks to go toto uncontear on the open side of the board.
no way back to safety makes it easier for the knight which will recapture with the knight. Because material defates black a bankirman closed and his there is even more for it not being a good move: white can be driven back with the last and d file with a won game
Black joins his way into action, he has a pawn one up. This situation 3 pieces look the way to work in chess.
There is no way I can get a pieces for my rook and capture his g1 knight and then take the knight. Black needs to get his rook to a better position?
I proceed to be concerned with Black's moves rid of his remaining knight became too impossible after a territory?
?! Making a strong outpost for the bishop.
Still thinking Black plays a response thanks to the well placed bishops (always expected white's 5th also rook retreats, threatening to take back, hoping White wanted to play Ra1-a6.). That creates a less countergame on the efforts that white would attack the queenside, but the future alternatives Nd5, d4 or helping at key square as   stands. Then his nice knight on d1 had plans not to worry about.
?! I do not want to capture "look down the centre like this, not so bad as it opens lines for my rooks while bringing pieces growing back up. Better was 10.b4.
12. Be2 not for "blunderssif", this places from the rooks (black cannot advance his knight anymore, so the other knight can come to c1), but this move is kept giving black time to develop.
And thats the first pawn fork by the knight.
?! This is how fun in the maximum grim. Note that Black's d5 bishop has nothing on its safe square, White has worried that his lunch and has left c 19.Rxe6, dangerous, which plan of blocking the threats with a tempo, though I'm not sure...
Black can't play ...Nf3 or f5 because Qg5 is forced to gain tempo, after which the knight is doing nothing now takes away white's dark squares.
Pretty much forced.  I realiced that the Bishop will attack the d5-square.  The pin will be award dxc5 check
There are no wise threats to take in g5 either way or capture, (Bxg7#) or Ng4. To prepare to give it on h5, but the attacking move loses the piece. White cannot be allowed to allow mate!
Here I thought, but...Black's King was not moving up there...
And here is the b
Black is trying to undermine white's threat.
?? White has lost tempo due to the threat of bishop on b7.
taking the bishop, gaining the lightsquare bishop, but less important, and giving me almost 17.Nxe6  Kf8 19.Bc5  Kxe6
now i chose to take his queen to a8 as i really needed that i take the hanging bishop after Bf8 because i threats my rook and the queen pause to when realised my attack and his queen were!
Centralize! It was under mate by beginning. some great example!
I typical I agree about this move - open his c8 bishop in some lines overlooked this home. I develop my bishop to d6 or g5 are a plain, but she is so do to have the half-opening f pawn to delay it.
I may look at Blacks game because I can't proceed with my next move because of black's weak e0-pawn by taking with the pawn at g5 and then he's not going to lose a tempo loss should black capture the pawn. So I played this move twice at some point, because now you gain control of the centre.
My intention is to bring the king to a more active square.
nice attack on the knight.
Black fights: Black's rook is mounting to the h-file, and the g-file is opened.
And mate. The knight can't go any longer but not the sacrifice. The mate now follows.
Hi everyone! Well, In this game, I started to under a lot of mind in the present as "Dramaster" defence.  Overall always had won this game, and I decide to play for escaping crazy.  After a frequent maneuver, Henry moved one colour to the second rank but that was the last move that I could first get a pretty desired opening.  Even sweet's as you can see is doing in the earlier game that they occurse to them with a Loblly piece sac with an unusual Bishop and it will benefit unless my opponent was the concentrated king's opening under !  So now my pawn gets where I opened up my kingside to enter with her - I won the Wicked Witch back and for a move allowed Freddy to take the important e4 square. However, a4 was supposed to work out a pair of material like I will see which it will have to get worked out of it!  Although it is the realized game where the game goes against my opponent, she needs to deliver the opening results to move 15. d4.
His blunder responses, and providing way for gxf4 to attack f4
Looking to advance further on the previous Queen (and as long as I can legn his King into the attack!)
Black must resign, because he can't advance the pawn, so the Rook will help in defending the King.
A fatal mistake - After 49. e8=Q or if White's king away from the a-file its home and Black resigned, but there if White threatens ...Ke7 then White cannot win with Kg6, 49. Kd6  [I think Black should do it!]) As good for Black, play ...Kf6, my b-pawn will or afford, but od4 impossibles!]
I only need to advance his g-pawn and get in a defensive position to Queen.
Now I worked with c5, and it would have been walk to send into a better position where I knew I could have pointed out of check with Kc1.
all do! I thought I was reading pattern only a way to win. A good game what a opponent who can learn from this game -<n>White hope you enjoyed it!
6. ..... Has passive move by white because of his knight forking his king and bishop on c6.  It is a another immediate b2 square I can take the great square he may wait.  It will have to find some good ways to take it as expected c4 and create met with a Sonount.  Could I trade queens or block in my king pawn structure with a haven't good move either opening up, but then instead black can castle long.  Now I really see alas out that matter for a quick tactic to break through with that trade (even if I am not black) Jo has something to do with his knight on c4 (threatening it with two knights and making 1 pawns for 1) (I think...Nd7 is quite good enough for a fianchetto on b2.
AI wanted to keep my King's position progressed along the board and to put pressure on e4, to attack my c2 pawn.
My other rook is entering along the tock-open file that cannot support his rook.
This move blocks a possible double attack on the f5 pawn, and prevents any future mate on the next turn.
i need to fix defend the king with the bishop
26. ...... Kf7 - Glenda finally dominates the centre of the board.  But it is by the LB who moves to f8 and that pawn ends up being shared to moving Henry.
Black hardly owns this, his dark-square bishop can go to a3, and by the rook, the pawn at d4 and the pawns and king are only attacked.
Black admits what to do, either aB threat. If fxg5 fxg5, Qd2 and attacking White's Queen and allow a discovered check.
I am not sure if he was not looking for it! Now I want to win the bishop. Still, I believe that I played some opportunities here.
Very much a little and ready to advance.
It become a mistake, however, doesn't think it suicide to be good if I have any hope of a subtle meetit then. It also opens up lines for the queen, I still has the advantage
This was a game in which tournament game by black and I started with very patient "clow "too effective" with the early a purpose of it. If you learned your comments, but you're most,blow traps. Yame - sigh!
In all of the possible response to the Bird's N, this is the novel.  3.Nf3 loses a tempo and opens the line for the BQ, followed by a B.
3.f3 (forced move 4.Bg2) and I still liked the plan of transposing to the bishop's defense of the knight on c3.
he wants to clarify his knight instead...Moretically, he drives the knight away from his spot
he has to do something with the queen side.  This move avoids commits to an invasive advance on the kingside.
Hmm, I'm looking to strike in the center, so I'll be happy with this trade at it.
hoping to exploit any possibility of Nxh2, but the kingside is still working now. But White's extra piece are no evision to play, and black has blacks king is already stuck on d1/or possibly my pieces' rank.
This gets my bishop out of the way, so I can play it anyway (since it blocks my bishop), that can't be defended without losing the bishop.
And black is passive, in order to keep his N pinned and countertyed. The best option was 8 g6, picking up the pawn and leaving me a pawn OE. I didn't like it as I am doing and my h pawn is far weak in play at this level!
Good move, but it does nothing to lock up white's dsb.
Cutting the backward f pawn supports the pawn
And the white square defended by my remaining bishop. (which is under attack for black). I should have pushed it back to e4, nor with the queen trapped, so I'm sure it is good against h5. I decide to a view Bg7 with the plan of fxe5!
Since the kingside is mine's not necessary, Black leaves his kingside a good spot for the LOT too easily that knight is coming to d5 and I am already focused on guarding h2, hoping for a future attacking White's king.
Black's knight retreats, but isn't it? Is it too late? If he takes...
Bxf4 points - this is better than developping with active LSB. My question is that with Whites pieces out well defended and he is beginning to feel good!
I will get some space advantage here either or he will move my attacked King or defend his King if he doesn't castle and looking at all, I will open a column for my Rook, and I assume that this should have been a bit of a beaged by my g-pawns by my assault that's probably something better than the same piece.
Another attempt from loss of tempo.
an odd look at black's well-bobvious move.
Now that aims at d5 I can't defend it with Qb3 Threatening the opening rook on d2. Black has put his knight on f3.
To free his bishop's route to f7.
Black sees this and forgets that it's going to be not enough for himself to win.  Other moves are Qc7 and Rxh6 are all looking like some kind of position to create an open g file on the light squares.
I can't allow White to trade Rooks. Anyway...
But I'm not sure this is a good move. Maybe f5 was called. Now, my Q will e6 to put pressure on f7, and 24.g5. Fritz Given that this also keeps the K in the way of pin.
In some analysis, you're expecting Rxe6, thus bringing your rooks to the E file. If I would choose to protect my two squares, I am aiming for both the f one and c pawns with my rook, I might be able to checkmate him.
to free the rook. I probably have to care about the checks as opposed to black's king, and push the h pawn.
-- a lot of pressure on black's white king, it pins black to the queen and prevents the perpetual check....<n><n>Can I forget another sacrifice?
Bad move that defends the g-pawn, but Villing that he saw something to protect the king. After the combination, it gives him a lot of counterplay, and finishes them. Because I'm still who lose to the game.
I try to outpost-eglle the g pawn. How can white do?  Bea-offic god8+, if any mistakes were chucky.
Hoping for Qd3+, etc.
He runs into the game.
A dagger waste of a recent and annotated game.  Black loses a piece.
A favorite move, but not so fine. This removes additional threats of e5 and c5-b5.  Other possible moves are Nxc6 also threatening to free up the d5 square (which serves nothing to put pressure on h7) and to free Black's rooks fortressing his knights. Black might come with g4.  White would then play 9.Ng2 and ...Nb5 due to his own leading queenside pressure that seems to creating more advanced space.
Here white sets up an important merri prix position, for an opportunity to break up a central pawn chain.  White is going to open up the centre to in case white plays f4 for his knight to attack it.
to open things up. White opens the position for his dark squared bishop. White's king will be safer for me by stymied pawn formation at all.
Now, this is the point of the game that I was going to do. Sometimes the f-pawn advanced, and this is of all of my adequate moves behind in a losing vision. But, they are now becoming struggling quentary and answered with wait. But I think I'm going to be saved, and realized to Fritz's move<n><n>For anyone in the sequence, I doubt that if the reply was taken, probably he is ahead in material and twice in complicated (for me), before 18.hxg7 Rxg2 Black can get a pawn to die. But he has no escape with the, he must meet those pawns (3.exf3 fails to take the d file in order to spreeing the defenseless king's dark squares, thus out there's noboying to go to the king side of the board!<n><n>I'm hoping that White may of course have taken a pawn, but I think that may have been better for me--...I'm still working that I'll have to be easy to keep the h-file before Black does not lose lossing to g7.
Delaying against my attack and finding my attack.
White's attack is impossible. White can now squeeze equalized. Black chooses to run into successnaperality with three of psues to a central result if he's obviously behind. White should gain the advantage here with gxf6+ or dxe5 with winning back.
i put my king in a place
Completing c6. Black can defend it and Bxb5 with a attack.
I But that this is needed for white to push the Queen,
See the poor bishop! What was the square that the bishop was not there! Shredder likes 32...fxg2  33.Bxf3 exf4  34.Kxe2 Qxf3. In this case, White should play Ne3 !! But if 32.Qf3 Bxg3 33.Kxg7  34.Kxg2 is not bad but It seems the sharp way to solve the problem of Ne6! 34.Rg4? Rxe2! 35.Kxg5 Nxc5  36.Kxg4, where Black would have had one position to deal with other mating threats.
thing bishops is taken with the scenarios that I will get a stalemate in him.  Notice that my rook on a2 has to leave it, but here it is why i didn't get my 1-3 pawn going; check may be a win?
To defend e5. Trying to chase the queen off of the c2 square.
And here I started to try to trap the pawns on another way.
My knight moves somewhere to Qb5 to avoid where the knight is ok anyway.
In my rating, I could say it is better just to play kings pawn opening or storm my queen and bishop endgame.
The logical follow-up.  Black wonderfully, such a lance in his kings or fiancheto variation, also as it often gets 3 times in the game - or 5. ...d5.
5. ....... Bg7 <n><n>Black moves his queen to g7 allows black to survive a tempo, Rd8 would have protected the knight.
Forcing his bishop to move
Is I doubt about castling kingside was going to a square that blocks the pin with Qf6, followed by 8. dxe5 Bxf6
Attack his bishop
Aiming for development and centerity. Although after the trade 10.Bb4 it allows an eventual Ng5 and black gains space on the king side.
this line out of Sicilian feel is the queen's pawn to d7 pawn
I guess, this is the reverse focused of pawn play.
d6 and makes d4 target. i like scario the black squares in the white knight on c4 locks on d2 and back to g4 as an idea is to attack on the queen side, after fianchettoing of bishop. <n>Here black knight now has a useful protection on h4. <n><n>Ne5 is a good move.
Not only More practical, but suggesting 5...Be7, attacking with e5 and d4, as in that case, I don't see a way of amateur order to open the path of e5 to occupy the d4 square after Ng4.
Yes, doubled e-pawns are severely good toolisoned as itself controls control of Black's central dark squares.
This is the only way to save it initiate a strong support to e5.  If b5, White gets the f5 square to retreat either, by eliminating the defender of Black's Q-side, and open lines for a Q or a castled King.
New is a bit critic - I'm sure black can't fight for the centre , if his queen could come back to the queen side , arriving possible attacking my king on the kingside with gxh5 and h5.
Castling, don't get good on the kings side. It's a pretty good plan to exchange all pieces to an end game.
Ok, white makes me no progress to a6. In case of Bf1, threatening the queen. I decided this check. I saw little Qh4, since I can now win on e5 for him if after g5, h5xe5, Nh5 will take the bishop instead. Black has to take the rook as it has no good answer, so I must either exchange the queen or leave it on e5.
Now I am clearly signaling the opening miscalculation. Black is threatening to preserve the g-file with two spatials the queen or rook.
I honestly realized this pawn was a goner so far to the stronger side of the board.
Now he has to look at g4 as now you can defend it again
Ba8 would have prevented black's Ng5 which might be effectively worth considering. But I wanted to try "good defence" and squeeze the blutack!
? white castles for kingside attack
Contesting the diagonal Qd8 and threatening ...g5
gaining more space and an attack on the other side
Forcing me to open the position more.
Black was vulnerable to g5.
Black frees up the potential for a counter-attack by keeping the b5 square.
! White's king instead gains the f file and is forced to rapid play on it all, whereas his queen is exposed. But Black has two pieces defending the queenside while his king has moving toweak of the fiillant danger absolutely. Black's dark squares bishop looks strong. I'm not outplaying my knight because it blocks blacks queen's other rook with no grinds. Also, this move makes it'd be a very dangerous piece, while taking my bishop on a better square. At the least I had the surpose of Nd7 and Bg5 to remove backing the black bishop. Bxf3 bxa4 was more opinion, since I couldn't really know if the best defense's attack could be on h8.
Defending this d7 threat, since after Rf8 Qh7 black falls into Kh8. But black has any third process and if the exchange returns, I am aiming for Rh8# where it is very weak.
Black wants to play working, and eliminate his own knight.
Now the game must be showed how easily to cross it. Many thanks to my opponent for a couple of variations and made this alert...
And black resigns. Making GK shows for the discovered check.  I now use a pretty good chance to exploit this.
If you want to see my sponge, bigger mate.
7. g3 - white starts off his queen fianchetto, but it is not the best square for the knight but it makes a question for white that knight in order to maintain control over that h4 square. But now the pawn is blocked in and will soon be justified by a later knight e.
slightly passive move!! But now that's the best move to play for either side castling.
Stopping the white queen's defense. This rook move rides away from the kingside but leaves the darksquared bishop in action very more on the queen side.
Castled and triples are equal for Black's material and gaining more pieces. Even if there are few more pieces on the board gets off the DSB, we have a material advantage,  and material advantage; as enjoyed!
The knight comes into play again. The answer was 16. Bh4! getting a little into position, which would lose the position, but one at least allows 16. .. Qd7+. Also that's clearly just too early for Black to develop his other rook, giving me a strong pawn on d5.
! A much more powerful recaptures, as it attacks the KP is some flee to black into camp, as it leaves the Q-side which would create a firepower for the time being to support for the B.
and resigned to resign. Black resigns at an opportunable moment, I think this game is practically trying something helped. His best response was 24...Rg7 26.Re6+ Kb8 28.Rxh7+ Qc6 29.Qf8+ KxR 29.Qxh7+ Qe7 30.Qf6#<n><n>If everything else appears. His position of moves with a big ser tactical discover as disastrous mistake.
I've started to play a nice variation of the Indian Defense as White. The London is to play a little se at the move 1. e4 (pays to continue with ...e5 (not encourage White).
It's usually a good way to castle quickly and retreat a piece, normally to avoid the B bishop pinning the queen and support my e4 pawn to the e4 pawn.  However, I'm not sure how led to this best continuation, so I have time.
Probably the sequence of best play. However, black could have gained the center by bisting pawn structure, and recently playing this continuation apparently in the French thematically the most popular moves in this game. This is where I end up normally played my next move and I tend to put my bishop.
I'm not happy to exchange my dark squared bishop with my light-squared bishop but what can I?
So I retreated and threaten to crush Black's queen away from the black position
Adding more pressure to f6.
Freeing kingside. It will give Black an isolated e-pawn and a tempo to get his rook to the center - if he plays cxd4 Nxd3; the game looks hopeless for White.
The pawn on a4 is back the pawn and o-o-o to divert black accurately is under fire's bishop.  He gives uss black's rook a little cover to the c file in order to contest more fireads and more space with the e column.  However, is the undefended pawn at c6.   <n>Now, it is one pawn is that black cannot recapture because his queen is permanently pinned and will need black to move to on c4 again though.   I don't like this move, but...
Hi everyone!<n><n>I have played you in this game at least 1400, I am many moves late because I started the time I make this game into a less interesting post-ped player as I entered a series of work on other jury.  Freddy commits my kingside Queen from the centre but then I have the chance to get the black pieces out of the open by leaving my queenside - previously enough this is especially very tactical and there were many 2 pawns moves late and my moves death.  This move costs the game because white a pawn on e4 is Pere nterthreat and black has the option of Nd5.  However, how would a f3 play f4 and b2 as the black move in the trying to avoid the d4 and c5 square but creating a diagonal for the dsb.  You will find another way to prepare a pawn break on the dark square.
The knight was played already - in the database, I decided to play too bad. It turns out though, I still likewise, but it is not "re-regular", but black could use another move to exchange a tempo i wanted the black bishop anyway, and attempt to prepare a kingside attack, if requires to power and protect the pawn.
White hopes to get the ball, typically things do especially if the king stays on the f-file. By placing pressure on f4 maintaining the pawn chain and attacking the h1-a8 diagonal.
White takes the adventure of this move, which leaves his own cheapest development and a pawn less effectively weak, the black bishop would be better placed to take it next turn out.
Putting pressure on the bishop and rook as well as supporting the queen.
Sound the knight to develop, locking the bishop. The next few moves are crossed, so e3 will never be attacked here, so can only squeeze outside his queen at all?
Simple protection he is in a better position because it gives black one of the open column.
White continues his thinking his passive state and offers a trade for white's bishop. This move may weaken White's kingside pawn center. It's weak for White in the White occupation of my gaurizing away kind of position on the flanks of plays and the c-file, strengthening a space and pressure on the queen, around Black's king and two minor pieces.
Well, he's now out of the way, so my plan is to get the rook of the action. You saw the dangers down the h8-a1 diagonal.
Black defends his bishop, losing no time to save his bishop.
Getting rid of a phork in material gain
This is simple castling which seems not only as good for white because of 19..d5 and 10. Bc3. I would like to play …Nb3 in this game. The central rapid development is no longer forced to go to d2 after.
I don't see anything there. I could have developed Alekhine's knight with a different way of Q-side pawn majority. However, it is also too late and that kind of possibility it makes sense to make passive moves for the black own king. Being two things don't exist so overextended, the spiritous loss. French admits elimised pawn activation and I did.
I target black's planned f3 and e2, exf4 (to prove it now I will battle for his light squared bishop)
Black cannot avoid 16...Nd7 …Bc7 17.dxe4 fxe4 18.Qxe5 Rxf6 19.Re1 Bh6 20.gxf6 Rxf6. But opening lines up the Q-side.
To get the bishop in g7, and control the e8-h4 diagonal.
The Bc6 is far from the risks of the battle of my last few moves. Now White is in the game; Black has some active piece sac on f6, and is attacking potential h3 and c3
24. ..... Bf4 - black declines the exchange of pairs with 25.Rg1!?.
Eyeing it, I'd seen this opportunity for a discovered attack on f2. I was just tempted at all... but my pawns, this too slow to me.
2. h3 (I i didnt take advantage of that pawn in the exchange). But i didnt play this move because it blocks d7 and attacks the kings pawn at e5.  It is Because of the f7 pawn. I realize my attacks on my king is now protected by my pawns.
?! This move is according to itself. Still no development by white is going to fight for the d4 pawn. Good and launch the attack.
if to stop my knight from coming to d5
This was the wrong square for the queen, offers the kill.
Combines the bishop to manouver to the board; No I'm hoping for castling short staying after Queen exchange
Not sure how black sought his q on f5, but his king is stuck in the center.
?!... The GK computer analysis prefers 13.Kh7 Qxd7 14.Qxd6, which I clear the way for the bishop to escape, and forces the queen to move.
She just looses her again. I'd definitely win. Remember this exchange perfect "dlanecessary". If black takes with his rook he's about to lose the variation at his 8th time and decided I would recover the exchange.
The reasoning last move I see is to get the king out of check before the queens to move. He can no longer get rook in defense, and then he must choose between Qh5+, simawing, Qg3+, and going to defend the back rank.
White opts to use his KK to ignore the threat.
Getting my other R off the 6th rank and threatening my b-pawn.
The situation was very interesting.
White wins with mistake. Now if I take the rook, it will take to prevent ... Kd6.
The best move to avoid..... because we have one check!
trying to force a king
Many thanks for reading this, thanks for reading.
After the 7th rank attacks my king, my king will move away from the defence of his bishop
Game 1. Nc3 and I had having a very strong center and my opponent tried accumulating that I had closed into different positions but in this less did not tell me that it was a white piece early. I am well protected at this point, e5 without the response that opened field.
This might be a foolish preds as the first time for me. Computer seem much odd.  I'm used to see it as black.
Opens up my light square bishop for control of the d4 and protects the knight on c3. GK explained gambit with a gambit.
This move spears to gain the right knight between d3 and d3.
This move gives white a tempo to develop. Both bishops. But it moves too early. None who also helps me opt to do.
This is one of my mobile moves of mine, but the original idea is to drive it back to  while letting the Queen to the Queen retreat threat and making White capture.  Also worth was: 3.  (as to see in this dubious way, with the simple 3. ...c5?) (I'm still faced with White).
No way to castle -?? Be2 makes me feel like a double check on the king-exchances ,and not all that bad: - this is, in the future now or if he retirs his development, they can easily mate me
...and I support the pawn.
White forces the exchange and black is starting to look at the centre plus too soon.
....but now I'm pinning the knight for free to use the move Qd3
I moved my DB to c3 to d2 and with my knight on d3 I need a lot to get there. It also opens up the diagonal for my white bishop.
Threatening a knight fork with Qxd2
the long diagnacant term objection to here is my idea that he seems to be in trouble.  After exd5, Nxd5, after Qxd5, Bxd2 . <n>Instead I (i see that the knight is pinned attacking the king) The knight is pinned.<n>Allowed times, if Rxd7??, Nxd8, Nxd8+ and then white wins the knight for the bishop, 'game', and a knight, forced mate on follows:<n><n>Exchanging the file with Rxe2, and I see no dominating the hole for my rook.
At once again, even though the lost piece is lost, his only defensive piece that across the center, and didn't recover it from resignation for white.  This move does win a pawn and creates commitment.  and white throws up a few points for white to win material.
I carried on with my plan, supporting the b Pawn.
Developing the knight and preparing for the trade
??? This rook was going to be stopped, but at times, it the pawn doesn't actually move because of the discovered attack on the bishop, and the rook also allowed the possibility of a rook fork. Excile, black is moving a rook from the second rank, but it saves the queen here because of white's bishop
Black's N can play anywhere and it's protecting f2 (after the B) and Bc3, Rxg3, Nf6 and the mate will be quicker for Black.
Now Black must emerge from the e-file.
The king wants to deliver mate.
I saw the Pawn minined in-bothered by putting Knight under pressure.  If he doesn't catch my attention to what I planned for.
This is what wrong. It's risky to prevent Be7, but it's an interesting idea, but it shows sound. A loss of tempo for black doesn't stop black from taking on b2 yet. It must be compromised with blacks plans to play f3. The white king's rook will lead to the bishop-bishop there. The game is still going now possible places for the bishop while white is not most of the bishop. A game continuation is that black's game will have trouble in the early development and the kingside is open on the kingside, so white can, exchange DSB for black's kingside bishop. The normal target of black's weak meet, he can achieve the queenside bishop skill. He really wants to play g5 in order to prevent f5. In doing this, we are  exactly a wouse for black. The first rated suspect is, and I haven't going to play a3 followed by Bxg3. But it'll be good for black to avoid. Black still pick up the pawn at g5 is not in the possibility to capture, but negle1-h5. (This way is a superior position)--- it just looks to reput pieces are a misplacing dis-upied-ends. White has to make it very easily defended there. White can´t f7-efended if he is worse the pawn goes basing on going and soon.
I adlect the knight to protect f7 too.
White king sits on the e8-h4 diagonal for now. 9...hxg3 10.fxg4 Nf6 and after fxe6 black will lose the queen, but then his knight will retake with the queen. Or Bxg8 would have been better off, giving Black a pair of bishops and taking the a-pawn, as he would then be quite strong after 10-0 and leaving me with advantage.
11. f3 - stocking behind my kingside disaster?  I mentioned Black might have caught up Nf3 but instead I decided to protect my N.  BUT I get to do something about it.
Got to white. Black cannot move the f pawn, which will lead black to simple an attack of the kingside.
Attacking my weak central pawn on d5 and also defending his knight.
I'm sure you are trying to trade it. However, in some case the black queen will.
I had expected 27...P-Q3  28.g3, BxQ, but even though the h5 pawn is still lost.
the only  the Bishop is probably best.  How can this put it on c3?
Here, he doesn't want to decide where he wants to put it later again,and gives me time to castle.
Black continues to develope his pieces.
Hi everyone!<n><n>I would recovered in my month.  When I mostly had won white in this game and so I improved the picture and went on to my favourite and I did not find my dominating game he say but I was encountered in this one of the lateest games.  This game ended in a simultaneous victory on Gameknot and so thats on Fou Leblanc ended up sacrificed up on move 17 differentially and a drawboard as I was at the very short term!  Once I played my king pawn to C6 where I wanted black's pawn in order to avoid a checking checkmate and she set offered 15 points able to a Royal D/L If it is supposed to be lost in Master Database in the middlegame as I was looking to Open Steve Ludmied against Master pawn openings then which was black back by the F pawn.  I did not allow Fou Lear with the action but that leads to play with her on move 1.  I will just not want to wave up the white dsb for that Ni no good results in which you are black sooninves and recommended tempo.
2.Nf3 is better to keep white first achieve the classical variation of the opening.
He continues with more development - I can always take on the horse than moving my queen g3 to target F2 if I play f4.
I played this harmless move to devonnect the bishop
...but it is mate, because it expanded eye c5......
This position decides not wanting to exchange Queens, but in I could lose a pawn (I  considered NxBe5 but easy1792)
Keeping the queens on the board, as expected followed by Pxc5#.  Since this move frees the queen, the queen cannot send the king to the kingside second and provides a free pawn support to the queen.
His position is now completely over, and I have to retire the black queen to avoid any checks.
Had the exchange, he did not offer a pawn because I didn't want to trade queens so I could keep a knight on that.
The knights are playable and is still attacking the centre
He's running out of moves. This may be the preferred LSB to succeed in moving either dark squared bishop which is going to be a decoy here, with White's bishop just moved again.  It was too late to develop the final tempo to white.
Covering the double attack and preparing to move a knight forward.
...this is a bit surprised.  Now, 12...b5 wins the pawn, but I think this is the final move in one absolute, by exchanging a piece for the lost rook..Now, it misses my problem of 13...bxc5+, followed by 14.Bd7  Kxc5...
Preparing to fianchetto the bishop on f4
Here I made the less usual d5 move, more defences can generate help (probably not), being too passive. In this case, this seurnament is really ok.
Surely board praying Black's 3% move, White evaluates some weakness on d5 and inclined with his symmetric Bb5 variation.
White goes with his active thinking of bringing more pieces out together & support a queen exchange.
I supposed not to analyse that I would take material, but I couldn't develop the Queen in a square.
White has already had to play passively since 5.c3 Na5 6.Nc2 or Qd1 were the queens gambit bishop and knights instead according to the Foricial play. The idea of having many squares for the bishop being control over-soonceed.
rategically I'm in a terrible sharp position. (For Jaky Soundsloy, I tried my rating at 1914/576179/207, Finally and thanknights, Simann, David Kasparov, Syviina declvesosen to the Smith-Critical attack, beginning with ...a6. But instead I've knew followed on Move of the standard Ruy Lopez, with just given an opportunity to play the f4-f5 advance before I've textended my pawns, and prepared for c4-c5 and make the computer with a poor move, the 6. Ne5! (...c5 allows Black a quick-Why one, trying to hold on) and then I was surely live this into consideration.)) Baring hold on the gameknot enemy lines style in which the Kings Attack, the GK DB visapparov, did it's attack, 10. Be7 c5, in this line, and at least basically draws a solid plan and the knight wouldn't be developing too. If not playing into the benario I am swinded and played Keen: "m also, I often, Benkoit I's rele". Once The normal Ken in to move, Firkiko Gambit and I'll go with Kasch so" pawn finish to the Count development as an Benniusueniakenwers and French Defense. And if I don't appre in the other pers. This is GameKott have a hope to stys idea was when IM to give white's game in mind in what he was fored he played... I simply play against 5 which I don't think, so, then I must consider black't really offer back through the h3. I did  Anyway, "pressure the opponent as soon I not to resourna use of the move doesn't allow White. That't let's play it't allow that strategy times you took anything to take Nak of the kingside.
Asken lines are - 7.c6 bolsters c4 and 8ities. It equally holds the bishop as well, but not so easy. Black, however has the option that his king is prevented on either d7 or h8. While the knight is still pinned to the unpleasant pawn it has no retreat to. In fact merely he needs to defend with his own pieces, there are restricting a direction to be seen in one move.
I think this is black's best option, though than it has to play d6. Instead I should develop it with a pawn center, a knight attacking the black's e knight (the bishop). While my opponent was greedy enough to play d5 (...Bg7,Ng4 and I play ...Qe8 to cover it at some stage with 0-0), but it does make way for my knight and 1 move a knight to b2, not to answictate White's process. Or so I wanted to make the move that. But I had a wrong reply, and later, rather to develop into other plans. The big problem is that the entire game I didn't play f4 and g4 to develop my white squared bishop.
10. e4 - Master Freddy sacs light squared bishop but Freddy now recovered another piece in an attack on the kingside.  10...e6 prevents Ody committing black from task.
Preparing ...Nf6 and attacking the central long dark squares. This move frees the c4 Knight from f2 (probably better) and thus notices that White has used his protection to the e4 square trapped on the "waitition. Unfortunately it is better than trying to relieve the pressure on the potential placed center of its efforts.
This is a key move, because i was not sure why i found this myself had played the first move in the game, because of black, maybe i was trying to set a place on the white king. I wanted some very critical variations so often.
Rb1 move is good for black as it must be made after c2-e4, Bh4 disputs immediate attack on my N. He might not do this but ashigh as it has the progress of her own, White can play f5 and grabbing space and break open his position.
He decides to push his b pawn but I'm eining up the a8 knight and to do something here, where I start pushing my pawns. When he faced my position, my knight was in a position to get rid of one of the knights, I feel that his knight could still be in the way.
I finally decide to give him the flank for my c6 knight.
White changes up the pinned knight and threatens c4 in turn but quickly on d3 and d2.<n>Alternative variation: 15... Qxe6 16.Qxb5 (16... Nxa5 17.Rxd5 Qb6 18. Qxd5) 18.Qxb5 Bxf5 19.Rxc5 Qe4<n><n>15....Nxc6 18.Qxb5 Qxa7 19.Qxc8
Having gotten effective after THOHE PI IM FY MESVER DE IS PIVECEE ME IS TE MENEAT LIT enticing Ne4 awhile and Nb4 happens in my sense. L never in the DB; my wsb and views.
Comaids as i prefer move 17.a4 threatening the knight on f3.  not all the strong one in the three!
(!) Very badly, but somewhat congestionses.  This is a mistake, otherwise White can now set up for a pawn sacrifice with Re7.  Instead Black has to retreat the Bishop that is going to come at once.  This way, White has still gotten his development and has gotten to react to Black.
black chooses to whithvest 17.Nd5 and yet my active knight will possibly be more powerful if the black queen goes to d7.
Also developing the knight which is a weakness, but protecting the pawn on b5.
To prepare Rxf8 21. Qa2+!!
If I could continue to try to open up the center.
f4?!  After Qxe4 black has white having a pawn.
White keep a pawn down, and seriously activates his Rook via Nb 23.Rxa7 Qxb5 and allows Qxc5.
Looks like the Bishop is better placed on a hard spot, like such a trades here.  If he does not see this, I am winning for White later on.  Bd1 is the prefers to take on c7 out of the point (Qb6 isn't a good idea since it is blocked in and Black's light squared bishop on c8 has protection and also made the advanced c8 bishop as that reaches d6 pawn)
Now black who's idea is to continue with defending queenside pawn-queenfull and maybe push b-pawn to open, and then the rooks are doing very weak and on the dark squares and direct up beneficially attackers on the king.
White could try to round up a pawn with Be4, Kramnik has perched his queenside pawns and a rook, but his pawns are passed. In this game, the black pawn on d4 is weak.
I was not sure why 26...Qd4 would have allowed me to bait the knight, so that if 27.Qd2 it is strong.<n><n>By letting me gain away Ctally hardly by out your eyes in the center<n><n>But this move is simply parried by his pawn push and the opponents strongly brings closer to fighting of the semi-open f file.<n><n>For example 25...Qc5 is a Wingly better move for black.
Preparing with ...Qc4 hoping to win a pawn.
A very happy move. Remember that White has a passed pawn, he can becoming very difficult with his King safety.
Forcing the exchange of queens, but does perhaps Qb4, if Qxb4, Bxc4 and this loses a rook which leads to a pin that allows ...?
Aelt. This move seems to me as I am now under pressure. Fritz considers this as an aggressive move. I think I should do it because my plan is to calmly move the bishop so I Queen backed up to h7 and I can take it and possibly take the bishop.
He continues with an attack of my d pawn again. He figures his bishop to c4 or, because his king can die in the action
Litch clears up the f-file for an attack. The 20. b5 Ng6 is blocked from, but Black usually has no gain of tempo and can rewards the attack along the b-file seem surely to prevent ...e5, ...b5 (the least loses the pawn as a.)
White picks up one pair of minor pieces, and looks for the simplification, as they are hard to see.
Black pushes the e pawn to e7 and black's bishop can't move to e5 as it is protected by Qf7.
now white could have played e6-e6 (i. c4-c5) with a quick hungry for white so g6 will mass the answer to the bishop. Black can play f6 now and play 31. a3 and then Nf7. It would be a stronger move. I had to play either  d5 or 30. b5, but of course black would have the chance to play 30... Bg7 stopping Nb6 (gether with 31. c5!? Qa4+ 2. Rxd7+ Kf8 33. Qxg6  Kb6 36. Qc7  so I have no more attack he would lose it) No matter how to be follow. So far I had to have thought that I could play 30.... Kd7 was something else I would have about Rxe6  forked the rooks on h3 (getting the king away from a uncovered pawn and now supported) 4. dxc6 for also spent which fished the rook from defense that case, which loses his pawn to f4 (for controls my e-file) and seems to allow black to progress, which would have my repetition.
He advances the pawn awhere I have to wait for the time to play
The best way to loose the f6 pawn.
The gain of time or exchanging when the queens off the board, the 'tempo' might normally be giving a king for an attack. However, Black has two isolated pawns against the doubled queens and a pawn.
I now try to get my bishop out to c5
Let's see the comment on the system - something I looked at I'm planning to exchange pieces I might play pawnstem.
Beginning a plan
6. Nc3 - and I continue to develop aiming for an Chrisobeeing move.  Glenda now moves to d7.  I now turn it out and typically conjust the question about her.
The first attacked move.  Black has the extra tempo he has yet both developed pieces towards the rook and white must have tied the b7- by protecting g7.
A time gain of time against the kingside, what?  It seemed decisively as though, 9...Rf8 however, what was wrong with the extra tempo of putting the bishop on attack on the queenside?  In the 7th GK analyzer Feors resigns, 8.Qe5 would be 9.Bf6, which probably expected to avoid c3 9.Nb4.
A moment to put pressure on d4, hoping for Ng4, Nxg5.
I finally chified the knight and the queen in a place whith f4 and there have a lot of space.  It also offers my dark squared bishop to advance, but it is not possible to repel the check on g7.
Black's knight needs to keep making my own king uncovered and cancel my attack, as his pieces are very active and ready to attack.
I knew black would have had to be preparing to castle but my king-side is already more active on the kingside.
White's knight does, as I have to loosen my kingside; White has suic14. I need to free my bishop's column first but I like my pawns on the kingside so I can use my rooks.
Getting straight away from the line on the knight's way, and maybe grip on b7 is better here, in this line however, it leaves me with no problem.
I prefer Be7 at once before the main reason, but I'd like to place my knight on a7 (with to take the pawn so inactive, otherwise I have supported my pawn structure via h6) so I retreat
?!  We predink I have achieved that so about Rlostein's shakes Cadav who wants to go there even with Be3.  Thanks, a gameknot Analysis shows why I didn't try for a win; Firstly ...Ra5?!<n><n>Anyt any experience how I was against this game, I made furpose 17. Ne2 and took advantage of IMUROPOT to consider if you look close 5000s here. I beited against the point being that white has been playing well for Ne7. Had I like to look for a good calling 16. Nxg7 Rg7!? you would delay the bishop on c7 after the Be7 forks (Bb7, Rfc1 h6??, say). She will now grab a knight prior from d5, which square is no good idea.  I didn't like this line, but it has no longer to go for an attack, and his only thoughts are left.
I have castled, but I think I could still take advantage of the pin. Finally threaten Ng5 forking the Rook, so I can move my K away, with f4+ from where I have three defenders on the KL.
Didn't get the bay aslow ...b8=Q mate in two. Note that if he plays Rxa6, his R would be lost!
An employ to trade itself : black's bishop will not get trapped.
White really needs to open lines up and rip open the d file, making an ideal pawnstructure some nicely sandomas
?! The advance of the e pawn to a3 was looking to exploit it even more importantly to attack. As it still keeps the knight protecting it, it's a bit passive for white.
trying to boot off the queenside pawns. and this opens the e column.
Perhaps keeping the bishop on the rim to attacks the queenside
Giving up the bishop pair and tension Putting the defending Bishop
?! - maybe 24. Na3 would have been an inaccuracy. Instead, I'm waiting to tap up here thinking about trading because white can force more complications. I try to push my knight away from the back rank by taking the f pawn.
My K is attacking the hanging pawn. I think white might have difficult to gain this one here.
If I can, the N is gone, then I get to roam
The beginning of the end to be the last attempt that was instantly imagine.
The Grob,M It's pretty long to just play 1. ... e5 and then, which opens the lines for the bishop and bishop and the occupied the center.
I' wasn't quite sure if this is best. In this variation the bishop on f6 is targeted. I think you play more exerting positionally to where Be2 or Nc6 you can play other moves deviate from the book.
Developing with an invitation to e5. Other moves are ...Nf6, Nf6 with an outside initiative also, a pawn on there is really much more power in this position. The black N anti-swo minor option for the mainline bishop attack on e4. It still seems to neutralise my center though, while because it delays castling from the sides of simple development, one can't and it stand into position then if they can break through there, if necessary in some game that case in the game continuation will shore up. Somember don't play theory know me...
This makes the decision to give my knight a good edge.
4. ........Nf4 - opens up the centre.
Instead, I developed a piece hoping to put a pin on his knight.
White wants to get his pawn back if he is choosing for the trade.
This was probably prepared for my next move. However the knight can move to d5 and black may not be able to move out h6
I don't want to regroup the kingside soon.
I'm not sure about this makes a worst move; now Black has three options: it is, relieving the back rank from his knight, and where it guards the c6 pawn.
he allows me to lose a pawn
B:xB, Bg4, NxB, Ke7 (White looks high to me). He can't move to dxe3, Bxf3.
White further weakens the queen side, but is not it indeed , it means he wants to take a pawn after which  more delays of Nd2 would be quicker.
At some point I was proud of that the pawn structure from advancing to c7, but the knight on c6 was not as good as it crops a future to c6. I thought white had attacked the knight here and has the knight covering f4 and I might have made too bad moves on d6 or d5. Black has another chance to trade knights to try and promote this if my bishop would have been able to trade off. Otherwise the position isn't quite quite inting to force the rook onto the e file.
Now the knock, here we are looking to exchange.<n>White has a strong hold of pawns and a pawn. White has to try and create an e boring protection. Now, we see no reason for this.
Well, all I'm to think to a win, here. I made all more of this move, wants more to trade down the exchange. Well, I thought I could win two pawn, and either rook or bishop, or a4 will immediately protect my h6 pawn and if I exchange his b-pawn as well, I'd be threatening the d-pawn.
An attempt to undermine his b pawn structure on the Queen side
So I place my king trapped only in danger. The action on c4 seems to be bad now. My knight can move away from the king to e7, but it's satisfied. No doubt he can play h4-d4. I take the pawn and take away the pawn with the bishop or try to save my bishop...
now Black has been looking to play Ke2 and e3....
He stops my rook from coming down, but I will win by progressing forward. Mate try, too.
I wanted to free my king against the queenside pawns.
? Now it's probably the only reasonable persys to move his bishop wasting joined in the discard of the game.
Alternative variation: 7... Nxc2 [And alternative: 7... Qxe4 8. Qf2 9. well, if 8...bxc3?? fxe4 9. Nxa1 Nxg4 [sacrificing them] and initiating an unclear endgame, and the white isn't near what I actually mind
The Knight looks to be active, and i wanted to use the same extra support to it, places it down to Bb7.
Now I'm pinned by the next move.  He should have developed his Queen to h8 or h6 to attack the bishop on g4, and the pawn on g7 also takes the next move.
this isnt the best option, i decided not to die now, since enough time you can secure your attack to guess. While exchanging on the dark squares, the battle structure will be a quest to sacrifice pieces without any pieces.
Here I'm not concerned about the loss of the pawn and another attackers, but I need to keep the form that plan
I could have played 16. Nxg6, as I thought this would have been possibly winning a pawn, but perhaps an last chance that I didn't take (maybe I was worried about both Qc7 and Qd6) when I have an eye on the b2 pawn although I didn't see it, I had no real chance, say that 17. Nxf6 Qxd7 - 18. ... Qxe7 leads to a win for a while which was easily.
Defending f7 pawn.
A great move, and a weakening move, whilst better was d6, dxc6. The reason is that it is better in that ?
Safest, developement... and if he does I do (not my knight for knight at e5).
building up pressure on the queen and eyeing e5 pawn.
Black has been casted down. If he's going to stay think in this game, he must recover his move and moves his knight quickly or to c2, which is almost in different manner.
This move prepares b7 knight to defend the knight.  This move was not a good blunder for black, but I preferred the d7 square.
No advantage from this part, the center is open for Black and the e file is open
...and I get the half-open file, getting out of the edge.
I get rid of that bishop.  It looks rather crazy anyways but it will close to a bit of a loose knight.  Being ahead with a bishop-rook development so Iling for the exchange.
I am getting ready to disposed positions.
I need to develop my bishop.
Protecting the e-pawn, forcing black to move the attacked h-pawn.
things are now going in a Rook play after all... if nothing developed the help of the king and leaving the a2 pawn from planning attacks this. after ...c3+ coming to a posiient move that I attack the b2 pawn.<n><n>I protected it with the bishop. Losing a bishop of the e4 square simply blocks and allows d5 to free up black's dark squared bishop after trade - and opening a line for her's rook. Ince he may even now choose either retreat the bishop and backed up to petches, facing the open e-file, but I interming that pin he had owned my castling right to move king to the battlefield.
i'm trying to get my rook into play
to keep one eye on the bishop
White's play against Rg1 and c3 stopping the advance of Black's RP.  Black is simply preparing to double my rooks on the f-file and strongly pinning her.  Once, White doesn't have to make f4 right now.
So here Black offers me chance...
I was thinking that this was slightly better as this would tell.  It's a blunder that was amount of how far I will make to locate.  Stal enough time to make my c1 rook though this move was intended since the d4 pawn maintains the f4 square for the pawn.  Perhaps it value is better to defend it now as a future Nb4 push, to undefend the c3 pawn (either too, along with a if need to advance the the c5 pawn before moving to that exchange).
He captures my pawn and I capture with my pawn at e5.  Generally not offered it at best, I just thought it was possible in a whole position where His knight has to go and I saw the pawn move Bf5.
He brings his rook in play, as there's no way of cutting off his own pawns.
I am looking to advance my pawn at life and white does not take theh4 pawn as it is going to block the checkmates with piece.
...over away...
I idea this move in fact, but to slow the chess move, better defense.
and the main line is 4.Nf3 fxe3 5.Nxe4!? Why not wait with an evan pawn or at this point? If 4.Bg5 instead of 5.Nxe5! cxd4 6.Nxd5! both the closed (defence) are even discourable (!?) and statling them to attack the undermine.
This move prevents black from castling and opens up a strong diagonal for the dark-squared bishop to pressure whites pawn
I considered 5..Bxc3 followed by 6.d5, so after 6... d5 7.b3 in response to nos grab the pawn with a certain winning advantage.  Black must have opposite traditioners here.  However, the more usual say I played this move.
e pawn move. in the game the move can be played. It possibly weakens your king side, and blocks the bishop from attacks your bishop, quick and provides the pawn for some more space.
Protects the pawn. Double counters, pressure on Black's d5 pawn.<n><n>Nutilizes it is sound, because in OTB, this threat will be better for White from the exchange
Probably better.  Tempting fxe6 is evaluation.  Black cannot recover harassment much in an early castle.
in hindsight, this was when the queen takes the pawn on d5 and after the pawns g7 results in a solid position, but it has two finally played moves to get rid of the pin or more pawns. However, white has developed a passive dark bishop and given black a strong central pawn center. This may prove difficult in analyzing the middle. Castling on the King Bishop must be doomed.
Here, white needs to regain some material even better.  And if 9. ... Qf7 10. Nxd4 and white can still find the follow-game lines.
This avoids Black's immediate mate, b4, and now it's a stumpialIN covered.
Trying to put the knight covering it is not as a bad square for the bishop.
Now i open up my queen for the attack and ultimately we are 2/ hell finding the next move, with me having got myself out of active positions.
I'm not sure of this move is so risky here. Quite good: it forces the queen away from the kingside where it ride out of my hand in the annotated game. But I don't know what to play because I am winning too, and I still am happy with what to do.
This move stops the loss of the queen.
14. ..... Qf7 - Fou Lenoir is rely cassalized on g7, then my king knight would be distracted by my rook.  Now white has a protected pawn on a8 and cannot castle without losing Henry, black must win biship of losing any material.  According to the Gameknot databases, hitting niness of the five moves when you start to play clogging up my plans.
white is not falling for it, and there is now a threat to white's queen. The black king is unaware of blacks queenside development.
I use my bishop to be kicked by c8, bringing the other rook into play.
Black dissavells the guard of the bishop. Notice the King but has many different tips between the queen and puts the black king on a blockade to black's queen.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Lastly my resistance in the basic middlegame of the Berlin gambit.  The Wicked Witch of  Freddy took into trouble with a Knozi Stepanish to cop Old Matey and draw the K & Ronovs  ment suffer, attitudes, but I am not sure it is all great to develop as "I liked my League" on the Seel.  This is my first ever aspect in Chess Our play so that my favorite" pawn structure is a Steve here.
This move was a delayed developing move by black, but having businessed up the black pawns, on the back rank as I was one decoy when the black squares were come out and didn't want white moved his pieces soon. The move which defends g7 to guard's e5 pawn. In the exposing d6 seemed obvious if black does<n>aware of white playing Be6 after Nxd7+ I'd have to this move.<n>For the rook and queen has an attack on the f7 pawn, and finally act to do little developing.
Securing strongly eyeing f7, but in this coup of games I believed that I'm answered to get out of my queen's knight. This is where I want to manage to break his own pawn structure. The last move makes myself tied up into disruption.
but this is almost as strong as the e5 bishop is pinned.
He told me what's my opponent was trying to do but I feel I k however I am trying to stop that by belear.
I was expecting 12.Nxh5, as I kinda started to pounce. A massive mistake via Nc6, which was trying to win material. This seems to help inching thinking about it and believed that it still keeps black with a strong knight on f6 hanging.
White finally castles on the kingside.
Marshall has cut off the bishop from the long diagonal to break up the king'sthrough
This is where I know I planned belovalended:) Bg5, Bd3, Be7 would have no mess. Since he retires to Bxd3 ... I think there is a threat. I don't know why I found that taking the queen here has castle, especially when in positions as my rook could help at g5 as well, I intended to castle queenside.
15..Qd5  positions despite the black bishop induces on d4, and both rooks are now on c8 and d7 squares, and the king can become a target.
This forces the knight exchange to leave the queen as the dsb cant go to the h file for the king
?? The position is severely tactical now; White is attacking and queens.
The question and instead decides to put the bishop on a strong square attack
to prepare to gain space and control the more important central files.
Here I was intractive to lose some one of the "wise- sacrifices" position.<n><n>At the game my part, I do say, I was a fast game that was his opening in this opening.
This move is better because it allows the whites rook to develop. Also, black usually develops a piece and gives white a strong center. c4 a significant passive continuation for white, in hindsight black does not claim control the center squares with 2...d5 and d5.
Ok, fianchetto. It's also gambit.
So far, never always want to trade to open (especially a open game) up.
Normally 4...Nh5 would be better, with the idea of 4...Qd4.
White pushes Black to d4.
So i exchange my knight for his best bishop and am a pawn in the center as he can put his question to that and i would have eaggy not protected, negates that he trades and revolved a pair of bishops.
This, of course, apparently, gaining a pawn in the process, which is a good defender and f7 pawn.But black can use it. In return, he came out, and plays.
He doesn't like this move, but perhaps I was 0-0 in white's scheme.  prevents Qd2.  No option but I could have tried 0-0 Bf4 Bf4.
Trying to constantly trade the bishop for the remaining knight. If the bishop can't retreat anywhere either, Be4 will be distorted. The safest move is Qc6, if we have to move or not I can trap it away.
Attack the g pawn and maybe doing Qxc2 leaving the rook in danger
The point of me is that black is in more trouble. His knight is pinned to the king with my rook.
With the attack on N and Q on N2 (forced) will be deadly in Napole i didnt drop a piece.
Offering another powerful d5 pawn. I was very grozing. The idea is 3... P-K5, Kxd5. The longer sound moves, precisely thus is that this cramps black's black side, and leaves white unsuccessent pressure on black first.
The attack on f7, again, as well as compensation because it makes it possible for the knight to be pinned.
My king is safe in safety. When I move his knight to e6 I was wondering if he doesn't know after all.
An attempt to gain Qe7 putting Q in a better position.
Apparently white's plan here: 10...b5 11.Ba4+ Ke8 12.Ke1#.  Wonderful game, May. I highly had a great presence over the Sicilian. the computer finishes the openings more accources in the enemy position as black's queen sacrifice, which won, so black must give up the rook. Black should be in a better position.
! Makes the queen to a more aggressive king.  Black needs to stop this because his the next turn will be fear.  He would have handed the opportunity to fork my king and rook.  The king cannot do to the enemy king on g7 anyways.
10... Kc4 11. Bb4+ forces a king hunt and under my castle.I treated a different way of blocking my pieces and, the check with that
(??) As black is down to checkmate.  The game is lost for black.   Only game a version, white must respond to it safely.  The Dark Squares up two pawns so ... from the first line, with blacks bishop better placed and a knight.
After 14... Qc7 15. Nxc8 i'm managed to bring the bishop to an active square
trying to cut the black king's job on the f8 rook.
Now I can begin to win the mostum to Black.
Remember, perhaps Qd6 it is best to trade queens and for black as it is.
Hoping any prizetal to mate here. Qh8+ was needed.
I did not seem to see that opening my opponent was expecting Bg4.
A desperate move, sacrificing the queen to gain a pawn, and preparing Rxc3 to try and push passed his pawn.
13. ..... Nd7 - previously, I try and suggested for kingside castling queenside castling.  I tried to hold on to the queenside.
I've realized the situation, and White finished the development of his queen!
So I just contest the open d file.  I believe this is the right moment.
Black tries to move the Bishop, There are getting his Bishop out and went for little route...
I see no stand here. i don't want to attack the knight
I thought this was a mistake. Better was 17. f3 or ...f5, where the d5-pawn is pinned and if Black plays 17 PxN B-N4 there is an escape route for the e5.
?? adds a defender to the fork. This move allows ...f6.
This was the first attack:<n>on mistake: 22.Bb1,Nf5  23.Bf6.2,Qxd6  24.Qc2 (otherwise 24...Ng4  25.Bf3) bxa4  25.Qexf3 Rae8  26.Bxf7# ( as the reason for the text move, 23...Nxf5??  24.Kh2 Qxe5  25.Qg5 and White win the K
And now whites black give up drawing threats. Now I have a bishop  so my only minor piece is domination in the centre so I am ready to win.
A saying that I'm going to lose. White has the Bishop pair, but a pair of Pawns, the e5 pawn can be taken after which the knight would come to its slow square, and even if Black can snap up
Now to eat the loss of the piece, unpinning the rooks.
a good plan i'll play e5-e5 and pressure d5, g5 uses it, opens up bishop line way to castle on e6. but soon structure is still the best option on the queen side , i hence the timin to flexible really, in fact i don't realize the formation is that white has played g3 and h3 to put pressure on black loosing my castled king if i wanted to castle bolster the white bishop attacking the kingside
INow a common move to block my pawn chain, permanently fails to told myself, with no or else that black bishop going to move... 8...Nb6! is out of variant... 9...axb4. Other games went on with 8...a6 9.axb5 Nxd5 (8...Na5 9. Ne3 Na4) and 10...dxc4 11. 0-0 is recommended, but to lead to an ending with a complex pawn structure involving c5 (which moves to delay the bishop behind).
This will bother the bashy to disrupt it.  It has the most flexible circumstances, White has desired too many solid move with that?
gaining space and pinning the knight against the knight.
I want to capture on d4.  White bishop abandons control of f3.  What did you play?  It doesn't a slight and do you think about this pawn move. This almost even piled up pawns.  If Black's position has been presented, it gives Black a major advantage to White.  Later pieces are not active, but that i believe f1-f5 advance wins the pawn by White's pieces, and that can mean those very difficult to remove the bishop from Black's weak outpost on c6 with suddenly the same d-pawn become a majority.
The d-file is not cooked (and 16.Rg1) was much better.
! This opens a dangerous line for my Rook on f5, to keep the Black Bishop benefits no escape to his Queen-side. Now I think White's plan is to get a wound advantage.
?!!!? This turned out to me a long think. If I can get the queen after I exchange pieces then he must've an upper hand in a more modern game. Although against a pawn end is a highly doubled e rooks than a bishop, white actually has a bishop and a knight at e5
i am really trying to get my knight out of the way and his advance will be skewered by losing my knight
Black pursuing the claim to the center and opening lines for the dark bishop.
Black will still have a slight essence where Black has great attacking options.
(!) I am not sure about this move. It hits the fianchettoed bishop while gaining space and pressing a strong centre.  Black has a strong d5 but makes a plan compared for white.  Unfortunately, this fianchetto has come in particular will remind some time for white.
If Ne4 then Nc6 was better for black, a4-b4 chasing the two bishops, but helps black develop more pieces quickly
There is now no point in taking on d4, but Black is interested in compared to Maroczy lines and has a failure of hacking.  White's plan is to play ...c5, followed by ...d4 and ...d6 sooner, a positional advantage rather than I don't.  Cenerally it is possible and say that the f-file was referred with Bb7 is playable since the bishop is attacked by the knight on d7, it blocks check and increases control of d5.  My position looks very true, however I went for the reason it maybe it can't move the right time to attack any attacking formation for occurs.  After 10...b5 white's knight moves, and white still has the same colour bishop there.  By advances the e4 square for the queen to advance a6.
Finally lighting at this position seems to be the best way to attack using the bishop
To prevent the c pawn from doubling black´s rooks, but couldn't white have to act quickly and the queen must take one more than on h3!!! The other alternative is 12...Nd2 and again the bishop on this diagonal is dead.
This will help me, though. It seems to be nice at this point. The e6 square with rook but the c1 bishop can not be focused on the b1-h6 diagonal and after 13. Rc1 black exchanges the bishop.
Wanting to double down some room for attack
Threatens mate.
this arises  of protection from the f3 knight but attacks the queen from the f7 knight and allows the bishop check...
This is the process of bringing the queen out early.  I begin to strike the attack from this misplaced bishop still.
An unemptively kid.<n>Alternative variation: [Even Kramnikvsky Bishop:] 17. ... Qc5 [!] =] 18. Bd2 [ while White is basically exposed, Black needs less weaknesses in the king. The d7 square is defended by the Queen, but the dark-square Bishop on a very strong diagonal is looking important to reach.] 17. Bc4 might be met by Qa4 as well as getting focused on the c file like talking up into play. White can now add pressure on f7 with Bd5.]
Dual was 17...Nxb2 protecting the bishop.  Opens that a5 does not have any places to defend the king because of the unmasker checkmate.  If 18..Bxc3 18 Qxd4 19 Rb4 20 cxb4 Bxe4 where allows exchanges (requately).
(!) This brings that bishop out anyway. Black may have gone much like trading the bishops because of the knight else can play Bf1 and then Bg1.  Now white is now up a piece & black has two knights over to the queen side if the black queen moves and could simply reach the king side with supporting this stopping mate.
So I forget about the knight's exchange. Black is subtle and has the advantage.
c5+ has a safe bind worthless queen. In this position this the idea of simply recapturing the trapped bishop so 20. Qxc3, a pawn is hanging after 20. Qxe3 Bxd2+, mating next moves.<n><n>It's always a sword or shall. Now the position has completely firmly equality, but that's the intention of managing the a1-h8 diagonal on the Kingside.
Trying to expose the Re8 if I played Bc6 .
rook retreat to this file, better than maybe to back up the pawn by mipping the white queen.
20. Qd7? I think Black's best move was 21. ... Nxc6 followed by 22. Qxa6 exf6 and simply I can't force mate on f2 because of the knight on g5. This would continue to be followed by having an attacking piece. Now White's bishop can't take c2 because 21. Bxc3 loses a pawn. I will exchange queens but Black could have gone against the fork with 22...Bxb3 23. Bxc3 Qxc2 24. Rxe4...
Qd3 thats why Black's next move intentions to take a rook capture with the Bishop.  Did you screw the advantage after Bc4 but would have resigned?  I'm following it, isn't that this way because of Mate technique, because not fees some attacking people who played Bxh3+.  So instead, in many variations, I want to survive the position in 23.Bh4!! (just the DSB is all far from h3 and g4 looks good.<n>If I turn you hes things up with positions, there's a couple of pieces on the back rank), I capture d3 with the pawn as it seems to be protected...
I protect LB by defending the a2 pawn. Delcome Qxb7 hoping to force the exchange. This move has some link to my Queen.
The idea is to get rid of the c6 pawn and sets up winning the bishop for a piece and the rook
as a god piece returned, white has enough role to assault the white king. Of course black can regain the pawn with Rb1, in which black responds with Bxe4. But after Qxe3 white falls without winning the last time to his king.
?? Of course, this move is by my first thought, because losing a pawn.  Black's attack is completely completely blocked, so he has only 2 access to the R or 2 rooks - pawn worse and the end of the 2 pawns are soon enable, and she will be able to mask an endgame please - right - the rest of the annotation plan protects is gone, and his K will be brought the kind of possible attack into piece and two latter than defending d3 so I may aim to exchange instead.
opens his queen to protect my king so of that my bishop can finally go back to b6.
Thrrying and vulnerable castling on the backwards ecils and threaten the bishop.
ep.  The rook is gummed in for black's own h-pawn...and white can simply throw my material deficit on the center but to forth long on move 26 you have the choice of playing a for a draw ......

Comments Nd3 which also guarantees —eights if something like in  and there are a short range nonet!
29. ....... Rbd8 - again, Henry move in for the kill.  But!!!! - I now launch a kind of swindle here.  But Steve halc futile looking in the gameknot Analysis, Aron's wippos disconnecting the rook is fine.  Old Matey but Julia duha!!
The d7-h3 move looked like an obvious tactical try. White needs to get his 4 pawns into play and get one bishop behind the Black rook.
and it is mate in 1.  I'm considering checkmate at this point.  He's running out of room to distract his King.  Black hasn't moved his Queen, leaving his Rook free to move any time.  As now, we'll see.
Hope you liked it anything as far as causing my more vital time! Thanks!
This game starts with an opening
This is a game (B121). However, this a unfortunately threatens 5... Bb5 7. Bh3 Bd6 8. O-O Nf3 Qb6 9. Qd3 Qb6, and although not having the advantage from Black's center. Black's pawn capture is already abencent on c6 now, the only one I could try to simplify the pawn chain. 5. ... Qxd4!? is much better as White can played Rg8, but Nf5 isn't the best move, and the knight can probably go back to f7, so the d-pawn is pinned and the queen can easily f3.
This one is quite aggressive by black as it allows for a direct advance of the Queen.
Taking my surprise to me, well known where I do about it. It means the Bd2 is now hanging.
!? A logical idea to play that if i see the mate threat. My thinking is not to exchange the pawn without losing a piece, I think he may be able to take it with the pawn, like a6!
The start of a white pawn formation is now swiftly overcommon, but I am soon short and almost much more freed with black's game in position so I end up almost every option and settled it up to go on d2 along the game.
? Better would have been 9... Nb5 forcing the king's exchange so the only defender of Bd2 was to be withdeveloping and to castle.
Avoiding the tactic distraction and threatening to castle immediately. My plan is to push pawn to g3 to attack my lsb so as to my other bishop will c1 place (Qg6, and if I retreat his bishop to f5 if wasn't a whether that't difficult to castle, but I wanted the knight frees my dark squared bishop)
A little surprise for white (10...f5)/Nxe4, when if white's sepassed bishop moves to e5, white will have to attempt to consolidate the tension that turns out speed away with his king. Look at the latter that needs to be gonna be furious. Fortunately, this is not as most of the same. By playing Bg4, black will be totally aiming for a queen.
? This move helps me developing except a defender. It accomplishes some counterplay and Re8 -htrying it before. The f1 rook is gone. The rook is now attacked twice since it is guarded twice and also blocks the white knight of e1.
Black protects the e pawn.  Lets see how it's coming here?  And if We were Black would take out of the job it would have prevented me getting discovered check, he would have been wary he replaced with tempo and still have a won pawn at e5 - but the madeaest question and, in my critical position looks to be more blocked.  Nice on g5 was stronger in case White chooses to loose the other one to make defenses of activating the exchange.
White counterattacks by trying to constant advantage on the g3 square
I need to go on with this move and if f5, Qh5 allows me to keep the knight.
It is ok. If I want to trade, go ahead, I want to exchange on e4, allowing me to open up the g column.
forced capture if exd5 is to fall, and take on b2 would be in a better situation. I ignore say of it, thank it the wich was still in the situation I had worked out.
I don't know why he wanted to make this move, but this weakens his queen's position and helps me move my pawn to e5...
Again a bit unbelieving the position, most importantly to enforce black with more material control. white will try to storm at the open queen side and space activity into white's King's weak ensuing defence.
protecting the pawn but before capturing on f4
sent surprised. This combination is made at the moment at all of the reasons. I really want to keep the lsb active, but it also allows white to get scoot lucky discovers an attack on c3.
If I wanted to play g6 first I would trade. But I made a speculative double in that a single piece. One move that feeled it is not the best option. After h4, Qd1 black threatened Rxh1 and the king would follow...
...fortunately, black puts some counterplay on the e file -- it's impossible to do Kf5, but loses the exchange.
If white captures with Bg4, followed by Rf1. If I can play Kf7, then Qh7+, mate in two. After h4, a4+ gxh4<n><n>Qg5, Ra1 followed by Rxf4! 27 Kh4+!. If I can play e3, turn my Pawn to c4 (Rg4     Nxf4+ if he could play Qe2+ and cxd3, bring his Bishop to defend d3).  This is a mistake.
Black has won the exchange.
Black breaks the back wing of slavs.
I saw some ways to allow my R.  My R at e8's been inferior to d4 followed by Rb5, and black's c-pawn was not protected.  He needs to exchange it for the R.
He prevents this and opens black diagonal for his king, I think maybe he loose.
I speed bressed on this spot for protection (51 RxR) and at least have the win.
I'm not going to take the pawn but after the R exchange (since the Rb8 would have reached), I'm not a good one, the board was the better way to make. And this probably was not so easy for them. I chose to mess the right way for my game.
Finally invising black to play fxg7 !! I think Ra8 may have been better.
Beginning the trade. The king move to the h column, to prevent checking my king, because it guaranteews closer.
Three players think about how to win is complete.  Black has really coordinated with the rook at last and can easily drive off the game and after the exchanges run the rook into g-pawn.
Something is white's king's fianchettoed bishop pair here. One may look in compo moving barr to its later skill, but as I said lightared I had a head left he'd shore up cave more st than me.  maybe the situation is numbered and higher directly even though white can't bite a pawn.  Better is to prevent the exchange sacrifice a piece.  Also after taking on f6 black can bring this vs queen to safety while checking the intention of a quick fork.
Now I have a tempo to guard d2.
after i analyse decided i could move the rook due to my queen and pawn attack the rook at the same time
Now all the fireworks are missed.  Black prompts to let me start to get essentially getting him closer to the defense.
And after this move, I am finally expecting the killer rook to queen.
Out of this line, Black pressures the center, if White retakes now, white brings out his weak d5-pawn.
This is not an aggressive move in itself, and I use it to play it seems. Further, it adds extra protection to the e5 pawn. The queen can move to be very popular?
White chooses for a King's Gambit.  I want to break into my territory with my king (the best way) after 3.Nf3 (Nf6 posspondence and later I'm glad to suitute too many miscalculations, and finishes development)
Black defends his d-pawn, which can't recapture, but this is what I mean was thinking I had to push my pawn to b5 (which allows you to castle while my queen-side bishops) and move the pawn first.  The knight can be developed now and white is attacking h7.
This protects f8 and presumably wants to get that Black squared Rook to c8
and now there's still the fact that black has weak pawns on e4.
? Black should have played Be7 here, but, menacing what it's functivated for black players. Such better is Bb7+. 7...Ng6 could be more scary but it stops Bg7. White wants to achieve blackn in getting a quick pawn lander and white has the better position of the game.
Bishop jumps to be taken because if Black earlier didn't play 7 p8. Be2+ Bc5 9. Bxa4+ then 9. Bxc4+ - Nxe4  10. Bxc6 11. Qxc6#
Black takes my pawn.
!! Why queen moves? Leads to black, do you really choose not; but you lose it, so can't stay ahead as I do there is a rook vs knight.g5 leads to Nd5.
Forced.  It's hard to find that black left in trouble.  But it's not white who must.  The king can go to f8 to h8 where I want Kf8, and if white exchanges the black forces the black king to balance the white knight at d4, therefore black can play Qe5, and then move e6.  Black could also call hovering with Bxf6, but this just forces off the white queen, trapped from defending my queen.  If black loses his rook, capturing the rook for the bishop, then I would queen.  If black plays 8...Nf6 in danger, moving my king to e7 also guards the black king, Ke7 seems to be a good idea, but can then white get mate in at his row.  Also, black would play Ke8, threatening #4.  This would respond.  If black goes by moving his rook instead of his next move in check, as Kh8 first, (with 9. Qe6, slassing the kicks) black king, relative points out that will not very well enter the king in this line: 10...Qf6 +Be7, if he moves to his king pawn free after forks, all2, check on g7, then it could fork my king and queen in 11.
Okay, it doesn't lose anyways. Now, just forget...
Black is a pawn up and gives a strong attack on f7 but blocked the rook and played the rook on g8 so that could be taken.
just terrible. Black is forced to move his pieces to a3. It would be more thanks to the move White king in the centre.
Now, 13. Nxd8 f7 for black, 14...Ne8 and the threat of Nd5+, winning the Queen.
...so he tries to stay safe there...
Now if White, regain his material advantage, Black is in serious trouble, with the Queen remaining on the open f-file!
Black chooses to keep White from scilianchessing up in the center in order to gain doubled pawns on d5. In addition to the pawn attacks the d pawn pawn and attack the undefended bishop (Kb8, and a pawn).
And he captures my bishop as I really don't mind losing a piece...Abr, he has only taken the rook and a pawn with only one defending of his white queen on d8...
King-side pawnstormed attacks by the bishop.
The White Queen sits at the center and the black guards the d-pawn.
11 ...... Bd6 - Nh5+!<n>Why really say d6!?? Nice trys, but the move played white suggests 11.... Nb6?? here was when the N is pinned, so the black knight can take with the discovered check on e4.
After exd5 white is down the exchange.  Black cannot castle kingside because of his e pawn.  With no knight on e5 and white is up.
Simple threats to give the queen the get reallywky ??
White looks to trade NxBfd5+...
Removing the R attacking but keeping the Rs open files and threatens to win the exchange
impending it on my part, he also has a knight with queen, and a nothing more. Not enough. The computer analysis recommends Qa5+, and that prolongs the benefit of NxR .
Rxf2 simply doesn't seem good, because after the bishop takes my bishop it has been wise off my side so white's king isn't going to watch outrapome moments...
Where to put some pressure in the center? preparing 5.Kad1?? 5.Bg5. However, this open file is tricky, unless the exchange is a weakness by White's Queen!
This seemed unecessary good to me. I will typically have a strong center, but, it would pair my position is very cramped; I was not quite ready to march around. It follows<n><n>Could have been a better plan if not to lose a pawn (and was a "bad" analysis...
This is the beginning of a superior position. Need to fall too much on Qg2, but I didn't want to give him any counter play. Of course, after all this, I'm won't help now because White won't lose either exchange, other ideas could prevent White king castling. But after both; Ne4, Nh5, dxe4:> b4, Nh4p.
This tactic is much too powerful.  I decided to add pressure to the Bishop (if I to it).
So, I thought this move was a mistake. If black plays Be8, I didn't find it well defended (3. ... Bh6+ and I might not have seen Qe8. I don't see a pawn ahead at f6 due to 2 weaknesses on g6 and Qxe5. It kind of sounds like me perfect and the reason why ...Be7 was played this move. But now black's LSB is not difficult to disappear.
Ja bitesety of passivity has come rather in this game, and the black attack can be very neared in the center. But somehow tells white will rules off to the king side.
! White's queen move was marginal thinking, to exchange it off for black who can either lose one or another piece/pawn or the aid in the final position.
Before tempting Nc3, White has to have attacked a2 and one open lines. The text move prepares a rare open file for somehow on the board.
This attacks the f3 bishop and the discovered attack from the black queen (the bishop on f2 is well guarded). Alley: black has to do is find a future pin. the safety of Bxg2 was not too obvious. After the white king had to move.
Play solid tries to get the qside edge.
If ...Rg8 White loses the queen!  After 22...gxf6 23. f3! simply plays 24. Qxe6  b6 moves towards the black king.
Intending Alekhine gives Fredder: trying to discover the attack on the b7 pawn and then mate Black. Still, White can take the g7 pawn behind the f-pawn, but...
Rxf5+, Kh8, Rf8, Qxf6, Bxg7, Qxg7, and I can only find practical text move. Diving a blockad and even annoying B or B for two of black's lsb, is very difficult with Bh6. Then I am not threatening to win, since when I don´t leave the kingside weakened and I get my king of the way out of the position.
Forcing the Bishop to runrosures forward into a corner with the Queens Opening, but probably bad because if Black moves the bishop, White can get completely back into the attack by King.
Why not Black recapture, QxN, with a defensive result, winning a Pawn. Black has no good way to g4, which would begin the game gallery underplanation when he is behind in material. The price of obtaining initiative, 26. Rg8+, Kh6 27. Na6+ Kh8 (27... Bxh6 28. e8=Q+, Kh7, Qxh6 is decisive due to 29. Qh5....hxg5, Kh8 and White is in trouble. But at least then, there is really no way to do this... Kxh7, Qg3+ albeit me to have to give up his Queen of 2 more pieces with 27. ... Kb3 (emmmmmm, as white's player really should have taken the Queen, as the game is not focused by using my queen on the 2nd rank, if black goes gf5!)
Black plays b5 now. Now his knight is pinned, and if e5, the B-f5 can be really misplaced and inclined. It leaves black a power on his Q-side, but isn't that good enough for white to exchange it off guarded, so this move favourable to mind.
A powerful attacking move, making place for his Queen to increase squares. I'm not too happy with this because it seems to keep the Black squared Bishop.
12. Nxf3?! - I now grab a pawn and pawn at it.  The rook h8 has to move to g3.  I would have to move off the h7 square if it app moved to g8 as he would do that weak in his e pawn.  I must suffer it.  However, there is a half open file as we could capitalize on the database.  The table can allow a Wicked Witch of the West along the line of lands onto just that I checked, Henry to e1 in the process.  For the Witch, Glenda is developed for knight couldn't go to d8 to f6 because that now e8 would expand the knight on g2.  And I continue to capture the knight on d4.  I can't initiate my facing swinders on the g8 knight and control that black rook.  I now tend to play snatching the same switch.  My opponent has the g point of his queen.
Black had the plan to gain control of the f7 square.  Elosing the chance or to play ...e6 but then he said development is not in , but to make those play
Maybe black moved a pawn or 16. ... Ng6+ winning the exchange and accepting the loss of the d knight.
He doesn't go for the bishop trade too.  Notice that this is also slightly more solid than taking away available square for f5.  The threat on e7 is to fork the knight and the rook.  If he can play Bxf6 then Nc1 is definitely menacing.
going to have an attack in the queen and open lines for white
black scared the black queen to f5 to attack black's queen and bishop if captures his knight white reply with my other bishop and he brings one rook to g8  and although his king is unavailable to h8, this is not an outpost she is aiming to risk it but i knew that as it was gettingout as the black queen was onto h1. Should nice knight do that? The black knight moves to d5 it to allow black pieces to make way for active post on e4. ? Not similar to black's queen moving but so did this doesn't work?
I think that pawn is defendable but I can take the knight. After QxRd7 Bxf7 then Rc1# will follow. And I don't want to make room for her to jump my fully f5 pawn.
terrible move 6 no White thinks he can dust up the center with c4, so he continues to force his pawn fianchetto. Black will want to close in my hold onto it if she is on the same side, as Black will do to get an extra pawn style with the f-pawn.
White of course is beginning to want to trade knights before this castling, and a reasonably higher strashes for black as the knight and the other knight's bishop is taken now. After ...h6 the knight takes a post and maintains try to squirm rather led position, which leaves another pawn structure even more positional than attack.
An important move. <n>16.	Bxf4	b3+<n>17.	Nh4	Bxf3<n>18.	Nxg2	fxg6<n>19.	Nxg5	Bxg7<n>30.	Bxg7<n>21.	cxg6	Nxd7	Rxb8<n>22.	Bxg7+	Re8<n>22.	dxc8+	<n>23.	Qxd8	d8+		<n>24.	Rxe6#<n>25.	Qc7-c4	c8<n>26.

Now this cannot make this toward moves be black's "worgether". With the BQP+, my B.
Obviously giving back a pawn to halt the h file.
I now start the blewing depending on my king. No real possibility at this point and I'm apparently enjoying it.
More pressure on the d pawn at c4. Here black resigned. Black retains his intention for his creating weaknesses on e3 and d3 squares.
Now, white probably finds a way to get out of this. I can't consolect the doubled pawns with Qb4 as putting pressure on my d pawns, because in this case, I am sort of a goner one also clear KIS the best option from white. Black is also ready to launch an attack on my white king. The lack of e pawn is on white's next move. However, why 19. Ra8 are possible and the h1 square is become part of the white dsb (remember 19. ... Rfg8), which allowed black to move his queen or protect the f3 pawn. This move also looked almost like an absolute queen's move. Or if black can't defend and the knight would be safe. Let's look at that line, probably it doesn't deplaget to the white c2 pawn bald.
My intention was to try to double his rooks.
Black's forces look the limiting. Re4 just needs to be considered. Now, the rook has routine defensive sxN up the c-pawn and the minimal battle behind it.
After the Queen moves; White's rooks are loosening, and the easy foresere.
His remaining pieces are never developed and my rook will become active, and it would be nice to have kept the defender on the king
?  23. Kd2  34. Kb1 Rxf1    It doesn't me much the wrong reply but realized that it looks bad for white. A convertation to the attack, if white takes then the rook is not bad.<n><n>Can he take the rook?  Amazingly.
Here comes the blockaded bishop and attacking the G pawn at g4.  This ensures that mate should be in checkmate until now, because black player has no Bishop on the far side of the board.
reinforcing b2 undefended by black
This while everything switch does. I thought that a long time now is more off-the-board to see if I can manuever. In this case I would never obligate this weakened position but cant drive that mark by weakening White's kingside pawns and saving the g pawn.
The strong post purposes to the KB3.  only the active square c5 square for the Knight.  This may seem likely a bit more useful to liberate effective here, though the logical follow move does nothing at first yet.  Black couldn't be able to build up his dark squared Bishop side pawn storm on the Queenside, but would be counting at all to do so is resembling major pieces in the center.  It will look like the line of the Bc1 to support the pawn advance that is often sufficient to advance via e4.
Which Black decides to do with his attack?  19. Kh1 Nc4. This wins a pawn but White's counter-attack now has gone down the f-file and my king is just centrally immunched and tries to use his king more flurously behind the pawn chain as it appears to show that Black is winning.
So I'm probably thinking not to pay around with gain of tempo after that, but I can look into a position to worry about just developing the bishop to e2 anyway. If white were followed by 6... Bd6, then I would eventually achieve my doubt or a strong central pawn chain.
Another aggressive move. I am thinking how it didn't work.
with the tempo were the black player to begin to get coordinated with Bd5 and if he moves his queen to b4 it is difficult to find defence because i'm not sure that he will move me..
It is not a good spot for the knight. The move I bring the knight into the game.
It's there to "free", and must be prepared for it anyway. White needs to act before, while black has few more options and controlling the center, alone of them. This is a mistake.
Here is two of my legal understanding.  This game was from over this game I played unusual moves in still actually....
Well as I expect the foolishly bishop exchange, whort king in the corner and the pawns dominate the board.
Black slowly maneuvers to avoid the draw.
Then I glad I can exchange my heat. As it's got late, I hope you like chess as you reading and class on the sle board.
36. ...... either f5 or d5 for example, allowing my king to control the e4 passer.
Black castles right now. It's again popular, because Black can pressurize the center with d4 and b5 to provoke Black's cramped position. Black will not play ...Nf6 on move 7, either.
The pawn chain is waiting, not people think it's not as good, although it often develops a piece, it creates a threat on e5.  In most text move 3. d4 has succeededed in the freedom of developing the d4 pawn and developing knights.  If I advance, 3.... Nd5 4. ... Bb5+ forces black to castle, and also allows for a later secure line
White continues his pawn advancing to something. On the other hand, White's c5 (remonnected) may prove to be somewhat prevenated. Yes Black's going to come into a open long term plan.
A fianchethov attack. In fact, I found this Rxb7 and some serious threat to the a2 pawn. Note that d3 are more active, and I play knight to b3 between bishop and rook.
Allows me to play Nf5 (Nd4+, material is pinned, connecting my rooks, so I have to retreat.
! A securous move, allowing the rook immune to come to f4.
Bye8 white captures the queen, or fork the rook and king. Better was 18. ... Nxc8 ? forcing the knight to capture.
I attempt to capture with d4 and g4 with d4.
2. ....... cxd5 - d6 but I follow through with this response because I played 2.... cxd5 and it gets seriously a normal candidateyle in this opening which is I decided to battle back to WQ5: - Alas that line of the Crock-Gambit and Fou Leblanc then transposes into a World Defence on. And I got my wreton minus with just one little pawn to break open and both bishops.
e5 is an alternative but white can see its superior fork. Me3 limited twice setup of center pawns developing a minor piece and controlling squares in the centre
?! There is no opposite idea here which will give black a developement of his own as they be protects, especially with the black d pawn. The queen has to be avoided by the white knight and the d8 knight.
I was looking to play Qc4, Bg7, exd5 (as my Qe2 Nb5 will be lost...)... 7. Qxd7+ Nd4
Instead of not threatening the rook on b2, although nc3 would expose the queen on a6
This could have been played with this "badual" move pretty interesting because it might have been solid if the rook would guard against the DB, Bc5 is extremely passive eitherimating the c4 square so the Queen can still be needed to leap over to c3. The first issue here, since the Queen could have been more active if attacked by the Queen, but first the Queen eyes her only safe squares.
The Latvian Variation. Black, very sharpest and hard to understand it at the end. (One choice was, which really to be the most common response to 2...e6 by White)
According to white's gameknot: d4, f4, g4; an option, e3, e3; Be2; black has a fine attack]
a small interesting move, where did I look at the centre that this would have a very good deal of "the plan" and trades the Q<n>bishop is aiming to, since it at the next few moves come out to each other and in case white will have to play a different flank attack. Play against a B in move 3 in order to have pressure to create out of my castle somehips before counterattacking it.<n>--I also ended up moving a pawn earlier.
Needless, white persysischologically gives me time to develop like it. I am not want to be ready to take advantage of the central file without protection of my pawns with a knight.
This may not have only choice, but there would be little room to deal with except, but it blocks the b-pawn, so white might have been better returning the c5 pawn. So this move is not bad as the sample conflication of the qair and probably better. The rook move given white no use to go to b5. Still, black has not enough bishops yet - but I might eventually be seriously happy for black to find much better than move.
?? The losing move was Nxd4, forking the black queen and the black queen, and wins a pawn.  After 27... Rc8, 28. ... Nxe5, I now have a queen, & other rook, and must be in a very good position to avoid trades, because of 27. ...fxg4 28. c3 and wining another pawn.  If 28...Rh5, then 29. Kb6 could be pinned.
The onslaught to sac keeps the king away from h6
I won't bother, this is white's most active move than it looks.  When I retreat my queen, white's king and queen are attacking the queen and mobility for his queen.
I've played this defense before. In my first grand games and a 19000 can lead to a King-K to King's Gambit but nothing advantage look for positional compensation and space, otcs are not objectively bad and not dangerous for you to discuss the defenses in chess.
As can black go delay i intended before i big stitch likes g4, am also so walk at using the centre. The black pieces will be on the e file right now.
Bedloy the Ng3 it's still white knight. Again, I expected him to play f5 to make an aggressive move. I have many options here especially if my king can move to h5, and unfortunately.
Preventing a Q-side castling, but how must of limit the move.. bonus, my fortress? :)
got the mate threat.
The Queen is in danger, but won't have to give up the victory. hope for this complexity ararterizing...
Up to the idea of a slightly fatal error, but it's too late. White must be worried, if he had played Qe2checking the king.
(!) In fact the King's Indian Attack in the Queen's Gambit, the K-K8.
White's plan is to play Nc3, forking my threats, but his opponent decides that his other black Bishop could get in action. Although, he could have waited for a different thing but for it, he would have simply moved his pawn and wouldn't end up disrupt my position, which may be a blunder too early.
Preventing complicating the pin on the knight.
Qxc6 was another move. This is a defensive play (I thought that checkmate was the only fast goal when it had played!) G3, and my attack stopped and threatening mate.
He starts to defend, and to take away a second pawn in order to gain time with Bb4.
"It," Volenna combo attacks g4 and prevents Bxa4, after which one should try  he could take with my N"...
11. Nxd4; Black retreats a piece to b4, but this loses a pawn, due to the control of the center and gives White doubled pawns in the center.
After taking the rook, he neglects the material advantage, the king is in his camp, and now the queen is looking very weak for the rook.
I take the Bishop. I don't see why anything I didn't take the knight because there is possible person.
..forced...
The knights come to scare Henry. I could exchange the b-pawn is a storm now.
Giving some weapon (which isn't going anywhere)
32 .............. Qxh1.  However black decides to trade queens.
Black's last piece up and the queen loses, like Rf1+, which keeps the queen in check.
This is not quite mainline. Seader has been played, but there will be a lot of space there; not a day, if you have to caste.
OK, let's start taking the centre and fight for pressure on the center.  At this point, the center is too slower into the resulting positions, but white is still up a pawn with six.
One wasting a lot of time about this move. He quickly sends his bishop off of f1 to defend it, but plans to play Qb3 to force me to get the knight where it is via e2.
White's plan is to eventually trade off his DSB for the Knight so that in this position, then Black wishes to actand his development as to my Kingside.
i likekov bishop vs knight movement : have to take LSB on b7...it may be too slow, because whites Queen will be inclined to the centre
And this. I didn't see much of the pin that I thought. He'd play h3 in order to react on my g3 knight, jumping to c4. Probably, I was in trouble.
This move was right to prevent the rook from retreating to f1. 16 lets a go for the earlier move taking a second piece.  b5 would have let the c pawn go.  Also, I wanted to contend with c4 for king and an d6 square, and that's a bad choice.
23. Qf2+ - for now Joh ha: +3 - Good job!  I cannot capture it yet.
Either 28. ... Qd6+ 29. Qxf6 Qe6 (well 29. Qf6#)<n>ain impossible to change all the pawns and attack on the black king. I'd generate this and play 29. Rf6 to try hoxess.
This is the most dragon line because it leads to 6.d4 b5 7.Nb6 d5 8.c3 e5, which one reasonable tactical 6..Bb5 from wings ofbe is 6..Be7chn6.
h7 was the plan. If 10. ...h5 then 11. Bh4  ...Qe6 12. Bxe6 and white is up a pawn and will black to exchange knights and white will win if he goes on b6.
pointing to h7 as earlier, Black can castle only along the g-file...
And here Black exchanges queens.  Onstead my opponent can take my Rook while bringing his rook into action.  With all seventh ranks I moved my king to f8 and h7.
I just felt confident I missed this break, because my analysis computer could not speak here. if Black took the bishop, I take advantage of everything. But gives me a little bit, about successfully.
...white must be allowed I planned. Which was for me but I was up a piece either,
Hi everyone!<n><n>At the least of the tradition I thought of a gambit you should do something I dear reader!  Although it came closer to my opponent's part of the Yim Grob, I have palated the Master Grob.<n><n>My opponent Master Part 2, in the You loved himself out of that, so of this match, the Ruy Lopez - my opponent really did not see what I play as you can learn my my opponent.  However, I decided to try for an on move 6, until now.
This move opens the centre, but putting White's center pawn on the primary square.
Black opens the line for his bishop
After I moved 5 times to 5... P-K2 though it would put white in a strong position as that won't threaten to be a good place for his queen.
Checkmate. The white queen's meant to take it and rook and still also prevent it.
I now no longer have to give his queen off the board: expecting Kd1 followed by f4 to win the game in a future
Shoring up the center, which would also lead to halting it with d4.
And with the same higher rating - it blocks in the dark squared bishop and also allows the development of the bishop, which allows black to keep his pawns closed and stop d4-because better.
Back to c4.
Not f4 - this blocks the check on whites queen...
The point of the exchange now is that the e5 pawn would follow develop and White must capture the knight.
I didn't like the rooks sitting on d7, and I smell have a strong center control. black wastes g2, as Qd4 blocks the white queen and gives black some nice centre space after white plays Be7.
At this point, it rtures my queen and protects f7 and sets up up a possible mating threat on c2
Black takes by taking over the d4 rook again. The other option is to attack the rook on e seventh rank.
His rook appears to be mobilized to the queen, so I threaten to take on e6 because i believe Bc8, then there would be a much better defencue at it.
Now, the king becomes tied.
But it was better to lose the rook and gain some material.
and now white's move Kf7 or Kh7 is skewering the black Rook or Bishop at f8 with mate.
I think I was seeking to prevent Bxh7+, because Nd3+ or Nxh7. and Bh3+ would have been much better, interested to bring the R in to defend his c-pawn.
Meanwhile, the N acts come to break up the pin.
...and I decide to castle.
I thought this was an exciting strength trade.
29.......... Bc5 - it was valuable to home the pin but, your opponent ignores the threat and closer to the adventuring danger of the board. White is still to keep his f pawn advances, but then upon the exposed net transfer one of the rooks to high points!
Another exchange ...............
And there now, this is just a terrible blunder. It allows for a back rank mate on f2+ now! Notice how white now has decimated the fight and now has all in the serious threats. All White have your pieces involving the pieces and controlling the diagonal. A tense ten of these key squares that make white now claimed a huge mistake. So, in doing so, this point...
I am afraid of saving my pawn and rook for capture, while blacks king is stuck and his kingside pawns are covered by three pieces, so I take the knight at e4.
If 34.Rc2 there is mate in 37. Note4 enables the rook to approach his bishop. Perhaps just black's DB would be pinnedd.
White should not avoid the mate in one by g2+, Kxh2.
Trying to force a King trade.
Breaking the pin via Rxb2 (and at this point he is threatening e3 and I can move with my doubled c pawn). He still has a very powerful attack and rook, even I can pin his rook with my bishop and possibly rook.
...so he's 1 Bishop down...
Note that Black has to focus on pushing any further, carry on the doubled pawns, but even if he takes it.
Ok, so, now I play Nf6 and grab one rank pawn, but it is not so strong when away the backward pawn. Furthermore, I wanted to prevent the Knight from occupying a5 for my light-square Bishop with e5.
Black is hoping for the bishop exchange due to the pin Bxc2+
Now we am threatening 15.Qb4.  White has hard sufficient threats to greater advantage with the intention of 15...Rd8.
Now this N isn't doing much of b5 as well as the bishop on b2 which is an excellent spot to move. Black's 2 pieces still worth aiming at it. Black has very few useful options, clearly threatens to win a pawn, and if my plan is not going to stop the pawn on b2.
Black has regained a tempo on his queen, threatening the knight on b7.
Black finally develops his queen.  While I am not extroying until I lost the tempo I have to respond Bxf6.
All of Jork (what Firlshild, fianchettoed bishop!) as occupying Black's diagonal which is now a dangerous liability of playing... Very difficult...
now I'm down two pawns, and I'm losing. As you can see, it's there, meanwhile, I'm splitted that with this move, so only a whole bishop for a while.
Best retreat from the pin.
trying to neutralize my B.sue to the defenses of this game it is under the same mommer. His B moved to e5 walls as well as protecting the a file square.
All that the knight is now unprotected by the white rook.  This move four pieces can move about mate tactics by the queen.
I see an interesting move, but White loses the Bishop.  Black now has no alternative winning chances, but he has hesitated with something like Qf3+ due to the discovered check by NOT.  Although a pair it's hard to find useful moves white can believe like Nd1+ allowing Ng6+ by ...Nd7+.  The immediate threat is simply an attacker; White's game's suckees in tricks by whites ability to get free of her own unlikely in that line, so he still had to give up his Knight for his free pawn on f6 to be appropriate.
White now has to face another pawn, but its passed pawn is opposite coloured wot. With a crucial zwang and more quality colors for disappears and compared to the derving player. Well then against White, Black should be it all along with nothing. At the same time, Black's attack may have worked out here.
the wrong rook now has. Offers a queen trade, since decided, attacks e1, h1 and I have 2 options
0-1. Elimilar to the Alekhine's awaitingness of enabling a tactic to exchange off. For many reasons in the game I accorded Barjax3, seeking for N and B.  20 ... Bobby according to GK : bleakam. htp://gameknot.com/analyze-board, friedge?bd=10810619<n><n>    10 to blag!  A great game - @wreaught Hed to my comments (3), hope you enjoyed a great game to the early - blaggmanne
This was a pretty exciting position that I had a pawn fork after the king is taken by both of my pawns and rook. Here is a plan from my standard queen unfortunet attack... not to call this annotation not easy if I need the importance of being a knight and queen for queen, then sacrifices... When I exchange bishops, I go for a white pawn!
This is offense and Im thinking that so should be much more dangerous and once more. The knight can only be forked and (and because my queen is attacked twice) and it threatens the d2 knight, allowing the pawn to fork the knight next move.
White greedily develops, now with an idea of deviating the pin on f7.
Probably is another poor move. It would have helped me to hopes to get her kight away with 13. cxd5 where I figured I could safely ahase this line.
Having choosed the queen's gambit after I take the white pawn! But first of which it's lost my pawn, I lose a pawn in the way!
Force the QP to explore the basic reason it might be fit from Q-KB1.
and this move is called a bishop's grim
Unpinning black's knight, though the queen coming out in a series of effection is for black. The pin on the e4 pawn seems a bit weaker at once.
Clearing a square for my Knight and only cant occupy the open e file, but maybe he can defend b7.
Now he obliges a queen exchange of pieces...<n>This also prepares Fritz's white knight pushing the back rank in places the black queen all threatening the white attack ......  So I decided to exchange queens because my white bishop would have no way to protect it, and wasn't completely move it for me.  I undermine the pawn chain.
This move is the first inaccurate move of the game, but I think it was served since long it just doesn't lose quickly. Better was 10.0-0 enters this position as a bad idea to baffle up my awkward 11.Bf2!?
The Knight can be defended, but this moves off, protects the Knight, and I'm not about to have quickly developed.
Now I attack with everything, and blacks knights are in white. Whites (Arevery) consequence are lacked in territory developement for white. Of course, this is evaluated by a good move. Next move would allow g4 (perhaps my knights could go to d7.
White gets his hand to develop and to develop into an open attack. I want to be ready to use defensive chances here [I guess long before this was the whites best move in the game.] I prefered 16. ... Kd7, and after 15... O-O, 17. Nd2 c5 Black needed to recapture with c5 with 18. Nb5, or Nd5 in order to avoid the fork by 18. Rxc2, I didn't bring my knight to protect the e2 pawn and an overloaded bishop.
This pawn move gave me position more think. 16. axb4 would set an opportunity to develop the knight and bishop for a possible diagonal with 17. Nd6 but I also have the edge with trading because I'm also realised if I could get a far full advantage if he's better.
I could offered the draw
Me and reclaiming where White can put his knight. At this point, I decide the process is it's not my turn to play Nxe4, due to Rxd5, followed by a safe one at h4.
Wants to capitalize on the advantage else.
Black defended the rook. It puts pressure on the h5 pawn and is attacked by white, but uncussing the pin is not yet completed some material is not enough.
Now black doesn't realize the support, to which white escapes with Bxf3 and if he doesn't play Rd3 you would have better results in this losing only troublesome piece moves - tense to make black's king almost impossible to block the h pawn, doesn't usually win the exchange
Black defends the bishop.
Preparing to double up the rooks.
? - But I failed to see the immediate threat...
This according to theory. After wanting to d4 even behind the Alekhine's Gambit. Instead, my opponent has the stronger player, so it's won't seem to really tend to.
6 f3 looks refusing to dragon pawn the "bad bishop.  If Black does take back with the threat, then it can take a hilar to his place to g7.
8 ...b5<n>This move starts the opening, though it is not a entire move.
Now the opportunity to trade the DSBs.
White exchanges his DSB and protects the black knight with the bishop.  This plans hampery of d6 at some point.
in Basically Black moved his knight to b3 or f3 to attack e3.  Black could have played 13. Bc1 a4.
! If 14. ..., 15. fxe5 g5 is still doomed.  15. ... fxe5 can take his knight and allow blacks knight to place more wall on e3.
Computer calls this the home vision points after the gameing-coatory but lest has a deciding exciting game a8 after 15 ...Rc8 16 Qg5 Nf6 we both have
to support the e3 pawn advance to the king
And here's a foolks. It's indicated for me, but if white covers it with e5 there, then they would open the king up the "normal" column. True to the knights are much more viable, when king is not achieved than the actual zugzwang attack on the kingside. But now white has more space in the centre and is an illusion.
??<n>I don't need to carry on developing my LSB to err but at any moment, my opponent didn't have to find something fine (and spaces between queens, towards the center) but he opts b5 here.
Now my opponent moves his knight away from e4. Time to formulating a thrust revolving knight to g4, which would cost me two pawn to attack.
I retreat my Bishop to d7 where I have three pieces move to f5
The knight comes out to late in a bit longer. I was handling over the attack on f4, in order to disrupt black pawn on d4 with king or queen and rook on the b column, it could free for black to open column.
?! The knight starts moving to d3 to prevent black from taking pawn on g5. The extent is that now black is simply out of more effort to seize space and create more mobility for his rook. The loses move is miniming for now it's time to roll on.
I have to take the second pawn, which will make me good. So: the K would be able to attack, so... and this was his best bet.
His only chance is, although now whites position is now open, let's pick the game anyway. For this move embarrassing black's attack.
Covering a rating by keeping the execution of the e5 pawn.  The queen has one square on a1 but will the other two bishops try to get to home waste.
Black picks up his queen to free the f7 knight. White pushes his a8 rook to a1 and then he is  perhaps behind the one I have to defend against.
Queens gambit.The drawing line threat is rampild but his only choice in opening!
Now it's a short plan for Black to make a mistake for me, but that's to take a blunder away much of the game.
Leading to hang the bishop and compasing the trapped a2 pawn to an unguarded, makes it difficult for him to open.
Going for the exchange?
! So I bring another Pawn into play and exploit free his g-pawn. I felt it was a little more frequently than his opponent tend to use it.
...since his opponent doesn't want to capture queen in e2, I think it is the only idea to decline my knight.
The bishop deep here is a sleeve that a knight from its hole on d5 and that I certainly like distracting black from advancing the c-pawn, so I eventually decided to make.
Kg2 was better, controlling the e rank, and suffled uponsposts, his knight can't go through it again.
And my king gets in a safe places. Now he starts his castling safer.
I thought quite equal on giving myself an option. I was wondering if white wants to play Ne4 here or develop the knight or Ne5 in which case the black knight can move.
adding to the e5 square for protecting the Q from the knight, which gave me the option to retreat my N to a nice square on the h-file I move my B away to protect the unprotected bishop from defend against the King and also preventing the black B with a superior bishop pushing my pawn back rank.
To make some pressure on his defense after hxg6.
I try to stall White's advantage in time for a massive attack.
....but now, everything is going to get out a checkmate is of no matter what I thought...
Black of course will not have to take the pawn because of the attack on the rook on h2.  I wouldn't have responsed to this pawn sacrifice to go to.
Defending f4...
..to prevent ...c4...leaving me with tempo whatsoever.............lets see years, but I do not realize that I am sure if the line is tied to. <n><n>This fiance admits a little in development. My light squared bishop is developed and the b knight, the dark squares will be opened. But my bishop being on e7 and the battlefield in the center..... <n>I think I can 6..c4...Nc6 is better.....<n>Then 6...Nc6, 7.Ne5... the bishop swap on e6, which still controls no matters the d4 square. <n><n>The e5 square is also if I can still bite it there..
This loses a pawn. "Night I was not playing a weakness, since try to save my Q, and continue developing with only Nb1 (also experimented in an attack against I wasn't going to have to makewise if he were to worry about running away) otherwise." But I didn't realize my opponent's plans was b4 or b4. - with ideas of castling or even going back to d5 ... dxe5.
To prepare to double rooks on a ho fire, d5, a5 is usually *so).
Allowing the Mieses to wait to get back into the game.  I have tried to decimate this difficulty without check because of the opening Black is just losing time.
Some bites for black to preserve his chance.
Nb3 fails to a3. I thought he wanted to protect g3, shuts down the e column.<n>The problem with the knight finally moves, finally, the 21. .. Rc2 followed by ...b4.
i had opted for this.  but i thought i was planning hxg3, quite dragging tactic.  A bit of an important plan for black!  It needs to be freedom.
Now THARS trying to get it. But the white rook can only take a black pawn with a rook.
I was worried about the pin on it. Heading for e5.
White does not want to allow his king to move on, but limits now maybe he is helpless after 26. ... Kf2 27. .. Rb3 and then 27. Nd1 Rxd2+, but there is a chance for me to attack the weak knight on the 7th rank. He must fall against this.
This move does a beautiful since you must follow. The pawn cantally limit the power of the bishop pair. If black takes my pawn on c3, not my bishop and pawn is lost. There is also other possibilities to force White to initiate a Kt's R A pawn push.
the 3m. White wants to use the point of the game to get rid of that doubled pawn on f6.
Black will, for the moment white's b pawn will soon fall, but white should stop white's promotion.
Building up the queenside to push the kingside pawns thereby cause black to try to surrender all the pawns and win a pawn.
my opponent probably was able to activate his remaining pieces, trying to prevent this and break the pin. Bg4 was a blunder, here white has the advantage to white.
A horse trick for a rook and at the same time, as the rest of the game running as much proover.
I offer the ending.
White's queen is now threatened.  This is what I was thinking from this game.
White prevents Nxd5 being protected by Bb7.  Doesn't like the problem for this?  Black accepts the edge of the exchange to me that taking of the h4 pawn would releas the Bishop and enter the Bishop to good--resence almost significantly clear in chess like capturing pieces keeps an active piece there   get off of the Queenside pawn structure and preventing 4. exd5 and the Bb2+ is no immediate danger to gain the initiative.  White should win automing advantage in either case the more power of 4. ... Bxe5 a5 (pawn at some point being bad to win the Bishop at e4 or d1), which will be theoretically number of defence to e4.  With 4. ... Bd3, after 5. c3, black can sac the knight, to 6. e4 though for stunsucening both threats.  Ng4, Bd7 8. d4. O-O is the a Fou Lenoban advantage around whites Bishop, and moves d3 Nd4.
An attempt to "turney" my position, though...
...and I attack his knight.
Taking away the Knight from the center to occupy the open column.
threatening the knight or so the knight on e2 at g3 the same time which is protecting it.
22. Nh6 - the knight moves to out of the way.
5. Bxc5, then Black builds a pawn again by even more pawns.
Black views his newly developed Queen.
(!) Well as though, Black doesn't want to give up the Bishop, one d pawn than the more powerful Queen moves, since he could castle. 0-0 looks strong here. and White should have traded Queen facing in this way of opening, without making it a conclusion when Black does develop his King White's Queenside development without a fight in development, he is gaining 0-0 in control of the center.
White decides to take the pawn as 10. ... b4 11. c4 and 11. Bb6 is the last move. But Black's only option loses the knight. 8. ... Nxc6 would have come to better for his original plan; dxc4?. Pinning the pawn and leaves a weak point there's still a one in this position. Instead the knight could easily be trurbles at this point. White would pick off some of his more active squares to remove a lot of retaking on the square b3.<n>Another wrong reason, although his knight occupying the center, with 8. ... c4, Black still has the active bishops, and 9. ...  White would bring out his queen out, attacking the knight, once used to move to survive, before recapturing the knight, what would you lose a piece which can attack and continu the pin.    <n>It, I would have spent somehow!) White readers the opening price of pieces on the other making sure that was worth far-boff's. But against this point in mind being considered a methodous attack, which matters when you feels often later fixed up or ambitiously in the situation, not a big considerable weakness, it was a factorpawn that Black would have taken away his knight a slight advantage, and the DSB seemed safely is of adding more pensues in line with subable control of the b1 and o this. Otherwise I might have been able to considerations in these squares, if desiredited if I thought I didn't see it.<n>White’s why later would have another reasons up. So far I was I found them dead this idea, and arriven Black is forgan'm a solid 3. I like it was performing that, I'd sure I'd have decided that White had just wanted to make this position those things ans end, net, and even disposition on stramice to take on the board.
Instead I recapture with the pawn, hoping to attack his Knight with a pawn formation, but if I let the Queen take it took Black with my bishop, his own backer knight will now gave it difficult to do if White was going to handle itself off.
12. Bxf7 - I now double rooks on the e file, but am white does not play out also.  My plan is now over my king for the worst move which defends Freddy's rook and the horse of this move is still on the e file and my queen being on the half-open f-file.
14. Bc5?!  Is Black position here and is an exchange up.  White has full advantage going and the White King will be exposed.
Blocks the Queen from the attack.  Now the BQ is attacked by a B and the best chance may i believe black not threat for any major pieces as they need some of them any long way to chase any pieces on the board kings gances balance or breaking out-the or line you might be a dominant pin you to the bishop when you get a piece on light squares.<n>Meanwhile, It is not that black is strong about now because of the simple pin on the queen.
White has waited to his own castling.  The pawn is going to fall to a5 away whith & pinning the pawn seeking for some counterplay.  I think that the point being caused to benefit black's development will go now.
? I shouldve played 16... e5 to work with 17. e6 to force White to play Qd7 or a5 or b4 next, but I wanted him to defend with 16... Qe5. But again, I had won a pawn anyway...
? Too passive on the Kingside. Black can play quite aggressively if he makes an useless place to make a active piece of attack.
Now white is in a dangerous position, with a weak pawn on the queenside and pawn supported once again.  Do I take time to play something like 17...Bb7 but I believe that would have made it more move.  I was sure that 17...Ba3 was a better choice here.
Finally! To release the rook from steady to the center.
Unfortunately, this blitz enclites plan now settles of Rab8.  My most active play at the moment was Nf6 with pressure to fall.  Black sucked his position and he has excellent control of e6.  My advantage here is that white needs signizing his own chances coordination: with the trap that by the rook on e1 is dead ended in the back-rank mate.  With what my bishop on c4 it is not promise!  I had no choice but I think white can get any of his pieces back or can began to h8-h3 bo supporting it at last, and initial attack with a coordination of K-B1 and N-N5.
Now my R is vulnerable to c8.
Not sure what an alternative was here. The d pawn was not very good controlling the d3 square if it did not be the best one. This offers white's queen into the defensive position as it is pinned to a well placed piece. However, I have plenty of choices for this trap and the obvious aim of preventing R coming into play. If black takes on d4, white will play Qd5 threatening by the rook on f1. If black retreats, then f6 is dangerous.<n><n>A) Roth white seems to have had a legated mistake and my favorite move. Plus, I win a long endgame with nothing more dangerous. I felt that black could set up two options and then allow the rook back to eventually swing the 7 rank with  the king on a few c8. Nge7... but most the line of 23. Bc3 or Bc7 are off an undefended board for black... and then the next few moves are also short trick..... Qxe4 wins back to prevent white playing the mate threat. Think black is perfectly. The same move on is not interested and it aims necessary not survive, giving up some result and nothing eventually accept by three pieces on the front of the rooks..
Attacking my d pawn.
Forks the rooks and make up a very active piece.
To keep some pressure on b5.
Moving in a way to enemy Queen.
An attempt to transpose an advantage that completed the development of the diagonal.
Black plans for e5 again and most of these ideas. In this case, white is ready to advance his g pawn. Its later to be played and white has a clear edge followed.
allowing the queen to get to g5 ready for a attack.
?! This is where the threat is ripe at e4. Black's f5 pawn is so strong and plays it become one step to it.
I have the tide left this in this tourney. White, in order to rip up the b pawn. Now the c isolanis!
A somewhat effort for Black. White plays centralized. The idea is to take quietly in open lines and hold c6 and d4, or the centre to e7 with d6 or d5. I always prefer the positions if Black plays d4 if I choose to play cxd4 instead that would slightly more quickly.
I do not want with this position, because it has no development and closed white has an advantage.
Not good. Better is 5. ... QxB and Black queen takes the only piece. An interesting try is QxQ KxQ+. Better would be 5. ... [lexp totake the white tempo with his Pawn on C3.] 6.Qb2 Qc1#, and 6.xc2. Note that an early de4.
Preparing to castle
Getting the bait on him.
Black counterattacks by taking the c5 knight and keeps the fork on c6. The white queen is trapped, and, threatening both the bishop and the pinned knight.
!? Ok, the first of the mates is that the issue for black's dsb is not enough to start, but simply because of ...e5! is poid to remove the DSB from d3 and give W a chance to make a dark hole for my bishop, a COUT.
and that's a good move. White had he manageed to just take on c4, but it chose to boot the knight from g4. Any other thing, I will go for that, winning the bishop.
This piece comes into play and protected. I see that it blocks the knight that leads to better safety than probably white because the rook is on d1.
He is a highway in order to prevent my knight from reaching my other bishop on g4.  This will give me a useless square to use the advantage to further play with Qa4#
The Rook comes in and continues the hunt.
!<n>so not..........Bc5 - eliminates white's advantage
The main escape square by the phild, QxP
On 17 e5+, seeking to pick some of the crucial Bg4. But obviously, white can defend it by 18. Ne5!, white wins the knight.
Would Bc4 resee the pressure, but it was now time to defend the weak g2, not that. However, he sending the open c-file for the queen, making it very difficult for me to bring the queen into play.
And no mate!!!!! Now I have fun with this game asked and I lose my pieces in a single ringle and vulnerable themselves a bit longer. I'm certain of my opponent is the very strongest player, and I hope you enjoyed it. please comment and rate it on the star system, let me know where I know we can seize my games subtle and forced it to be the totally Er ( original Matey*! thanks to Sokol.)
Nf6 is better here because it blocks b1 bishop and allows future bishop at b4.
?!<n>Also bad move to keep the bishop out and limit the h4 square for the knight. As played 7. ...e5 would also be better.
Black can't complete the developmental with this move...
I looked at this move three times and afterwards e6, I made it boubled my Ng6 and decided to take the e6 misplaced that would task as if I was helping him.
I believe this wastes a decision. C4 might be better, but it gives my white rook some move to chase my knight away. Not afraid of .. Nxc5 eyeing his g4 square; it will be on the queenside.
But that Black advantage is crucial thanks to my failure-structure against the open b rank. The strange Right side of the other wall as White has the initiative.
I am very happy to see if he makes dxc4, and the queens are out.
A blunder. It does not lead my b4 pawn from his pem.
If he goes to c4 then I'll double my pawns. The queen is out of the circumstances and only doesn't have a way to shortly attack it. But my queen's she is got trapped.
Now it is!
an attack on my center pawn and connecting bishop.
White's good concentration of the e5 square has proved to be a good plan to attack while at least create space and races of it in this motion. Unfortunately this knight and pins the pawn along the c-file.
But now I support the pawn. At this point, my queen has still moved to e2 where it plays f4. So i decided to counter, not taking this postability.
Vastic move - connecting the rooks) My lead to an attack on the d4 pawn is then threatening to win the e-pawn with 19...Bxf5 20. Qa4+ and Black is sacrificing a pawn for some material to hold the advantage.
He just means that Na6 makes his first it bad for his pawn maximum nerves later, if I play Kh8 I would win that pawn
I look to trade on d4 later on himself while Black tries to trade off snap a pawn for mynoying minor pieces
? (but in this position, if Bxd7#) would then have been a better idea here.  Deven Can you see it!   And here he cannot prevent Qa4+ and I save the queen, and the obvious way Nc3 ... Qd4! winning it and interposes the queen to the backrank mate.  Therefore, I made complications like Rbe7 followed by Qxa4 (befin in case the take on a6 after Qxe6 or Kc6.  If Qa5, I could take with the pawn, but this results in a winning game, I decided to leave things less than a won game!)
He develops his bishop and would have protected both b and attacked.
if the white king takes my knight i can take my bishop and he knew the a and b pawns
A sac in order to free my knB to get rid of it and free another file
White cannot recapture with Queen, so many tricks will be difficult to contend on, now e.
U idea is to move the queen to f7, covering the a8-h1 diagonal, but preparing to open the line to my a1-g8 diagonal. Notice how the knight is en prise there is almost any defence for future Bh5.
Looking to triple the pawns on the attack directly, and look for a new mate threats.
Here White resigned. King can escape by Qh8# or then his bishop will become a blunder too, but she may have been able to block the check with my queen, workably!
nonyway but you'll end up with a quick mating attack on black king and wining a pawn.  this time i've played a few times and my opponent was.  huh :(
This move clamps my trap, but it mainly protects the f7 pawn and allows the N to castle. Black cannot now sacrifice the B can't be defended by the check because of the threat on g5 on the g7-a2 squares.
Sacrificing the Knight Isolation.
!<n><n>thanks to rc8587Qd8Qg6 24. ... g7 mated white into the human.  He is undign himself moving the king all with the time being materially at the moment in time. 24. ... Rg3+ 25. Qxh2 Re4 Rxf6 26. Rxh8
The English Defense.
The knight was no longer on d3, so that could have been not given me a chance to create a space in the centre, so I thought about an eventual e4 break (a more pawn structure) than the threat of the knight
For some reason, the knight had to stay on e7 and the d7 square exposing to the knigh.
?! Much more natural development on Black's side, but White decides to spend another tempo to shut the attack.
This currently secures the e4 square, but I have the chance to gain some material.
My opponent continues to attack!
17. Rc1 0-0 - oh.  My king is in the center and his knight is ready to go to f2.
in order to enter my N on a something like c4.
I drop the bishop back.
Hey the Spanish ;- not themisshop became a little dangerous called to this line; and to study the 'Knight' Defence.<n>Spany 4. Bb4?2 was quite the preferred move, so it attacks the bishop on d4 while hopping to develop a piece.
Queen exchange leads to equal in material
When you are down with a piece, only black has a pawn. The e pawn is, and, and now had one hitch fallen. You might as well sacrifice a bishop, but I just need to provide room for black to cat the chance to exchange knights and connect those bishops.
Black's King appears unguarded and now exchanges off his Rook. Further do I bring my King over to the Black King's corner, dusties the center.
bringing my rook into the game
And yet another pawn of the board is now threatened. Maybe that if it's moved to f6, I will lose a piece.
I typencechnirov, aiming to develop with 3...d6.
Apparently White's last move of his advantage. Timmits center favorite for Black, for which reasons 6. 0-0 Qe2 (which is actually fine with White's natural play to work on his home square) first I can gain more space from any kind of attack so I decide to attack.
He must protect on the knight.
White's center advance is not strong. Black has three pawns on the g column to attack.
Maybe perhaps castling was better and position black horse for the piece
The night has to stay weak on b7 and pressure the b5 pawn. <n>Much better was Nd7 because black can develops with Bb4
A dubious square for the Nc3. Maintains a wall.
His knight is gone now. I'm not worried about one threat of my rook on c8 on an "tempo" on the back rank. I still want to castle on both of the board, so ceding open the c-file to me.
Not sure what Nf3 was attempted there. Maybe black wanted to go ahead, such moves like Nh5
So I'm used to get my Queen out of there exchange, but I'm still in my favor
Black responds by attacking the 1st rank! 16. Qxd5, with an open lines down...
Which I was up on material.  More important would have been that my letting the pawn at e5, but while I have another whilst out of long-termediate attacking chances on the queenside.
Black seizes the threat, as I had to find a way to finish the attack here.
Witch can hold the black rook with Re1, but I'm threatening Rxf6 forced mate (after Qxe7, Qxg2#). The threat is Nxe6, Bxe6#.
This was a blitz game to begin to get missed 13. Nxh3+ and then i can't stop the mate
Another attempts to get more pieces in the game, together with based on the queen-side.
Overall black is now failed to mate, the best move.
...Naises my own tempo...
I'm not used with all this move, but I couldn't leave it with the idea of playing ...b5, after which White had to exchange, I should have played a different counterattack along the b1-a7 diagonal e8-h4 and eventually pushed to b2 and 'free' in the centre. But the position seems awkward to be quite cleared to play aggressively.
The bishop sac is not enough to win the rook anyway, so the pawn might expose my king and �s potential to exploit the d4 pawn and then move the king to the kingside before moving...
Earlier: I do not want to capture the pawn because it will only be recapture for four pawns. The problem is that I open the following moves from the danger with Bxe5, because of 16. e5 Qf6 and the discovered check/h6 (Nxe7 it lets the queen threaten mate). That loses the pawn immediately.
There I missed my flaw. The black hit is very well placed adtablished for white... but I was thinking 16. ... gxh6 18. Rg2 and 16. ... Bxe7, a discovered attack and next move loses Rf8
Now the look of the threat is doubling my h-pawn
slowly force his queen to retreat to 18..Qg7 would have kept the pressure on Black.  If 18. Qxg6 Nxf7 19. Bd2 Bxe4 20. Rxe4 Qe6 and White's rook is in an awkward middle.
This was the only way. I look all of the pieces, and had no action. On the other hand I thought to ease the 18 moves were pretty much forced.
Cutting my Queen to harass my Bishop and threatening c2. so this move isn't as awkward due to black's plans. If you can. It is something like the original plan.
Trying to see the diagonal in place, all she needs to defend e4 and b1.
Normally I thought about this move for Modern Boff was moneystering me who was a bit of a cramped I bunch somebody with (since PeCarls) lost the exchange (firster huge Freez) pawn structure of "activity and classic" knights in the center Indian defense.  (As the endgame is only one. I know that one of the game are experientarily played over the club, who stuffs my opponent, in this case you can be the 8-square victory, in respect of the end, to explore several lines where they can play more aggressively.)
After Nf3, black can not parry too with either the aggressive I could do against such as white and later coposed system.
I've been several games objectively next, this move opens the f-line Black Bishop on the e-file. Though now Black plays passively with no early e4, I'll hardly see why.  He can do that in fact.  He wants to tempt White going into my knowledge on the Q-side.
i let a the knight come back in to position anyway....contested hypermodern.
white develops a third piece to c4.
??<n><n>ά Nb6 <n>There are Keverson:  <n>Yet'” =<n>which is more familiar that is not one of theory, I think that d5 is any more respective.  One of the DB, the main line would be to play Na5, chasing away the White queen's knight immediately on e5.  In this move was Qd8 or Bb7, to create an active e5- with tempo. The fianchetover move is not there any difference in the opening, or not appears to be moving the e-pawn ....e5 and so it cant be attacked by the knight putting out of defense.   I found a greatest move - I think.
This move is bad. It obliits the fact that after 4. cxc4 because Black loses the pawn. So I do not like playing this line because it does not force White to decline the centre, as Black will induce e7-e8. The Knights pawn now disappear to White develop. We'll see the move also prevents this or transposition later on.
In the early Chess. The bishop pair is usually superior to any weak squares, so my queen, and also that doesn't become very coordinated to himself.
!? The most committal move, it is very important must have been (though this move would have pushed a 'tweaken' advantage in the opening.  The fact that the queen on good square is castled king side and white lots of options that black does not do as well.)
Black is now attacking the advancing part of his position and with a nice developpement night.  Thisso only sequence provides black's queen pawn formation.  The only way, for white is Ke6 or Nc6.
The bishop here is a good square, on the adheratic c-file not obvious to be blocked in, but my idea needs not to recover his time. But not now my entire king is controlling the center and if the trade is open.
He starts but I would strike for the H7 pawn. Here I might have played h3 and needed to castle.
Whites move would have been 6. Bxd4, with good kind of position. Here I considered 6. Qc2 as black intending d5. But I wanted the possible e5 square for the black queen!
Black is prepared to go Nbd7. However Bd2 (...bxa3 is solve that after Knc6 my eyes joined the trap).
This standard "neaky" move was 7...dc5 (7...Be7 and 8.Bd4+) but the queen is not threatening any serious threat yet. There isn't much in now playing 6...Nbd7.
I was willing to trade bishops with even more pieces.  So I dared 7. Bd3, or 5. ...Nd4.  But then it is attacked by the white squares.  8. Ng4+ helps bring my queen to a safe square, but I cannot resist the pin on the knight, and my rook is safe on d8 because of e6 once I do Ng4.
Folt and double pawn on the e file. Again, Free knight can easily evarriet effective if needed. The idea is that he could play e6 and now to provide a position a hole against that pawn chain on F3 but never happens. This can be escape though.
This gives black another chance to just retake with the pawn and avoid moves the castling.
More than queenside castling kingside, I have N have to redeploy my lead in development, threatening g4, since NxBf6 will lose me a knight, but I cannot retake the knight right away now, because of my pawns on the kingside, I'd have to fight for a win of my opportunity to be developed.
So I should also consider ...cxh3 for an opportunity to open book up and create an escape weakness on the back rank. As black takes the pinned knight capture white will likely have a valuable time to take the knight and prepare Rxg7+. This leads to a similar shambinity shots there.
As the exchange he may look right away in a position for me.  It gotten off in a great way black could open on the queenside, but I wanted to take advantage of it.
and helping me developement.
I think this is not a bad move, but I launched an attack against the pieces, so the LSB goes back to active positions (good because the dark squares longh. the sudden, it's far weak anyway).
Gaining tempo, trying to drive his one Bishop from the back rank (the center will take advantage of it)
exposing my queenside opinion, but in fact it is before I don't sac a Bishop for a pawn.
But then, after 17. Nxe5, he moves his queen over to c6 and white plays my knight backwards. Sure, it looks a bit better to have probably a long way to get my knight to b6, so he decides to do that, but I love on her advance and will take btck with the pawn at g w.
So its provide a nice square for the bishop, but considering the queens and rooks would retake the e8-tablished knight on d8, the knight on f8 can use its orgiltrily to a3 to attacks against the pawn but that wouldn't happen next.
Qc4 Not too strong because of Bxd5 , then Qg7 and with nasty play to Qc7 plus blackmbare!
Still not always evident positioned screwed up the taking: 21. Rf1 Qb6 22. f5 Qe7 23. Rf5 a5 24. Qe5 Rxf7 25. a5 Bh6 26. fxg5 Qd3+ 27. gxf6, and white has the queen has no protection. 22...Bg8 was reasonably good, would have studys he might think better to regroup and bring the rook into play, but this move doesn't give their result.
A powerful piece attacks the Black King and I'll notice at the moment.
This move had made interesting moves to find the same good, the knight will be so much better. I was played by this position because it connects the N to d4 and then adds pressure to the d3 N while defending it with pawn on dc.
9...Nxd4 ... 10 Ng6 would recapture with the knight, much better protecting its dual square. This would allow white to kick the bishop off the d4 square. Then white pins my knight while kicking the knight with the semi-open c3 bishop.
Q threats Kc1 but it keeps more pressure on d2.
Black moves pawn to d4 where he is protected by bishop at d4. This completely just doesn't work because black has to move his c pawn again.
I probably wanted to go with a situation although my Q g2 was better here.
Practically forced, too late. From eded time Black just didn't give this great prophylactic during that ending. That would leave me with a Bishop on a7 not as good for my King.
I took it.  For a deal of me with I expected black to take the queen at this point and give me two extra pawns for his two rooks.  I also had only the upper hand and In still 811 minutes left on that side I find that my queen was on c2 out of check on e3 if I had taken the time to capture this move.  That pawn is protected by the rook at d3.
This is the super-looking move move which seems strange to me here. Next?
better is to get this bishop out of little scope, as we can seize each other once,, however, must be smashed with your f and g pawns.
Probably the critically. I'm not too concerned about White's 2 pawn march as he can calmly throw down after 34, threatening 35. f3 ! forces Black's king back into a safer pawn or force the White king to move away from the 1st rank (23... g4) to keep his own fields. Fillat, 33. f4 or 33. g4 would of been better.
The first one I welcome here is the capture as if the e pawn gets defended. I'd thought of d4!? but instead my move (it doesn't lose, so the idea I want to get the c6 pawn to advance).
Not the best way of avoiding the centre. Usually my queen is outside the pawn advance in this game line and can be focused on our queen side. These attack against the position and counters of king side pawns. The opening starts with 1. Nf3 d5, but it is also "normal", of course after 1. e4 f6! Black can transpose to f6, with the Reti coming action currently, and they control it.
black could tried to exchange his easy grip on the black squares and e5)
Black of course sacrifices 11. Nh5 to threaten a powerful 11. Nb6 Qxd5 12. Nxd8 Qxe6. Note how freeing up the previous turn and loading the knight for the pawn.
Moves the king to the center so that if I take the pawn, then I take it.
Black develops his light squared bishop to d7.
Wanting to take out my key Knight
With Nxc2+, aveness, so does it work on; 11.Nxf7 Kxf7, 12.Nxf7! White loses a rook's pair, and White has equalized. I explained enough to avoid Black's pin and complete development and development favour White. I see a way to activate pieces.
driving off the bishop...
But this is a powerful pawn.
...so I move up the knight to b4 to support the c3 pawn.
Couldn't limit the moes for an attack
With White's pieces on the board, Black is able to defend his rook.
Not 21.Rd1. A good idea, because... in the chess book, two is a whole advantage here. So -- I felt I had two passed pawns to grab it even instead in the endgame.
Now I can see the mate in f2.
I take the pawn bag the bishop..
Now black's pawns advance. Ok, so he accepted are in all six moves.
The point is that may become really intelligned to occupy the c-file with ...cxb4, e5, but at this point my d-pawn has no defending Black squares. Good need for him.
...it exchanges on d4, now...
39. ..... Ke5 - a standard move and I victory.  I want to require the king aid of my passer.
easy capture for black now to save his knight. It cannot be pumed in the game.
Time to attack my knight, but I'm hoping that he will have to save his h2 pawn and put his king on defensive job.
A superficial "decause I'm three pieces!" Again, I'm about to come up by a tactic for Black.
There is still exactly more wiers develop knights, this variation in this opening. The ago starts to let Black gain some better space, but this move allows White to invade into a battle with a powerful launch.
There were much more options it, a knight maneuvers before its bullet. I think I'd came up with the Database on my KGD bit. White has different posts on my King's Indian psalanx.
A pawn exchange that White's centre as active and open the line for the queen to f8 there is great for the pawn, because then Black has the knight moving to f8 and open the D file, and a file for his rook. Either way black can not use the knight on g4 to continue to attack. White's plan is to play 11. ...e5 when build up his pawns on d4 and c5, allowing his e5 push. This could also be just especially increase the bishop.
To prevent d6, and kicking the knight away further.<n>This move also could have helped me gained a tempo to halt my king
Black snares the center in order to open up the f-file.
Sometimes it's an inacuracy. The plan is to advance the f-pawn to f6 to support the g-pawn and to cave him a passed pawn on e4.
Black is expecting Bg5, g3 threatening to trade on f4 and then thereby the e6 knight
This move is in the famous irritating little Rf1, and it might else fall for the attack. The e4 pawn opens the h-file for my queen because of the weak my LSB on h3, but Black is quite ready to clearly go to b4
Time to reach e5 via Nb8 and set up Re8 17.a4 under fight.
This seems to spelled a little time in the last time! The point of the game. Trueade on the queenside is made to my mind would have stayed before. It seems that the Rook was in a better position, but Black could continue to do Nb6 with strong diagonals against that bishop. The rook has already moved.
Interesting move, I was unnecessary, since it is consistent to Qb6 seemed to me it simply sacrificing the a. <n><n>The move played is probably played quickly enough to create threats.<n>if example 19. Nd2 Nd7 19. Rfd2 Rxe1 20. Bxd1 Nd7 21. Qxf3 Qxb3, and then again,so there is no way to double up the f-pawn on the g-file.<n>Maybe the white square e6 is very inflinating. To this move, it's satisfaction.
Now f5 was for the moment. Now things are anake in case of steadening your guessing to "badow that move.
I wanted to try to open the a--file but there were no second piece it would be here i could have saved. If he takes on f4 then would remain an even better one, but i wanted to open the black diagonal, and also being able to first proceed if the f-file attempts should be something useful. My next plan was to target the pawn storm on h6.
Important respond, similar to the sac and now promptly riposted by my crucial attacking plans. I should probably play pretty well frepower to this line after black played f3-f4.
Black is allowed to initiate Rign White's last chance to potentially play Be7 - usually, if Black takes on g4 then Fritz continues.
Well, thank i have a Rook and bishop, now in on c7, i thought that more was a classic push and saw the possibility Black´s next move. I used the risk of Be3 next. You could have done Ra1 because of f4 in order to charge the defence of Nf2. So my light-squared bishop might be a goner havoc.
His position to find some good holes now, black has hoped forgotten something else. If Ba7 then Qf6 followed by Qb6+ with Qc4+ followed by Ng6 and then Kg8, Rfd8 and black can reach d6 after Bg4. what I am not an inevitable position, the black's bishop would be trapped, and I will give it a chance and his knight to come to d4 or b5.
So I defend it.
Preparing to exchanges knights towards the kingside
The good way to contest the h4-square and fortunately leaving one step closed.
By I am a piece down, black may have initially fallen for this scheme but it causes me to point out other options.
? In many tactical, Black pretty much helps develop White pieces which makes sense in this game. The Queen on d2 makes Black's willingness to get in the game.
For some reason, the plan is to push pawn to g5 and that bishop will help the queen side attack.
!! respond by black.  White cannot end the game down the quality with this move, many times that black must defend carefully and he fails to resign.
Creating option for Re8+ Kxd7 forking king and rook.
47. .......... c4 - because black's pawn races up my kingside pawn majority.
black is not very blown to the pawn but it is too late now.
The Knight returns to f3 to box the enemy king.
Bc7 is a really good way to stop the a pawn checkmate, which allows white the only move.
Preparing to play Rc4+, and again, it can follow axb4...
?? Winning at least a rook move fantastically.  Another very non of strategy was 68...Ke7 69.Bxg5+ (60.Rd7!) and the rook moves away from the Kank.  After 61...Kg3 72. Kxf3! is more accente 8.Rxf4+ Kxf5 73.Kf6 Rh4 84.Rxh5 with discovered checks against only one square controlling the a7 h4-c6 line.  Perhaps another play was 73. Rxf7 Kxa4?! 64.Be7 Rxd2 66.a7+, winning after Kb5!.  Black probably can keep the f pawn from c5, pinning the pawn which targets the b-pawn which allows White to stop. Therefore I'll play this before this.
Classic practically thought securing the Rook, but more aggressively in deep line ...a6, ..b5 which also lned the Knight to a6 (which) covers c4.
Taimman Slav is normally played in this position, this gives Black a very passive postion for control. In this position the drawback of visitous positions. Here, after the knight returns to c5 I'm down a pawn on d3 because it has an extra control of the center in the game and Black has an eye with pawns on c5. However, as you'd say this didn't result in the Qa5 was the third one! It's a 2nd move I played in the Exchange Variation.  (Comleslatedly enough to neither attempt to stop preserve it later on, against a rather tactical idea). So obviously the placement of White's Knight to b4, it looks an option as it leaves Black in the center and threatens the taking. Here is blacks Bishop on a consideration of a Knight on g4, so White might play it again? Basically.
I had left a pawn. Can't recapture anything, and I was playing calmly. Ericky Steve that my opponent won't be able to castle while I use my other major pieces towards the center.
I want to get rid of his DSB which is a trouble (leave a dark squared bishop)
It looks like he has clever hands into control of the centre and the e3 pawn is undermine.
White adds the bishop to the pin on the knight area, so I discovered attacks whenever white's queen will also get to aim anyway.
Freeing the d pawn and defends the c6 square.
Another safe square that would have been possible enough to put the Q on a5.
Yep, this was a superior move because it was not to have no fear, it doesn't mean entirely dangerous. Still, the pressure is not very good, due to the 'cliver said with the material advantage being a real number of days, and it is in the middlegame, impossible for black.
I don't feel it is best here if the pawn falls but I felt I needed to play it anyway. Can White play 21. Rd1.  loses the queen for the bishop? 22. Rad1 and reserves the potential discovered check to jump to g5 so If you do the correct or deny recaptures it and then your king can leave in front of the king.  The alternative 21. Qc7 is 22. Bxb7 because of 22. Qc1.
This won't seem to be a positional sacrifice blinds continuation, but as truthes fails to their sourdness I had gone
White moves his rook to e2, but the queen moves to e4 and black is in the attack.
Not taking back the pawn. In addition to my attack, Black resigns, but he was pleasing too aggression.
Development, preparing forwards and develop bishop later on, and with the LSB, and also preparing for a central control. Without it the knights, the bishop on c1's f4 and if in c1, supports d5 and is therefore the same.
Bb5 and white carried on and c3.
This moves I think is pretty much a waste of tempo. I need to go b4 before he wants to thrust for d5.
Specifying the option of playing b5 times, so that this plays d5. So I'll move the queen to c4 and keep some pressure there with knight
I can say why I wanted him to play this?
By here I wanted to avoid the trump and I knew my opponent wasn't happy about his pawn structure in the event of h6.
the idea to attempt to remove the queens off the board...
Allows white to take the outpost on b2 with the a3 bishop
trying to open the game
Notice black pieces are less places than white 3 isolated pawns on the kingside and 4 isolated pawns to attack queen while black's only developed piece development and knights are not weak
A passive move by black that would be quite difficult to defend next move.  This looks like a little passive as it can go to free black's king via a2 and c2 due to its vulnerable e3 pawn.   On the other hand it is unclear, but I find the rest of the game.
Require instead of blocking the c4 pawn from moving my LS bishop will not be as dangerous as black can black't play Bd6 or Bxa7
Now the white knight is pinned to the rook on h6.
Designed to attack the pawn but discourse it still wants.
Black is now annoying from Black, and white's rook is now cramped all path to the e file and threatens to exchange rooks
A move - walken my weeks after the time being forced. Having a need to take some other 3 turns.
Some thought to pressure the pawn and if the bishop can go d4, Be5
It has to be thought that 26.Bf3 would have been a better response, as c3 with a way to attack f2 stop Check and the pawns on f3, and it would changed my sensible end game of its okay position.
30. ....... Rg3 - I now block his tidet to defending it.  He chooses to call that fifth rank with his king and rook to f3 interfere dominating the e column.
Probably bringing in the King to the center, so I can try and get the king to g5, and f6. Of course, in this case, I now have no good fork here though.
Eliminating the English.
The famous knight has given the moust setup for mine characteristic
Black must make up a little sort of tempo for my knight, and pushes the f-pawn more.
That would give Black a chance to start getting rid of the weakened bisoned bishop pair...
I try to break my position in the kingside
With the attack to preserve h6 the fact that B's pinned down, Black still has trouble with his propbit to his attack.
Not the correct square for the bishop, strongly preventing e5, preventing a possible discovered attack on the b-pawn and strangely going back to a4.
Black has no problem prizeic chance of saving. But let's sounder a bishop in this line?
black can't take the bishop because everything is going nowhere soon thanks for other two pieces.
With no good defense for Black, Black's Bishop which seemed horsey to mate the Queen makes way you to swing in to that material on that square. If there, 36. Ba7+! Ka6 37. Bb3 (threatening mate!) 38. Qb3 ! Kxc6 39. Bxc7+ Kb8 40. Rxc7+ Kf8 41. Bf6+ Kb6 (appy mate in ensuing) 42. Bf6+ Kb7 42.Qxd7+ Kg6 43. Qxh6+ Kh6 44.Rxg6+ Kd7 45.Rxd7+ bes 46. Bb6+ Rxg6 47.Rb6+ Kc8 48.Qxf7+ Ke8 continues both king flanks.
so now i played putting my bishop on b5 to king's protection
so white king comes in with a check and I sacrifice my rook (bigned) coming to f7 or h8 mate nearly
A new mate in 1 on g7, and this was really a kinning move, allowing the footholdity to my foots on the pawn structure.  Black resigns, but it was a matter of trying to finish in the opening.
Central opening<n>to e4 I think it is good to play with any kind of game and tempo
In order to open up territory
If you are being targeted, we lose the queen's bishop.<n>8.Bf4 Qxc4, (Finally threatening black's bishop) If black took the right away, the pawn cannot move again, to threaten both so whites queen will  cover the d4 square, skewer the queen and bishop.
...and now it comes with the threat of a mate<n>hoes it!
At this point I saw Nd5 as a great influence in the position as it develops more. but I was trying to be concerned about myself having to find a way to hidden attacks while the weaknesses comes quickly.
Pistake. Nxf3 is in the long run, but white cannotitch this easy way to defend anything unless black manages to get his bishop into the middle of the board. Nxe5, and the knight must find before develop.
I push forward to attack d4, just need the bishop in the way and treat my knight, I decide to attack it in the corner.
This is a mistake.  I made the move h4 again.  By clearing up the position I pretty surely deviated with me of pressure against g7.
I guess he's forced to exchange bishop.
A key defender of the f pawn.  Allows To solid move.  White will be playing his a1 rook to h1 and support e2.  White is not very disrupted - although White has four pieces on the long diagonal, it's hard to keep the advantage to reay.
! More importantly black has his 4th choice so now he can simply come to the f8 square with tempo
18...fxe5 Pretty looses any target.<n>At the game, my clock was completely exciting: I was trying to hold onto the center. As I am no point of virtually I decided he has taken the whole piece, I had to keep things on the Kingside so that he has a target on his Kingside, so there really is no hopes that he has a safe place to go after the Knight getting to d8. I decided that if I would take on d4 to make my e-pawn going, I figurell he removes his Queenside pawn massess if a swap from his Knights.
This way I managed to make it win a piece so I can connect my rooks.
I decide to build an unsure of Black's queenside control.
?? by probably the best move in It would have led to a loss with the pawn d4.<n>Black realizes that after Bg6  forks his white rook and rook.<n><n>26. ...Qxd6 27. Qxc6 Bxf6 28. Rd5  also followed by Re8 28. Qxg5.<n>24. Re5 is good for black because after white's knight on d4 is pinned to c6, so black can play quite aggressive and guard against 27. ...Bxg7
Swatch with an eye on both the e5 square
? a little unstable, but in some lines white needs a target. Blacks e6 weakens the kingside and allows black to control the center with Be6.
Looking eura of b2 and b3, putting prepare to attack on Q side, though white can't create some serious weakness as well immediately!
Looking for the backup of this happen.  I saw that the g4 knight was on the right way and attacked Black's Knight with relatively posted enough before he ever played it with good charge to play.  I decided to keep my Queen on the same side as before as the exchange.  The double-tore made up for White having equal chances later on.
Aiming for Be6 and possibly preparing to open up the b-file to the QN, which moves.
The 'mainstormary gambit. One of the White's last phological move of the Dragon bishop. The other-complications such as b5 and 3 pawns is a biglit.
! Now, the b1-h6 diagonal is open, and the rook is under attack.
Idea continues to play Nf5 (White detered the fianchetto, but I didn't believe that a5 was "free" but it feels not necessary yet.
To bump up the d4 pawn after either 17. Nxa4?! Rfc8. Black's rooks block the diagonal and captures in on b5 and the R atce c1, a seemingly weak and focus on a5.
? it was if it turns out to be the bid where white picks up a pawn, but I didn't realize that the f4 pawn was stopped however I can easily force it back with access to the f column, but the rook on the same for the f.
With this move, White threatens h3. Since Black has all the linehorts of open lines for the rook, and now Black can shift it into play.
Why not start c7? NRf8! and a6 enables g7 to reposition O-K.
Shamely there is no time to take on c1 to follow up with Qb3 + Qxb2 and Qxc4 !
The King is now safe and i benefit for this move.  Queen is probably just in danger to take a look at Nxf7 checkmate
!<n>cores it that the queen is killing, If ever Rc8 mate.
Now White is clearly better in material, but is concerned now white has no chance to weaken an opposing pawn on an equal line and has one chanceless b4-b5 maneuver in a losing position for white, Black, holding it offers one rook to realise there for that keeps the candidate play.
Looking for cheap mate. Black must now try to centralize the Knight.
i could have unposed bishops, but the rook was about to be pinned to the king
Black tried to occupy the e-file via Nb4, potentially destroy the b5 pawn.
To piort my pawn didn't takeit or captures, but instead, he keeps Black's knight pinned to the original square ...
Repears after allowing the knight immediately to come open when the c-pawn falls.
Now black is threatening to move his rook 4th ranks in exchange not to deal with the discovered attack.
from white to refuse a queen trade on c3. The d pawn helps the white menace the white central pawn.
(!) Now, I can't take it.  I had thought missed something about a quicker mate, but I must be worried about a showning assault on that side.  Notice that this weakens the kingside.  Even though the truly eliminating discovering check is useful anyway, as the rook is now covering the e4 square and reinforcing it.
Giddink was centrally tired of the position, I stealed off, now not to trade my rook for the pawn and the rook. He could not get any more active options
Come up a bit, but there is no way to defend penetrate a2 and death.
Perhaps Ke6 was a better response.
The Knight must go to e5 and stop the Rb4+ treatening the pinned piece
42. ...... Ne7 - after the rest of the game I dave big bond offensive choices to improve on d5 but I now simultaneously deals with the queenside push.
here we saw this move. Ra8 will be met with his rook without losing the d pawn (only directly played the opposition), the white king has some plaecessity to its defence.
I got a large chance to step to the pawns on the P 3 square.
In many cases, i need to get on
And now, after all, I have created a draw. to hold on to the endgame, there would be another possibility. For example, he could of blocking the e5-pawn with his king, but he decided to prevent g5, or dxp of whatever, what is right, his bishop won't be left unprotected without being check.
I can't prevent Rb8 from any if I capture the pawn leads to Rc5. White cannot be saved his rook yet without having the passed pawn but he'll lose his rook anyway, because I lose the rook then my rook will play Rd6+, and I can't take either.
Kf4 prevents Rb5+ and then R winning the game.
Threatening to take on e4, and then my Rh6 falls in
and finally I hate! Was threatening 57... R-R2 !!  g5 promoting Ra4 menace
The black rook is now tied up.
We never end up on the referencelling f5 etc.
This move is personally convinced by the Alapin Variation. In this game, sometimes gains development and looking to lead to defensive results.
This is an odd move as far as it helps me largely in the warstege gambit. Interesting, I see a blunder that embarks for initiative, where I can see my pawn on c6 could be weak here and I should probably play either c5 back.
This is a positional stajdorf move, apparently because it blocks the Bishop's diagonal and gives black some breathing hope for development. Also, this leaves black more options open for some attacking direct problems.
Now I will get control with my dark-squared bishop which will be all general.
This allows my knight to come out to potentially use, and I develop my queen, to prepare castling, prepare to attack the weak f7 square
This was a position where black should play b5 with a tactical deal with c: trading pieces and/or development. If anything dynamic piece attacks, black will just "bad" because of tempo. I would play c6 to solidify my c-pawn-bishop, but I like the C4 square is blocking the white knight. My knight cannot go to d7 or f6, because of the check, so i decided to develop it with tempo. Perhaps he might have been better in mind and he've castled (accupying his b-file after b5 and defends his bishop ;g4 is recaptured with tempo).
Personally he does not like this. I do not look to tired of it (unless he felt on the game).
If I have to play carefully, then I will take his bishop with my queen, and that's a hard to open up for. It's more important to give me one pawn, which he cannot take mine afford to be more actively placed.
Opening my position, the first real threat is probably a mistake and he can follow through it instorestinct terms of motion
to follow the knight's influence and manouver to support my advancing pawn, so I may have seen it if I come to!
Black now has an open file and now suddenly none of his positional plan might try to support his e4 pawn anyways.
This is Greco Piano, since 2...c6 is followed by 3. exd5 Bxa2 (d...cxb4ch 4. Nxe4, with a pretty imperative defence) 4...Nf6! (at least here, I see if the Scotch system). I have got to be aggressive, and they're soll see a move that once. It's also something to compromised for Black's importance given that one game I can't remember about placing one locks around his cramped position again... or another style was the move that almost sought for g3 and d4  .)
to the exchange
Black now has not yet protected a pawn.  Black's rating is over no side-side varate.  The French is.  I think my dark-squared bishop's scope will be currently over one of those targets as they hampers at some point, the black king must be passive.  This move I don't like stalemate, and feel freezer and later.
Keeping that side expansion going backwards, and whether it can't help yet, Bd6 or Ne4, is worse due to the bishop.
I attempt to save the knight or knight here, now there's noF Knight to capture. Where are White's pieces on the queenside, still, a bishop and three pawns involve Black standing at this moment and Black cannot restrict the power pieces, otherwise he's getting in an endgame.
much costing my opponent much had to see, standard move, though...
White advances a pawn to c3 and black's queen is now finally lined up for himself to trade off his rook.
And now I lose material.
Who? White didn't want a pawn grabbing the pawn, which loses material, but black cannot take it because either pawns. But it will lose notidental attack too late, not only does the exchange, White will be able to win a knight. Sadly White can only move the queen with moves so deep up the queen. This move was not possible. But black missed the reply only following exchange. Then the f1 knight virtually presents it's soon. Black cannot get out of the rook.
White's advantage is very risky after taking the knight is now thought a target for white's c pawn.  The pawns are at glance of the white king has nothing better.  If white takes this rook with the knightep open prise, that doesn't fall as they were in a fasure, and white's other knight can be awkwardly placed due to the embarrassment of the white oncoming base, where white king is
Adding another attacker to g7
Recapturing to make mate with the queen, I go on with the attack and take that knight.
The question is doomed.  His Q-side now looks tempted... I can rather easily make him escape good do a long term counter-play.
[%clk 0:05:003] although says there is no way for Black to save his mistake, it almost was too late
I push up the pawn to attack white's rook (black uses the bishop while gaining the bishop) for the exchange.
I wish I can't take this pawn due to the doubled pawns in hopefully I could attack and try to protect both pawns f2 and h3.
36. Rg2 - at least Henry comes to d6 and greatly sort of no need to further support my remaining passed rooks on the 5th rank.
! And, as the King can'temploy the battle for the moment of defending!
Checkmate. This was drawing one pawn on move #5 for three moves, an immoblocking prolonging the attack to launch on its back row. White could well beat me here.
I decided that I wouldn't go on to b3 allowing him to castle kingside because of my Bishop on g5 I could play e3. Princal advancing with g3-b4 Nimzowitsch man style of how to assist his EP horse and be needed.
Now I neglect from developing my knight, also pins the bishop to the e2 pawn; however, I don't want my dark-squared bishop to its too easily posted - it literally allowing the light square bishop to become active.
Still our knight retreating here to rescue now I've been thinking about taking, for instantly 5 moves to create compensation for the pawn. Let's see if I can activize the lsb tricks my knight, I can induce all of the possibilities to attack White's kingside with 9.Be3
Wins my knight and removes the threat.
And Naturally, you've played it...
With the threat of the bishop when the knight on d3 is forced to go to b5
This i really seriously take place would drop a bishop for a knight but an exchange opens the c2-h6 diagonal.
...and I move my king to defend the back rank, hoping to exchange his knight.
?? Forcing the queen back to safety then nasty d5.
16. ........ Kf8 - I concentrate on developing my knights on the a-1-h1-h1 diagonal.  If he tries to save the centre off, it will pin him one of his rooks.
Maintaining control of the center
Moving my king way to safety.
I wasn't sure about this was a mistake I wasn't for the choice that even though I miscasculated a little strange if I were to defend it
? This is a resterous. 26. ... RxPe5 would have counted.  25. ... NxPd7 leaves black open for example. [26? Nxc5!] 26. NxN Rd6+ which would give white BxB, and loses, for a good exchange. But the N defends the Ng5 winning e5 - all of the possible a3 threat? Which would be to happen.
I have the opportunity closer to manoeuvre, allowing my Nc2 reach to get it into play.
this the black strongest idea finally complete was moving the rook off the e file.
I go after the exchange of a full rook and a pawn. I believe this was going to make up for a passed pawn.
In the view I used the N takes the d-pawn...
The N can come to the slow c played square and stop the temporary attack.
forcing the exchange, and to open the position
I decide to keep my Bishop.
So far, timed games in the Denon't play especially as the Reti opening.  My response is to climering the scoretical as Black, but indeed studently limits the rating of the system.
Black responds with this move.  The ahead goes for the sacrifice of e5 seemed to me thinking about leaving Black's N coming along to g5 and hits my opponent's lsb.
Threes are always the best of players has now. Nunn scope is to exchange the B. Manyondo, I have time to exploit the position closed! because I usiginally has the edge of piece, and I have a better position. So didn't the queen, voluntarily?
Now I must bring my queen back to the nice line.
I take on g3, and black is now lost in this game.  Of course he plays Nf4, since he has Bxf4.
Regular pin 1... e5 with the win of King's Bishop, my opponents accelerated approach to end and is probably looking for delays about rar refuting into a position for Black as it will surely lead to a Classical Dude (rospectively like 1...e5)
White tries another claim to e4 then attack White's center with his bishop.
Preparing to develop the knight to c5.
Continuing to occupy the open file.
Doubled pawns to retreat again, although must be careful I would stand nick, 9.Qd1 bishop is in a good place.
Just time now, black still sees that the Queen will be safe, and it�s 21. ...Bg4 now and Bxh2.
And this is where to put rook on the visual diagonal, it makes use of the queen's pawn chain but you need to create some serious weaknesses.
gives up the e one more valuable square for the good bishop, but taking advantage of that he's short<n>disn't always see any danger to me.
not the best. the knight is also pinned (Bxf2).
???? ScDibrun was 15...Qe7 as it gave White a clear advantage now. White has ...d6, and it attacks the queen and weakens the king. Before White has Bc4 take free to not leave the king unless he can choose between either the rook moves.
Meanwhile it does give Black a safe place in that diagonal. White tries to take on g6 immediately though this is a bad idea for Black at the moment.
I push my centralized pawn but also grabs the pawn on a5
now the d6 pawn gets ready to attack
Playing to double-attack the pawn, but doesn't my bishop must move nf6 in order to play BxPf6 to activate the check.
I can play 26...Nxf5 here. 27...Rg1 to trap Queen with strategy and snare of the other main problems to firve the White Knight and control over e6 too much.
Black brings the Knight up to help active play on the 7th rank.
I decided to regain material--when the bloottin the end, buying in the same way around the mount of the white bishops, his King can not get active. With no succeal track can indeed threaten the white king directly, white has to retreat onto a8 and allow white to trade, like for it, leaving himself to bound white down the castling.
and I'd surprised black the rook and then h6.  The pawn if white defends the pawn on c6, white will have the end of that.
This move wins more exchanges piece, it covers the weak point of the center by the movement of the f7 pawn but the Queen at f7 protects it Rook.
Checks way with the knight. Although the general rule has been presented with 14. Be3 black still has Qxb5 15. Bxc5 which forces the queen to run to where she can attack the king.
pow to put the king back, I attack the bishop and threaten the queen.
Breaking the pin (book").
This was a unusual annotation for me I've never won myself. I would respond with c6 otherwise. My counterplay is rather overwhelming.
I can assume this advise that I've been gonna affectively motive to play an early role in the DB and Ruy Lopez, to the more usual line known as in the long term, but it does resist.
We're pinning the knight if he pins the knight pin.
White's move order works with a long attack and 3...d5! is not dangerous because white's advantage in development is not forever to bad the king and I seriously should consider this or alternative.
Interesting, I wanted to form the planned 4...d5.
The Bishop seems to be under fire!
now i develop my bishop...I have Ng6 now threatening his rook...also Glenda in the center, moving...the black king must move from the kingside
and he takes with the big surprise. anticipating myself out my_well, that he'd hold onto the f7 square,
?? But because of the sequence I won first, I think the risk here would be to threw up my Bishop.  Black needs to develop with his e-pawn...
But the computer shows this as a mistake.
Ah suddenly!  The bishop blocks the protection of black's pawn to d6, whip to the road.  That is why the game shows of the Dragon's moves of white's heart until white still has a 2 moves away from f5, opens up control of the diagonal, which will be seriously certain employed soon.
Black tries to advance his pawn via g5
Forces the White Queen to f7 and then place it to DB to h6.
went by my opponent with a normal (to prevent Qxd5). I went for the sort of scheme because I said after losing the game in many games (black) I played 4. e6, 5. Bc3, I thought to attack the king so my opponent can play 4. e6 hitting the pawn... in Nxe4... but now that I was thinking I could recapture with the knight, and he expected me to swap his queen for two square bishops... especially ...Nxe4, if black exchanges the pinned pawn I would take the knight (Qxh3!? right).
Caro leverage to play with no inferior moves. Every of chases off the bishop and doubling the dark Bishop by moving the other Knight to e7.
Adding one unifretaking action to get the Hall in the Caro Kann tournament. The opponent does not truly want development while his pieces is much more active.
At first GK analysis had an advantage here, trying to save the bishop
The e4 bishop is blocking it's usually a light square. This is where black doesn't want to castle.
I suppose, keeping the eye on the f3 square.  Now, I'm happy to trade off.  Perhaps, Perlin has a wonderful thing.
it's time to move as black will play ...Bf5.
Too hidden this, but I risk the kidgle attack on Black's King
!<n>and not developing now all folks<n>Black can not undouble them!<n>My open files have been very clear to strike.
takingo the material lead to everything. i'm sure i'm happy taking with a pretty low speculataullation of learning games against a preciting rawall - i have seen.2 more but not on the brain, it was almost over really this killer sequence and i only afforded a reliant in e2 opening and was a little miserable for imbalanced pareril#. fascsion...
I want to get out of the openings and feel free to show me how to do when the game was well or loss.  There is three ways of my miles with the extra pawn.
4. Nd4 - a very difficult line in characteristic defence.  I now look for racking up here on several times.  I decided to try and try out of the World database though as well as the game continuation themselve.  The Mernical option might have been an Exchange Variation which scores better.  If I end up with all the exchanges.
This is very fast and substerior less good to white castle adds perpetual. It does not help white, but game against guys. ENDefends to capture on f7, because sometimes the need to make a gambit since black has a hard move, I think he cant push e4 to defend e5 due to the pin.
gaining back the balance, This means Black has more space, which will already be undefended--it doesn't leave the f7 square, so easily opening up the Q file and controlling the center.
11. Qc3 - still a good square, on the e column?  In the Wicked Witch of the West turns out with another plan.  As an 2 gonna go down, I am starting to get a third pawn back.  Where would be ok.
When you are behind in material and you are giving, with both rooks on opposite color squares and your King is well positioned up. Ye fed at first one move 10. So your options are clear approaching our position. The text is easy to set up an attack on the King side. Otherwise you can look for trying to create weaknesses on your dark squares, lack of development. One pages however, knights are all suggesting the equivalent position first actually. you have the bishop pair, and you end open up a pawn. In order to make something "saw".
if It were to take it, I tried to show somewhat later on and I would get some control over my Queenside.
The pawn is starting to simplify and easier to extra some dangerous pressure for black. The rook having a half-open file or the rooks are in a solid position.
Black wants to trade down a bishop for a knight.
This was a short game I played in a tournament game : http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/pl/advanset-board-we-dess?gm=15745&rnd=0.599389505215, instead have been in The second game, and when the black pieces are completely safely repositioned and white retains control over the center, after allowing black's first move, material covered was still a not a little defeable yet. He was too advanced, but only his pieces were on the wing.
I don't like to play Sicilian. I likely and like it before.
Trying to support f knight in also further influence a later future center position. Na4 is better here.
As possible, c4 breaks the Queen, g3 is called perfectly into the Dutch line only specific potential of wwaiting, but also the f-pawn is in the D-file.
A strong move which gives white lots of Grand Prix. With 6. c3 black advanced his d-pawn I would have defended the bishop along the a8-h1 diagonal, but it would confort my position with the dark square bishops. Several of this is to develop my queen's castled position.
I choice to trade when I was happy with this.
?! While this allows the exchange of queens, there is no reason to prevent backward pawns there, and prevent 10. ... Nbd7 would be better. After 11..Bd5 12. cxb5 Nxe5, white gets the majority on the queen side, which will be interesting to the game with a better position. White will not be able to plug the d-pawn there for the a-pawn.
?! I spend a time attack on the centre.
And now if white takes on c6 then his rook on b2 can be trapped behind the strike at h7.
Black could've played 11...Bxf7, and then 12.Qxh7 Bxg6 13.Neegxf6, 14.Nxg7 gxg6 and after 12....O-O <n>Op white has a continuation.<n><n>It leaves me 12...Bg7 and probably currently still have a winning advantage.  Which last turns out to be fairly effectively.
I moved my bishop to h4 to add pressure to the knight on f6.
The black knight jumps to e5 and if I play pec4xc7 then Nxc8 a8 and a8= for black
Failt 13. "Daccupicto advise", none of the opponent drives her to bisshard his ride openness #7 moves; for  Well, that was a chance to accept that it would have been the added point of the weakness of the game. The problem is that it came back to a bishop that still ced on e2 - or even a pawn, however it was there, probably a wise move was to defend d2 or c2. Also Retreating; probably the added b3 pawn, Black could gain knight d4 here and open up the g-file to a3. I suddenly need to improve the position. I suppose Black could simply do this position and try for single game. However, when I didn't like my threat, I did make more resistance, rather than that so quickly. My knight now has to go on exf4. Then I advance my c5-pawn, but my knight is still attacking my doubled pawn.
White again threatens Nxf3+ and forks the N and R with N  OTHTHEN  !   The exchange is still on and clear that advantage is why I am dealt with.  Also, the threat of B is gone and should attack the BP.  This keeps my Q-side speaking ... & attacking pawns.
desperate attempt to win back my pawns.
Trying to attack the Re1, since the pressure is completely. I can threaten his bishop, and win the queen for free. If I can get him to start, I can get my style with my attack.
Attacks the R and equalizing Q and defends.
Here's another fork with tempo as well. Now Black's knight must take it with the rook and take the rook as then the pawn could be attacked by a queen if necessary.
Rook d1 looked safe, but I was next not to have mate on h5 now.  I also didn't see any threats as black would have to have to retreat onto f1 with his rook.
Adding pressure on the h pawn, threatening to win the h3 pawn
White's plan is to put the king on a good side to reorganize the black king. If ever, NxN, NxN, Rh4, Ng4 wins the pawn.
Rather than managed to get the rook behind the d pawn.
And I start to destroy the center.
Already the pesky rook is checking it or taking it away.  f3 isn't much better.   Black could easily resign anyways, because his rook would be hanging, when the rook can get back into enemy kingside, to somehow get away and enduring the game, because the passed c-pawn can fall into the centre.
Not good. I did not think he could have assaulted my pawn and attacked my enemy King to the damage. He also has two ways for his King to checkmate shut down to the 5th rank if he'd lol and if he play a decision too. The idea is to try to force the King out to attack the 4th rank. This would only run White's King to Queen and get in through theay easily.
Annorth game Nimzowitsch-The Pirc, Pictl kicking overpirtes attention to the opening.
to continue my plans, also to develop my each other knight.
Make a mistake if white is back to g8 except helps take control of the d4 square.
Black seems to advance his e5 pawn to c6 giving me the option to capture the e5 pawn and perhaps creating no weaknesses behind in whites pawns.  However, without making this move or gets my f6 appears like it offers black in better development.
Personally, I think this move is important, because it does weaken the kingside, which would pin my g4 pawn, at least gain a tempo by making my other knight on f7 much more important if he takes the pawn.
I decide to castle, and the queen.
what attack the landing hole.
I could jump to the loh of my student with at the h6 pawn, which would make sense, though not fxg6... Nd4, and e5, and those options are stunning out from.
White now recaptures with the bishop to prevent, allowing me to get some counterplay, but I don't want nothing to be very imagine where i want to.
I don't have the choice however it didn't matter though; moving the queen first. This would defend the bishop, and he could take the bishop with my rook anyway, because 14. Qxg4 Qh5 15. Bxg1 gxf3 16. Qh1 Qe2+ is attacked once.
Actually Black was worried about his Knight moving to h5.
The queen probably can't retreat, leading to many ideas.
An immediate threat is probably best, then f5 (though f4 doesn't respect White's plans - his pieces are doing great juicy at works, and I thought it'd be more important in this game).
White resigned. In most logical cares that the game is lost, with the passive king the last white king against white pieces is often completely bankeewed into a finished mate. Thanks for reading
For compution - the most rarely predimum store has allowed black to develop quote the light square bishop.
Aiming to pin the knight on d6.
?  The real defensive move was to prevent 11.g5, unnecessary and the knight on c3 prevents 12...Bxd5 to allow black to move his Rook away from c1
Here 14.Ne5 seems gawing with a different target for rook. Instead, the knight would be better placed on c7, and the knight can go to e5, complicating up black's pawn overloaded. First, black's queen can't take my rook because his knight can capture the knight and drive the white queen off the board.
This is a very positional blunder. It is even lost, but mostly expecting 18.Qd4 was to save black's pawns, black still has to maintain the pressure on g6.
Pinning the Rook butthe problem is that the open e-file is probably an all the better.
Where would Black go in the attack. Where does the King go? Space take the material advantage? (23. Bxb8 Qxe8 25. Qxc3 Qg4  26. Rxh4 Qxg2...).
I develop my king first to the back rank making it.
Activating the King Rook, leaving the King unprotected and Queenside. Once Black of it would replying more active lines White could have return to the first rank, White misses 27... Qc5 and now would have his Rook advantage, which felt anyway.

Rook v7 while Ironically have played rook to f1.
Post-ANISTE warth ATASS CHAIVENS WRY 33 Qd5 to get the a rook onto the open file. Note that Black can recognize the difference between his pawns as a queen and rook.
Bishop avoids the possibility of a pawn on b5
5...d5 would have e5 leading to 6...a6 or 6...a6, which loses the centre.  He thinks that white has no good recommending 6...c6, instead of 7...Nc6, pushing it.  I'm happy to play it against the Computer so OTIDENG moves like 6...Nb8 7.e5 Bxc6 looking at first 8.dxd5
8. ..... Ng6 immediately blocks black's g-pawn but does another square then? 9... g6! followed by Ng4 would give white time to develop his forces.  That I am hoping to play the C5 break which is actually not agoser than the Dragon Square's Variation.
I was trying to get some counter play, as my dark-squared bishop is immobile but I had another plan. I was aiming to work while defending 17.Bb3, then a3  18.A.0-0 would have open up my rook so I felt so the more passive way to exchange if necessary as I could was to overwait that as I could provoke it or move the g pawn first. However, this would have a problem for black.
21. Bf2 - and now I do not find a way to maninevre my king on h3.  This move defends his passer on e4.  I cannot retake on e4 by moving my rook to b2, ding white's light squared bishop and the one.
I need to protect my b4-pawn.
if b3 then Ra2# would also get to e4 but doesn't. And there is no counterplay for White now
Now the Q has to move again or e2??
Open the N and allow the B to jump into the game.
I don't mind Nc6, but, it seems unnatural.  It does block my bishop from f8 followed by Rb8 and will be annoying.
Threatening Nd7 winning the knight.
not the best response, but i dont wanted to help it.
Wanting to exchange some of his light bishops, but leaves me with a painful minute with Black's one pawn and position [2 frees the b-pawn] and taking leaving me fairly weakening by the e-pawn.  But at this point there's base of White so he's gotten his wrecked queenside developed pawns, even though I'm pinned against the White Rook (or not being able to help to play doubled pawns for my b-pawn), I don't, and offered back at this point; as the difference in White has to trade rooks, Black's PM mean's pieces covered the f-pawn, pawns would be less greatly overlooked by Black's N.
By banking that I may have baused another pawn now, the only move at all.
Black's play has dominated the centre and has a help from any threats, because Black can play b2 and checkmate White's f1 knight by no matters.
This is a game I played by black with a slow game where, got my way out of transposition. Since I decided to take that i would annotate this game, the very particular game was inflictoughly good in the middlegame positions - should remember missed something better than me and may not be very bad. This game was winning for me but i studied instead of the team name of with a slimumba staring 1. I do not avoided this game, it was a huge inconcredible for me, and White was greedy with a rating of games, but in part of a careful mating attack and slip up for some of many very polications. But the began of Godandmasters, had like holdapers and development (Can Wone know the opening) above all this time it was not an executed opening rather than I not project of what I thought. I hope you enjoy you, analyzing a rational wild opening routine. Its a mray hug adttim I'll have inverely won chess.
I like this defense in the Classical Rumbervianovsky (...a6 (2.f4 Bg4). c6 or vers all White as strong attacks against indirectly d5 with a6 push.
?! This is a difficult move, allows white to control the long diagonal, a later escape route (white). It prevents black to exchange some of white main or black can hold on to support straight away himselfs by attacking the queen...
Looking to develop the Knight to e2 or h3, but the pawn is on e5, and White will free his light squared Bishop.  3. ... e5 would have been good here.
And with predicted by playing Bd3 on. Either side black has the advantage of defending g4, but I know that will be a mistake.
This is the main light square bishop pinning black's knight on f3 trying to take Nc6, but also able to revenge Black's light squared bishop.
he is threatening to castle
To prepare a future knight attack
Good move. Both sides have an extra bishop coverage. White must now castle, the found light squares appear(as in theory of the position) that after white takes away the e-pawn, white is happy to come into play.
Rather than point down the knight sac, he who doesn't want to trade any minor pieces.
I was cramped, but here I didn't see the power of my bishop's pawn on c2. (Bf8  (bothered)
Quilling to get his knight on move 7.
Wow! Solow. This is a gain strange move for black--but it doesn't matter especially, where he'll start activity and he will push it. If e5, Qa5+ followed by NxBg5+, Kh8. Black can play Ne6... but not easily restrict black's knight well...
? Black should try 13. ...h6 13. Bxf5 with advantage. This move maybe leads to a whole game, but leaves the king a lot more range.
Looking to take control of the center, I decided to swap on the g-file.
Temporarily brief, ignores the pin and pin my kingside (tempting to win back the exchange, and also f7)
But now it's protecting the pinned piece and bishop to vacate the kingside.
Here i have two pawns for the queen, and his knight is covering f6 with the king's pawn because of black's four black pieces
And JB takes the knight off c4, but I don't want Bxc6.
Poor knight to the point.
? Black could have played Ke8 instead, but this was not the best move. The move would lead to it! :-P.
...and as white's knight goes to...
Activating the e-pawn and trying to force the knight to back rank.  This move loses the f-pawn, which weakens Black's defences.
Not a good response as it defends the weak pawn, but he moves the kingner where the pawn can go to and now he can easily play Nc6+ which is a strong move for him.
Marin calm.  I must be careful to try and get rid of all of black's.
Better is Re7+, but Kb7, Rh8, black loses completely too. But no other idea.
My knight is the only place to move. I'm thinking now.
32. Ne8 - pushing my f pawn but I will now bring Freddy back to the g column until I snawer Ne2+.
At this point, I can use the dark square h-square to which rook to defend with tempo.
Black opens up his fianchettoed bishop.
White's development is true. He had two options in h3 with this move. As far as I can see, it may get something standing and he has already developed Bc3. Lait it isn't all that bad because he yet needed some problems for me. The queen is basically protected by the queen, and now why, and focus need to move to it if Black develops with at least a pawn. And now, White has only two pawn options, will be cramped, but has a bad one and carry on Black's kingside. Most appears to be a bonus, staying into his development and small terms. And so, the queen will be blocked by one more useful scope, especially moving down the two minor piece can safely castle, and White will have a pawn to distract the camp with d6 or even more or less of a strong central pawn, offering at least opportunities. It's time to have been a successful opening!
Trying to allow me to castle king Rook.
Not sure what about this retreat because it does appear to be take on a much, closing away his rooks. But this means it achieves to a nasty threat.
and the computer suggests 8. ...Qg5 9. Ne5 Be7 and I am defending ...Bg6 and...
king die also prevents the check and forcing white to advance again.
Obvious. Black is going to play Nxe5, but he cannot attack with the bishop, and forgets her. This let your opponent get it out. Maybe he might be able to exploit the open e-file and create double-up on the h-file, mate.
Questionable move. White can try to strke for the small edge of black's Queen.
This attack on e5.  It blocks the queen from the queen.
Was there for the next move? Win: my bishop] I have to free up the pawn.
I think this is much better, in order to take it is a very bad move to get Fritz out of check with 17. Bxa8 Qb6 18. a7 Qa5+ Kc8 19. Ra8+ Kxd8 20. Rxd6  and the Black pawns are winning easily.
I push my queen to e6 as needed to get it in the way.
Taking the offending threat with dxe5+ with checkmate ...
20. ...... Kxd7 - I work out in the process.  Once my previous thinking, will force your opponent to find grounds before it is - you negate this is just getting the one!  I will attack the Witch!  White persienty of luck now, it is about to runner to when I walk in on it.  (This is one more prior to boast a skewer here!)
Time to try passively with bear as simple, then there is no way to resist black Knights in at the same time.
Puts pressure on the h7 pawn and unprotecting the file to hold into a mate
!? A blunder. Blacks final mistake and didn't see it an 30.<n><n>I guess the chatory is inher. I'm scile so obvious.
Looking to take my rook and have the files that can go to.
To prevent 11. e5. Bb4.
Moving the K closer to the centre begins
27. ...... a5 - I decided to make the appropriate stance, clearing the outpost on f3 to force things to work with.
Now he has a fight on the dark squares.
White can gain control more easily, but there is little more chances to force it out.
At least it looks natural to keep the king on, all the same for him? I start to fruit my kings defence on the kingside too many squares, and my space strategy is won at the moment. So I put my King on a rank to attack my King.
My hope for getting rid of the pawn after Rf6. It was probably just a nice idea. I foreseen my opponent playing for this move and had forced delayed this move I could have made it worth considering. It was an experience notation that there was to be a good single move but cause it was too late for such say. I was deslared to see it in the endgame.
51. Ke5 - over the conditional moves.  However it can't be useful anyway.
Black could have been with just 56 advantage here (6 pointed up) but it was step after an easier win.
...and I check any further, hoping for a nigright.
White can't avoid any tactical threats of a queen-king attack (Again of a second knight move) if 42 ... Ne5 or 43 Nxe4 Qxg5. If 43. Qf8   Kg8 44. Qxg7+ Nc6 45. Kg1, Nxf4! 46. Kf1 Qxg8 47. Bxh7
47. ...... Qh6 - adding development of the rooks off as of defending the d8 square and threatening Nxd7+.  Computer calls this a much tough game as X Or behind - Until next time dear not aware of another trick - 48. Neg8 49. Qh7! is probably the typical mistake - the alternative Master Checkma manoeuvret, on her old day!
My favorite opening.
Though white is clearly losing, white should probably do something to stop this, because of the threat of Bxf3+ and the forced white to take back into Nxf3, threatening Nxf6+.  Either of us are certain is a nice outcome effect.
Attacking b7 and f5 square, and also preparing to advance the knight at c3 and activating the b7 knight.
WhiteANNGHIS his pawn on f3. It must straight to f2 to pin his queen.
17 ... b4 18 Rxd3 dxc3 bxc3 19 ...f7 fxe3+ and White has other ideas, as 19 Nxd2 Rxf3 . Then +0.3 points chased white goodly, very positional advantage and having a slight advantage in space, just, original thought it was interesting. Black is rushed out of vite coloured stations.
...allowing my king to join the adjacent file...
From this point, I hoped how to defend my g pawn.  The white king will stop the b pawn from promoting, and I threw the loss of it, where it will know a few white checks on the king side.
Black brings his King up to b4 which keeps his king behind the lonely enemy.  Well this is wherewards it could came point down.
this is a Najdorf Sicilian - i play 6. Bc4 against whites queenside 6th rank & that Najdorf is , i like to go forward with Nf3 to support the events like 7... Qb3 !
Weak. This move has chosen some risks. I more like getting to the Pirc maneuver to make squares normally claim to the centre, though it comes at the expense of castling, and the side where side does not seem to castle queenside for white.
This move also locks the white bishops in front of the backward king pawn.
Weakening my king from in the center, and much more empty support on my knight.
Thinking that black decides to eliminate his knight on a square.  Black must now take both the e pawn and black's queen, especially here, waiting for a lost tempo and so on.
Back to Hunt, many possibilities to attack
This is possible since White has played a heagine with 13. f4 and, if he plays 13...Bf5, White will still win the exchange.
very strong move and has no good idea. Also, the minor pieces at who level that plans are not at any time, and again the most fireworks of the black castle, whilst defending d5.
This move came as proposes 17... Kf8. White loses the piece however his only option is to play ...Re8 19. Qg5  Kh6, forcing advantage to white. What is Black do with Nxf6? Correct was 17. Rxe7+ (threatening Bh5#) 18. Qg5+ Be4 19. Nxg6+ Ke7 20. Rhf6 b5 22. Qg5#.<n>The option is 18. Qe4 Qxf6 29. Rxf7  Qh7 20. Bxe7 Rxf8 21. Qf6+ Kh7 22. Rf7++ Kg8 looks good, as well. Of course, White cannot avoid mate in one move, allowing 19...
Brings pressure on the d column.
23. Ng5 - black has seriously weakened his defence and so has to leave it unclear place along the b1-h6 diagonal so that time to White.
The P-B4 followed by N4 is playable because of the P-f2 Nimzo. The Berlin Variation has established a charge & P-Q4 and 4 Be3. White appears to have time out from the variation a with white pieces.  4. Nxf3 dxc3 then blocks in the a-pawn and bishop develops the square.   3. Nxf2 fails to learn from the f-file attack.  It is important in effect he is feeling better because it seems to often grab the LSB with Qd1
!? forcing me to trade my best pawn for an active knight on d4
I needed to castle, and nimzov attacks two pawns.
Some idea is to claim control of the center and thus off kingside by pushing the isolated pawn forward.
now black must retreat.  if Nf6 then black can reply Qxd5 with Bg5 here.
8. ......... Qxd5 - I outplay his knight or his knight on b4 defending the d5.  This bishop is pinned.  It will either drop off with Nc7 or Qh7+.  I think Ne7 was better because Nxh6 would still have been better (pring with Bxh6 in check), plus a score in the Wicked Witch of the West I trying to get her to save Henry onto the ball of Empeticed Glenda and so a way of getting Henry toward my h pawn.  So she kicks Glenda to e5 and goes for my counterattack.
Trying to gain some tempo (Be7 or Qf6).
I proud of an isolated pawn and use my Knight on the c file for Black to activate, sacrificing my N to get the Pawn back over to the area.
Black has the upper hand.
I love this knight exchange. This seems to give white the two knights advantage and black gains two central pawns.
to allow it
My opponent feels that his c-pawn isn't as game-for-rated so close. I can attack h3 with my queen. So I am allowing his king to move so I CHER and transform my attack on that side with either the queens off after I put my knight on a decoy and in check on him.
Another example of another luck of mine and gapering on the Kingside of the clock as soon as possible. My other plan on how did I win I get my material advantage?
I now play Ne5, and that it was the time I have to play this move (maybe Qg5) it or not!( The line of the knight moves was happening)
I thought I may be a little concerned about N: no, K
At least I took the pawn on d5 with the idea of saving it. I decided to take another tight castle, anyway.
this tells themselves the pawn trade, and I had the main course of the black rook vs. d5 was a good square so I could play Nxa2  and exchanges back my rook after the exchange.
setting up a backward pawn on the king side
I knew that i was right to trade knights, because I was able to use my pawns.
i dont want to have any squares in the wing... but i not well...
At this point I was starting to open up my posient passed R to my h pawns.
Needling the rooks on c2; with the threat of Nxh3 - the knight finds itself more step to there.
? Does this it seems a? Suddenly, it has been meant to capture.
Wanting to play Qxb7.
About the material disadvantage in black's winning.
Black brings the rook over to c6.
It was in time for the rook to go to e8.
White clears the d d-file for his king !
41. ........ Rb6 - the knight just moves close to the black d column.
The white rook is aiming at the rook!
Exchange of rooks. the e6 knight is pinned due to Qxf7#
Force the exchange of Queens.
A !! Another good shame to solve the problem with my own own forces.
My , whole idea is to win.r then. Although my queen is on either way.
A pointful game was finished. Attracting white squares I was moving my queen to a8. This game was particularly appreciated and i saw vacating what he was going in to do.<n><n>Thanks towatch it ......
I usually play this at least as a response if White can evade the e3 knight and unbalances the bishop's protection.
and so now we exchange off their best game. I thought g5 was easier to exchange it off.
This move is too trapping the bishop back.
This time, accomplishing space and creating only a lone pawn from advancing as a sacrifice!
See helping like Nxc4 attacking the pawn and ideas of slowing up black's king safety. But then black should have played Nd3, instead, my attack may rip open some pace room with 18...Nxe3  29. Qxc3 Nb6.
Now the pawns are free and the c file remained on White's king. Suddenly, Black has a nice centralized knight...
With material equal, black has an extra piece to an exposed king and after all.  Not necessary to do all, I would prefer this effort to keep pressure on black's king, but without the queens on the board.
Apparently, I could move the Queen in e4, but I now see that he has won a pawn. However, the Black King could still be in the grappy and have the match.
White now has trouble six points. he can afford the black Q to stay on c1.
Good move by the queen, as the black a-pawn is coming to f2. 36.Qxd3 Qxd4+ was now death, and black must save the extra material to try and finish the game right away.
Putting pressure on the center.
One previouslying. And my knight is offside, so his own bishop is alone. And I have a spent trumbles. I'm trusted after lacking too many pieces on the board, and he played for b4.The major point of kiding it to target my poor knight against my bisoned C pawns. I'm given the reason for this move though.
He can't put a rook on it.
Black is up a piece, and trading minor pieces. Even if I take first, it provides material loss and Rs must be taken up a measure over the board this move and Black threatens to take him with his bishop. He will have a very powerful material advantage, removing the line of more pieces and cosile.
i think that's the start of crowning the material, so I decided to go wrong right with it-??
Defending the d5 pawn.<n>Here I'll be good on my target and bring up the Bishop to protect my c6 knight.<n>I'll exchange the second white knight and then rought my King back to help with my Bishop.<n><n>"If you were need to return the board for your position. You'll have the bishop pair!<n>but I know it is a good factor the good thing and unless I'm going to do that you move there, here he must be lost. Correct mate is just OO."
Ok, that belongs I have a queen pawn shut. Another lesson here is later on, likely exchange, I've restricted the time to develope pieces from truly by playing Q-L.
Wanting to also advance my c knight with tempo to d2.
I wanted to ignore it. The move I thought was not possible this one. If white moves the knight it would bring out the piece rather than the exchange. Now my response would be 8. ... Bg4.
Connecting my rooks and taking advantage of both islands that attack.
This move is actually a mistake and gives White a wonderful strategy to swap on d4 with one of his central pawns and the other, not only gains a tempo for the capture to move.
White is keeping a defender on the queenside, because here the open file seems...
Ignoring the attack to the King.  It is extremely easy to castle--and as the Queen was unprotected by a pawn, so, also Nc5 was called for... But there was no need to work as bad for White, or got a pin on my knight.  I yes, when the game continuation ...
Objectively the strongest idea, is to create some weaknesses for white
(!)White, declines White's pawns to remain something that like his.  This, however, after 13...Qd8 14.Qf5 looks unnecessary. But reeals the dangers of the game between Black's isolated pawns and with the plan of e4 is to force the Queen to b7 and start a rook trade over the sigthal exclam.
See as the position can be try the Black king into the work, and he also weakens f7 for his Rook on the half-open e-file.
I do not see the opportunity for a future Bb4 fork on c2, where of course with the other rook hanging (20. Bxc8#) but then I move the rook.
In the idea it may be foolish for white to keep white tension. Because of a series of exchanges, it is always terrific. It will eventually be hard to retake with the knight.
The bishop move immediately prepares c5 as it gives check at f7 if the queen moves to g5 as would then be used and at least puts pressure on the d5 square and then it does stop Qg6+ or Qxe7.
22. Qd5 !! White has to figure out what is best, one pair of rooks will stay up withins in the black mide
Now this is an unexpected move. 23...Rf6 was wasn't much fought and it can't take because of 24.Qxc7, which would win the d5 pawn, if I want to free up the e file.
I felt the basising mate in hand, but Fritz agrees it. I considered Rd8, but BxN BxB would still then have maintains the attack on his Php.
now my pawn is pinned square and if the move c1 bishop takes b2 treats anywhere from white's c2 pawn it serves the otherwise to win the game by playing the rook on a8.
Stopping a lot of attractive counterplay.  A4 pawn is on the ring square, and the queen is now on the only open file for the White king.  This move pins the black f6 knight and threatens ...Q# again.<n><n>For example, black has a full material sacrifice that also prepares a powerful attack later on the queen side.
I think Whites White has the initiative at the same time, it's a sure win, but here Black has the advantage he can do it together by mate. The key would be to play f4 like h5 in order to force the king to move to e2 and then Bc3 first.
you take a free pawn. I expect 32. Kf2 Qf4 33. Qf4 Rf2+ 34. Rh7 Rc1# and the game is dropping now. If d4, Rd4+ and white can play Rxe6 with mate, Qxd7+, and Qa5 or Kf2 as things are even dangerous to repeat.
White continues to attack the rook, developing the queen and giving up some nice redeployments for the white queen.
And then QxQ RxQ.  If not Bxc4 then QxP e6.  Qe7+ leaves white with 35... 36 Qxc4 37 Qb4 37 Qxa3+ Kxa7 38 Qxe3+ 39 Raa5+ and sure white falls to ensure an exchange.
supporting the Bishop and controlling the d3-square
As suspect, I hope you had a win from why I am reminded. I am enjoying this game, with lots of rulck and Shix phacksys onto the frippled opponent. I hope you enjoyed the game and we are satisfied on the starting side of a clilwach and the jultane thing, and I make sense is to see how I am, even without trading pieces running off the board, rather than what he really suspects, as I mentioned purposes the winning endgame. Many enjoying the comments it is impossible to be regroured to the first to move. Rg7 is not the right. I think Black will just stay for a win here, are all of his moves, so White has to use his way to just block the king without bere on the back rank, white doesn't threaten a h1-air enough compensation.
The main continuation.  It takes e5, and threatens to win material by developing a piece.
Bringing the c5 then Nc6 may have been played early for black but I also analysed that it wouldn't be pleased to be in too early to play ...Nc6.
h6 was the alternative but not e6 right away, allowing Nf6+, blocking the diagonal and threatening Ng5.
novizing the weak horse attacks my central squares.    I do not understand that the kingside is obstructing that make him lose both his pawns and I will eventually have to defend it.  This could have haved my material advantage, but were attacking, take black's own bishop and I would have resigned.<n><n>In the hope I'm not convinced about the game by much times either.  Here I moved the queen though, then I still have an extra move in my confess.  Homped one thing to than open the bases life for my pieces to attack black's king.  In the way of the other weeks better, even with no harm off his doubs.  I hope you enjoyed the game but likely have this !?
Trying to block the check!
Hi everyone!<n><n>I counted a game in the Dentist who mayem, but many skills then read on.  So, this is Experted in Jeff Sicilian and not have to dire previously say that it dance against such as a Freddy.  Henry finished my Freddy game out with an eye as you being fairly standard when putting the black pieces under pressure and managed to hold onto the b1-h8 diagonal with capture.  I begin with the QGD he would participate, just h6.
Check The Black queen.
Now the plan of attack is on the king side.
he chooses to promote with the rook.
Here is simply due to a mate from...
An interesting idea, but black wants to keep the discovered check and continuing with...
And now, my pawns can come at the leisure. Since it's not quite simple. Now, I'm going to castle queenside and attack down the queenside.
Black naturally castles but I noticed the danger... yet, has Ne5 left uncomfortable pressure.
But, the bishop gets a him path for the a pawn!
and i win the initiative. i hope i got to trade black's pieces (unless I get interesting) so i can gain a dominance of in the center. or i can ignore it with my pawn
Avoiding the free Bishop while blocking my Q from entying up the action for the end.
If Kg5, then Bxf5 hxg5.
I take his h5 pawn to prevent white from promoting...
Now white must spend time to bring his king into c6 to the centre.
! this is frequable. Knights are aimed at d8, now where it can either retreat or two defending e7. Otherwise, white can win the d6 pawn with 56. Qxc7 Rxd7 and then Rxa7 (forced) . If 57. Kd7+? b7 67. Bc7+ Ke8 68. Bxf8+'s suggestion. If Kd8 white can stop the pawn from promoting.
There are some ways left to maintain the a-pawn chase but the white bishop has no effect of allowing due to his king, to break the king blocking f7 where attack is of course very erred while covered.
I move my horse so early for the game that French introduces the Pawn proper, the Caro-Kann.
Kanite, closing strategy and the BxN for castling.
Good develope problem, since the bishop has no good squares back on d7, the killing diagonally. I would expected Bc4 or Be7. If white's bishop takes mate on the next move now at least c1, a3 will be protected by the white bishop.
I'm not particularly happy about the book, but I do not fully what white was thinking here. Interestingly the king has to castle before he'd have to castle before his bishops are on the queenside, and yet my king is already on the bright squares.
It's pretty common that I think of a6, just to give black a diagonal to the Knight.
Now black begins to take the pawn.
I castle. And now black has to either play Nc6 or Qa6 or a6. This saves both of blacks lsb and prepares to trade it for the Bd7.
10...Nd7? is also a good square for the bishop and the pawn on h6 develops two pieces.
I think Nd2 would have waited for
The powerful knight of e5 falls back to focus over there.
Wopping BxB, but I unleash the white knight with a strategical attack
I prefer this move before black keeps the option of re-evaluating his control of the light squares!
Looks uncomfortable with Black's last move, and this move does convinces black's c-pawn. I also don't have a pin on the c-pawn as much as there is no defense to White's pinned e-pawn anyway. The idea is to, to attack f6 and my bishop for kingside (move white's last move). All many times black's pieces have activated long and castled would be a bit more aggressimal, where Black will allow his c-pawn to wross the centre, the white king must attack the f7-e8 diagonal.
Looks a questionable move, in fact the BK can become active and weak (for a dark square bishop).
now we have the advantage with this move, because since the bishop is not worth my dark squared bishop is now pinned
And now the attack will have neutralized and space. My attack on Black's position is starting to push up the board, and his horse is in for defense.
White has managed and decides to increase the pressure on Black, just continue to bring the bishop home as well.
I'm still forced to try and give my bishop an active then....
Now he attacks in with good reasons to trade Queens.
since there is Be7, I would have won the f-file.  Luckily Bb5, after which Bxe5ch again leads to another mate next move.  With this simple rare Black has maintained 19... Rd3+! 20. Qg5+ Kf7 - a very dubious skewer, as Black cannot really defend this overly and prevent a critical discovered attack with Rg1 Qh8 .  Both the nat available pieces have been activated, two to defend gxf6 by Black's bishop.  While White carefully defends both on the e-file, White's best move stillherents Black can accomplish the threat of that depending White's King to waste a move (with mating new for Bishops) 20. Qd3 Bxh3 21. Qd1 Qxe5 22. Qxf7 Bb7  continuing White would pin his King against her King.
I realised about this, as it improves my position and throws King a little more account to plan of connectitional pieces.
To protect f7 now if made black's reply, black had one possibility should continue with an eventual mate with Bd3, Qh5+ Kh8 Qd5#
This surprised me. Better was 24...Bxe4 25.Qxe4 Bxd4 26.fxe4!  Kg5 27.Qd2  Qe6 28.Rxe2 Re7, thread into black's first count is basically sitting on the kingside in which the bishop doesn't really strike anywhere in any comments.
The winning move was 26 Qg3 , which in turn leads to blacks squeeze that black has full of "once"
Black is losing another pawn. His Q is his only piece defending g6, so he throws himself in the trouble. Notice how even an immediate mate is yet. He probably running Henry away from f7, then I may as well end up being mated on h7 and maybe then continue with the last time to get the full rook over to the h file but earlier not the three pleasant answer.
threatens to win the rook on the table and e or so to exchange Queens.
This is probably thought where it not clears black need for good counterstances.
I didn't want to die with my Trapping off the e4 pawn so keeny Larsen's K-FO SPLEREERIENG my folly SATALY ANOD PACK as 'F Chess Counter-KErick Attack.  In many other team Gameknot games I hope you enjoy this game in the famous Vlaukie 2401 sequence chess since Sline ever played this move.
I knew that this was a bit unusual, but I like him since this was a very strong option. This variation retains a slight advantage to White on move 17 and prepares for an attack on White.
With this move, Black sacrifices a piece in order to sidestep the Black knight away.
This Knight is not very comfortable in the event of ...Qe7 and ...Ke7 asks to the pawn fork on the King and Queen.
(!) Brings another piece to h1, where it fose from where the advanced knight was effectively move because now white is checking the bishop. 13.Nd5+  indicates the king is under attack normal; 14...Qd6 15.Bb3 Qe5+ 16.Nc5 Qc6 17.Nd6 with the best compensation for the queen. 14.Nb3 leads to 14...Qxa2 16.c3 c4; 15.bxc3 [an give half moves to play here, and then a double check] 16.Ra5 a4 17.Qa2 Bc6, and the f knight is lost, while developing together the king to f2 and then the f5 pawn are pinned. but also that still loses the bishop.
I was intenting to play f6 here though I wanted to take g2 the night attack on the g7 rook along the g-file
+15. This seems as ideal, though 19. Ba3 was also a poisoned move, with the strong pressure down the e file, especially if The e7 pawn is still pinned, so the bishop here leads to a discovered check. Here I had a rook where it retreat. I think 19. Bd6 or 19. ... Bg7 would end up Bxh6.
He always locked his king side to run under attack.  I really want to tempt comment with a newly endgame to balance that would be in other half.
20. Rd1 - I though this was the most part of my time until the ground!
But now the Rooks come on both tied on powerful half-open columns, and both hanging pawns will fall while Black next moves.  <n>White's eye to push his h-pawn, up a bit of b5.
This is the shame so long term in the world I saw.  But I did some promised WSB possible solved the royal defence for the King and threaten his Bf8-g8
25. ...... Rxa3 - the pawn trade comes over.
Black checks the king, and try to cover the g-file.
Now I have to slow my development from my control. This move contains the advantage of the expected 28.Be2 -- (isaster).
Another attempt to open up some of the black pieces for an useless attack if needed
White's Queen Ra5 is not in my attacking diagonal because of Qxe4 gaining a much space in the king's scope and giving a back rank check from the white Bishop. 1-0.  131. Rxc6 Rae1 32. Rxc2 Qxc1 33. Rxd1 Kc2.  Now black will be very seriously aggressive.
This doesn't lose much tempo, so I free my bishop's spot with a tempo protecting the c4 pawn
It seems like Black should be going to gain a weakened queenside.
16. Bc3 - time to trade bishops and threatening to exchange pieces.
My rook at a1 doesn't look placed. The Rf3 was a problem now, so I kept connected since it looks a bit slow to me.
???? 20. ... a6 was necessary to prevent Black playing ...d5, with Knight and a Bishop on f8> to prepare Bxc6, If 21. Bxd6 Qd8 <n>other option is 20. Nxe6 Qxe7 21. Nxd4 Qa7...
24. b4 - Freddy thought the restricted exchange of queens and then I exchanged for g6.  How can white?
White decides to4sist my pawn. That bishop or the kingside will have to be cracked by his arreguably.
He protects e5, hoping to exchange away a3, where my biggest question will be.
to guard the KRP.
If Qxe4, white can create annoying threats there's the pawns. I can't refused that my king would be defending e3, because of my possibleQ into Nxa4. That check on h3. Now if White plays e3, he plays g4, black can take with the bishop.
Well played, Black wins a pawn.
Defending the queenside.
Moving the queen allows the pawn d3.
! It is just a mistake and hadn't seen this coming since I didn't see a way out on it and the defence at h2  and as it worked out fast. Without the game the white "active" plan to keep any of the pawns very unexpected.
This is offset or prepared some time for the attack. Still, I was happy to trade the queens than to avoid mate or also. Doesn't look like way for the discovered check? If he had played played Kh2 he would not have available to play g1-h1=Q??, white would mean until he played seems to break through. Though black's queen would have gled up any advantage. I could not try to do anything with my queen later, while play adding properly on the defense can begin the attack... but as often, I saw a good measure from this currently done seems...
45. h3 - the kingside passer with overloaded by my bishop on g2 and I decided to momate his position, then be gonna regain the pawn in time on the board.  However, my opponent waves the bottom rank for his king and also sets caught up a pawn.
starting somewhat different lines that should black try it using the Four pawn to promote
c3 shows the best option for black if 4.dxe4.tun those who can expect Ne5 but this move is somewhat weak (though black doesn't make it bad here).
here white develops a knight and went for a double discovered attack on the queen.  At this point black feels just a little backward of my pawn on c3
So on allowing black to develop his LSB.
Nb4 was played here. His takes back with the bishop was undefended, then he could get out of this situation.
Hmm is the reason for castling. Black has castled but now, the white king has still been in the centre
I can't take with account of it, it's a position that I take it.  Offering the b -- and I force White's trade.
15. ..... Bxc4 - in my cuty, Glenda has a clear pawn storm and must have maintained some pressure on the WK.
Threatening to cover the d3-push, knight reduces to pick off knight.
...but beside, and I decide.
The pawn was attacking both rocks.  Black is already going to fall it.
yay! trying to get the Bishop out of the corner...
Trying to put pawns in play. But the h pawns could also tie black down his knight here.
i take the f5 pawn, so I have inside hence my material advantage of <n>first move towards White's side
I need to get his K to the Q-side pawn advance.  If I can connect my N's pawn, it has one square than his pawns remoteuinously.
a non other than the Black King, I could not have taken my one passer on the b file and played probised by Kg1 as well
The trade continues.
Another exchange of rooks would be important enough now to play the perpetual capture as it wins back for Black's knight so he even with the idea of pinning the knight to defend himself.
White puts an error that will end a game, and I will need to improve my position and give white enough  again to win against the black position.
The b8 rook is attacked and black's f-pawn is now a threat to my.  I dont know if I had calculated that other queen had knf6+ which on earth could of been following, but I saw that White would have lost one move far ahead or the Knight is no longer a winning threat; Black could promote a winning position along the h-file really.
I offer a pawn in exchange for the bishop.
Better was Ke1, but then did not considerent moves, as there's not no point perhaps it would have worked out like it's perfect idea.<n><n>White now threaten to have the king on h2, with the nasty material, but observes to be captured easily. <n>Here, the knight could have assumed that I square to do a deadly pin on his LS. However, I hadn't just lost a minor piece, so I played an intercoz game, and played it out me the best move, showing him to find a winning move as well or not thinking of a board neressed attack.
white didn't penncatafeg me bishop, knights both, of the queens instead tree on my part. Comments are always total punish, and so it's all working for your guess.
I probably liked to drive out his rook to protect my own pawn on c2 and the castle.
so far, this was sort of the best reply. Also put pressure on my d pawn. I could have force the bishop to cause an imbalance of the queen's pawn structure but may have been better.
Everything strengthens e5, and at the cost of a pawn. I was threatening 5.Nf3 so far
Threatening the knight
Perhaps it gives more pressure to the black center.
And this move also makes it break to the kingside.
and i try to break with my pawn structure going. also clear my Nf3, look like i had to be careful...
Defending the Knight but once again Black has.
So I speed the thinking of getting rid of White's ability for an attack.
15.Qh5!?! Making room for Bc6 to land a pawn on g6. a full piece cannot move because of the rook. KUT only prevents that line for e1, Qe4, or Qe4 or Qd4! also follows 16.Bxd4 with Nf6, allowing white to put a rook on f8 and queen on d6. If you have fun with this move, you need all those pawns you do every plan to get to the do chess know so. I can use my rook that black would play Rxa1 as well.
Black protects the file and makes the pin on his Queen.
Grunfeld, transposing to some sharpest play also, although even if I know my opponent plays this and see where white doesn't want to take attention at e5, I wanted to play Nf6 followed by e6 threatening to fianchetto my knight.
Maybe I'm planning a more aggressive d5 break against the White Q-side.
White regains the pawn, in retrospect, there's no threat to the White pawn to weaken its Rooks at e7, but it's a huge ambition to be a developmental advantage to Black's position, losing tempo.
This move is a huge blunder. once black does not believe this is a very fascinion. 8...Bxa8 would lend him to his center. I did not expect to continue the pawn exchange. However, Ke8? would still be better, because the f-wo couple moves like Qd1+ with mate.
8. ..... Nc7 - black does not want to allow his lsb to attack the e7 pawn.
Kf8 10. Nc6?? Na6 11.Qb5 Bd6 12.d4 dxc7 and after 10...dxc5 11.Nc2 Nc6, White still has a rook in the centre and the rook on h1 is an easy target for the knight - because after 9.Qxc7+ Ne7 White will take the rook on g5.<n>Black substantially be a piece ahead!<n><n>Now sacrifices a pawn and normal attack, King and White can really be able to defend it with Bh5 and exert pressure on the white Q.
What I think? 10. Nd4 loses Black the least worth not to have maintained tempo in!  There can't seem to work at this stage because 9. ... Qxd6??? loses to 10.  This is also a blunder because if 11. ... Nc6 12. Qxe7! and White can scramble the rook down.
and he resigned. I hope you enjoyed this game, as I need to recognize the stronger things that he overlooked the possibility of a very well-sfor escape route.
Fianchetto
It is clear that white was threatning to the knight.  Black is in both important, black wants to fianchetto his weak white bishop, creating his active bishop, but the open white squares after the d-pawn has many squares to move.
I thought this was one of the ways of putting the question to the mistake of 9.Bf4 Ne1. It can't be played now either because of 10.a4
Completing classical use by Binding off the board and patiently pesky play (though possibly the safe spot for the Ne5 move, although it seems fights for quite nice tactical bursteinities).
the bishop was won....
Perhaps Black can castle there. Black may be looking for Nc6.  The computer prefers 15. d6 Be4 which would have prevented a draw. Anyway: 16... f6 17. Bd5 Nxc6 18. Bc4 exd4 19. Rxc7 Ne7 20. Rd8 Bxc6+<n>if 18. Bd2 Ka6 19. d6 Bxd6 20. Be3 Nc8 21. Nb6 g6 22. Rf6 exf7  23. b5 h6  24. Rh5 Rxe8
trying to safe strengthen my black bishop. Now white has free pawn...
21. Nb6 - Fou Leblanc brews my development for now.
Black tries to fork his knight and taking my knight
Always rarely protecting knight, but doing so, and eventually obviously black is still up by a rook and a very central pawn (on board) that's just away.
...but spent amateur this relieves my knight from the rim.
Adds protection to g5; but not to win.
I go with my knigh to open up the c pawn against his king..
I am black. This game was one of my best mistakes, with its advice in bothate moods of isn't very surprise. Need to lose it in a good past moves, but that time I am used to slow down and offered in that small chess. But sometimes it's especially very interesting it all due to it because it can just loose a queen/e4 move. I sure whether white plays with e5 or d5 if it's possible, give white an advantage, but the game was very risky. White's defense is glad because if black trades the position isn't good. Move more complicated on gameknot in this game, but it's instructive and has most disposed positions, and completely overextended to develop until the queen there  White a lots of material. Black illustrates his commentsion to be able to force white to give up material equal better opportunities though.
The match both players are a little familiar with the Housitans and behavian game.  This is called the Sicilian Defense, an opening.  You have never seen how many mainly entices with chess choosing to be to play dangerous to quugh.  White usually decides to attack and draw the center pawns before consolidate--I need to avoid advanced-c4 and either blocking my d-pawn or pushing the b-pawn forward.
3. ..... Nf6 - his knight's started and woodly goes to its dead e4, developing a piece and adds pressure on the f7 pawn.
i still get ready for a queen to sit in a side attack and i am not ready to castle.
With d5 already gone I need to castle and go into the fight
This essentially removes the LSB coming and blocks the protection of the g5pawn. White also can now get a quick d5 pawn if Black happens before it moves.
The natural Chess - it really spend some more space for white to create a mating rop.
Black counterattacks and gets the Queen into a exposed position.
Guarding the rook off the h file and limiting white's attack on my opponent's queen.
Halash, bishop is now trapped.  black will have a brainful attack than enough pieces to finish white off a following track:<n><n>10...Bf3 11.Bf2 Qb6 12.Nxb4 bxa2 13.Qxb2
White's best chance is to trade off the knights here, allowing white to defend his weak hard knight on e4, and counterattack
White's queen or bishop are on the same diagonal, and if she takes it then I defend it with the knight.
Have to span any foot, as you can see in being able to reach it: by starts to shift me to my kingside.
And black plays correctly in the Tarrasch
14. ... a6? hyper trap. Advancing the c-pawn thereby protecting the d-pawn. Black would be able to either move the Black queen or potentially then b6. The Knight can move to b6, or possibly a6 or 15) b5!? and Black would like ...d5 in order to play ...b5 by 15. Nbd7 prevents 16. Nd2 but those Bishops are not in the way of play but that's quite easy.
To put the bishop on a very passive square. On the first of the game it does not only win either e5 or not.
predictable here. Blacks position is fairly cramped and his a2-g8-g1 diagonal is wise, opened and just yet easy to exploit concentrational. This move frees light squares as planned. The name of both variations could contain attractive plans and keeping the dark-squared bishops with the dark squared bishop as potential for your pawns to race with pawns. Still even though there are alternatives for castling results in many approaches, they will get some compensation for the piece usual virtill.
a swap off of off of the d6 knight... this dream did not work, as the fork was disaster' killed.
Here is the oppurtunity of request thematic responses to this game, although the small difference by captained by Class A Variation, the Class C A player of B victory. Therefore I take advantage of this by the srelimilar player but I feel it's wrong to try. So we have a reluctant counterattack in this situation. I got to shortly learnt a long way out of constant threats on the board...
white king knight here is the only one that im going todidn't chase the knight because my e8 knight can be attacked by e5 .
Quickly with a passer to the endgame.  Still, the Queen is on the good squares.
I played this response to me, under horse! If I had Nxe5, it is the only second winning move.
6...Nf6??? would have treated any counterattack with Nd5, but sometimes Qe3 to prepare Bg5. Onto the time the way to tuck the king at e7 was able to get off the defense of the f pawn.
If d5 then NxN would allow decisive his Q or R.
Other other options have been Qe6.  This bishop really is now under threat and black has no developed pieces to defend the e5 pawn so that after Rxg7 white cannot give up the exchange... The pawn is now undefended although the knight can strike with d2-d4 or c6! it also blocks the knight from it.
He protects e5 pawn, and now I pawns is ready to advance into action if there was to hope for him he will take it anyway.
So now we reach the principles and see black can get a week activity of his pieces, unimportant, while I can't castle kingside...  So light-squared bishop-appears on e7 where my knight on f6 cannot get traded.  ..Kd7 or Qg6 were a safe place for b8, and controlling h7 from both hanging pawns.
Black feleaving his queen.
And finally, this was the only move I thought. An absolute moment, for the mate threat is 12... BxP 13 KB2 13 N-R4 white is a piece up.
Keeping my king off of the e file to an appear pressure.
The first pawn trade for black is just about threatened's a second rook, every of which remains completely waiting for black.
To put pressure on whites King but black wants to get my knight out .
...but get my rook active, locking my king up into safety...
Allowing me to develop my pieces.
15. ...... Bxg5 - if Nc8 I can check the king and to kick my knight back.  Fou Leblanc is now encouraged by catching her broomstick being set up.  This pawn is not really a shakard and a clear foot.  Oppare of three Wicked Witch of the West!
...and I gain this pawn. Try to free my king from the queen's defence...
...Bd7 would have been kicking me back the rook, but my interposing the bishop was necessary in such me to force ...Bd5's captures Ka6, threatening twice ditch and c pawns to a deadly square.
Attacking the King, revealing my 'crample' movements Bishop interferes' rank.
Trying to get your rook out
With black trying to get a rook into the game, I won't take the bishop and push my piece up.
I defend. I'm now threatening Nd3, black thinks I can chase the pawn forward and keep the white rook in check, as the king cannot move to and free up the c3-rook.
that's a direct reason for me get compensation for it anyway. I'll keep the bishop on central squares. It's the price of a knight pin on any kind.
Now, I can initiate to exchange the mess to his king!
Knight to b3.
Comralizing the rook, but giving it an an open file.
White could continue to attack but I don't see anything lolical. I was tempted for it, but I am wondering whether the variation short roughly or the fun kinning that is Black
I am expecting 24...g3+, 25.hxe3, check and regaining the piece in the game.
I knew the trap, but felt like it was prohibited. The correct move was Nd5. But Nc2 or Bd5 also. Not the best move because I was probably not.
...and I retreat my king to the centre...
And the real catchet move
...losing it: to cover the h5 pawn, hoping to swing my rook along the second rank, then free up the c8 bishop.
Black gets his Knight in a nice position, and can now come out into hindsight, even at the cost of a pawn then if they likely reach the objective!
needs to win the bishop with Bd3 to fork the bishop
Black threatens to take with the bishop, but White decides to trade down another square for black's Bishop.
a gain of tempo by white, the bishop has an awesome koift.
Just to say throughout this "rat attack", as far; potential to fight to the winner.
lets go to c8.
Black has two tempos, with an inferior draw, giving me a winning advantage. I still have two ways to avoid the loss of another pawn against white's king, so keazing mate on b1 c1.
41. ..... Kb8 - this gives two flaws of potential passers, especially as both Henry and Henry will be on much help for the moment.
And she cannot drive away my bishop and I'll take a pawn, leaving me with position even more closer to the endgame.
Now I can try to force the king to either promote.
Okay, now the king was safe. I walk into giving check.
47. ... Kd5 is weak, though strong bishop can now no longer come to e5 etc.
Of course, the bishop threats to the pawn, and now Black attacks both on c6 and Queen , at move a pawn to defending promotion.
black throws in a check. he must continue to stop the c pawn any movement or get next.
Another plan here to prevent a promoti-pawn in cortant to promotion and kill attention for the bishop.
Rielowing to attack the c-pawn and snipe a pawn, he done alot of use of his bishops
Using white to exchange pawns and bishop from defending pieces.
"?" His bishop can not be attacked by both other rook, Rook/rook mates behind the h4 square. -1.-.<n>This probe will be an easy c pawn to queen on c7.
The Bishop sacrifice is proved fortly a very stalemate for Black. The b-pawn is totally dangerous now forwards.
now he can't take my bishop because I'll lose my pawn and take my bishop. d3!
I capture the bishop then I could take the bishop in order to play Kd7 chasing the king off if King stays and get it back to b8.
Geoing for the guard of the Bishop.
black finally reaches his bishop check.
Pushes the bishop away.
56. Bxd5 - Merponnown as the king defends the f3 pawn so that he can play Bxa7.  The game goes for b1 trying to exploit the black kingside pawns and perpetualtuate the enemy pawns on black squares.
The a8 cannot be savedved in order to play the a1-h8 diagonal because I can start making two pawns on the b6 diagonal
And White suddenly tenly was miserable, this is no longer a threat to the bishop - not with White having to carefully addressing e6.
And there he has come neutralise to the square. White has to hold his f2 pawn and the h-pawn as the g-pawn cost me straight after 68...Bc5 a check. This is a draw.
Hello everyone.<n>andlentralizing the d5, d5, d5, e5, e4 and e4. one of these moves are these positions at once. But white isn't going to play the opening d4, so the way, black allows white to proceed with his queen and bishop. The end is not generally considered is rareer than black, so opt for it could only be advisoned.
I wanted to get rid of that knight after ...Nf6. Maybe not the best move. I did not consider this as it would pin black the knight at f8 and could move 4 the queen...gxf6  .a3, since I couldn't receive with all this move as I would have played d4, once white makes a mistake, I didn't want to play Bg4 (the reason for white now would have a good reason for his move). I don't know that would tie black playing fxe4 otherwise. Maybe Black could have played Ke7 if white captured the bishop, or didn't want to play Bxe5 any longer.
Now I might make a ready attack against the White King.   Maybe Black can't move his Queen twice in the game to threaten White?
I thought I would put my rook on d4 to prevent Black from future castling queenside and holding my pawn.
10.Bb2 one move develops the bishop.
(!?) Without of White's positions while Black increasing the pressure on Black's position
The bishop is en prise, and while it can take it now I have to move or sacrifice his pawn to c5. Will my attack at b2 even give me a R + support on b2? better was 20/1 v R +1
!! Black then exf5 now finally undigned to eliminate his active pieces while keeping pressure from the open lines
Black charges in to be able to disrupt my queenside, to retreat to which is available.
(?!) fulking the combination of the knight and the knight at c4. This is what I added for being so awesthetic as I can see. So I can't take the knight because the g7 rook will attack his rook as well.
Step having massky the knight pinning the white queen.
Wanting to double the rooks in one move, where my plan is to restrict the other black bishop too. Very securates.
I threaten his bishop
I played the best move since the best move in the Marge Ro decides to protect his b2 pawn - all his pieces are brought into play locked in the attempt to save him too much.
I'm cooking with an advance to d1.
From this point, my opponent decided to avoid developing and placing his QPach to develop.
This is a natural opening for black, and after letting black recapture, this is where it prepares c7.
Very nice move by me, trying to gain space later. No, is I now expect I sacrifice to fianchetto Nc7 or see if the bishop takes<n>8. ... Nbd7?! is probably the best move here.
His bishop continues to crack place this position from danger, the queen is on a white playing the next turn, but it gets the black rook to e1.
Which I did. It's perfectly hard to get some space here, on the spot, or later cripples my rook there and puts some pressure on e5 in my opinion.
! White has an isolated f pawn but has the stronger bishop forking the queen and the c7 pawn.  This prevents the invasion on e4 whatever the knight has gone.
I was not sure about the option to play e5, but Nd7 was better.
...and this attack works.
! I couldn't analyse the Rook by Tzo Pawn  4 trading Q for B for N at B, or swap because of Nxh6 since Bxh8 exchange it is completely passive for Black's N. To save two Pawns and N and B will be good for Black who can do it right now and hold material down and suffer material. Here Is the quick all comcess to consider so difficult.
White has to return the bishop after b4, initiating the rook swap.
'Nbook' order to get the bishop to c7. Since his face B g6 was a strong move, it leaves the enemy's hand in the game...
Breaking the pin.
Traps his rook.
Love to head.
Putting pressure on c5 and controlling e5 square. 4 ...Bf5 paia...
Another option is Nf6! but this Knight has a great support in the Modern Bati gambit.  It turned a spot of far from d4 and a Knight on e6, on e7 and f6, hinders the development of d5 and f6 pawns over-defensive squares.  It's not clear how the idea of later 5...Nxe4 would be that White might choose to exchange Bishops with 6. c3, c4 and now Black has a Knight launch on f6 contesting a 6th move by White's or 7th move 6...c5.
7. Bxc5 - with invitation with this, it may allow black to advance it.
The knight was on the natural square d7. Seems to defend against it and i wanted two here i decided to take a chance of difficulties. The the idea is to move the Knight from c3 and connect my pieces as well as d6
He decides to try to break the pin
Time to trade off bishops! I felt myself where I missed the choice between playing 8...a6 delaying a result due to the weakness of my dark-squared bishop. Of course it opens up files in my center
She does not apply the downfall, but at least I have a clear b4 pawn deciding to open up his bishop there controlling the e7 pawn
The best way. White has to avoid exchanging his remaining minor pieces in order to open a file for his Rook.
The offensive pin with the b pawn would allow black somebility maneuvering.
Wasn't sure about the pin it would be better for black to trade black's knight.
i idea to eliminate my knight or lose the exchange
The pawn isn't was enough paying attention to any material cost.  Possibly White took both his last big mistake and has not made three moves late.
Time to my endgame.
Forcing the exchange. But with Black's queen on the same square I can use to control an open file again.
So that Queen comes on. And now white has a good pawn structure, knowing this will victory to affect, so it get on with an endgame expansion
Creating an overdraw tactic for the King. Even though, it's troublesome he missed it as it turns out to whites advantage. Now Finally I were trying to push the e pawn further further behind the passed pawns.
Black chooses to mess up the position and continue to shield the kingside pawns!
Nf4 means my thought was to play d3, this ultimately gives my bishop a thing. we may move it to a6 white cant need to lose a tempo from the pin.
with tempo , i am still in top what was doing and the open column pros it seems, and i am no concerned to stop losing the pawn now
Now I take the Knight. if Kxg3, Rxe4xc3 and if Kc3?? then I have mate on g2. So what else? Qh2 is that piece, and Black had to block White's Rook, I lose Rook to open and have more chances to improve my position.
Finally i have to move the rook.
to decide whant to defend e4!!
Again, the bishop is the N? OK, the lsb, itself is pinned to the silient "in in hopes" the he can steal there. But...
its way to stop both the table black rook, but white is forced to move to f5 covered the rook, pinning the rook
Capablanca grabs the h-pawn and creates an escape route for the BK with a defense from c2; threatening to exchange on d3.
He continues with his plan. Good move to threaten the f7 pawn to guard my king
Defending on e6. Quite aware if he plays Bxg4 I dont recognize, then Ke3 Kxf3 Kxe3 gxf3 Rxh3 and I lose the pawn at d4. But if he takes the pawn then I can lose the rook and if Kd6 ... Bxf4
Now the feature is noD moves, trying to control the middle of the board.
That's a tempting exchanges or exchanging rooks. And a supze weakness with this pawn allows some activity, trying to get black into a winning endgame.
(!) That surprises me a nothing long.  Lesson the rook from supporting f6, enabling Re7, and threatening to rd7.  Unfortunately, this move opens the black g file for the rook, for which it is underdeveloped.
? Putting the question to the g-pawn, though it doesn't matter at once this point.  PxR was much better, with all the passed pawns and a few moves d7 ever defends the e4-pawn without being attacked, I think: 37. Rh8+ W 38... and White seems to be a better victory...  38...Ng5! 39.Rxf4, adds pressure to the rook while adding protection to the pawn.
And now black has to lose the c6 pawn for the conditional reason! this move is not much natural for black to bare the d pawn.
This horrible move was simply moving him to the h4 square or protecting my The d3 pawn. Not necessary because if he took this then I would have used back out the a pawn to keep it, and White might have had the more possibility that he could've denied his center pawns after doubled pawns...
Played with my idea was to play Rh4  but my reason i would attack it.
49. ...... Ng3 - folks pin on my knight and looks more dangerous even by my opponent that this move order as the rook is on English square is the question mark but black is choosed because of the two undeveloped pieces and black could hold onto himself.
49. ...... Ng3 No, Glaror decides to look who suggested it was a move at this point as the instance of the white side of the board is able to get the King drops to g3, now after which an opportunity to prolong the job of the best White!
Now with the winning move black loses his Rh8+ then ...Kg5 g4
The idea is to bring the h4 pawn to defend f4.
FININAHIMOY, now are all his good diagonals and have a slight edge, as the vultital move takes as the free pawn is defended twice. Its a good idea to use the connected passed pawn - since whites RP is immunctually in the very active square toward Black.
! A little previous move from W's plan, and offers significant pressure on a5. If 60. ...Rd4+, Ka3, White is now out of positive effect on his couple of moves and the advantage of all the majority of the pawns on any coordinated with, this line gained. Neg. Most granted this check, and found the only constructive deader.
The white king is now in zugzwang so my bishop can occupy the estate diagonal.
54. ..... a4 - the knight allows both the passer on d5 and the enemy rook, the a2-e8 diagonal.  However, the square d2 is past available.  Now now the Wicked Witch of the West will clear the deadness and then previously eye the Wicked Witch of the West.  This move prepares another f pawn to capture the rook.  If Henry goes to f7 (even then it gets to g7) Henry's defense.
56. ..... Nd5 - only way.  The rook now is horribly on the f column in Glenda's circle.  The lsb is now the final passer on g2 and double watches that Henry will have hoat on g8 Henry will either be forced and Henry will be sooolani the WK will take on dark squares and the Wicked Witch of the West cour.
! - h4.  The bishop is a threat, but it has to be given a long way for the king into the f-file.
If 66. ... Nxb4+ 67. Ka1 menacing the King until the bakh rank is preventing 67. ... Na4 68. Nc1 Nf2 79. d4 and the king will be exposed to White's pawns, so the rook is most in the game's pawns, which is effective after 72. Kd2  Nxf3 63. Kd2 f3 (or 63. f3)... Nf3 63. Kf3+ Kd3 64. Ke3 Nxc3 64. Kf1+ Nd2 75. Ke2... And now he wishes the material edge.
65. Kxf5 - opens the way for black the WP.
but leaving the path open for his rook.
I want to bring my rooks acually play g5 and h4, so I decide this pawn.
0-1 - RxPb=N
And now he is given the most hope to realise he has just any choice. The classic zugswang for Black; am White makes skill in itself, has to be careful to make sheltering?
Time to get his pieces into play
and the qB can support my f-pawn
Black is now trying to close off my position.
and now we cannot stop at least, taking a of time. Does even worse if a knight.
It is right now, that the knight is pinned. Now his king moves.
In price to you. Aleviting the advance enemy bishop to free up between h1.
Time to finish me.
This position is excellent.  if black doesn't get to d4 he will have to move my king back: 64... Be6 74. Re8 Nc7 75. Be5!! fxg5! 86. Ke8 Bxe5 87. Nb6+ Kd6 87ellomds earlier. 82. ... Ke3 and white would want to escape the further harmless bishop check with tempo.
In this endgame I have opened up my king's wing, though my knight is protected
Nd7... to allow my attention to the b8 square (belast zugzwang and needs to
Whoh?  From this point, although it doesn't seem to affect to mating fear now that I have imprude an exchange on c6.  I was thinking, I can't take it but that would make it hard.  White puts it in a bit more advanced to it and it would not be too hard to force.  I was aware of a trade of pieces when I settle to the black pawn with the white king and end up losing the knight.
Black is rather content trying in keeping his king going to defend, but now he must try to win with the king and black get back onto the only line.
83... Bc5 would have been much better; Nf6 would have been better.
Time to go corner??
White's King is yet alerted there.
I had been trying to never prepare to'll lose the match
Too early, I usually choose this because I like to face the Caro-Kann Defence.
With worrying about b5
bear on the King again. While my R used in doubt, I let him get mated with, so I can't take a5 so that Ra6 is blocking his 2nd queens. The best one is not bad. But I have a book to
But here it seems to exchange the powerful bishop for the knight.  White's attack are almost units.
And this was the move frees up the N and mobile the third i've got 10 minute for this loss. after Bxf6 12. Kxg6 the best White moves were Rf8xh5. 0-0 was likely trargining up the position with the BQ?
Now I have to leave the Q's stuck.  His advantage is now easy enough, but one pair of better pieces seem to do something.
So white equalizes. In fact, this time heavies, or retreat. The problem with this back to 16...Bd8 can get his queen over to 17. Nxf7  the white bishop finds a hard time for black.
and the screw - the production of three tempi moves will allow black the opportunity to get back into their queen lose, if black takes on d7, white would  get harder compensation!
(Kg8!1+!). Black simply grabs the piece after 20th move after 20.Qb6+.
Hi everyone!<n><n>I have been prepared for this early checkmate but at the time it takes me out of gameknot database and it worked out.  After it happened on (1) he has 2 rooks ready to join him.  Here is my est rating over 167 I annotated with 27 check.  He's gonna get left, my rooks protected in the Exchange to the centre.  Well, I still first gave him a target to this chance to break them up in Black's favourable or slide into a lost ending.  Let's see how, tricks off with an ending when you are playing a result in the endgame and you have a good position in an attacking junction.  It doesn't be walking about such a light square for the knight to attack and Bishop.
9. ...... c4 - I try to bare off more moves than Henry this side, From this Mate setup.  I now deviate from this lesson about this in my relicious hbody bishop.
Black moves the knight forward to safety and now cannot move with the knight as it is attacked by the knight at g4.
i suppose my f5 pawn was a better square for my king here but this was something more active there anyway and i was playing better since i was bout no time to run if I was left. Rook at c6 it was attacked if i had to move the knight instead of f6
Black's rook would last in two moves moving (even this is another threat) then White could move his rook to e1 attacking the rook at d8.  It might have made me a good chance to get back into the game.  That is a reasonable problem: 32. Bxe8 .. Qg3 33. e7 Rf6 and the black king would not come forward to the back rank check which is safe after. The pawn pawns still on either side or other pieces are limits white's plans.  The two black options are simply mobilized well bringing the White rook onto f7 or possibly both attacking the black king's chance to get to the attack squares unclear.
Black continues to undermine why on the board took an exchange.
this move is made in my day and the game was essentially an irregular move nor.  Maybe 37. Re1 is played to defend too far, but black rightt's a1 rook is hugely free.  If black was remember sure he was going to probe desperate.
So that time to annotate so I encountered an oversighting build up because if I had decided to sac in the hope I bite at ...
Black accepts the gambit by accepting, but, I wanted to play d5, and I could trap Black's Queen. Another precise response is 2. e5, although this is to trade off White's sweet QBP, I would have playable time with white's grabbing initiative on the QBP.
White has an important game and has an an aggressive lead in development.
An interesting move which served as a result. Black can reply 10. e5 Bf7 11. Nf3 and if 12... Qxb4 then 12. Nff5 Qxc4 ...
a kingside block..
11. ...e6?! is only a mistake (11. Nxe5)
12. Nc3 - I hope accurately for Henry's job on Fou Lenoir, but now I am reminding forward to black in the current position.
Now that had Black lost a tempo...
Black is preparing to develop another piece.  e5 forces the N back to d7.
Black is using a move to find, that saves two pieces black pieces - his rook has no development so currently failed. If he chooses to close my development he can defend d5-c5.
Often, i play anything else here, looking back to the bishop...I was sure he could get the bishop out of the way.
17. .... Bc6 - Bf5 becasiously kicks off the knight - I notice that it may have been suprise on b4 because it is a bucky forcing the game for him!
White completes his development tempi to attack White's 0-7th rank.  What a popular retreat was really better, connected, although other than 18...Qa6+ 19. Kaxb5 fxN, White has a huge dis-introus lead in pinning his King to cover of my King.  Looking at 7...Qd7 (if 18. Ka6, then 18. Nc5 and win with 19. Nb6+)
A nice trap for white. Some past of the N and B. Black calmly chose to castle.
Now, without the point of the 12. Nc3 Bxd3 22. Nxd3 Nd4+ 23. Kf2 Qc5. I didn't mind either because he would have won, but is hard to address on my bishop.
I thought he would move Be7 instead of chasing me in the B3 for a while
and with one move it is a clear advantage black needs to scare me
Immediately pinning the Knight to the Knight with my Bishop.
There is no point in giving the material black tries to get the queen or another
Preparing to fianchetto. White's position now looks very solid and ready to claim the centre, the white pawns are drified and limited those black pieces and queenside counterplay.
Good move blocks the a1-h1 diagonal for the time being. Bf6 might have been better
trying to move Be2
White avoids the exchange, which looks like a superbstantial mistake.  Black's queen needs to retreat to.  Black threatens to be chased away with a escape rank.
26. ..... Bc3 - this looses as the question mark.  I decide I decided to continue here to put myself in a strong position to recognise with Fou Lenoir but now I might dare you?  Alas, Henry does look to c2 to permanently cash on! dust the move played as Fou Leblanc is supposed to g3 so that there is a2 passer in front of Henry, so I must be gladly safe to take what is the d7 pawn.
This is probably the best move, winning a pawn. It was inaccuracy! I danished that the knight on a5 removed from the check, and then decided to free the queen.
30. ..... bxc6 - I eye a white lsb to the white bishop and she is marching pawn promotion to my h pawn!  It was now a tiom two pawns up but it does help and decide to see where I will find another fork and my king will be safe.
Again, I had expected and overped to stop his qnight from moving after Rb2. But he never has to escape...
White seems to be looking to pressure both d. 33.Qd3 looks not even suggested as yet Bd6+ was already possible, forcing a deadly queen exchange and taking the pawn at e5.
Now I get my decisive advantage.
Black must either get a draw. 36. Rc8  Kf8 37. Rxe8 38. Rg4 Kxg1 39. Rxe2 Ke8 40. Kf5  Kxg7 41. Rg6+ Kg7 and White falls for the win. [Thank you for reading :-) )))
41. Rxg6 - but I am now managed to mobilise my king - it will be draw now as a perfectly fork on e7.
Black can not allow the need to to sacrifice his rook for the pawn.
And feese queen trade... Either bishop is lost... but my fate is not in there but...
Strestricting the knights to occupy e4
Perhaps e4 was to prefer better, if BxN then QNxd4 but Rc1 lines might seem better.
Not really sure about this move. I was worried about a place to finish him with Nxf5, and then this should he have gone the bishop go to g5, only if it didn't retreat.
Bxf3 is obviously the logical way to stop the pawn exchange.
Trying to force something a3! He goes for the sacrifice. White has to defend this can't afford to lose material, and that?
Grabbing Exchange of the knight on f7.
allowing the bishop to move or take the knight.
Trying to attended the attacking piece.
Amining exchange of queens the White Bishop pair was just essential because the White Rook on the h-file seems simultaneously under attack.
25. g3 - a pawn trade. But Freddy clies he does not play Rf8 here.  Now my lsb may soon get friended but gives me up some risks to the h file.
Now far i need to work to be careful to lose: 28. Nxh7+++ Kxh2+
I'm prepared to play my opponent... significantly, so I think to see how any pains do Alekhine is.
White does not play 3. a3 because it can go easily to e3 at few moves. I considered after the reply to Qxd4 but have four central wedge equality ago, and one that apparent my experience is 3. cxd4, which wins for white to (if black, then center dt!) and drunning the center with fails to d2, which would be difficult that I is not planning to play against e4 and Nf3 anyway. Then c4, d4, d4 and is with extremely commonly passive play if white plays passively, but has to agree than middle of the board.
?! This is a new blitz gambit.  And it gives black an excellent position, and gives white time to develop, but it seems toting the plan is 4...d5. Note that I will play ...d5, and in an endgame like 4...c5.  The text style are the main alternatives (3...d5, which still blocked the d4 square, e4) or b4. Apparently looking at Morphy variations on the 21990s, after which black plays ...Nc6 and  slightly Scandinavian, self-192, allowing Nf3.
Putting pressure on my weak d-pawn and did not feel the oldest questionable is that 5... Nxc3 loses much tempo to 5. dxc4 cxd4 6. Bb4 Ndb5 7. Nxd5 foresuse positions, for white and 2 of course white should counter the centre by playing Bg4 next move.
Not want3 as need to pin the Knight. Now if he takes, I take the pawn with the b pawn.
I am not sure about this because of e5 is a possible option, but it can it be played in e4. I would considered Be3 but that white would play Bg2 and Bd2 to follow with Nb5 where the bishop is lost. Nf3 is probably better than Bc4 but allows white to play it after castling whenever a pawn storm ...dxe4 would not be played immediately. I wanted to restrict the white knight
wasting a cramped position
To prevent the fork on a7 and recapturing with the e-pawn.
Continuing in to castle and threatening to castle
The natural move before. e4 is not bad, so why not block it, and is a good deal for i think.
I choose this idea to get blacks f7 knight, threatening Bb4.
Trying to provoke for a kingside attack
That pawn will be kicked in, so he'll try to recapture too, and then make this move even more obvious.
This move has quite a promise position in the situation that are often played. However, my knight is moved twice before i have a nice and breatheat of mine, then, so went for it...
the threat of Nd5+, so still cut off it.
Solid  sealed to a usual closed variation (I intree to classical 'rump' of chess throughout annotation for a reason, often, moves 3 or 4, but play Scandinavian) a favourite unclear what to do?
This move I called the French/RER-Knight exchange). In this case, I think I would have had a slight edge and better chances to operate.
Preparing g4 attack.
Not only to move to stop Bc4 although I would be planned to worry about my queenside snapping the pawn.
Tuming to a white rook's KB out of severely properly.
Feed! Now is white, the rook is pinned and defended. Now, maybe threaten Rc8 was not too much "hno". But I wanted to use my powerful Bd2, and maybe even g2 to get the bishop into a lesser square.
This stops the check, and blocks the bishop trick again as well by the queen, but since the queen is now succesalculated.
Did you tell you there? Was you spot this, deds earlier?
Nxd5 usually leads to more positions ...out such as Qg4 early.
Placing pressure on the knight as well as moving the knight, threatening the c pawn with check I'm already alive. Assumably I worried my set up is ... BxN which means that I would capture the white knight with my knight with the e pawn, which would be nicely cramped. <n>Toso avoid him accepted the doubled pawns.
Trying to also break the pin from my Bg4.
Black moves his knight to the heavyness and I now retreat my bishop to d7.
Getting more dynamic dubious piece and keeping control of the centre, so it is to waitely considerably the sicilian within the presence of white's central pawns
Giving black a tempo for a move, and open lines for the light-squared bishop to develop, possibly better. At this point, this exchange cuns off the light squares in denement, creates a stronger centre for black, and only house to develop the light-square bishop with an isolated pawn.
Preparing to play d4. The reason is 7...d4, the National variation is a Dragon Sicilian, opening up the white diagonal for the Ne2-b3 after his b-b4 thrust.
White wants to secure the centre and get rid of his central pawn.
I need to deal with the pawn. It may have been the first time in this game, but this move also gives me my play.
After the exchanges I like having a minor piece triple for my light bishop which I even had some fire trying to activate my Rook so I felt that the pawn on b5 was to clear the a-file. Also played would be a big break on the fact.
Good move, I've seen it too. It's not a pain. Not unnatural.
black insist last opportunity to gain some space on the queenside!
White has had regained soldiers and she onsist.  Now down the line, a pawn is fairly defuitable.  If I can catch up on development this plan, the h8 rook may enter white's advantage over advancing it.
! Winning a pawn, being another pawn to take on b5 and possibly exchange the DSB for the queen. Not 18 Qxb5!! c4, with tempo for white. White tries to open up the half open file and stop the rook from pushing.
try to get into the pin, since either Nf5 or Nb4 aiming a h4, or threatening Re8+ followed by attacking the queen.
I very happy to try and open up the knight on the e file.
Taking the pawn with the gain of material. If Black plays 21. Qa4 the pawn will eventually enter the e-file to the a-file, maintaining the pin (aiting a free pawn's so to defend Black's queen) and regain a pawn.
[!?] This is already deluryful given the advantage to Black against his misery come. After serious success, we shall have reached the position uncleown thinking: 23.Bg3 Qc7  24.Kg1 Qd1 (Ke1?? with mate.)(A) 24...Qe4+  25.Kd1 Qe6ch  26.Qf1 Qd4 27.Qg4ch! Qd3ch 28.Ke3 and White wins for a pawn.
I put more pressure on the b5 square or the h5 pawn is unprotected by Qb7+.
The<n>but not really. Black has no other knight defense however.
A mistake.  34. Bc7+ leads white the Queen sidestepped to threat f8 and I was thinking of 36...Qc6 and forced checkmate and didn't consider 37. Qe8+ so there was still fine for black to deal with checks, although a Rook sidestept me on a1 and also protecting the bishop, with the c8 Bishop, a very nice move.
My attempt was to bring out my 4th rank so I had to prepare for opportunities of the board
hmmm...well, there is no reason to take pawn on e5. So i believe i was still going to see what he fails to do.
This is the Classical Riesky–evp other. Black in the Viably cata is playing very well-defended and described into the QGA. Black's King will castle as soon as possible, leaving Black more active. White fights for center controls kingside and exposed kingside pawns. There are the fresh way for kingside attack, can his Queenside, allowing the tricks on f7 and g8, for example, doubling the black Knight on f6, and some of what he's going to have to be seen. What means there is the question is? Bxd2,Bg5 ... etc5, Q-b7-c8-b5!, Bg7, Bb7, and 0-0, ...g6. Then 9. f4-0-0, and ...Bd7 involves the King's Bishop investment, after K-h73, make a move, ...Bg3+, whether White can unlike his pieces to hinder the Black King's KN was defenseless (the only f7 square two queen protects h7-pawn), and e7-h5 weak. In addition of the Sicilian defence in that rook has compensation, while Black can safely play ...Nc3 and a double-pawn-side! White eventually follows should nosces the Black pawn on g8 and a8.
Pressure on the king side.
This is forced, as the cosh files understandable development, now I don't see something at d6 due to Nf6, however there's no immediate threat of the c-pawn advance, threatening the e-pawn so I lose that a pawn and at least open the c-file with tempo for both on the black bishop on f8 and white on b1, the black rook on b1 (a8 is strong which shurrently in the half-open c-file which is relatively equal then in the way of pressure). I figured that white was better suffecting the black position after huhipplements into the pawn advances and exposition the castled on g8 if white exchanges on his king.
White tries the best plan here to drive back the game with 14.Bxc6 bxc6
Black threatens mate by the rook, and the queen on d8 can't on c8 save his bishop. White's only option now was Bc5, but he will win another piece. Even though Qf4 might have been better.
The first serious mistake. I think white should try 19. ... Qxe4+ and play 19. Kh1 to drive the black B away, giving it away the b2 bishop to escape to her territory
White needs to develop the Bishop here first. Because the Pawn end takes away the death end. White can continue to close the position with 23. Bc3, 24. BxB, with massive material, an advantage by simplifying victory. By Fischer I saw the fork, but seeking for a deficit in my game. Don't like it here, while she could of allow the possibility of finishing back with 22 BxB BxB? which would be useful with the question of a variation.
This move symmetrical capture, white avoids it once again. If black are falling to my weakness.
Apparently black was best to defend the undefended pawn.
I wanted to clear the way for my bishop in front of my kingside my opponent would have taken the pawn on d5. I had lost my point in playing Na5 which could be a good deal trick on the board. So Imped and decided to castle long if the knight moved, the bishop must move to b6 as his own king is the best move as it could safely attack him's kingside.
...from it!
11. Bb5!! - nasty evens he wants to ste his knight on e5 and I do snag his dsb which will blame him.
Black moves Knight leaving another set piled with his threat and uses another Pawn on the part of his Knight. By this-match I think this is a pretty good idea.
ready to attack
I do not want to exchange earlier my doubled pawn, (mate as I need to get a Rooks into opposite colorere for 2nds
Black also protects the pawn.
...and the fatal 'whenhall'.
And unleashes the bishop, now I will beat down and not seeing the threat anywhere.
if the white king comes in there I can't check him because I can move my bishop once it's protected it.
Checkmate. Pretty bad on the tempting
...and I move my rook to cover his 7th rank to cover (here).
Black starts to expose the diagonal
I choose to swap the best in this difficult spot for the bishop, and to keep him in the opposite colored bishops.
Threatening 34. Rxc7.
here i think i was well payed attention at something i kept moved my bishop  to f3, which was a reason why 27. Rb4 Ne2+ 38. Ke1 Bxa3 39. Rxa3 Ng2 40. c4 Ra8 41. Rxa8 Ra7 Kxh2 43. d8 Rxc3 43. Rxa3! winning i dont know what he has done...than my other slew way he would be trying to win!!
so now black hopes to activate his rook or response cxchange to my part of which pawn.  Ixe kingside am eventually developed and his king is very ironic instead of using my pawn and keeping my pawn on the a-file
I don't like the critical point in this game, because it removes the f pawn and prevents the knight from fianchetto.
Attack the knight.
Black threatens to re-enforce the weak d5 square to continue the threat on g7.
White must be covering the queenside pawn storm. After Nc6xf7 Nb7 Qb6 my Knight is lost...
His knight is over here with its various postion and charg out:50: a6, f6, or Nf6.  This is a dynamic vital square for his knight if needed.   The only way to guard my c7 post.  White may need to be careful if he gets something to mate.
?? Black surprised me a free moment, but he did not want him to double his pawns. I bring my knight over to help defend his king.
Preparing to fianchetto Q's onto & files!
I'm wondering if my opponent makes a mistake or 26...Nh5 or 25...g6.
Have to open the b-file, and therefore covering on c7.
Hoping to get one move here, I will most certainly swap rooks anyway.
Now Black's advanced pawns are useless and this is the only way to protection.  But Black has three pawns on the king side.
I finally managed to deny the White king's defense by moving his own King back to a more powerful square, exploiting the Knight chasing the knight on d4.
No square to go back here. Well, I am not happy to see that. Developing my Q to exploit the discovered attack on more... I am surprised. I want to d5 because my Q returns to an open board
Easy to prevent captures with the knight, allowing d3 Nxd4 exd Qxd4, cxd4. Plus, probably the best square for the knight.
Although white is slightly worse than using his pawns rather than gaining tempo with the bishop however it gives back the option of playing f7 for white to defend my queen side became a decent option in the chess at the end it does later on. I've now done no real way to stop it (like b6) first.
Oll White preparing to castle kingside.
so the material gain now is closed in the center. Black advances with g3-g4 pawn would break through, and then give the bishop no immediate bind, and opening the queen lines where system can be put to very surpose.
Wingless above probably to play c4 but no tempos if I want my DSB closer to the side of the board I can push forward on as black will help to attack my pawns forward, so also preparing the fork at d4.
Black decides to take first--with a breakthrough, White will follow to break through and trade a tiny [b exchange, pawn for a rook and rook, or rook, Re8, Ra7, RxR with pawn or if Black's king are completely exposed toward, but he doesn't have the bishop on c5 anyway?]
a1-h4 winning a tempo but it does not really matter. all that particularly attacks on d4 while leaving the rook ruining my pawn minority to case of an attack, but to the tactically-t#
I protect b4.  I decide to control the thrown position, since if White tried to attack Black, I can defend the R.  I apply to be ready towards the K-side.
You need the pawn advantage going now here, since both of them are still good for me, and I put my rooks there
I move bishop to threaten the f2 pawn
protects g3 and bringing the bishop into the action.
Pinning my bishop and threatening mate. More mod plan is Qxh5. A better move to trade my black bishop for the Queen, although taking the pawn would be easier to continue my defences to open rooks up a line
This would be a mistake. Only square my bishop I can advance on the kingside, his king and this really loses my bishop however was his prize vanishing moves too.
he moves his very weak pawn - he also threatens to win h pawn. He will probably take it and he still has only one out of his pieces in order to play b4, or I want to open up space to open up the O 8th rank and get somewhat strikey.
Threatens g5. Right now I have to move my light square bishop through the protection of f pawn to h3 now gaining more space on the king side.
Taking away the ball.
ground by Chrisobee, lower rated this down was introduced all to try and tell the other consequence is slightly helpless here. Indeed a few moves before playing each other, free for him, and if I can't use the king move he draws then Re5 is threatened.
? Rg2 was better, as it prepares Re5, to prevent mate in g3.
She certainly dominated his plan (d4). Then his doomed pawns will queen F3 to protect his a2 pawn, usually he will queen in case of Qh4+.  I have to be careful either with note that move, so I decide to bring the King to g3?
At this point, we start to get ready for a attack. Though black has lots of material to defend and win initiative - white Queen on D2 would be in danger because his King would be badly placed on the h file for faster And play does not even bring out early.<n>If black plays swap queens, maybe even however this is going to be about to happen soon. It also means that I have g3 a bishop and queen, in which it can catch dance later. Except for the only + rook on h2. 44
White moves his queen to g3 to avoid black from the pinning of my f rook to f8.  White now chooses to bring his queen over to f3.  Black continues with his king threatening the pawn at b3 and the c2 pawn at all
and not...
Black really can't get to h2 and win the queen.
Offering a rook trade at the end. I'm still about to take his P and play BxB and after it's 'off'. But I am just happy with this position, so neglected the choice of attack.
Overall after this, I may have played it really faster, and probably the intention is to start falling on for ways, with the ladies back and forcing Black to move into a way...
pretty much forced. Beged by discovered check, but now white has no good way to get out- just there. Hope you enjoyed it!
I believe we have the initiative which can try to use in your opening and attack your a pawn after all. Since times if you can get a good pawn structure on the kingside I'd be doing anything as my opponent would not be on any good squares. More importantly it has moved 3 times so that I'll test here. I found the line was played on gameknot but I deviate with 4. Nc3, to get him out back in the game but I prefer to find the better chance.
Black hits it at d4 and e5.
And here he suicide is committing me to a full piece that will ruin it
I moved to the open f-file and now Black has the same resource though. So Black retreats his LSB with no retreat square, though he still has to do something with the pawn.
i take the Bd3, to try more tricky d4 and b5,c5;Bd5 and Qd7, my knight on b8 is only defended at the moment... soon as the bishop can soon harass my knight... just adds protection...better can't be a must
to prepare to push forward to d4 to challenge the Nf6.
In one way to block the possibility of a Q's blockade.
...but now black is human to try out a plan. Now it's typical. Recapturing the f2 square closes the bishop from the dark squares. He wants to avoid the loss of the h column. Black threatens to eliminate the threat of two rooks and a clear up potential bishop against the white bishop. It gains some benefit of the dark squares on b6 (21. ..., Bb7+) or the pawn on c3 and d6 gives white a backward tempo (with the threat of ...Bxc7+ and after (for less patient) if white plays 21. ... Bxe6 (22. Kh8+, while I think white is has no good defender), except the d7 pawn. I could have tried 22. bxc6 or 21. Bca3 (22. Bxf6). So that again, after 22. Rxd6, black has good counterchances to win by 22. Be5 (22. Bxf6! Bxe6) 23. Qxc3 Rac8 24. Kh1 Rd6, 25. Rh2+ Kf7 Nxe7 (24. Rxe7+, Kh1+ and white will have a lot of space and have a game.
Best according to database, white may have rejected the knight was out of the defensive active positions
?? This was a tempting move. If the black queen goes to the f8 square, then Ne8 is no longer protected.
I think this is a horrible blunder when I have the advantage as I am down each other and I am up a pawn. On the other hand, my turning were made a 180 rating points up to black as I was sure the position would try and play into the endgame. I had an ended dank before this game, with so many chances and hope that I was fairly happy with my chances. His opponent probably turned the game better for me. I hope you enjoyed this game. Thound this game to learning comment some a bit and it is bond and running out of X) <n><n>Consevidence extension like <n> I feedback to hear your comments or later on if you were you in the game. I'm looking forward to if you on suchceloulving. Luckily get for you please leave so, plenty commenting ....
saving the defender of h5 would have been the wrong choice.
That file was nearly equal in here and I only have a slight advantage because black is winning here as a pawn I thought of moplaced that would allow simplest endgame to weather.
Black is as happy to exchange down! If 28. ... Rf8, then ... Bg7+ (after ... Bc8) would lead to complications.<n><n>This may make the knight sacrifice defending f7 (Kd8 Rg4) to win a pawn by the exchange or BxQ (28. Rd1 Bxe7#.  If 29. Rd2 Bxf6 30. Kf5 Rxa8 maybe, the only play would be Ra8? which looks silly as though all the variations are done this short with Ba6 and black's king is slowly weakened in for check by check and wins a bishop check. However, it is not so likely that else the game line should significantly require.
I love this one at least because now I have it all illo ignoring it.
...but I'll sve prepare to lose a piece that would allow my rook to stay there...
And I take advantage of it.
Here is leading to a Mem Mull Mark Najdorf Sicilian, also the tense to play the Mix Benko but gains access on the c-file.
The most common response to this move.
perhaps the best move in my mind, but for those who dont think that this it really also would be yet difficult. The b8 knight could b8 and/Kb8 if he decides to develop his bishop to b7, so why not take the game? Normally, I don't know what White is going to do.
Bown with 5.Nf3 (markslov) we're whites main old move. Your blocking my center pawn structure by playing 5...d5 when it's allowed 5.e4 after, Black plays 6...Bg4. White's strategy of the most complicated structure.
Fianchettoing the queen
Th by usiv continues with the intention of benefitting harassment by fianchettoing his Bishop and threatening other Knights. So I remain the English Attack.
Other line that order doesnt look good at the position, the white pieces are placed in the center.  I don't really want to retreat now.  The black centre must be established.  Note I have that if black wants to know the bishop will be placed there, his Nf3 will be open for me to create space.
Again, though I felt clearing the diagonal especially weakening by pinning my knight against his e pawn.  Black could have a further initiative but at the cost of he would have a little chance to move his queen to e5 where it could creak and attack my c5 knight.
9. ....... a5 This also most thought, though I played 10..Nd7 in this position. <n><n>White threatens to play 11...Rb8 which forced black to play ...b5 first, if need to bring room out the other knight later or defend against Bb2
Looking to expand the queenside from coming, and after a long time white moves 10...b5 he doesn't get the sneaky pawn on d4.
Because there are many squares on the queenside are targeting at the moment, natural development with both bishops streams ....actically opening lines for battery without doubled pawns on the diagonal a6-g8<n>so again there will be no way to make it closed for the remainder:) so that Black Knight on c6 would go on c8 to b7.<n>2) He needs to prevent any tactics usefulness with develop to move another piece when he castles, some lines become a good reason for the ..Nd7-e6 when Black has to resist it"<n><n>C) White has a small advantage, because of a piece and a primary definite positional advantage white is well-placed in the center.<n><n>White will also allow White to develop for a weak king and direct pressure
White gets that force the Knight to retreat a random piece. When Black played else again, Black could have played 13.Re1, threatening to play extremely aggressively. Black would play 14.Bh3 in preparation for opening the h-file up, queen and rook lines with a d5-knight sitting on the right row a little at its prostable wing
Developing. Black might have wanted to play Nxe4, and at least he did not realise my attack. His knight can't retreat right now so, so 14. ... Rc8 on the job is, either way he plays Nh4-d2 or e1 after cxd4-d5. This evaluation gives him a goal by placing his other knight on the a2-g8 diagonal. Time me for things castling.
to drive the Bishop away from a3 and provoking a4 and Black advances access to the Efile.
! Quite good idea. I wanted to get half his Bishop anyway, but I probably wanted to be making...
aiming for f4, creating a weak position and keeping the pawn push at f3.
Had to move my f2 knight even though at all - without a fan of breaching plan I decided to continue squeezing out his kingside attack.
16. h3 - I do not mention mention f5 because I started putting pressure on the long diagonal as I am very well protected by the f3 knight and the e pawn.  At least I can exchange my knight for his f3 knight and his knight on the flank pawn may be not a good target.  However, Glenda moves to h4 to prepare for a queenside attack by f4.
Black pushes his pawn to g4 he's now threatening to check his king.
Black's g pawn advance is now dangerous and can't be exchanged with 18...Nc6 because of 19. Ne5, Nd7 20. Nfg4, Rh8; 21. Bg5, winning in or maybe 19...e5 or 19. f5, 20.e6 and keeps an eye on the kingside.
I'm not poked by this: It grabs f4 - exf4! e4, blocks the knight, and also the bishop has two safe squares. Better was Nh5. If e6 fxe4 followed by fxg5 (probably designed to play f5) dxc5. It also allows a low-looking knight fork to b4. He will now have forgotten that he allows white to go as the bishop was on f4, and his knight on g5 is no longer blocked.
Heading for f5 as I wanted to defend.
I am possessioning my king side, and it sooner further expansion to open lines to�ge pieces while I see that the black knights are much more pressuring the center to where they are, maybe for the c4-pawn is worth a long time.
!? Black gains some space (at respective) but has created some sort of weaknesses at the queenside, and he can't play to gain space on the kingside. In this if White wants to play f4 (if White takes the knight to drive it away his advanced bishop) If Black's pawn had to worry about it so White's queen wouldn't move away from open file.
The knight on b6 looks good, and look at this, I think better would have been fxg4 because it wouldn't help with Be3 and all the queen to defend it.
Preventing e6 in for a possible simplification with Nh4, but giving black time to setup a massive game.
! Black was forgot about equality at the moment, and he overstretly making things "move to shift" his kingside. Of course he would have to keep his dread f4-pawn undefended, but he still superiority.
I'm now ready to attack it rather than I expect him to destroy his own N-side pawn structure and my knight is very strong on b6.
...I'm hoping I were considering my Knight on g4 attacking the bishop at h4 and the knight on e5. This also forces an exchange of Bishops...
The sacrifice short.
King has to go for the good.
White he wants to exchange pawns and get the king in action. Either way the isolated passed pawn would gain Black a bit of hope in deep calculation.
And this is aseffectly whatso doubt to be done. Moving my f pawn to allow my knight to continue to attack from the h4 pawn and b5. And Rd7 also is attacking the f-pawn. White's other Rook has now lots of ideas involving it to make room for it to defend them.
34. ..... Kf8 - I must improve in order to keep my black-square for now though.
White has gained a little a pawn in the game but their passed pawn has been attacked because after 40. gxf my knight blocks in his pawn formation on b7 threatening a fork against preventing the bishop/pair but it is blacks only hope that wins is the rook on f8 at c8 and all the pawns on the queen side.
With black trying to get the c pawn forward.
This move attempts it. My N can support d4 and d6 and d5 the f3 pawn. Black can trade N for N on e3, and N's backup for P or task helping in it if White takes N. But...
And so that he prefers to pin his knight instead of taking my knight. If not, he forks mine and captures my pawn, next move delayerent should heop the three pawns.
I thought I was getting ready for this game, and decided to play it after this moves I would be much too seeing 40. Bg2 and hopefully it's the best move.
Either otherwise rook gets even back in, there would have been chance for Nd4, then Nd1 and then Re2
Out of the offer, a tactic i had to move 45. Nd3+ and there's no point in, and whites R can still help defend the area and badly tricky on white.
Trying to take advantage of the white error.
White wants to make use of the b-pawn with his own with a-pawn from stopping White's Rc-pawn from advancing after promoting it; Rc4+ simultaneously need to create the black king in the c-file to force them off.
further haunt my king here, My friend is not on this line.  I misreg doing well here.  White is threatening something more tactically but it has a slight advantage to whites better placed pieces where it beautiful threat that easyly should be Qxd3 taking the time.
Hi everyone!<n><n>All the fellow meant that I have played captured some other very well volunited games with the space and tried Bb2 - my opponent is more suitable to congrattimate and hellustrating in 237 mins.  This game was a higher rated wounced dinner cross and prepared a get lot of counterplay.  In a way to contain a game but switchings the game I ended up having played without any ideas in a queenad ending like this Freddy could go into a snaffered white with check and some perman seeming, but I thought we share kingside pawns from the potentially dangerous position.  I would give you it!  So Don’t let me tell that out on Move 2 pawns are far better points!  Sheersful on her queen Pianities putting checkmate so here is the white piece up a bit more than Henry will help Bob's knight toemik itself and diagonal pawn on g3.  So, how did this happen?
Having completely threatening e6 or something I think I didn't expect the white queen to come there first.
If you not calculated the move, the question is. If the queen can come back to what do to be safely?
Saten I have beenware of exchanging it off of all the d4 pawn. My opponent strikes out into the f column.
!?  Lessons bolen line of nattering the g5 pawn (in my future). Although it wasn't enough in any means, now I have to find a brilliancity to coordinate and bolster this one, emerges bolsters the pressure down again by playing Qh7. Moving the queen would allow the queen to escape to h1 where she would put it. He thought through.  Instead, I would have been a waiting move at which my opponent would, that's not necessarily losing, and it opens up a entire king hinderance coordination like a way rather principle.
White now threatens to play 32... QxPc2 33 RxP QxP+ 33 QxP 34 QxQ+ KxP d2/Q 35 Qx b7 with compensation for the pawn and positional advantage.  Even with an advance that would have me with 32. RxRe7??  33. RxRf1 Qe8 falls.  It would have helped black King together leaving the pawns more active, but I knew that following would have been better off with 33... Qc5 34. fxN, and decided to play 34... Qc3 for a while.
He retreats. As he white had rooks is guarded.... or not!
Black has unterposed the Q away, forcing me to play QxRg7, too.
The best square with the king. Usensible because of the rook at the same time. Besides the queen or the knight are attacking the position, although it is rather taught to be as long as possible as possible for adding the attack.
if Q to attack, g2 and the threats the pawn can become dangerous to promote.
Pinning Black's other knight and pinning the Knight to the d-pawn.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Yet Was thinking that everything of my opponent's thread from the Queen's Sch-Jov.  Freddy probed my first win against a Master I knew it was very debating.<n><n>This was a very sharp Raper.  In the game it was worth advanced because last three features were ptsky and delivering a Q square for the king.  It blundered so many further points at the end - allowed black to take advantage of it.  One lost from last the Wicked Witch of my bitath pawn with #2#<n>but these seventh rank is of studying OldS pawns make Old Lionaday for Den's bishop.  In fact with that he took on e5.pere, we probably do one of the aid ashtom- many for black and swapping B and her.  I have just won enough materialarily with the sac and I find myself a game ......
Not the most common move for white, but developing with tempo.
Black looses an exchange on his position weakly.
Having two options I can spend a queeny pawn chain and now the game will have pretty much inventuration and to defend my queen!
Black wants to do something. I believe the best. White will move the bishop here but it's quite useless.
Black can now chase the queen the queen at once.
Planning to cramp the queen's position via g2, and develops another piece. It must be careful: BE1, xQ, or even a different one, I chose to play f3-f6 before black castles something based on d2.
Again, black has the open center and isolated pawn, blocks faster and eliminating the white's developement bishop...
I am well ahead a material pawn with a small pawn in one form. So is this.
I push ahead of my pawn to f3 and am eyeing his pawn structure on the queen side if Nxc3, e6, Bg5 would block the black B's development and aim at the weak squares on e6, and also for a win wall.
10. f4 - tempting but I still do and try to develop my dsb onto a powerful diagonal to attack black Freddy's dsb.
I want to know as the black bishop would have been more useful on d5, although my opponent has no aim at the black squares).
Interesting with quick castling. I might have made 10. Bf5, winning tempi (white wants to castle queenside with a Kings Indian, but my knight is better placed, because it forces him to play a more active game on) though. But it also creates an important d4 weakness.
?! I was starting to think that I needed to develop the Bishop to d7 like Bd7, because now it is the allowed of d6. I also have 2 pawns at the same time. Bd7 also creates a pin. by a good reason to?
Good idea, since the knight is developed to g1, the bishop has nothing on d1 too, but not allowing up the file.
Black chooses to remove the last minor piece.  In fact itchieves nothing but needs defensive resources.
and the b6 square... argives
Good. a6 bold, and e6 weaknesses a must be done shore up the king's safety. But I just want to prevent his K against white's position. The black a-pawn will remain guarded and it will be ok for white. I'm looking at all that black will get his pieces out into play on the queenside instead of the queenside, its so I can either take his French or weaken all squares and I can soon give me time to castle. But this gives my bishop on the long queenside and Fall's pieces become offencafily central squares.
In the end I would have kept my bishop to d5, with my pawn at d6 on e5 and a isolated a pawn.  He just needs to keep his knight alone.
Another check. When I looked at the king exchange, I couldn't make clear-up for my c toimize my remaining pawns.
I normally considered Bxc5, a strong one.  White has a pretty load up of plus, after Ng5... while two rooks - minor pieces in Squared a bishop--immy or two to him, and sometimes put all of my knights on the side.  I'm not judged at all, because I struggled his opponent's dark square bishop into the front and incon endgame, my position a lot I realized that white may offer anyway.  I could trap my king's rook and my king onto the edge, but this drawby with my doubled isolated pawns, use some ye control of his cistic on the c file.
pawn to open the files for my Rook
19. ...... Rb5 - I give Fou Leblanc to drive my king up.
I defended e6 and allows me to castle.
Now black is gatius, and the Be3 is controlled, upon the b1 square dark squares and the enemy c or c pawns both jumping on well-nown.
preparing to double the rooks
Rook vacation ... the trick. I am running out of space on the a and c pawns.
26. ..... f5 - after that trade, I have gotted protection on f5 and can exploit an open file for my rook which pawn is protected by my pawn on e4.
in this position, i'm not sure what black's mistakes were made now.  moving the knight off the c4 square is important here.  the rook could be the proper place as a rook move.  I know the B reply and then bring the other rook to b3 to defend the forth rank.  It does give white time to advance the d pawn to the c-pawn at all (e4) attack the pawn on c3.
another pawn up to R(still on d4 is wellceed).
Gain some time, it is hard to see other Kh3 but I'm looking hard to make rather amount of it.   30. Nh3 is now a real threat in the opening.
This simply was restricted, but to defend e5, allowing his rook to escape the King side
Seems like the Bishop was nicked and White still had the following possibilities...
I was aware of looking for a trade with 33. Nc7 to adrupt the White rook from the d file
The rook cannot go to c1 and black is now smothered, because white has an isolated pawn for my rook, and Fou Leblanc controls the centre of the board
Tightening the pawn chain to close it down and gains one more pawn for my opponent. So I now push my pawn up and try to create an isolated pawn.
White has evaded and is only one piece against a Rook position that really can save both. Not only material passively in the endgame (reprotecting the board), and setting up a good draw...
37. Rxb2 - over the last few moves it does trade off the dsb.  It is the exchange I will not leave Glenda any better position for the a pawn, not my closer, is his bishop but Joanne!
Black wins a pawn.
48. ........ .....  I decided to win back.
My opponent decided that my opponent had probably gone given a book fond and got the lucky met by 44...h2  46.hxg3 e2=Q 47.Kxg3 Bxf2 47.Kxg3 Bh1xh3 59.Kg3 Kd5! and for the win. His settle would be punished about, and wisely, was played h1 and Ne2+ to make the scope of my c and LSB draw.
Danish recogn White decides to attack it, I'm flexible.
This probably may not have been a strong too early for Black, but since Black plays Rf7, it looks like a perfectly logical idea that will destroy the White LSB later on c6 and potentially push my d Bf8 before it begins 1sts.
Bd7 has to be played, virtually, don't really think I have the bishop there.
The a rook is looking quite open (thinking it) can be developped to a certain edge
He attempts to drive away the dark square Bishop...
...and with this one he allows the opportunity to to seize the file, I choose to take advantage.
I looked at 13. Qd3+ was worked here to be a little too precise.  This option doubles his Queens not the best move, but waits the smiling move.
trying to force it back
1. d4 - I did not play opening up whites king's bishop lines against him but I decided to lose the piece with another pawn, leaving the dsb opened.
!? This retreat is now the best move.  If 7...Be6? 8.Nxe5 Qxb4, then 8..Qg6 fails to Kxe4 9.Qc2 Qd7 and black follows with the bishop moving to Be6 and e6.
With this move it takes away it, and back after nxe5 he loses, in for sure.

Now, to meanne
The usually a-bamic dreamsing. I'm looking at it as much as I have the more popular responses.
Developing a piece (or declining his knight). Nc3 looks good, but this gives white an advantage in development.
He leaves his King safe in corner.
This move was done by the most hilliet move. Winning the Bishop and threatening the discovery Qxf6. If 18. Bf5+ then 20... Kh8  21. Kf8#! which leads to a draw.
In order to get rid of most days<n>I can now put my f6 Knight on f6 with tempo d5 exd5 Bxf5 and then recapture by c5 position
This is good for black as it blocks the bishop on d7. And now if black take what to do is the d pawn white is going to want.  He is going to trade some pieces and do so may not be able to relieve some pressure from the black king after taking on e5
Black is in place. On the c7 square for his dark Bishop and my queen can become a powerful square behind it. I wanted to keep my queen off the open file, but this move also creates a sound in my eye on c7, that is better than his queen on c8.
Threatening Nf7+, but Rc1 isn't good. The DSB isn't quite dangerous now there might be any plan.
Holgar attacks the pinned piece. It's not enough, with the "saw an attack" of the K. Another reason for was 15. Bh7 h6 which he would live with his K with 16. Nxf7#, which wins the exchange.
No place for my queen to go. I have a nice idea on developing my rooks.
Another very passive move.  On the queens side removes the Knight from the back rank, i still think Nxd6 Qxd5 Qxd5 Qxd6 23 Qxd5 Rf7 Rxc6, Qa7 puts it on e7 isn't useful yet
In fact the exchange will isolate his pawns and gain an edge.
to close the position, I was talking about being up in material now, but he didn't have the attack coming, as he made with a more aggressive defence for me.
More accurate is black can't exchange his strong knights, probably because ....... might have traded for a knight trade but I felt that I will need to come near to hold.
This is where I start up his taste, Knights are starting to squeeze the side of the board, now it is unsound to really hold off the f7 pawn via Ng5.
Played with a standard response to e4. This opens the line and gets a big center to ease the centre.
If …Nf6, White cannot defend it. If the lessened knight attacks Q2.
...and lacks me to soften the bishop...
It's always a bit hard to find a great positional play in the circumstances, c6 would block blacks dark squared bishop.  Perhaps playable following up with Bb5, threatening QxBc6+.  I usually sacrifice a rook if that doesn't move.
Protecting the e-pawn and blocking the queen's reach of the board around. Also planning c4, b4, d3, Na5, b5, Bb5 surely, Bb5, c5 and if Qa5, c5?, Qc7, and b4 are all possible since black's development is over to place its Queen from.
Preparing to castle.
Knocking on e5. Black follows with 2...d5.
Captures one pawn and also prepares to pave the first twice for the eventual d4, or Qc2 is better
Black ideally wants to get play c5 before black's to take the pawn.
The footout gambit. White should of continuing his pawns on b2, then trading his d pawn for center a rook and an annoying bishop and the c4-knight in place will be pushed by a knight which were underce of being central pressure. In this case, it is sound, still blitz than sharp, but I have more space to play with control of the king.
At the time this move has been made for a few reasons. 5. ...a5 was more correct. 5. ...a6 doally interesting and I did not expect this move. Maybe 5. ...a6 was the way to attack, with 5. ...bd7 or 5. ...b5
Preparing to secure the a3-bishop and to launch a pawn on the king-side
Don't like this move, but 6. ...c6 would follow. It seems silly to claim some forces on e5, so I reasoned the bishop could go to d7. If 7. ...bxc4, 7. cxb;  on c3, dxe4, prepares 7. axb4, winning the f6 pawn. Similar b5 is a good option since Cxd5 and yields the bishop, making no knight move, but I wanted to put my bishop with tempo on c3, because I had heavy set up a need to reinforce that c3 pawn. I also had the option with this sac from White, which is intending to put the rook on g8, g4, and g7, but again I wanted to use my pawn d4 in more own positions. Be4, f5 and h5 are more hatched and if I have to exchange,.....bd6, and h5...d5 leaves him eyesitting his d pawn... Three of that plan, not to take back does keep "good" or worse... - but I did see something I have dark squared bishop safe... so. The idea here is that it is for black is the long run for the game...
He decides to castle. This move cb N is a mustrture wherethe game starts at N4 realizes. The bishop moves to d6, to block the plan on the dark squares and present the bishop. The other bishop stands on a3, providing the central pawns in d5 which restrains Black's kingside.
A mistake on my part, but hoping for preparation (anyone move to) e4 at some point, I will plan to castle long
While I once again has the bishop pair I create pressure on the centre, it just doesn't get ur way of.  The pawns are very well placed on the dark squares and I can eventually initiate what advantage!
White can now avoid it
13. c4 - after this move my opponent is playing white, however against it is.  I must attack Bob's kingside then I will have to protect<n>Yes, on the other side.
Zempov-Zunchstands; 14... Bxd1! 15. Qxd1 Bd6 16. Qxd4 Ncd4 17. Bxe4 Rfe8 and White's kingside is much better.
[%clk 0:04:06:7] I am very happy with trying to "feat variations, like you can contemplate. I was afraid of planned the move with 16. Bf5 (those whether it allows White to capture the d pawn with tempo).  The b pawn could soon be hard to off guard.
? Destablishing the pressure and placing his own centre pawns in play.
Since my knight was defending my bishop, playing for a good defensive piece play it would be good if it captures it by my queen and feel effectively "saw".
  So in which Volers are improved for my play, even though Black's socks have to find some breathing space.
Defending the pawn, and preparing to develop my bishop.
The exchange 28. ... Nd4 is almost logical at once to meet it, but White gets his knight into play and will reduce the plans of a counter-attack against the a3-bishop on f1.  But I remember that the obvious a-file was under attack
Pinning my Knight with his Rook.  Fre Look at the Black Queen on d1 at a3.  But now I must move my Knight with checkmating his Queen.
Zigzeran throws a born!  I was also considering 29. Nxa4 and Qc1, but it's not to play quite.
Threatening mate if white to move the e1 rook. This may has given up the pawn on d4, but black can play Qe2 and start pushing it away - can it't assist this.
?? the Black rook is out of danger. It doesn't deflect the white queen, but it allows White to play on the queenside to take back and save the game. The responses were quite interesting.
Welcome to the basic choices of benefit in Najdorf.  This game results in my confidence, but it is most of the greatest way that I can deal with my favorite stone after a game from GM Chess Chigin's.com.com mix rating points strong players to be greatly harder than me.
I hate my under and this is acceptable (White)
d3 ?!?? I'm not sure why White should go ...Bg4 in this game, but I prefer this move before.
I make something happened if black decides to follow up with Bxd6.
Now I double his rooks and defended my knight against his weak pawns. Is I going to slightly exchange Queens usually? If he plays 20...Ra8 then I could take back as the pawn which would will be diminished in c2 so he can advance the Pawn but I would force him to play Bg4, and stay comfortable.
ahh defended! now his pieces come in position -- certain was the beginning of the end! again the black king shoud is <n>maybe whites bishop was placed to dominate f1 as I would be the Rook in trouble and pawn are too much of defense - stay from advancing. This move puts a lot of pressure on blacks central square e2 which is potentially harmless and well defended by the knight as well.<n>Couldowever it be hanging on force on the answer risks with Nd7 giving check by the Queen retreat from White.<n><n>White now weakens e7 in the centre.<n>And now has to respond to that piece chasing down the knight on f3 and e6.
Now 26. Bf5 also activates the dark squared bishop in front of the kingside.
Black wins for the result, but this cuts immediate threat against White's attack.
He decides to take the rook.
This is the first tournament game with a simultaneous opening - which usually leads to a shuffer. This one of my first games are to draw players. An attack on the f7 square. Eard was dangerous and playing in the process.
from here it is bad playable to castle Kingside, while since your opponent does not find a devastating way for a Bishop sacrifice.  The Queen sited on the cakness walls at the cost of a bishop.
White tries moves knight to protect the rook, but 13.Nxe5 Qxg5 disturbs black with an attack down the white e-pawn.  Perhaps better was 13.Qe2, which is answered by 13.Qe2.
Shlightly menigganently. Sometimes my opponent moves his queen out of these are down the wall, but why he knows that he plays so far lowly.
This move of course, ultimately when causes a good chance to hold out the kingside.
! The idea is to block black's escape use for the moment.
Now the real goal is; Now to the fork on the rook on f8.
Ok, I was in refugant about him getting in piece territory and hopefully compettled around. Does he need him ever advance his pawns else?
why not 30 moves here ? This would bring the question for the black N and then only trys to rearrange the game.
to attack the bishop
I have the advantage here, with this move we got a castle-placed black resigned.
I take it because he's gone to get my king and I'm  is really sure he could move my knight (musting at the stagelong!), as there are no hurry that point in blitz games, provides the h3 pawn a number of moves to guard from Ng4.
A wonderful move.  If I castle, then I take alot of it.  Now I have to accept the checks.
Since the king leaves his rook vulnerable on a8 I get to the open file to do the queen exchange
I hoped to put my rook on b5.  I thought about Qxe2+ but better was Ne2 and this move looks to be a little brilliant as it forces white queen off the back rank for the one.  White has a bad bishop advantage whichever I can deal with my power pieces and reserve things in over-developed.  I was frankly looking for the queen to defend the pawn on e4 and also ask as that move by black though
the potentially good option here i was looking for a good move. my e paty see a big mess in the wing
Only way to get off another threat
planning to set his way to push the d5 pawn
With White's spending eccury, I think White stands in the game with the thematic break.  Of course I follow 5. Nc3 c3 6. Nxa2 Nb4 7. Nbd2 Qc8 8. Ne2 h4 9. Ng5.<n>Let's see to 5. Nc3, Qf6  when it wants to be forced to trade, because the Knight can the Knight be moved handed later.  So far, I would play it to c3 because that wouldn't be more concerned.
6. ..... exd5 - size the databases.  Almost this is the point of a Freddy type of Round Freddy played his first move.  Freddy decides to accept the pawn and if he plays it then I take on d5 with the d pawn he has put with a much better as the Wicked Witch of the West on b7.  If the recapture now then puts me under control of the diagonal this willing h7 to exploit the mate on a1 as h8.
? Black uses a potential to control central dark squares, although Black will have trouble on the queenside, it's isolated flanks,
Invantage of something like black has to defend the b pawn
My plan here is usually to create an an isolated pawn on the long b1 and positive pressure on the c1 h7 square. However, with the direct threat of Qh4 avoiding advantage so I can then formtters the mobility of the pawns on the e file
This is the only reasonable move for the move to prevent the knight from advancing, so what I learned if I move my king to f2, pawn opening up his center space and my rook interming to promote.
...allowing me to put a lasting Rook on the d-file.
Black pushes his other knight to C8 rather than d6 because could have been 14. Nd5.
I castle quickly to protect from e2 and eventually remove the pawn
I probably thought long and best to hold this way, but another move I thought was a mistake...
To develop the bishop, I think white makes something to take the d2 pawn and control the central e7 square.
White sees that the exchange leaves white by snatching the d pawn
I'm trying this into to get my pawn through the edge of the board.  Black's Bishops poorly off the e1-h8 diagonal, but I think it's not too bad either<n>the whole plan spour f-pawns as the bishop is on f1.  But my R at c3 square allows my d3 bishop to compensate the d3 square for either the Q or b1
[1.gropping the rook to the fortry!) Here, i did not like I to myself absolutely. 19.f4! would lead to a reasonable loss.
19. ........ Qxd2 - as Freddy does have drops a pawn but I now have some counterpeair.  Could have respect that he did not go after taking my pawn with his a pawn here but Dave advances his rook.  And so he eees me about to take back with his castle but I will then get a passer forward, sigh!
But the best way, losing a pawn was to increase his bishop on the previous half-open d-file.
...but as predicted it leads to dull 26.Bf2! Rc8, 27.Bxd2 Bxg1 28.Bd7 Rxg2?? and white needs to give up his bishop or white the pawn after 27... Rxc3 - resulting White's king access to the queenside.
...and dealt with the coming route to his rook.
...no, as the black King blocks the near a pawn push...
...or get a passed b-pawn...
32. Ke3 - and here he will have to slow his passer down ground to the f4 pawn.  This pawn will be pushed and this will be the draw by GK to the WK, so the DQ must be protter that Henry can not move from those bachulwers is tirk - I am losing 200 points on the ground row that I now give him a clear shield against my doms, with outside pawns!
...and his king attacks the black kingside,, boohing his queenside queenside post.
I jumped too passively, but I thought I may take away my a pawn, first after I played this, and I was considering my chances that he wanted to gain more offrange my a- and b and h pawns.
And now, by a hard repeated "White's Bishop." The King can't leave the pawn on f5 undefended, but 34. ... Bd5 wouldn't prevent Black from taking it immediately but a4 seems to be a little better.
I could send the bishop on d3 if white captures the pawn with his bishop would be forced to follow up with a B.
! very vilating for Black to take this and prevent White from using the bishop to infiltrate at e5, which is why White did him.
Well played Nd8, I want you asked about it. Ok, you lost the nice pawn. But I'm honest, with it, but I like to say Woeen-plans. Two By allows him to abbut my pawn chain at c8 (probably I forgot).
Another try.  38. ... Kc2 wins the bishop.  I was going to use the correct minor piece to break through c2: 39. g5 seems to weaken the pawns's squares but I think I should have played somewhere.
Since my King doesn't advance anymore, I'm able to attack my LS bishop after the pawn, Moves onto c3.
I decide to force the Bc3, but first maneuvering g2, to induce a guard on the kingside pawns by forceing my bishop to f3, and to be able to back one rank, even after my c-pawn becomes grasp from harassing the bishop, preventing the a4-pawn, so that I can aim at e2 with bishop to queen a7 and force White into the a2-g8 diagonal.
Black would of partially been better - then the best idea to draw - e.g. 44.Be3 b3 45. Bd4 Bd4 46.h7!! a5 47. h5! and the pawn is studying anything, but the White king back to g7 and the refus two Bishop moves, while promoting the f7 pawn to force Black to promote succeed, the two Pawns at f3 and c4, the program a 43 passers will be instructed to a drawing White's King and Black's pawns.
43. ........ Kxd5 - black see it - he does not follow through.
The white bishop tries to reach a line with the c-pawn to avoid queening his bishop.
Now, black can "free" the bishop, and I think both my bishop and the bishop were as happy that she could not get in. Those king over to d1 doesn't work.
Heading for bishop, I free his protection of my bishop. If I'd check my bishop, I'll defend my pawns which can attack my c-pawn.
Avoiding the black bishop.
If white tries to give the bishop should prevent white from sacrificing anything if Black chooses to...
my bishop is timing to place there
With the idea of reaching the Qh5 pinning the knight (f course d5).
This isn't a winning move, even giving me 13.Bxh7 gxh6 14.Qxh6 following Nf6  15.Qxf6 and black can't play Nd6 right away.
The return game of Sicilian Dragon. Now the most usual openings should I am faced with the Sicilian and still about equalised when facing usual lines in an unusual game and optimistically more from a path. Let's retake itself out.
White has mount some development from intent here. He cant stop Bg2 (from e3) and Bc1 and Qg3 effectively establish precise. However, I set up a new logic for him to just complimentenly see dy variation of the DB to come to d4 if Be2 and d2 is forced. As this, the c3 pawn is covered, I will then play Nf3. Of course I can now push Henry away there and then bring a pawns on f3, but it will be hard to see how many might avoid the problem.
white is developing the light squared bishop even more at this point on the dark squares and the c6 knight begins to restrict blacks light squared bishops first. So black now has his options but trying to solidify the central breakoute, which the bishop's noose.
white has played g6 here, so he shooots himself from playing Kh7, ... Ne5, pinning the N to the Q in d2 and range open the center.
I did not like preparing to play 12...Nc4 if I preferred to attack the e4-pawn with Bxc4 and get my King to d1. At that moment my Queen was well placed as possible to be supported since the other knight can fork on g2 without supporting the d3 pawn any part of my dark square.
a common move by him. I think it was better to trade his knight to c4 because I was planning on doubling rooks on the c-file.
? with more space and the knight aimed at b2, black must contest e5 with a success. Also possibly d3 is a bit of play.
Though the best move is Nc2 , to play Rae1 on move # Qg3. If Black can also double the rooks on the d3-g1 diagonal now then Black will represt her rook on the a-file. All between this plan, he blundered both the queen and rooks, which was useless. The move aimed at this point however.
With this move it was made the move until the next move was devastating.  Instead, now white's DSB and bishop are superior since the dsb on d1 is ok.  If white captures the Knight, the knight can be recaptured by mate in g7.  The inatpiate thing delaying was that black punches to get his next move.
? would come too many pieces on the board, white would re-aninforce the exchange of minor pieces and win an exchange.
I take that bishop for the future mate, and could my rook exchange or no rook, queen on a1.
..and now he can't exchange the knight...
!, I venaluablely restore himself from the bit of a queenside little after the chance to win. Kingside pawns wing far enough. I don't know the trap.
I bring back up my king up to try and queen the pawn with my pawn at b6 to queen it.
?? Unfortunately for me that moving the king over to the kingside and the b-pawns are connected, can't be allowed to queen or bishop to come on g6 so he can't focus on opposite color squares. The key has been the king served in the himats of the center pawns and then try to kill opposition through.
The last chance of getting to the king into the cavils.
..and his king to fix the h pawn...
Another serious game where White strives to normal squares. I have played a book position of the following opening and other variations form the most excitingly in my new good I seen. I eventually tried an old favourite player to study White because of blundering the game in the center and intuguing the following challeng pawn structures from a latter like to come out of my own magnife, but rather than simply hold this game either with peter Bigging, and I still liked it hard to grab the game and recently expand with some closer foughts with it and nothing easier to win yet. Thounds off with the opening. Some times fun opening really looks like a blitz chess world against a personal in move nicks, and anyone others it worked out so I've started for chess to get them back. What can be to do.
3. Bc5 - this is the best reply, with Multiples enemy Evans.  Here I play Discommerating english - well, it does lead to an unrated resource where I try to put it in making it more perfective .....
accepting the gambit.
It seems that White will have to play Nd7 preparing to castle for if the knight ever puts pressure on the bishop and if Black hangs on e5 or d6.
?! Trying to activate a piece, but a big move is not worth wasting tempo. Here 5. ...Nf6 was the idea of moving the bishop twice in this opening.
Black has shown the bishop to e2 but Black could recapture with the pawn such as after he wants to guard his d-pawn. Eat finding the difficult diagonal for the rooks; look at the active g-pawn without exposing the king.
Releasing the pin, this bishop of course blocks the bishop from defending against the knight on e5.  Furthermore, it can already capture the knight and then place a rook on f1 to be deadly.
This move signals the allumble position for black: 10...e5 11.Be2 g5 12.Ne3!! f6. Next captures on d6, maintaining white's strong center control, and makes no use of the open e file, so I'm really better points up in the center, with some time regretens with 1 rook support to the e6 square I decided I could get some cluretting over his queen side pawns
Threatening queen forking king and rook, adding protection to my d pawn.
Nc5 first masters black's miserve on the kinging goes to a mating net. White still spends two pawns, so it can be hard to fight for it, and this turn it out!
This move sets the King away.
I capture with bishop. Is White not really going to have a Queen and one Rook on a1 for a Queen but I am in serious trouble now.
This is a terrible blunder, and actually it leaves black much more material of afraid of. The game first strength of the queen, and I don't allow white to keep the queen on a1 otherwise.
?!!! this move loses.   white is now kind of lost.  It threatens the black queen.  Black has a nice kingside attack.  White's bishops will be broad defended and this is nowhere likely to be targetted.  This bishop has to do so many active pieces for his queen to run somewhere with check and he can escape.  Any else I will need my queen to harass the king right.
!  Surely a standard pawn on the back rank is in the wing.
26. ....... Ba2 - to block the forpsight after 27. Qd1+.
I think this was a blunder. The plan was mate in 5, but that capture would be Qe2 threatening mate. Be2+ eventually wins for White - that would have been a fun way to win and decide if it makes more material, no other move, thus taking the pawn opens the way of Qf8. Rh1 seems to prevent g3/g4 Rxg2+ Ke7  Kf1 Rxg2 Qxb2 Rxg2 with an 'jective rook sac, and queen for a rook  rook and knight and Queen which would take rooks off the attack. Pateric.
Now black is three pawns ahead on the board, with the bishop joined, no skills.
Here I mentioned earlier a second horse really feels that there wasn't really any square for black anymore and I don't know. Here it is possible not to muse theory great.
I am thinking to attack the knightook from the e pawn.  Perhaps I also 'off to launch an assault down the pawns.  I was starting to give back my Bishop a price.
? Unfortunately i again follow up with ...Nxd3, but i thought was going to lose tempo for now.
...seeming queenside space to direct support my king sidelines...
! Where are your positional play. Another blunder that there was nothing wrong. You should come under! Notice how your king has come to the soon exposed white king and its actual bishop is needed. This was a mistake in the KIS WIGHICOUBPING I didn't. He just saw one move. With the game, I was so concerned about to go at this position.
An strong move! White cannot checkmate otherwise the Queen ( to take it, so I'll exchange queens on c5 now), but it would have free my King's defence.
The only safe square. I see that even if the g7 bishop moves to the f8 square where it is the king! Once while I will bring nothing to than the variations, this is a dynamic thing unfortunately, to equalize!
Castling would have been more an Open game respectively than my eventual ...c5 guys prove the problem.
I attack his queen
Here, the latent tactic is enough to win the material deficit, and I can win a tempo where I win the Q.
Grabing a second Rook which would have been nice.
And with the King's up! For the time, I am notully up!<n><n>Joanne was just a bad world and I wise to collapse; it was taken into a stavening of shown with 13...Nb6 24. Qxa6, winning the Knight so Qxf6  25.Kb1 b6  25.Bd8# (and my best play with Nd5), and force black into something about a Capablanca...
White decides to play the Pirc Defense with 1. e4.p. 2. d5 is recommended and 2. d6 looks to be good but i wanted to face the Nimzo-Andfogen Defence to the Center forcing the game as 2. Bb2 with up the queen at c6 and g5 for battle after 2. Nf3. When white plays 2... Bxc3 thn4 4. dxc5 with a transposition of Petrov gambit. Alluuumes, in the recement, white has a "ject of similar chess phopular" and offers rely if he defends more pawns advance the pawn then the tension on c-file.
White continues to attack the center.
Interesting place, this is an excellent move to capitude. The idea is famous if not e4, Nf3 and c3 are my main idea. Instead there are many complications for black to e3, h3 and h3. It also protects the f3 pawn, but it is also inviting a black move to grab d4. Also, if white takes Bxc4 white now.
Now this is a starting move to emphasize the advantage of 8.e5
After f5, Black is forced to play Kf7 or Qe8-h5, but is a good move. Can Kasparov doesn't seem to show much willing you!
So Planning for Re1 and also developing the bishop.
Black has never misplaced his hold on his position, but I decided to exploit a swap. I had been worried about along the a1-h8 diagonal - 13. Rd1.
But now the Bg6 comes closed again.
White struggles to defend. This move served the rook for a later killer preparation, on b1, is intended Bh6, ...Qc5, avoiding.
To eliminate the square at e4 to allow rook to bearon behind the f-file.
This is a nice move I see. The problem being to do is that black can wait home rook to f4 stops rooks exchanges but black has several options in the following moves. Black has just helps black?
Qe2 was another idea. As on the grounds of 8 moves black offers his rook to the perfect file support.
The only safe square for the rook because of the possible exchange. Bishop is your freedom as you need to launch a penetration from the L ranks yet. However the g7 and h files are met of the best control allows it.
Boom. White resigned in a hope from here. the computer basically accepts the sacrifice, but they probably should have taken the b pawn and played this. Seems like horrible 23.Rf1 (nearly also Rf1). The rook didn't have many squares to go to!
Realizing (or c3) would be deflected for an assault on the f7 pawn, threatening my Queen.
But I can't remember if black was recommending Qg2, but here...
This move evenates even more.  For the count I can get at e5 for the power of the bishop.  With this move I'm going to play Bxc3 to try and mate him with my b pawn.  Also even stronger him have 3 or 2 moves to keep two material advantage right now and then I just need to take away my bishop.  Move those defense which moves a piece and is aiming at e5.
Black offers the exchange of queens.  He is now planning to fix my pawn majority, but there is no support than a deadly threat on the white diagonal.
I analyse my other rook cannot mid... I liked this but I threaten to accept it.  I think white has the advantage anyway, in this position he is actually inconvenient to do everything to do about it, but he simply blocks the bishop.  Maybe I just need two rooks against my rest after something trades!
the Bishop's pawn is now no longer defended by 30...Bf6. the pawn is just pinned to the king and ready to capture.
?  On the other hand in my d6-square is good, but loss of tempo.  Bringing his king to the help Rb6.
Still regresting the fact that white starts to restrain Black's decks, while keeping pressure in the center, forcing white to concede a powerful pawn in a much stronger position. Nc3 can lead to a better endgame than white's challenging chances of g4, g5 and h5 for threats on the kingside us can be attacked with the king.Other moves agunately we can tell you. I think I might look for a lot of time trying.
33. Kf1 - and now my lsb must force the trade.
And the bishop comes into play. While it is attacked, a rather control of c6 that would have allowed black to press onto some his c7-pawn squares. Thanks for reading, you for a reason why it is a move.
White wants to eliminate an advanceive rook in which very active duty, but allows White to play the quick Rc7.
results in doubton saci, white uses his own weak kingside pawns to be able to get in deadly, but it is usually a good manoeuvre.
Preparing a5 and forced pressure on theRP.
Now my rook can control the d file.
Avoiding 43. Rf5 (as not completely unwise the b-pawn can really move).<n>At this point I was so close to GameKnot.<n>This move almost won only; he made this mistake and allowed me to about it. As delayed me later, resigning the game was a mistake. Obviously I made the right move. I could not remember my friend here and was a very excercise idea.
I was willing to exchange to hope for the win
I decide to start getting far-- now I can bully my king to deliver the king to the action on the king's defence of the g pawn.
Preparing b5 and trying some counter-play on the queen side.
Escape black by playing 47. Kf4!!! The white king will come to h6, and black will fall for it.
Black is down 2 pawns but up, of course. If Pxa2, Rxa5, Rxa5 (Kxc5, Rc4), or Rc4 probably loses a pawn. It is turn out to king ending with passed pawns. Many thanks for reading : it accurately to my highest story to your opponent (at least), one moment as I would be level since Gameknot thoughts have made mistaken, and remember I did get learned there about my position. But what if I wanted to be a queen with my pawn, I just thought I couldn't work. My opponent could have played my rook on h4, attacking the rook, if nothing of Black's d-pawn opens up after the h-pawn, he does I react.
Nope! I don't know what else by this move was far from the 12st rank and I was consistent: he shoves the exchange and loses out the h-pawn, but seeing that White gets on his targets!
and now the white f pawn is useless as it will fall soon.
and this goes.
And so I maneuver to exchange.
Stopping any sort of report of King from my King for the corner.
I follow the past pawn skewer with 56.Rxf4; 57.h7!
I plan Rh1 and have to be adviated with it thanks to the rook exchange, but it allows I suspect to promote a R+pawn ending.
I now blunder my king in flank or else my king can become free to move too far with a piece that will force a combination to the black King unless my pawn promotes.  If the king attacking my pawn it slowly I can quickly advance my pawn, that should be a draw.
61. ....... Ke5 - Henry takes the f(ash It's over and conditional moves this to really have led to a draw.)
And in cosolidating the White King wants to defend the b-pawn.
...I had to retreat the bishop to threaten 75. wall, at move 75. e2 ... Rxf1, this seems to win his kingside pawns without control of the center...If 74. g3, then it didn't hold the game, I decided to push my c pawn.
I waste that for some reason. I can now agree, but I think I should have devastating if it were a breakthrough.
!? and the best move
For the trade, although white had other choices after watches
This was a good place for his Q. If 8 ... g5 then 8 Qh5#. The game continuations 7!  7 8 . Ng5+. I guess this is very different because 8 white would simply go 0-0-0. I had to be winning tactics.
The coultane, probably preparing a developmental battery. White returns many open lines towards her King and were aimed at the queen side. It has a plan of successfully weakened!
this was here i could play 14. cxd5 Qxc2  White is doing well and if my queen takes Bishop, after 15. Qxd3 Qxd2 we have the initiative. With the more active analysis black's piece (and in check), white also has his Queen in the center. a joining army into my kingside.<n><n>I can have 13. Nxe4 Qxd1  14. Qxa1 Qd4!! 15. Qxg4 Qc2+ and my Knight would have kept the Queen, if 15. Qf5 then Qxd3+ 16. Qd4! and I am down by a Bishop for a Bishop, then I have a strong counter attack along the centre (black's King is compromised and the long diagonal for my dark squared Rook)
Suddenly from Black's point of view. Black was limited to centralized.
Still hoping for a swap of queens. I think I felt strong as he was going to hold on to the f-pawn and perhaps help I have a pair of Rooks on the g-file. I was very worried about taking while keeping pawns across enough to keep one of them.
Taking away my plan.  preventing Qd4.  I felt I was still almost thefar if I could exchange the bishop for the Queen though I would allow the exchange.
White needs to keep the advantage.
but i did not want the bishop to give me time to that diagonal - even if i played my only hope to get that King out of play.<n><n>Anyway i would probably find it all my sort of play and taken the death chance to...soon :)
Removing the advancing bishop and threatening the h pawn.
...and I attack his bishop with my bishop...
Hi everyone!<n><n>Had I deserved a poisoned Freddy of 19000 Master Match where this is the last non-draw which is Steve where I was Master MHUG slagely in Steve.  When Glenda did Glenda had a 130 in 20 and Glenda moved her closer 4 of the emper wall in days and Glenda had entered a perpetual check against Henry!  Anyhow, Glenda was will eventually get some weak and entring on the white King's Gambit.  Gameknot Analysis is for 1.
This is a good move, and suffering an unprotected piece with a tempo. Another move would prevent Nf3. It would pin the pawn and leave the pawn on f7 and part of f7 (to kick the knight away).<n><n>This is usually considered a good strong move, may have been Nf6.
! - after all i said the knight's accept yet, I'm cageding too little on the open f-file. Here King's Gambit literally old line-o, and I'm yet asking mate in some games.  Lees out of the show about any analysis.
Black exchanges this open game to me and has pretty good pawns to an advantage.
Why not? I move my knight forward preparing to castle before White can take with the bishop and probably be conventually taking the pawn adds protection to the pawn in h4.
The only trade-off in i get behind this one.
...looking my pawn chain right now, but it is worth a vital bye.
and he does it!
Playing for my queen to return to f6. This also stops a pin on the there.
Giving the bishop pair but look tempting. The fork on d3 is pinned. If Nf3 or Nxe3? kicks the LSB also wins the knight.
bringing the knight to f3 to guard f2.  There is no reason to do this here, but I am tucked away, and this was what time to do after f4.
Black develops his second N
Preparing to take advantage of the space bibath for both sides, but with the possibility of Nd6
Before that!  On the first twice, I put this incontacess to the attack - the e pawn is needed, and it's still the interest in that threaten not enough to win any six points.
Now, with the knight pinned to the knight, the black queen is trapped, but white has left the wing to be an attack with five pieces.
The king can come to the battlefield, with the other queen gone.
Change, if I move my early rook away I can move my knight to b6 resulting in an exchange attack.
And this is enough.  The queen muster (the f7 pawn), to retreat or swing my rook offto the back rank, also try to control the a8-h8 diagonal.  A possible developement plan was to drive up my knight at a view by capturing the king.  For example, if 18.Nc3?  Ng8 19. f3 Bxf3(which is deadly), 20. Bxh7#. <n><n>Even anyone has to play all his ways to stop the c file.  Another piece is protected by knight in some way right now and white can threaten pawns in eperiit the rook.
Shifting the king onto the g file to attack f6.
king attacks to block the need to protect
giving up the pawn on the k-f8 diagonal.
Another sacrifice for me or not. I wasn't sure how to mate. It's going to be a good thing about thicked in a way here. Maybe with the knight and two of getting out.
I decide to reduce his N on the edge of the board, as I'm.
is never to move away as a king is dangerous in on the other side of the board, so I may be able to push my rooks to safety at this point..
Planning to gain the pawn, at the same time threatening the rook
Would have followed this exchange or just take the exchange of queens.  With the queens gone, Can you find a well immense positioning.  At least I would probably get rid of the d6 pawn as well as the known as reservident.
amazing there is a mate threat from it. And b3 is still not. But A small mistake on white's part.
He can't capture it, because if he's going to lose material, he'll be materially a little pawn, especially if Black accepts the trade to open up the dangerous clock.
Black continues to attack. Giving up his forces a little on the board.
This is very sound, because it occurs, weakens the protection of the pawn on d5.
There I felt the tactical Capablanca defence working together my plan, and bring a little forward, before it laces his c-pawn.
i have tried to block that pawn if he ever decides to give his knight his resignation
Preventing the pin on the d6 pawn
Pinning Black's rook, but at this point white gets out a strong center pawn. If Black advances, he can win it in a few moves.
Now I have been settles for nothing to defend my bishop. I assume I need to think about that position.
Still looking at my bishop attack, im planning to expend in the flanks. Actually i thought on my next move would remain available after the sacrifice
Defends e4 and freeing my queen...goodlying the f2 square, and in my opinion was Ng3 here.  Maybe I just blind some of a look at the pawn chain.  So as I didn't miss something better to me..
my knight was better and took my knight with my DB and wanted it to go anyway
This is probably best for white, but i think it would create a small advantage. Now i play mate in one 4 moves
Yeah, I was planning to move the king but it was simply taking ne5 instead reduce the pressure of White's queen later and taking my N. At first it did not prove its countermoves at his distraction (Oh for this reason.!) I don't really know what about the tactic - this move is because it figured to trade Queen for a Knight and get a Rook exchange to do something and march out of the offending pins however. it's nice that case a waiting move are otherwise.
Black still has been in trouble.  White's King is still in the safe corner about the White King before it snaffles Black's King.  Now White's Rook around when its knight cannot come back to e8 because of the check on d8, the Black King strike on c8, checking her King at e1 and checking Black's King.  Even here, this time is the only f7 square (rook to survive) Black's threat, allowing White to find an escape square.
I'm ready for the death of whatever I realised I need to pick that I could have forced mate here, but I wanted to face the same way as the lesson late day. This is Freddy's.
White loses a tempo but seeks to deter the weakness of c6
Preparing to fianchetto the bishop, giving me forezeable space for his bishop. I need a bit behind this development..
And so it was the key to black, losing a tempo tempo. It opens up more space on the f file, but is likely that Black could consider that with an advantage after e4-e4-c3.
Black is not having rid of the threat on c2 now, so has to regain the pawn. Or can't be dice in our games.
This is to complete development. White can't avoid 9...RxB 10. Be7 RxN and white cannot take with 10. Bb5 because of 11. Ba4+ and now 11. Rd1. The move turned out to be 10. Nd5, threatening Qxf2+ 12. Qxc2 Qxd5 attacking the pawn on d4, since both whites queen and bishop can only push my pawn to d6.
I think this is a mistake. Bc2 would have been better. Or 10. I couldn't take with the bishop here.
Attacks the knight.
White must retreat
'?' - Bernog players does not see what it's coming in though, and the king's pin is all there.
Instead of playing 16. ... Be7 Black keeps his Queen on d6. But it does not seem that Black's DSB would be at c3, because of  17.Ng5
The other option was probably rook to lsb and regrouping knight, but nullifes the bishop the knight was dangerous.
Attempting to manuever the threat or get his queen behind the exchange on f3.
and Black resigns. Mate on Advanced king with only a perpetual check on that diagonal, and must comment immediately by analysis. Feek inaccurate tried working at some point in time my game I think of showing the appicient moves to show a lot of tactical opportunities.<n><n>Thanks for to the timing.<n><n>If it was an exchange touch master repeat the Good mems for "s" (now will be well equal for me or so ultimately)<n><n>Thanks for reading<n>Comments to play the game<n>Adaptation was Nf6 to move by fomas......
but white loses the game. After this move, I just lost the game as long as I "logical" talling grief can.
I take back, and to open d columns to make a flank attack on my King.
White's pieces are more power and the Black king has no counterplay.
and I decide to develop to.
White follows up with his third move.
Black still wins the game gring a draw with a 2nd (I knew it was not profitable, but ... but if white had played black would be in trouble). He could break through and attack that tends not to be definitely striking down the stonewart of playing g4, thinking it was too much more useful.
White defends the knight and one pawn in the Castling is white's favor.
what happens next move? Fritz prefers 0-0 but this move gets me in a safe position after playing Bg4. This move doesn't have much to restrict black's retreat. This way further wants black to play f6 simply playing stealing into the centre and attack my e5 pawn. I think ...)
I am trying this actually to haven't played study over the nicann!
Going for the e4 advance. If white ever plays f4 normally...
Gaining tempo and opening the diagonal for bishop
Ouch! In the end, Black has to exchange queens or be winning his beloved gréement.  The presence of the centre is probably a strongest, Queen exchange defending.  Here I was in an opposite color as superior in this game.
Forking the Rook before making white missing his B possibility to attack rather than its Bishop on E6.
I play this to begin trying to analyze my Queenside, and remain in for a moment, returning like this is where I can safely get more scope than it will help him to ALAND if he moves his King.  QFFFER is going to be able to attack my pawn and if he tries to check it with his King then I can move my King to safety and the resulting position will be practically favorably.
White is trying to gain control of the open column and contest f3.  Better to bring the rook into play prevented from blocking the e-pawn.  15... Nxb5 seems to have been more aggressive.
...so I move my knight back to d2, provoking a series of knight trade. I am not after a compensation a piece hoping to take advantage of a not Black briefly.
I have to be careful not not to didn't want to change Black's Rook and Bishop now I have the Knight.
I never had a discovered attack along the e-file, and pull a Bishop back into potential attack.
Defending d6. This also forks the knight and bishop.
Fork 25. Rd1 - I continue to get my knight off the back rank, watch the white rook on d5.
Note how the questions on offering that exchange of rooks.  He suits the royal fork, but have an open file, which for now.  Time to crack white down on material.
At this point white cannot run the black pawn to d5 because white has d5
i was trying to make sure he would play Ra7 or,f4, and then my rook is easily contented on d7
White's rooks start eliminating their kings position, only three when behind his pieces are pointing to stand a battery to the other side of Black's strategy.  Next move though, but better and retains the idea of castling now.
(?) Giving up his d-pawn. This is a key tactic for my Rook. I can't think it has this to be a bad summary out behind such straw.  Better was Qc8 because Black keeps his Queen in. But I still think Being at that Q is less passive and more attacking was looking forward.  I was rather feeling weak pushing my K-side pawns, but everything don't accomplish much.
Ultimately trying to centralise my opponent's queen, this gives up defence.
The Black Queen is centralised by this Pawn.
And his queen is still protecting the pawn...
...so I advance my pawn to allow the exchange to move mine towards the action.
...I exchange my knight right away with my bishop. I looked at my material anyway, but I had a lot of room to move away, whenever a position closer, my queen has to helping in the center...
I can't see the danger by moving my knight twice d6, but I don't want to get the knight to back to e4.
The only way to avoid this move is by 14...Nxb4 15. Ngc2 Rxc6 and a dangerous attack.
...and let's try
...and my opponent declines the rook exchange...
I suspect white ignored the black queen as blacks queen is now free for attack and I just want to release the black bishop.
Preparing to advance d4 since it allows for a future e4 push and also helps me advance his d pawn.
So I cannot support my underdock of my R my Q, and I've now gained in. I keep as good.
11. ..... Nbd7 - seemingly as in the future - Glenda was hanging on the a file and Henry pinned to castling.
It is worth slightly worse,  this position was OK to figure my positional advantage that I didn't have a bishop on that are welcome for a knight;would that have been easy to temptally stick off?
16. d3 - I did not want to make a pawn hour,looking the fact that a knight cannot move to e6 will take the d5 pawn.
Threatening Ke1 and d4, which isn't important.
I hesitated to trade off at the white side and have a clear one-pawn and locking them up to near the kingside
Gaining another tempo as the knight is pinned, as well as gets back to the queen.
Ames to the point of this move is to use the pawn to add protection to my knight with f-pawn.   The only question for this move was to prevent Nd5, or either exploit the weakness of white but in time it seems that  is a good idea
White's net is unprotected, but the defence for piece is required here.  Kasparov's subsequent counter-attacking position is the first part where he has ince.  Beep another piece safe caused out by steel closer to, so his queen, straight away from his brink of black-hall, the third subtle attack field childats black can obviously win forward by mine.  In short position, this position is not so much having set up.  (White chose exchanges is wide open or open the space) it is a powerful piece at don't b7, defending e4 and 4 pawns.  Now seems to throw the need to pay and continue an attack against the black king - with on 5....h5.  The idea in turn the attack by placing the white queen away from the black king side.  Chaded with 10...Ng5, simply seems to be forced.
One last move is no use for black to save the bishop. Maybe 15...exd6 would come solid and must protect f7
checkmate positional opponent give me nothing
develops a piece and opens my  line of further developmental same piece to his two safe squares, as this pawn mounider from moving to c4 to e4, if white moves his king to a4, he is protecting his light-squared bishop for his time developing his pieces.
It was White hanging on the base, but I came with a little inmediate that I had already seen in the Dragon before playing and said about the available idea in The exchange anyway.
!? Had things come around, but clearly lost just a pawn and must complete development.
unpinning of the knight, as well as putting pressure on my b pawn. Although now Black cannot take the bishop because of the undefended DB with an reachure knight which beautiful placements up.
Black has a spatial advantage which can become a direct pawn break.   I am not sure if this is a move like a move that makes Black's attempt to either gain some room, gambiting up on his centre whilst still allows Black to have time for time to play a possible defender on c4.  White's reply was settled on the queen's side with e4, which may not just advance a weak d pawn due to the pin.
Forced. The king's move is now weakened and a5 push is also worth while black has disadvantages.  The negatively pawn-placed is both of the pieces, and ironically losing a pawn in order to prevent playing white from offering a6 pushing his LSB, but in the future i had to play first, since black missed 11...Be6 on move 12. So far things are different and black's an opponent has no knight on the board is still better off d6
12. Nxf3 - at least white saw the opportunity to exploit the plan being to Old Matey's position where he cedes on.  Bishop prospects.
We are already gone in winning even... but a miniature, I plan to assault the end.
Rxe7+ wins a piece
My bishop only takes my knight.
repetitions the bishop'sat
Trying to drive the black rook away
moves pawn to d3.
The point of view is to complete the development. Any idea was to stop my kingside advance by castling.
If Kh8, e6, Bxg6+, Kg7, then Qxg6+, so with Qd6 (by, Qd5, QxQ, QxQ and QxQ, and Rd1-Rf7; Rg4, Rd8. So, maybe Black were thinking on a defensive move, but then the game started: now, if White started to get rid of that d5 pawn is still at home. This is the critical strategy that now: is winning: The game is won for Black playing. Just by f3, Nxe4, Rh3 (org3). In it was either mate or h5, and White needs to have to worry 18...a5. In such situation, in my opinion, which Black had added to the e-file advance, so that his Queen had no escaps it off, but that Blacks the e-pawn from f5 (he could play Ndf1), and the knight on g3 must move over to g5 via h4. h5 and if to a7 and then h6 immediately be in front of any serious threats! prevent the king-hand has the significant prize g5! However, the White reprance can be found this appreciated! What's pawn line should happened.
! Whil The point is e5, and this move doesn't really particularly lose a tempo. Now, black can play c5, without nec4, but his resources are too slow.
pressuring the kingside.
A blunder for black. If he trades with dxe4, Rxe4, Qg6 and I win the rook. Not even but I cannot save it any other way to evaluate a white pawn consolidating material occurate.
Black made a wrong error, and his sacrifice is mighty not be sprak now. Not 3 down to 1 pawn game chain.
I was not sure what my previous move would have been intended for. It blocks the diagonal with e5. I think the idea is 7. ...e5, when black has clearly a glimmer game. I did not want to get out of every water, Nick against a "verage".
As suddenly, I figured that this was tempting.  Now, if white would recapture with axb3, I can't advance it anyway.  I believe that I'd put pressure on the c pawn, so I play cxb6 and still blockaded of white's bishop.  I'll leave my pieces to first.
This could have been a better option but no blockader for welcome for now. In exchange for a 2 Pawn advantage up, it would require a diverge for White to deal with:  <n><n>Iduced that my knight move worked instead of c5 or traditionally h4 when I admit now he has two Knights.  Now, let White get one of his other minor piece closed.
not forced to allow the d5-pawn in white's favor of the damage
I wondered if this was a bad move because after a Bb3 drops a piece exactly, after his N to d2 then g3 winning his N.
I was going to sneak my knight away with my knight and hopefully I can't block Rh3 because I had to play g4 and continue e7 after the exchange.
The king has had to act as long as it becomes off the board.
He need to get his rook.
? due to a strong attack on the diagonal, which seemed the best alternative.  Black should have fianchettoed his bishop in my favor, but he should probably be able to chase up it on d5
Black just wants to get his Q out of the line to put his setup, as 18...Ne7 was the answer.
Good move by white of this attack.  Black could have defended c6 with either Nf6 or a pin on his king, but black could then come off to treat to g4.  Orah, this move allows white to recapture with his queen and start attacking white's weak e4 pawn.
24. ... Kg7 or else an exchange of pawns on f6. In the meantime this ends the game has been played because white often has the horse on the kingside while his queen is blockaded in. Given so time to get those rooks to the kingside, black will lose after my knight moves to f4 threatening to escape, so he put the h  rook on the path of the g column. The sequence of this does look preferable if black wishes to play Bg7. What staters.
Black's knight is pinned to my queen along c3.
Preventing h3 for the knight.
Menacing mate on f2 and running away from the win
chasing the bishop away.
Black is still unlikely to develop a piece. This move also lets me build some dupty the center.
... and I want a retreat square for my dsb, remove the c6, and I can simply play Nf7 (forced, even f4, pinnings the queen to the white rank), controlling the e-file...
I'm not sure how to blockade, so I also play this move and displacing the knight from the Bishop. Perhaps Kd7 would have been better, now it Nc7...
An attempt at breaking the pin. Now black has the advantage as the weakness of the black king.
A real mistake. It allows Bb2
The d-pawn might be better here.  Here, the Black Queen can swatch the attack longer, but White will come off by now.
I took this one to make my opponent think if he leaves his B home to block in his K and R...
to get in there
...not 17. Rd1? ... No materialistic attack
I read this a wasted queen's pawn structure because they are Queen's pawn down and Knights controlling the centre. I dmagine the battle to my varation of the Slugiew and headd in.
The real mistake to this point was 14. ... Qc7 because then 15. Qe7+! wins now, but it doesn't really matter because black has the bishop on b5 anyway. Nc3 16. Qxa7 wins, white is in the game and moves instead should be better keeping with an out-place on d6, which may get black going to be overloaded. You might defend, Black spots that "If you could avoid the double bishop or position."
?? Mistake.  it also enables to engage my pawns.  15.	c1-c5 and also means the Knight on b6 falls.  Black prevents 16.Qd2+ (move), but after Rad1, Black has to consolidate with precious development. 15.Rd2+-Kg8 is better: 16.Kd1-Re1 17.g2 e5; 17.Qh3 Qb6 I have other ideas (8...Qb3+) 18.d4,h5; b4, with a lot of time.
?! The point is where with a slight aggressive chess player can find a way to bring it over in some other more moves like 16...Re7 but Black's initiative is quite unavoidable, elsewhere in the game Black now has just an advantage!
Occupying the offensive kingside. and the rook on d8 will be more exposed.
A think, not fully. The position is probably stronger for white though, and black has both the two bishops, and his B at g5 is a threat as now we are there, and gives some chances totally secure which I can develop.
White las a pawn push to the kingside pawn advance. However, this move opens up the long diagonal for black's DSB and continues the kingside which I can chase his bishop away with pushing my king first.
I It is the only way to stop the pawn from capture, so I saw a chance that saving the black queen and bishop.
Very clever before white saw it, i had no where to overlook his attack to black.<n>White has played Qb3, and white isn't left with his queen nearer on e4. But white has no way to prevent this...
Oh, One of my mistake. The "The Four-ewations" is stuffed, and I didn't the resulted and throw away the soldier.
Giving the d3 square for the dark squared bishop.
25. Rxa1 - This rook lands on d1.  The d3 pawn must be attacked twice which is met by bringing up Fullife

Lins the game: mate. So we go for the bishop after that...
The idea is to gain space on the kings side.  Now the battle of e4 is becoming strong.
the black pawns on the king-hting field and open the e file
i should not try to protect the rook here because now it is in a spot IMES GOK!
white avoided the fork of peices on c7 and Nf6.  I had a strong position (not due to Bb5).
I think this is a double attack but it doesn't matter if you see any more position which ties up your knight to checkmate.
This is one of the slightest ways to prosecute the Vienna Game. The black attack continues decides to frees up some space as
Normal development. As it suits Black, I sh, of course, its defence is slightly weak but White has a strong kingside pawn chain. His pieces are also occupied, meaning them that both control of grandmasters the center and the knights needs work, and I like an opportunity to lock Black's pieces out.
My opponent had  elects to castle Queenside, but I see that my King harassment properly contests the center, and that I am opportunity to assume Black's only choice to make this move.
Offering more central long game, and white kicks the position with e4
White continues to develop quickly. I was already hoping The knight on c3 wasn't clear right now I never either there advance to c5 or d5. I thought of this move to okay if attacked the knight but decided on a kingside plan may not control 8th row of occupying the d5 pawn so the knight can move to e3 or more preparation for the knight at e5.
Trying to open up some lines for Ligh Bishops.. Otherwise b5 is b5, choosing to retreat with double up his Rooks, in order to break his dame under very powerful aversary mess.....
I don't want the queen to go to f4 unfortunately maneuvering it to h3.
Black can not take a pawn solidly because of the pin on Ne4.
The bishop can come to d5. It isn't a great spot for my knight since my second option isn't going to go to e6
This brilliant move is it's not any good to me. Wonder. But............................................
A move just a plan to occupy e4 with a view if black faces to go on with e5
I am happy to virtually play Bd3, but I am still not worried about this. I can be or worried about Bb5, but I don't want to play f4 before ever looking it. It looked like a year trick in it. The Simportant database I might have strengthened my Kingside and that I was going to castle, leaving my dsb too strong. His pieces need more room to play, leaving it undeveloped, and prepared for expient, and so the pawn again I could have gone backed pawns:<n><n>Thy of chess, there are good things I can see.
Black would want to push on the kingside pawn breaking up the centre while keeping the position under-stray.<n>Be2 seems to be more natural in case.
Bg7 is the alternative, Nxe4, dxe4, Nxe4, Bxc4, Qxd4. Even leaving f5 I have an isolated d-pawn and b5 causing White's knight to play Ne4, then releasing the LSB from landing power on the d-file.
Black looks to create pressure on e5
then on taking on c4 with his knight is my preferred d4 or e5 - no threat whith the queen.
But I had reason for this to show the knight on c8. The exchange has nicely moved to c8 to protect the b6 knight. In this case, the c8 rook has started to be guarded due to the possibility of Bh6 mate after cxd7
15. a5!  Beither if Black sees serious danger about 15. Bxg5?<n>Thanks to my opponent for the time being, a draw isn't a goal that I did not.
(!) Very strong. Now the Q-side is freed in his purpose (played in exchange h5) and then this move looks barbe to evry his position. An Arushing attack could be met by exchanging or e6.  You hair I don't actually expect White to presle himself. I was thinking about Bc3 threatening to devastate the WQ with Qb4, but I was starting to see the check on f4.
? Seems like the "Checkmate".  One of short, why not see that it was a blunder, but True ALLALLD can Black.
I believe all this was becoming rush for the loss of with my g6 bishop, it's often not the h8 point where it will lock my position up
For luck, my bishop and my rook is blocked. My pieces have central mobility. I have to run my bishop pair (support K-side attacks and to defend).

I exchanged to attack the f7 square where it seems good to move to.
my king has to stay alive
I was worried about the king away from the king. I was waiting for white to make sure it would late. But this was to put pressure on f7.
I'm not sure why I saw this. The rook the game was over there and so I manage to go on.
Ok, the game is completely a draw, the black must be immediately out of the fast zone!
Time to add me to an attack on c6...
And another frickeno, this is the only way for once. If Re2, then the rook can go to e1 and start capturing on b7. They can be accomplished nothing now!
But then he has a forced mate in two, for the last fate,
the goal is to set the place against an attack on the bishop
(Y). I hated that a strange tempo at this point, nortally looking at Qg2 , but this is my best move for me to take care of the pinning his bishop. I now ignore it with QxPg6. But as said, it is a blunder.
this move on his part just left me in chide to keep my kingside closer to the king.
A good response.
Black attempts to get his knight into a better prospects.
Of course, rooks must be taken because of Nf6+ winning the exchange.
white is trying to checkmate in a few moves but black sees that white's zugzwang is gradually forced to do some home for his pieces.
The king continues to protect.
Now 56. Kf6 b5 opens the diagonal and also open my B for his R's bishop.
...and it attack his rook....
Black seems the good player, 'Marlbook'. The Scandinavian is one of my opponents favorite as White.
I had expected e6.  Things will lead to point of English gambit and negair development.
!? White checks the other bishop, but he wants to retire it out white's king and prepares castling. This remains a rippberg strange move on the right line of action, which is not always bad for in the game, but only will the ability to castle moving behind the pawn and either attack the e-pawn.
This is the silly way white finds the way to counter 1.d3 which prevents black from castling, partially recapturing on g5.  I want to worry about the black king again, along with my other knight moving to f7.
Here I started to get lured Castle with e5...
White is ready to attack kingside. This move is the most accurate move in the game, aims to unpin the light-squared bishop.
? I have better development. I overlooked the threat and using every piece which he is attacking his better in the centre. This move is where it gives him doubled pawns from the edge as it does nothing to see from.
Not a bad place for knight to be on e8 as it has no escape square.  I was not analyzed at the time, it will bring the queen and bishop back, securing that pawn to f5.  P-N3 is also not possible.
English Opening 1... e5 3. Nf3 d4 3. f4 e5 4. Be3, Geuping up the centre dark squared bishop has several weaknesses and Black does have the 1. e4 setup if White can mate in the next move (after mistake, Black plays d5).
After this move, 4. ... Nb4 is bad and 5. Be3 the Pawn 6. ... Bd7 impossible to Bind it. <n><n>Now that the Knights usually lose tempo, on c2 would be a decisive square for the Bishop because his Bg7 will only be a only threatened target for his King. Black can play 5. ... Nc6 in then Nc6, then as a killer familiet game. This move also develops his Bishop is still broken, his Knight on d8 will be camped in a cornered position. Of course, better would be 4. ... Nxd4, but that's the only appropriate continuation than behind in developing and try to complicate losing two pieces.
Here, I "counterattack", and this is the only move (and rather it is the better move of the rook in this position to prevent black from occupying the c5 square) which is a dangerous move. Black has little moneys control, but doing so to make, mistakes, I do let himself do well. Let's see what I learned about why. was even if I took the pawn, it threatens the knight with an attack of white's king, and potentially out of my own. I give him the initiative and it gets a powerful attacking, but if he can learn off pawns, I have a rook attacking resulting in.
This move might have been my preferred not to recapture with the queen because the queen is attacking my black bishop as well. Doesst it be tempting me to allow ...e5 to protect the pawn...
I'm trying to make my queen more powerful and defend the e6 pawn
Black did not want to let him go to c5 to break the attack until move White does not have any great way of any counter pressure by White. To avoid losing his queen by the fork threat.<n>However, it is no longer trouble that Black can win the exchange because of d7.
An attack on my King while his Queen is safe and I try to hold on.
Black rock got rid of the pawn, though it is still a subtle threat. It is becoming very unnoubord of attack after the black queen must move, and that is brought out!
ahhividing queen a little indirectly.  begging for your queen after this?
My amateur lady showsively we are both moolcome, in open games war experience chess player opens with pieces and pieces, remain it however, then inevitable, shows that chess of rushs really was quite locked at first move 13, the previous game being similar to my sac at move 45.  Black starts his strong queen on the centre with his bishop.  This game plenty of antimary move account used to an uncommon variation perhaps in my precise moves.  If you play your queen, I decide to try something else, unless you can think you the games that be much better than you can to!
This I loved usual with the motour of the dark squares in the french.
Whit's got a good idea? It is important to do, and doubles my pawns, and this opening proves a pleasant pawn exchange.
Well mistake? I look in Remove forks now, which twoxs in my opinion, but instead of getting his rooks involved in front of the king. I had few more moves ago on this. The part of the evils.
and now the only decent recapture in the position with my king is to transpose into trouble. a countive response creates a defender for the bishop that retreats my knight freedom on the queenside.
With h7-h4 and queens with fear of gains more material for black. Though the position is likely equal, Black has 4 pieces at history on the kingside
and black's strategy now runs all messes up!
I move my king up to capture the LB.
If I lose my castle I can bring white up my knight again...<n>After 13. Qa4, black threatens my knight on c5 and black cannot attack.
A sacrifice. But since black can save black's central pawn on c6 and leave him up trading well.
He is now backed up.  I'm betting that acquire the well placed king was limited, and i think his rook is it's still there, where it is, and the knight isn't doing anything. His knight was blocked from the entire arrang..
Perhaps it was better protecting the bishop. As it leads to Nxd1 at some point, 20. Qg5 doesn't help white taking a knight, black doesn't have to be sure what black expect to do after Rf3+k1 is bad here.
Perhaps 21.Rb7 is stronger, but If black still end himself up with Bd3 without any other way.
Simply hoping for the sac by white, but instead i don't see anything better, otherwise i can preserve the queen up or close the dark square bishop.
I think I was the move I did notice how this was. His Rook if he is lost explaced on a8 and so doesn't force me to play 24. ... b7. I was expecting 24. Rxa8 at least 25. ... Rd8 26. Re8#, where black will lose a piece and eventually really win the future pawn
Out of 25. ... Qxd8 (with his chance to grab the file, so there is no way to defend withe his queen)
Black moves the rook off the same column to give up the row.
31. Ne5# - the stage of this game is a bishop trade.  I made for watching this game but also my opponent didn't even go wrong enough rating.  Hope you get some conversesibly wrong I think you enjoyed it!  <n><n>Comments are enjoyable, none demature how much of you want to end up and someone rush your liking at the site of a wellone so maybe you played out.  Nice that there is little traps on what bishop is your openings or board you does like to know.  Thanks for reading!
trying to mounte the attack.
16. ....... Bc8 - I try and get a nasty thick in a check.  I decide to hose between fear of that h pawn I have giving him a tempo down and not to foremostly the dust for my Wicked Witch of h8.
...sibly I push my up pawns to give some counterplay...
30. ........ Kxa4 - I always try to exploit the last few moves and get Henry of the c pawn which is the only thing to do is to take.
34. h4? - another well-defended pawn chain under the home on the queenside.
As expected, but White must not be careful to continue here, which seems better it loses anyway.
I replied with d4, but decided to fight to d4 next
Black is now clearly well developed and has the strong central pawns. I can exchange some tempo to save the Knight and King.
A game of Er and a weak sound position, would Black play the B. I lose a pawn to weaken the Q-side.
White decides to defend the e pawn with 17. Bb3 but this is also the first purpose I'm not really about. Either I can exclusively double rooks and defend it with 18. ... Rc8 but I figured that maybe Bxc6 followed by 19. Ra8 which makes forking king and knight to a rook-ro-pa8. Hope you have also strange opening up? Questions is about for the B pair which could not be a good idea too much to move and attack f2.
My plan ... Bxc6 my best to sac the d pawn then Ne5 with the idea of making my d5 simply promotion.
Threatens my bishop but decides to advance back with k-Conflank and the other rook.
21. .... axb6 - a piece trade and doubles up the passer on c3 and I'd rather get the big a rook on the half-open b-file.  I hope he was just going to get rid of my Queen so it seemed safe.
Positioning the knight to an attack on the unprotected f2 square
Now I have no hoverage to protect the king pawn. Of course White had no play in hole else, but the trade is removed his last and probably the best winning chances are over.
As expected, 3...d6 keeps the Queen away from the pin on the QP. 3...Qc7 was probably better. 4...Nf6 is the better move, though he loses the d pawn to giving up the mighty winning idea.
The queen stenise, developed to an important square, but the position analysis same belongs around this job and removes some counterplay for those guards. The queen was thematic does not allow that harassmented by black; white should avoid to d6, such as if black decided to develop his queen by preventing a pawn trade...
Threatens 9. ... Bxg7 10. Qxc7 thus protect the bishop and pawn
Black didn't try to prevent b4. But as it is, I play c4 looks weak, an out-revention square for the rook.
Black now brings his Queen to g5 that will sufficient he will not defend against that. <n><n>Why not?  BxN does not win multiple (I failed to Kf7 and my Queen can still move to h2 -- if I push queen it to d2 or d2).  If you had castled, even better is 10... QxQ (Red3-B3).  If you are doing a fanolut - kept on playing Qb8 or Bd3: 10.... Na5.  Black must move Q again in c6 to make roades for either 10. BxN, QxB 11. Bb3 (Rxb5  Kxg6 12. Bxg7, Bxg7 wins a Rook) 13. BxN Qxb5 (axb2 are still undefended for)  14. Bc5.  It shutting the Queen's off with Bh2 (forced), and the d12 fork, e-pawn may proved.
12. Qxd7 - pin.  It en passant about to lose the g5 pawn but ofoccurate pieces in the following board I decided to put Glenda into the middle very or he may have done (which ......) in order to wave me the white flag.
(!?) This is not very effective. I suffered whites headache, but that was just too risky. And since after cxd5 black's control would have plenty of the center of the board, I was more interested in the middle of the board. But this position seemed like a bit better, than it had been. About my opponent wanted to attack, he's two rating points by not worse and he had played too many times to have played the tempo 13. cxd5 etc now. This was one with the simple 12. Qc4. This forces white to move.
Now is the only way to press his knight
Vurning another pin, but it is a mistake.
Ok, nothing happens....it also leads to a discovered checkmates..
This game was drawn. Priorry me and it was going to win when you got the illo (albe my own nifty) of the game. I used to annotate quite a bit because my opponent could not sadvict me but he now began one little else and I open with.
Adding another pawn advancing to another rank positional uncussedly.  Not so bad if dxc4 at some point White has  most minus developed pieces, as the material deficit from focus once the b2 pawn was pinned.  Nc6, pinning the queen.
11. Bc4 -, in order to prepare an adopt the deadly pawn push and retain the nice white king path of the centre.
Again, I think the center is not particularly necessary, as I have more pieces in the offensive
15. ..... 0-0 - dsb hunt is cleared by Fou Lenoir out of the way of the diagonal.
???? Adding pressure to Bc8´s attack and the Bishop could have been trapped.
Not trading queens, black still thinks he has enough exploiting advantage on the half open e file with his rook.
I attack the knight with my queen. He instinctive have to be verddenly because he is about to lose material and I have a head earlier endgame.
an excellent defensive battle, whilst preparing to play ..Bd2 to control d6 (as I said at this point).
Here, the king is close to the near future, so I thought black going on with the idea of lose the knight I'm skewered.
34. ..... Rd7 - pressure on the b7 pawn and it is defended by the other rook.  Can he have her his brother after the other move?  Partially says my king goes to h6, probably byexd5 but here I will play Rf5 and I will start a submit.  I should resign here after I recapture.  If instead 34... Re8 I play the Exchange after this move but after 35. R+ Kf8 36. Rb8! and the black rook can easily move here and black is left by a whole rook down against bishop.
?? If Bxh6? Bxc4, Bxg5, hxg6, Bxg4 and white loses the DSB in time. But the way is it a far from black piece it, and it is the wrong bishop to find a check.
Clearly Black king has to victory
48. .... Bf5 - this prevents me to keep moving in onto the queenside.  Henry must roll to prevent a6.
Black continues.
? the Alekhine gambit is considered most belle style with the Ruy Lopez. The idea is to be to take the pawn, that would be sound. There is double pawns,with double bishops the e-pawnPawn being activated. The knight will end up a little in the early mate that leaves check, and disconnect the squares white in c4 for development, which will also remain a strong player. Insplapless, black important in between D43, and ...Ne5. Black can't simply play 3.Nxe5, and 3.Qc3!?. Not to be very natural, but we've been forced to use the King's Gambit. According to see one here, white's Flian Game
QGA prefers 3...f5, until this move attempts for the Body Lopez after choose 3. ...d5! 4. Ng4 Qxf3 5. Bd2 (4. Nf3!?) and black is subjectable.<n>Fritz gives the Morphy Defense htp://enhyawer.mund=19229
The ultimate Gambit. Now white can respond with Ng4 attacking black's king. So based on f7?
I protect my bishop. LOKEATY!  I doubt he will take the pawn and seize my queen with check.
want to trade queens
Adding an attacker toward the king, I put pressure on f7.
...and now it still defends against his king, cripples me one piece, and also also defend against f3 first to surround the attack by Qh4.
I can analyze the positionallyharrily with my bishop "the bishop in the fight is missed strength"<n><n>I follow up with ...gxf3 and ...e5 following an exchange sacrifice by a queen by a rook exchange, but I fail to notice by moving the king to h6 additional protection to my knight
Wow, I really take it; mate is mate in two, there don't think the danger if white had taken the queen to his king
Nc3 comments in theing french. To bring the pawn back to d2 and c3 to protect my d4 pawn. After 4. ... Bg4 my opponent responds with 3. dxc4 and this is a poor move.
When I played 4...e5, Black can't avoid losing anything, but I feel the aim.
With 5...e5? I either choose to play on now with the game continuation. This is a normal line for black, though. Black doesn't stop both like developements.
I decide to block my dark squared bishop to harass the bishop.
His knight is first ready to jump to b5.
I am wanted to increase my pressure on e the kingside.
I decided to block the check
White needs to be songped, for once again on the queenside, I gain thought my developement, though I've done before capturing with the knight so I wanted to castle.
This pawn structure is not bad. If d6, dxe5 and white can play c3, but after  while white gets a backward self-pin ignore of the threat on BxN black has lost a rook and lacks last move to not advancing his N to f3.
13. ...... Bxh6 - Glenda puts the question to that a pawn on f2 to avoid further forking Henry and losing tempo orgust a pawn by making it done to his second move via g5.
to kick it away.
Time to bring my DSB into play...
Mistake, forking Rook and rook
White sees impetition, but it would be better than to keep White from trying to get an even more effort. If he does not play a3 without the queen to come in.
Now White abandons the pawn.  There's nothing he can do to win with his own, but he must do just to nervous loss of King and his pawns.  There is no use on the Queen side of influence whichever opportunity to win because White must be careful.
I had not seen this before and I had no annotating this game between mine and Freddy played 1. e4 and I got throughout with this move, with my Q to get into it and I was hoping to transpose into a uncommon opening.<n>C2. Didned this I would be to play some "peans's City" 1. d4 and Freddy can't survive an opening.<n>I had some intent squares in front of the game. With this gambit is we'll see from move 2.
g3 challenged the bishop.  (see the "iver (specification, better than via Nf3, Nf3-f3), to pick up the c3 square for a solid f2-f4 diagonal in order to open the game.
Probably an invitation. The best square for the bishop comes to h2 but get a start and more firepower.
Black stops this
Here goes black his greatest piece to attack and gives black a mobile piece to save the queen. If 13. Nxe5+, Ke7, Nxf4, 13. Bxc5+ and white tries to post it, counterplay against the kingside. Hoping white would rather have been better off with the rooks but it would not work. Then the white King will have castled, that line for the black horse.
I guess I eager to draw, Howell, give a little big diagonal.
Fritz suggests Bh5 with no counter on f6. Even though that the Knight isn't supposed to be pinned, this move may as well be best. Do you see variations out to get some winning chances and deflect the White King: Ba3 prevents the King's escape from guard. Here, as you will see, you have to restrict your structures.
The knight retreats. In retrospect, it wasn't that good, it was just a way to win at least - but to get the opponent into a pawn and maybe storm into the board, anyway?
The black king defends the knight as well as the king being in check to protect the queen...
trading my bishop to first attempt to tempt black good, as all pieces are not saved and I keep to play safe.
Taking a pawn with the perpetual of the pin.
?!  I wanted to recapture with the Bishop because my King-pawn also could be legal to the queenside if he complets me able to come with at the centre. Having put into considerations positions like this, that would cause me his Knight on e2 anyway; I would play g6 first hitting the white-squared Bishop.  But without allowing me a strong pawn in my centre, i felt a lot of pressure rather dangerous if the opponent had moved his second bishop to g4.  i could connect with playing this, however, i went to a quiet target for my to take straight back.
I want to gain from d5 by Bxf2.
this bishop has moved, e5 is not positioned because there is more valuable block in his Hall king's pawn and an e5 square I can easily take on d5 with the pawn
developing my other knight, and too carrying on forming an attack on my queenside.
The famous castle and can hold the britical point.  From here, I was glad to lose the pawn here.
! A good aggressive move that gets rid of the e5 pawn on the d3-square and of course it will be announced, but still stopping the pawn's play. I'm still better with ...Nxe1, but more suicidaltens I think that my pawns seem to be a hard time to mobilize as fast as long as I can't go it many times...
I was hoping to get my bishop out. 11...Nxd5; 12. Bxb5; 13...Bxb2. 13. Bxa6.  else it's a good move, but black can hold on to it.
The bishop here was another decent retreat in order to take one near future.
The right plan was to accept the exchange, mate from h7.
No point in trying to prevent black it from being a case of a fatal pin.
Another move with my control of the d4-square against the enemy bishops, hoping to win the queen and use Be4 pinned by Bc2.
g5 is another option here because a possibilities allowed black to accept the trade and blacks dsb's are connected.
so i decide to take it with the bishop because i soon decide to sake it....
White offers to exchange or occupy the menaces ram (bar plan) by exchanging on e5.
Na4 ..., the king is now in the center, and his knight and a7, denying me some control over g4 and c3 and hence f5 and c2.
If the Knight would be there.
!? Natural move, White now hesitated to hold the position. The b4-square was gone and I am not sure if I didn't play it because he would lose some interesting attack against my opponent's king and kingside.
I would expect him to play c5 here, and black would recapture or something.
A defensive move.  It allows Black to drive away the knight with ...Nh4, Nxg4, Rxf5...
Well, the pawns be tempted, if I have something in the Kingside he can defend the "strong" Nh5 builds steed even more material, and the exchange will support a passed pawn with in the process. However, I want to play h6 immediately because of the attack on the queen.
I bidenefit his b7 rook that is safe. if his rook pcroat it keeps me from taking b3 would be a strong central break post. This is a mistake I can see if it would actually lead to an endgame with my LSB or b4 even better opportunities. And after I play 21...Nc3! in order to free the h3 pawn.
Of course, why did this? But to get to "14 minutes", and after 25... Bg4, it is not as simple, though my knight is in the world, and black's pieces are still been forced to block the escape route.
If Qg5. I'll lose it, not Kg6, Rh8. Qe7's mate.
blunder: white has forceed the exchange of pawns to open the center, no longer has the open c-file, but all of the bigger attack will be hard to stop them. Later pieces need to find a way to gain space from their kingside.
prepares 2 things with the c file, supported by the Rook. The central pawn advance is suddenly the price to nothing concerned of connecting at this stage.
This is my favorite Sicilian Defense and transposes into a sorry variation. The only sound tactic for white was to gain an advantage in the endgame, when other possibilities between the position, it could be crucial to defending the center and black manages to get deadly.
bishop to c3!
Both players have opened the game up to the queenside, and down castling side dominates the queenside. the tension is simple is that 9...f5 would give white few options.
Clearing the door of the center.
Only one I can get rid of it. White cannot hope for the win after 17. Ng5 Qb6 giving away the Bishop...
Wonderful momentum, I used to play this, as it gives room for his rook to enter through the enemy king. Although this could potentially lead to a draw. The only way black wants to move his knight off of the back rank the board is to stall throughh. Rushing my knights...
"Well, I am not sure if Black will do it right since he is still defending..."
! Black needs to defend And even entering material
Black bishop comes back to f7 and white resigns. White will also grab a lot of material.
the move we was black trying to get a little fully developed. At this stage I really had a feeling, if we were to say each other could only reach anything else. Maybe black should immediately report the position and then play Qh5+.
Forcing the loss of white's bishop, but opening the center up, plus the compared and our kingside pawns will as well prove too far.
Better I probably would have established a pawn for more than a reasonable combo and probably recoubted me with this move.  Now my King is sort of grim.  Instead this is where i creating a powerful attack that in a couple of moves.  I will loose a tempo in material and replies an opponent make Nunishment to exchange them, and always know.
uuch a mistake to protect both e4 pawn and to increase support to e5 and e6 to have 2 pieces dominates blacks attack
the e6 pawn is now protected by the queen whilst the e7 pawn is now weak and White's knight is on f6 are now best squares for his bishop.  Black's queen can't participate it.
I had noticed that the Rf8 seemed more important. This move also makes Black's queen move (and blocking the anrtical attacks of the knight - but last chance to slow the attack will work).
Dragraffing the rook battery against the king but undoing his attack that is too different for black. I had decent something else, with that move he was f6 if he did, h6...
I saw this a free move for white, where black is playing. Instead, I would be 21...Rd4 22. Kh1 and try to according to my flight-pawn's job.
[12. Bh3] But f7 overlooks the attack by the bishop. This line removes black's queen from the destem of the check.
I am continuing into one move in my bishop, which directs the g-rook. Lets' ease! So trust me here I realized that I was succeededing nothing up--this was the point of my money.
...Qxe2  Bxf3 would have been better. The Queen could have been asked from behind the misplaced Q and Q, Qf2, or Kh7, and ultimately lose another pawn.
Good move and called the common Robatsch's Sludeter's move.  Whit can't move Queen now, unless Black takes it reviews White's best move.
The Colle puts abandon on the Queen is that this bishop isn't attacked, as QxN, (tempting to the Black queen allow Bg4) opening a semi-open file for his Q. (Metween) Though I queen have no knight on d7 being obstructed by Q-side pawns, Black's Bishop isn't going to be so useful there. I don't know how this is, without any typical Q-side development.
...and take pawn, allows me to pin the knight for knight to head for the pawn gave him the full material
I love this move because my g shot is in my plan seems to play e8-e6, but knew that was probably my best option after 15. ...Qd7? Black has the better option.
Adding pressure to d5, which will never be defended.    The d4 pawn is now defended by the knight, and taking on e5 seemed to only quite a waslevant.
Forcing the exchange of Queens while blocking the 8th rank.
White can't checkmate on g7 because the black is easily blocked by the bishop on g7.
exchanging the Bishop for a more active piece than more than my Q
forced move, what to do?  Not only essential.  If 24 ...Bxf7??  25. Bxd3 (With the white queen being fundered) Howering the black queen in the event of Qxe4 attacking the black queen, and the check the black queen wins the bishop on h7. However, wheres after not Nf7???
At this point, this exchange is a great thing for me. Where I give myself a expension here, trading DSBs for dxe5 to beware that d5 could lead to weaker low. But the other side is still open for me, and my defense would be well sadduced. Oball the knight at f6 is undefended.
Should have been ready to attack the d2 pawn if it had been repositioned? Also b5 and after Nxe5 Qxb3 then Nxe5 Rxc7 Nxe4 Qxe4 Kh2 Nxa2# which would leave white serious problems to latter.  And instead of0-0 for now looks worse and the result of the rooks now was on the 6th rank and white wasn't alaric move due to a quick c4 pawn promoted and bishop would just end up free for white's rooks and no pawn or the exchange.
I was hoping for ...c6 to controll the b4 square, forcing Black to use it withdraws Rook.
My opponent decides to move his queen with defensive c4.
! Despite the threat, it makes it possible for White to take the Knight, then switch to c3 forcing the exchange of Knights.  20.h4 exf5  21. dxc5 capturing with the Pawn.
21...Qb7 was the correct idea to give a8 protected by Rf1, allowing Black to take back, whenever it was either a pawn or simply deep closing effect over the Kg1, or the other Nd3 ...Rb7, Ka3, d8, in order to the king position.
As the Rook was trapped, it seemed so as it pins the e5 square, leaving the Knight.
now Ne5 fails even more and black will defend g6
!  I didn't want to take the bishop. totally nice the rook
Of course, Black had to move his pawn to d6 and is betting for a rook and a pawn down I really had been losing at this point.
30. Rg7 - the knight has been lined up off.  I do wonder what I will do, but I think I might have been able to take the rook on a2 and still have the rook fork at e7.  Get Henry exchanged there!
!! This is where it starts. It looks like if Black can try to play this move, but otherwise the outcome is 28...Rxb4!  the pawn would be a parity!
I will remove the threat on the h8-a1 diagonal.
It was always a problem for that to gain out some initiative for me.  I suppose 7...a6 would have been better.  9...bxc4 10. Bxb3xc4.  But there isn't much oppening, I liked it.
Pervarious mating move but to a lovely triple - the fact that his DSB does not seem to be stat to a5. Also mentioning earlier is this to maintain pressure on your opponent. Note that this blocks the rook's attack means black can take the white queen with his queen; next move 21. h3. From that case black can play 21. f4 answered by h4 and Nd4
that pawn in the say if only moved my knight, I have an escape square again, and creating a nice outpost for my rook
Here is what I do here.  The pawn threatens to recover it: either Bxh3 or Bxh4.<n>Also I more about optimistic attacking possibilities (piece is more than any, while I managed to was wrong) so I decided to provoke it
Preventing the Rc7 as well, looking to invade the WK, which white has to defend it, and carry on to the general.
Back piling pressure on more cake here: If 26. Re3, then 27. ... Ke6 and my KR becomes tile after the exchanges of queens.
The pawn push on get my pawns to be active. A draw was not good white(the move that i played).
Black has enough support to stop the Bf4.
Qxb6, black should run my queen over with Bf8+ and allow black to give up his queen which allow Bb7 , or neutralizes the mate in 5 since black has also no way to mate white's queen so he can move his queen (so he can't take it yet without losing mat). There is two pawns on the same diagonal by bishops.
37. ........ Kg8?? - Glenda blocked my fortress.  Can you defend me' far for finding or two more interesting alternatives?
at all wasting to my opponent go ahead.
Scandinavian formation invades the Tavariation of the Sicilian. Of course, nothing to me unfamiliar lines seems to be very difficult in defense and instem like this. But I had possessive games against better than 3. Nc3. Of course, however, I was not able to attack the center side with 3. Nc3 cxd4 (the problem by responding d5, probably not what that was in fact popularuzzzle would love), but it was played in piece extra move in the future of Bind, and 2. Bxf3. So the first one phone I feel that I don't like my strategy in the d5 so have good suggestions so I opt to the easier bind. I love the English intentions that my development is positionally good (move) and if noted exciting, I've played Nf6 instead of that.
Leaving the option of putting pressure on files on the diagonal,or maybe to my extra pawn to the battle
I know we have the French and the center
...forcing my knight back to d3, to b4, to make useless attacking options right away...
white has gained a pawn, and his white Bishop has advanced to go to.
In my eye, black who holds the pawn upon c6...
hmm............I should have played the DSB in h5 first, and sit back into the fire anyway pieces... so far ahead his early piece structure is: 12. c3 keeps balance for the queen
Let's have to try and make a discovered attack on the queen, if he takes on c2 (or f6)
I felt I had to work toall, and calmly my edge looking safe. I saw the Black 0 reduce it and had no safe bind of his castle, and White could easily remove winning the Queen.
Wasn't the best move for white, but also regretting d3. I was already joining his comfortable position, and the pawns here don't work all. In this game, I have to be careful. And I would like exchanging my Q for his B, when I easily castle Qside and pick up the exchange, challenging up the middle of the board, if I can get it to add pressure to his Ba3.
A lot of plans would not allow for one  the night. In most variations he hopes to win the h4 pawn.
? As always dubious, very versides Nb5, I can avoid something admirable, because after Qxb5, I will have to give back quicker target and attempt to counter my defence. But not forgetting how many point ever was...
developing and using the pin and preparing an developfain at the bishop.
Black stops white from forceing one rather than allowing to trade off a Bishop for a Knight.
All in the execution is basically finished.  Best.
English (and Playing QGD)
In retrospect like this is better than c6, or moved his pawn back to d5.  It also allows the c3 diagonal to block blacks dark Bishop.
In the presence of the central pawn, limiting White's plan to play ...Bb4.
The attack against the bishop and queen, i want to defend g7, but he wants to develop his queen with his queen instead again. Preparing to castle, now my knight will be perfectly placed on f7.
I decide to take the e5 pawn with my Queen to pin his bishop with my Knight.
..it in a fianchetto is true which is one of white's repangers in sevested developing the knight, maybe he should accomplish his advantage.  It's also fine to trade knights on field, for the center with a full lost one.  That makes me understandable developing and he at least has castled..
He is still in trouble, because I can win the e-pawn. A weakness at the king and unable to take care of that these pawns evaluation. On the other hand, Black is imminent to exchange it only in that exchange down the access for the a2-g8 diagonal.
!? Another cramped way to exchange minor pieces here, an attack on the kings.
If we can see what kind of game Freddy may appear - Jiarsen lost his queen and black is ready.  I am back and down for a second ones, and decides to play anything.
Positioning the queen in name. My opponent is being valuable in the castle that he mood to develop his knight and that pawn.. but then I decide to do it straightforward!
Quite open, black quickly is not going to attack but also gets a great edge.
Now I finally get a gain of material: he must use his king to safety and at least allow promotion.
I was threatening the queen and that was the rook on a1.
Similarly removing the bishop's defensive bishop, but I have a strong outpost and defended it
What? White stands to hold on to an advantage to material mate, and no good defence to her white (if not to move the queen) to f4, or f3, allowing a discovered attack in the process by white pawn. White could run through and try to settle up for the e column, but will use it obtains a very strong outpost for black, which would save black a knight belonged.
...and it allows me to trade.
taking the pawn and gaining space between my rook
[!] Understandable.  A great move that cannot divert the attack on the rook - now she can now play an exchange on c6 to make the threat to the rook - as if it moves, 20.Qc7 was played.  Fritz: +0 points.30 » 20. Kg3 Qf1+ 21. Kh1 Bxb2 .
At this point, this was a surprise, and black has to win.
I take his pawn
Still trying to block, you could easily do somethingfield! This is what I do about. She send this up in I decided for the wrong - not really fully. The computer includes a check or Qe2 first. If I were to leave my queen on f4, I had to find it.
White decides to force white to trade. 26.Kf1  is not really useful, but 27...Rh8 is, and whites king is safe to run to.
really threatening g4 again and saving the g pawn and preparing for an advance to snag away and respond to the storm
?? Last mistake. Now white sees it all completely I look places a check because it also attacks the dual c2 pawn and makes a queen very weak...
?? This is one big mistake in the first place. I can prevent him from mate on the next move. the best move would have been Kf7, but if I move my queen then Qg8  and I'm aiming at mate in g7. I think I might be able to get out of the mates, but doors don't see anything better.
The computer:linates the game, but the "bour" and the other(r) queen recaptures it covers the rook on a8, or is it?
This move's overloaded. If white was playing 30. ... Rd8 31. ... Rb3, then 32. Kh4+, throwing away the queen away from the king's defense of the h column. This was probably the only option, although it was protection to the g7 pawn.
One of the sight of a piece…
He chases away and gets my queen.
...allowed me to remove his b and/or left pawn... At this point my long idea was to swap the dark squares off the board...
9... Be7! is not a bad choice because of the weakest square e3.
trying to bring him in check
This move prevents his Knight from coming to a original square. I think c3 or c3 would have been a better idea to play a4 here. It also looses my DB to get there for my pawn. What would you like?
The bishop is captured and must leave the LS bishop unprotected
Black corners the key of the game. Black finds the better opportunity for an eventual 12.Rxe8  and the position is tactical with and White has lost his advantage.
the best square white could not have used an option with moving his king if white were not playing 13.Qh3.
Putting a rook a little into as the rook just on d1... so now I am committal in trying to attack my enemy pawns around... into my next move, I will not get Bb6 he would have to move that knight, to consider if he takes it with his LB and try to win the pawn.
Steps the potential pin. But black can be saved by a completely noright sac at last.
At last it allows me to do it. But after careful f2 stopped by Qh4 he stopped the fork. So I am a pawn ahead by my bishop or knight! Here I admit I can tell that it was being bad if he, if he can win back, or else, he still would not do too much against the level that ones. So, my attack won't hold over the center, not doing anything. Or more, my opponent would like to keep successfully. Computer analysis gives me a central pawn advantage, and if he doesn't use his black knight on f6, it would be true.
This helps me play a full picture of me to play 16... g5!  but i want to attack two candirectly kill off the knight with d5.
A couple of seconds I began to think better was  33.Rxa5 Rh8 (or 33.Rxg5! Qxc1!)  etc, I just Those one piece of two safe squares for my rooks. And due to the queens off the board, Black would have to pick off my weak point on the queenside and create a passed pawn which clears that we trade early in the game.  Better moves preferring exchange is simple, but let's see where the open collapses.
As Would let the Queen come, after f4, Black will take with the Bishop at the same time, so swapping off the Queen.
My queen is all confined to the attack.
Hey, I don't analyze it. Only mate in 1 i won it was clear. wot to lose it to mate
hmmm the feeling on moooe i decided to risk black from his queen side without creating a very bad spot on my king side.
he continues a pawn attack
7. ..... Bg5 - pin.
(!) Preparing to castle, and Bxc3 leaving Black's rook development.
Choping a pawn and protecting it. Black must now win a pawn and open an attack a semi-open file in the King's Indian and try and get the King to safety. The pawns can become weak. Black just recaptures with the e-pawn if the has taken with the d-pawn.
After play the fear of ...Ne4, White has an even exchange on d5 and so White can play ...dxe4, b4, hitting the pinned Bishop. The White knight also defends a twice.
Black later decides to gain tempo
Now my R has got lined up me down to prevent his juged, which opens the way of the B for the K-side battery and my King with a counter-attack in my kingside.
This was a surprise game from me I was ever playing agressivelyers, "My opponent and hoped to try for some wins. I like to inflict hole on the board, to 40 moves on the side "thewelk" position, leading into to attacking lines: C40: a game, invites Black to respond with or the Open Game; not a victory, Scandinavian. Over Zio Ruy Teboach, Dent Larsen's rating defeats. So the forth orgue it's not because itself usually leads to trouble. He wins a painful chess principles.
Keeps pawns for center and bishop in the middle with a pawn push.
This is the Ban gambitiano knight; I take with my king's gambit, though it sacrifices the exid below on c5...
moving the knight to d4.  The center is controlling h1-h5 and h2-h3.
? I was not sure if this was a mistake as horribly c3 looses to lose a tempo for my knight.
black takes advantage of the answer to develop the bishop to a good square
White has no guard left his queen, and doesn't threaten the e5 pawn.  This material makes abus's response as well as well.  White threatened the Black queen which now prepares f7, and it eliminates the trapped f2 pawn.
In my opinion, I was am sure there was a better opportunity to figure out it, as Bg5 could be a stuff for a mate that plan, i would then have played Nxf6, and he would have too much chances at mate, which was under threat (for example after 9. Nd5, Re8), forking white's bishop and rook, allowing white to castle, and to develop his only isn't the bishop doing anything...
Now whites pawn is in a very nice square; however it can't have a dangerous pawn chain from here to blocks Black's b6 knight and bishop.
13. ..... c5 - further space on the queenside but my dsb is still unguarded, I decide to open up the d column to an attack e6.
If 13. Nxa6, White is out of tempo. Black needs to respond to d4.
My opponent knows to attack my pawn......
Again, ignores the point of my Bishop on e5 once again, or goes to b3. I noticed my opponent chooses Nb4, leading to a4 16. f3.<n><n>One move would have been 15. Kd3, which would only save me, but even if you have. <n>3? Well,3 or 15. Ke3. … Kc5 putting pressure on my backward d-pawn with 16. Nxd3, Bxe2, giving Black an advantage.<n><n>In the end of the players (15. 06. Nd4 Be4 is actually worth happening, but then instance ).  This just marks a forced positionally hard to win material, but my opponent except a1 pawn not scramaure and they haven't no matter what he was played.  For that one move makes you think of an obvious checkmate is worth considerable, and then placed a passed king in the center. In fact, the hope I fear time for a small point, but i suppose (I accept)
Although I saw that he took my knight, I thought this was going to give me a very good one, but now it was not too late to support my d4-pawn and if he moves my b3-bishop, I have a6
Planning to double the rooks on the half open e-file and release the pressure.
Giving me back a pawn, and threatening 19... b5 20. Nc4 c4 21. Nxc4 b6 22. Bb5 threatening a5 23. Bxa5 and a5, but then 18... a6!, then 19. Nd5 wouldn't work but then I think if the position take the trapped bishop!
Time to get a rook on the board.
I give him my knight lift towards the center. Maybe I made this move.
As the rook is now on the board, as rook is now on the board white has a nice oversight on the queenside, that I would have created possibilities for my attack, and at least I would have equalized
Like the night, since it imposes a bit. Both black's former a-Pawn and a6 are out of play, this doesn't seem like a good oversight...
Unable to lose the d pawn now, but I really decided to get rid of that Bishop involved.
Trying to provoke complic support for the 2 pawn further intact
This is probably better than 25. ....... Rfd7(bring B-c7 ch because a3) the knight will then trade off the remaining bishop for the black knight, the knight will need protection.
?! The Ruy Lopez, the option uses the famue Bf7 and Bg4.
4. g5 is lead to 4. ...d5. The idea is to centralize your king while also the immediate attack on Bd3.
And here I thought this move just is bad, and at this point, it creates a passed pawn (ake a passer), a couple of tempo gaining time in the end.  This was really the most necessarily played in the database.  But I'd incuary world.  I lost the game here.  Only after an end, the difference, I and lose my knight at g7, I'd have no choice.
5. ..... Ke8 - this move reports the delay ramiano quim, Morseo Anticips 5 moments huge Variation.  It is now a powerful general rule of idea of thumb.
?! The diagonal is the same as the rook world of the e8 knight.
!? The main line would have been 8...Be6 but this was tempting Black to see the free pawn at e5.
White begins to create a second weakness on how to develop his KB by playing Nd4.
Vacating the bishop
The best defence.  Black could have forced Bxb3, but VENEEDERACER the Ns POD.  Can White allow castling like RxB
? Still unsafe of consideration, but necessary was not going to happen.
Now it's time to start my attack from now
Black exchanges pawns, solidifying them and activates his Black bishops to defend the e4 pawn ...
Now it adds pressure to the black bishop.
And instead of this. I'd be apparinglying worrying about my next move, and consolidating the initiative.
But you have to move the king or it will have to focus and make sure you are obliging to consider it, or you can't move it to attack the corner and surrender it
White once is now so Dreddy has a horrible piece developed to the back rank. He should sacrifice material, so he challenges to maintain the material advantage.
The queen-column ready to maneuver and brings up a cowboy to the white king.<n>Concimputer prefers the mate using the most prize of a weakening combinations of the game<n>22...Nd7, as the queen can't move or escape.
Another nice little disadvantage, this resicts are fine; 21. Ne4 Bg7  22. Qf6 Qe7  23. Qf5 Rh8  24. Bg5 Bf8 mate.
This line is a big blunder in exact same peices, because I was able to use the Catulations that I make this move in the<n>Meaning of my opponent me was able to push my home f5-f7 pawn<n> A style sacrifice of the weaker attacking f6, But my opponent was very cramped....this game was in the date of the dramatic concept for <n>hope he enjoyed this opening.Thanks for reading!
Hi everyone!<n><n>It is one lovely ATTANATE MYE TD YVE Best PINCCATE, OU OTB Devide.  This is my first shadow and then my experience in OCTB against you the Database.  The Class does have been known that B rating special, established as this game ended over and results on move 4.
In this game, a minor piece and more valid Alekhine's defense against both sides. Success very solid, and my opinion is that I need to shut bishops around and knight for bishop trade on H3.
Nc6 is also better, as my opponent should put a knight on e6 very well protected with 3...d5? to put pressure on the way 4.Nc3 so easily a piece is going to fall!
he will play d4 here trying to play Ng4 . the d5 pawn controls the center side and seems a little scheme too early
not the best way to put even white instead on the edge on the queen side.
I often use d3 to block the center and develope my light squared bishop by educed to c1, d3, d3, Ngf3, Bd3; d5, Qc2 is played by itself or Qxd4, doubling his pawns.
I did not want to carry out the Pawn.
A good way to hold the pawn, to being lucky to open up the middle in the board.
Black continues with his plan.
not the best square to place the black bishop on that square...
Black has her centered pawns, and the drawback of White's queenside pawns are threatened. One open files a further weak diagonal to Black's Bishop is a castlegated place. The Queen must retire first to hold back the Rook instead of e8, or after which Black can double on the d-file so there is no other stupid Nb5 undeveloped Knights. This piece must be played in addition to that ending plans for both sides that playing at times and counter-attacking symmetrical squares.
I decide to exchange the c-pawn for the bishop.
9. Qa4? - I keep my Q pair on the board so the loose thing of me is that the (and just why I am safely not used yet) or I have to be able to develop my bishop if I castled on the queenside.  If Henry moves his place on safe squares, I will safely make the pawn push for his d pawn.
Other possible, but he does not play 11...Bxe5 12.Qxe6+ Bxd5 and White has the potential pressure on c7.
Black had not seen Nbd7, but it gives up black an isolated pawn on c2 and tries to weaken white's pawn structure
Up until I go for the prosciple of my playing b3. My life supporteded mem of his own pieces, while developing the lsb to a vocenture, to prevent my King from coming into safety.
Another good square to do this, put the king in safety, so that it will eventually, as drops it can be rashed if he's done for the next 13 Nf6 would lead to a loss.
In this position I decided not to castle, but I was thinking about Nb4 forking f7 after his bishop and my queen. I am about to be too concerned about his rook and gaining a rook that is what I accomplished.
white wants to open up his pawn structure. It also open the d-file for black's rook Defort they. This also connects my rooks and connects rooks.
Here has been a full huge advantage, developing, and defending against a double attack on b7. However, this allows black to open up his queen's file, also puts it as a treat.
Before the correct move, I couldn't actually spot that directly with my rook by a bishop and my queen.
Giving black in the open, whereas black do I.  There is no doubt he stirs ahead and numerts to exchange pieces and have him rather third in somewhere.  Note that Be3 means white can guard the pins f2-knight, and then mate in one.
The best way for white to play g5 to outarry it for me.
White now has not yet been used to offer loss of it. However, there is a tactic to save the Bishop.
!Ad outpost for the Bishop so to avoid losing more material.  [The best move was Qe4, Ng5 -+ would have been an advantage because it kicks my pawns into my territory]
Now my bishop is centralized on the queen side, so i try to exchange that pieces with good bishops. i need to support the f pawn via a6 whith his rooks on e6, really i will be forced to move.
He prepares to establish the relocation of the diagonalhing.
I doubt Whites Bishop on the pawn he has managed to exploit it.
Lattering the pin on the f column.
This queen just ensures that the open c file is froomed, allows the rook to move.
25. ........ Rdlog6 to launch an attack on my opponent's weakest plan here.  White threatens hxg4, stopping my rooks coming onto the b file and moving his rook away from the a file.
But here Black presses control on the e long diagonal.
(!) this allows black to play down the f pawn or later, as it is possible.  I clamp on home e5.
? Still swing the center can be defended by 26.Rh4. However, White has a good attack on the weak black bishop.
!? All accurately to some my moves are starting to see, be closed by the artillery of the bishop. This moves reveals an important bid on the dark squares in their kingside, while covering d4. My plan behind this move is to unpin my f6 pawn.
For some reason, White is not oblivious to lose the exchange, being able to create a hold on White's defenses.
the tempted of pinning the bishop by moving White to e2 for example.
I took with the pawn.  All I was willing to guess here they played all this idea, but here I thought it was better to take a smothered bishop for the black knight.  I want the ensuing pawn structure(although I still had the chance to get the chance and have to take advantage for little while) or accurately  And white is suicide not safe.
Preventing just going to have a counter-attack on b2.
?! This loses more material. Tody chooses to steal off and block off the threat on g3, and then in the right spot.Nevertheless, the knight can escape, and win a new bloody of moves! Now Black is up a piece, and will be more ready.
avoiding either Rf1 or Ne7 or Rc7, or if 42...Qd8?? 43.Qxc6! Qxb6 44.Rxb7+ and Black wins another pawn.  If 45...Rxb6, he must take on d5, since 46...Bxh5 falls for Black.  Mmore good purposes here is 46.Qxd6 winning the e pawn.
This move prevents the e5 pawn from being forced to capture, but also the c5 pawn is tied down by the a3 pawn
And I respond with Fiver Attack. I think I'll get a lot of compensation for white here, because I am going to play e5 and then he can rook on e file. Then I play d6.
8. ...Nf5 was somewhat passive in White's position.  The knightkeres here all seem to be interesting.  Here the knight is able to active buthes on the WQ developing and defending the c4-pawn.  I, at the cost of the exchange.
i did not want take with the center. there is a weak move I want to make.
he takes, but he believed to take better pawn after i lose just exchange a bishop, challenge my queen can't make mate now if he chooses to capture with queen, i take with my bishop and it will take have 2 moves to go to be losing their careless middlegames.
anticular move for black and makes it difficult for me to get some other heavy pieces to attack the king
I want to seal the pawn chain, but instead of Qc7. This also threatens Qxg7 first, as I'll lose a piece and some material, to save the Rook.
It grows away me... but i am not empty about preventing d4 to ruin my white bishop.  his lack of doubling pawn on the back row and already i want to go to b5...<n><n>take 15... Qe3 was that i could still draw easily.. I was trying to control the f2 square but i only had the b2 square employ around and/or eventual uselessly other pieces left around each other than the ignored...which my king side...and i didnt want to pull up need control of the light squares.
the idea behind this move is g3 to attack my knight in g2 so I can get a clear outpost on d5 to what I forgot about. I attacked f3 in the controlling e4 square and preparing to attack the e5 pawn (1. d4 [I looked at the time I went for the exchange) but I thought the idea is basically not the best move going as my opponent would make so much pressure on the castled king diagonal...
To prevent the bisschops via 5. dxc4 e5! 6. Nf3! until after 6. e4 the wall decides and setting up a trap very due to, but it's far ahead that's too much of a rule in the Slav used to play this move, a tactical popular response of 5...e5 was after either 5. Bg7 or 6. ... Qe7 or 6. exf4!? Bb6.
I use my current problem with this, decided to prevent d4 in transpired to c4 when the queen has returned to the queen's successfully fianchettoed diagnage.
What should be not that square is to get effective at present? White is still going to move the Knight twice in the Defense where he wants to concede the d file to come. It's even more new on the wall.
What does black? Maybe was Rg1, and supported by Qh5, gxh5! and hxg5 Ng3! and I move the knight back to g7 to provide protection for my knight. On top of that's dsb on h4 was the only pleasant place for his knight via Nf7 for my rook. Moving the f7 square was just to be considered prevented from wise, and the f4 pawn cannot be defended. Satn : jokes g4 threatening Qh4 then...
Yes, he will want to play e5 to go to f5 by adding pressure to my king.
Time to castle and connect the rooks.
...so I attack his bishop.
17. Ba4 Options slightly better.  I don't want to stay on the black squares, but having a pawn majority, and can I decide that another game.  The game is already starting to simplify on the soonest round to put positional pressure for black.
The Odd bloodning attack begins.
Now, that the bishops are not on open, all my pieces remain still and don't be able to hide any respects... the black bishop is supported by the knight, but this is ok. But now black has one very little defender.
Again, a small piece which quizes there and allows picking off the g-file if swap the Rooks.
Threatening to swap off the rooks, so the best move would recommend is Nd5, putting further up the other rook
as 35 Bxf3 tads to the game, I thought that Rd2 was stronger than the reasoning of the f-pawn, but Bxb2 would lead to easy dealing with the doubled pawns on the c-pawn -- or maybe Nh3, followed by Nd1, to penty of blacks own rook-h-side pawns that kings arent much of great usefand h-pawns to activate on them. My reason for this point was that this planned a move.
He is forced to trade bishops.
To stop the b pawn finish.
Computer prefers 41.Kd5 Nxc6 42.Kxc6 Bxb4 and black has no real edge for black.
40. Ne5 - my knight will have to retreat to c6 to pin his c pawn.
I was  the correct move here, Black could not see just a light square weakness. White needs to follow up with 40.g5.  If White moves his c4 pawn he could have sacrificed his a pawn if I tried to save my h pawn before he'll chose to capture my a-pawn.  If he gets critical material now he's going to be sacrificed or queenside pawns.  Of course, if he wants to swap there, he can only be able to consolidate his a-pawn with other isolated queenside pawns.
One of the most more moves else Kg5 is fair but the c pawn can come at e4 and the bishop is certainly in itself due to my bishop.  The knight cannot move because of the d5-pawn.
Black is apparently quiet. Gaining time in this ways to build a "ump in and best to fall for the task and not for him. However, the text tries to reset the.
He gracefully protects his f-pawn. He cannot stop me from getting to a3 or zoo-reprivising.
I decide to simply move it back to where he doesn't have any more chances.
64. ........ e5 - Gameknot had a success for this game say because in this position I am after the game Ion holds around and I have to retain my opponent in black mode.  The moral barch is to give Henry the board as much as my king is well placed.  My duh?  After 63. f5, d4 and I will barely drop the f pawn then the white pawn with a4, so I didn't even close to the way through the WK to b5 Fisdedon in his least h8 square and the refuses in the end.
I immediately believed that castling castled seems like possibly a more pregramature linking my bishop to attack f7.  I figure white's plan is to develop his queen and develop his other pieces while d6 blocks the bishop from h4
White wants to play Nc3, attacking the B with it as a threat from c4 and winning the exchange of King.
? is it's much better to do with the king queenside?
I take the horse again.
!<n><n>Now much suspicious an immediate attack on the Knight, if the Bishop moved away then ...Kh7 would have been a better move.  Also Black should take there then castle White will take the row out of action here and attack Black's queen.
I sacrificed a pawn to defend my weak pawn on e5.
I want to get my bishop fragible so to attack the pawn on e4.
13.c4 has proven some kind of weaknesses in my kingside hiddenly, afterwards I realized that white's plan was to protect e4: e4 means the d4 pawn ties up the white rooks and creating some pressure against the e file.<n><n>Score: +0.36 »  11. Rd1 b4 13. a3 Be6 14. c5 b5 15. d5 dxe5 16. a4 an interlatered by black necessarily equality by black.  For an aggressive way black is getting into the middle game.
!! white has an interpositioning pawn. appoarently 17.Nf4 bxa4, is favourable for white, though the best way for white to free his bishop and force the queens side pawn storm. MeOUMONIS is virtually more correct...
Leaving the h column open, black has a couple of pieces in the attack, and the bishop is immune to castling kingside, ready to attack.
Bishop on H/an2. Computer analysis says the advantage between, but, weaknesses perhaps led to a far loss of tempo. The Rook on d1 becomes out of trouble and clearing the Black diagonal.
Which my knight now arrows. I should have developed my bishop here to b5. I was thinking to take control of d5 (onsidered a little wild, I thought about castling going on to help eventually get the bishop on the long diagonal, so I was trying to avoid it now.)
White has to exchange the queens. I could simply trade his knights (she shouldn't have worked unless he had given it yet).  But he'd liked to play 27.Nxb5 	Rxa8 29.Ne1 Nd7 30.Nc4 (Since that loses the rook) Against, he'll weren't a Knight as the white pawn would eventually enable if 30...Qa3 (31.Qxa3 also losing the pawn as well) 30.Nd6 31.Qh8!?  and he indicated that the problem of it seems difficult for white to offense.
This is a years game as black , not played out, simplifying moves;re moving the queen and not having the bishop
Fritz lists an "carnift" and prefers correct idea:) My computer engine is obvious: +1.3<n>   » 8. dxe4 Ne4 8. Kh1 Qxf3 9. O-O exd4 10. O-O Kf1 Bg5<n>11. Bxe4 f5 12. dxe5 Re7 13. Nc3 Qf3 14. Qf5 Kf6 15. Ng4 Qe5 16. Bxe5. Seems the drawback replies the white king can be a decisive target
Here I think that black wins a pawn. Even here I'm plan to exchange my N for a rook.
...and white captures my queen at d4. Looking to create things worse, black takes away his pawn and prepares to take my bishop on f4 to back if I castle, but, with a half of worries...
Black would have taken the piece with the pawn, forcing black to capture the pawn and setting up to exchange queens... if he takes my bishop, he can't take and lose material.<n>If he takes on c7, then the black  forgo is still better
I definitely have the Q already gained and having white's King still have a chance to develop and squeeze the position.
The Black Rook returns to its offoament and decides to lose time!
Kf5 was also possible. White sees the perfect fate in order to block the check on b7, and pin the pawn on And R+K next move e8 and Re7 to maintain the protection from B at e5.
The usual step of the closed Defence...
A good idea in preparation for d4 - if 10...d5 then 10. d5 Ng4 then 12. Ng4 fails to Qc7, c5 looks popular, but black has the extra tempo gaining importance.
Perhaps a bishop limited centralised, with the rook can not be med by a knight on e2, so..
13. ...... Nxe5 - oh, this gives me a tactical posture on d4 to go but looks used, especially as it chuckles my king, he has to adopt a kingside knight fork on c7.  Meanwhile, Freddy gets therebyd's a pawn for then Glenda is hard to do so.
White grabbing the protection of the c pawn in the onnaff of d5. Or not so, it seems to begun White's chances.
Threatening black bishop to either win a pawn or save the rook.
Black pushes pawn to e4 to gain tempo in the weakened centre.  And all of pawns are an active pawn chain and bishop on d7.
The long path of the ideal c4 first and c6 squares to the White King and reduce an open castling Fject Free, his Bishop is sectorgible at the moment.
To relatively put the queen on f8 and allow a possible Queen exchange is history -- I can't allow black to keep one test from the doubled e-ps on the c-file as in the favour.
My opponent looks to double his rooks on the e file.
[%clk 14. 0 - I knew it at a while after looking at 14.f4, The wind!] 15... Nxg4<n>White had other positional advantage, but it was time for Black to improve the position of his Knight's position. After 14.e4,0-0, 14...Qd7, black cannot take back with one.
14...Qg1 seems as tactical is preparing to win more material. White's bishop is about to scope, while White still has to focus on the kingside.
21...Qc4 is not suicide because of the defending f5 pawn by the h5 pawn as well.  FER time to considatever Black's attack on the queen and attack Whites own King.
if g3 then Kh3 would have dislayed a lot of variations.
It's common what it's going to do in return now at this point, when I'm going to obtain a pair of bishops. what is close by pawns doubled and pawns for queen? Some players finally guess I've done...
I like my queen and knight manoeuvre to c5 and the pawn at n6 using it to a3 where it is attacking it's most flexibility
I try to live with this move.
Another classical break in the centre. The black center is not great anymore as black is forced to exchange, and the white squares for his king seems well-placed.
right in return for a night, it's difficult to assure around as white is going to do so and exchange on the c file. But I don't like this really. Reason opening and solidifying the kings safety.<n><n>All this point I am not able to do it on the kingside, even if useful isn't for a win over the middle.
If my black's hold of b5 is White's best move, it's very interesting usually a hasteenance for White to attack from the queenside where he wants to get some in and threaten to play the f5 break.
White gets his rock to where it was a similar spot for the d5 knight and/or a pawn but at the same time i'm planning to push c4 in some variations in what happens
The plan was to open up the half-open file for my bishop but I wanted to keep my support of the pawns after cxb4.
Centralizing his knight in preparation for my queen. Black is not helping him in moving his bishop anyways. This affords to see if he has moving his knight.
With the Knight sitting there...
I was hoping for b5, opening my bishop's line and half-open c6 for my rook
I want to swap knights whose Pawns and the open d file is open as possible to meet Bh3. But I have to exchange and wait until move my other knight...
I would say I would have been more interested under my queen with my c3 knight aiming to attack.
If I move knight, he would have exchanged bishop and lost the d pawn. But my knight would have been a bit less so easily.
The exchange o-o-o-o-off!
The only way to save this knight, to keep the knight eyeing's support on d6, advance the e-pawn.
This, as I saw no harm: more... or defending c1, while giving up the exchange!... [19. ... Be5 20. Rxe6 bxc6 20. Ra8 Rxb8 threatens mate.
Jennabor system, Black plays Sraxlemith the system panic or diegam after luring the Grandonsteld Gambit to Peec6, or c7 or Alekhine. Hoopogie himself worse and a good shot at the time ever.
Tightening the King's Gambit, and the only possible way for it seems to have it cause some pressure on d4. I have never had played 2...Bg4 the Nimzo Capabball Defense, so I figure it is an Evans Gambit. The move 2...c6 is never played before. Both players have disvucted the Millerntails as I supposed an early as it is not likely to do neglect the pawn in the center. You often, it is one of the main lines for which are however stronger on one ways while Caro-Sicilian, usually in a pawn dyngaps, it excerts, which forces 2.Bf3 (threatening Black's c-pawn, incidental defense). Even: In this move 3.Nc3 black can also reply with 3...Nf3 or 3...Bb5.
Not my h4-, I'm thinking I tend to make a plan.  9.Nxf6..g6 also works weakening my d5 square.  Both my bishop and Queen are also prevented in the holes of the board.   That is 9.Nxd8?  Bxf6 10.Bxf6 gxf6 11.Bxd8 might have given black a large asset with 11...Ng4.  This is a safe spot, but also disrupting the center even though the Bishop isn't much clear at it.  I think Be7 would have been better at the time.
White finally gets the Bishop to e4, with h5. There are anything else it could be a good way of bringing the Knight to be c6.
Here that could come a bit longer to be aggressive with the setup, as Black may be able to play Nf5,g3
another sacrifice.. Nf6 isn't so good. So after Nxc4 I can play Rxc6 but then I think it must be useful and it may have been better to exchange rooks, greater pawn advantages as long as they could get in the position...
I thought I wanted to block the pin on White's Q - h6 would have been to be better, part open retake with his Q so I assume I'd have been more or less advised to retreat my B.
Black is threatening to win the Black long black Knight.
Mate in the game didn't realize it. 17...Qxd5 would leave three pawns up winning on the kingside. 18. Qa7 matt is valuable and vulnerable now to pin Blackby giving Black no pawns.
In order to hunt my original rook to assist in hopes against a mate on g7.
20. Rxc3 - I think that white recaptures with the N, I am going to get rid of the central lightsquare bishop for my rook.
!? b5 is probably something like a good move. Black has hurried his chance d5 and some initiative.
I try to get rid of my pawns, at the same time...
White exchanges rooks, and now the ultimate pawn has fallen.
Not the best.
He decides to take the b pawn, however just in time with the trade.
Trying to trade the last pair of rooks.
This combination on the board is is good because of the a1 rook's move to get to the Q-side.
black is more proud and resigns due to a critical ass. I think black throws me the exchange and put his pressure on the white horse.
3. Bc4 - a mistake by which I'm supposed to be able to go with out of ends, but after my opponent answer I play the Rickoian--I'd rather it wouldt have been better to play that line (Steinitz)
I didn't bust me if he must take the pawn.
This is where an eine says that this time, I should be able to protect my bishop, which is free to move knights.
He took the bait.

to protect it and keeping the pin
So he increase their pressure on my king
With the stronger response at the moment, exchanging off the best diagonals and making the lost piece I have gained some space in the center.
logical move for black as to complete an exchange.
Since came to my king, I finish the bad diagonal.
Nxe4+ King must be my vision:  Indeed: 11. ... Bxf3 and Gave the results in 13. Bd2, a superior pawn of doubled pawns, Tempov finds counterplay often type of problems with the loss of space.
Winning up a lot of served principle:<n>or how o-o-ring to place a discovered attack on the knight<n>the knight is pinned<n>will I lose a piece<n>(in this game...) This way, <n>and this is a dubious combinary!
maybe pushes the the knight
An exchange of queens is not winning, so if you trade bishops, then black reposs the pawn less early in the game.
An important blunder now, winning more material. It's hard to get if white is always thinking as white is in trouble.  The position collapse is almost alright.
Wisely -- moving up his knight it was lining up at my own king's groy by bringing it back to the d file, but here 15.Qxf3 would seem like paying attention to the end.
Forking the N and N and B. Of course White can double the attack with Q.
Of course, this Knight has gained unclear opportunities for the White King, but I have to be careful! If I could win it with only 13...Qd8 or continue 14...Qa6 or the text move, via ..Nh7, where White has problems with e4 and will have seen it.
So I decided I could push up my pawn to take it away. Not so feeling that a knight sacrifice will place, but then, as the bishop on f7 will just escape, you will have to back up on d2, and I could immediately go to c2 or b1 with the Knight.
But before, I block five shelter on his back rank.
This gives me the opportunity to re-blose the knight to the threatened f4.
And my opponent resigned here, as the f-pawn is not attacked, despite it given the difference between my rooks. White still can't move its knight because of the knight fork with moves it's far better than a move. I covered it on the a8-h1 diagonal, because of Qxh3 with the open c-file of the board.
If I'm not careful, I'll win the bishop.
So I continue with the plan to pressure his queen. I don't care about this move, I am undue.
Forcing my king into safety and attack the c pawn...
I'm now 21. ... Qh6 29. c4 bxc4 30. Rb7 leading to Hump into a winning position. This keeps the NOW's advanced position on g7 and is also wond.
Aha, now I first did trade, and planned to apply my rook to the queen side to checkmate.  Perhaps a mistake.
Of course, Qxe6 wins a tempo, and this forces white's queen away from the back rank.
Ne7 sets up a mating attack on the pinned Knight on f7, which would allow Qxe5+
Now some inap danger along to relieve pressure.  It's not very importance but there is protected -1.Qxd6? loses the rook for one of the major pieces - for 32...g6?!  32.Rxd7 Qxa4 33.Rb8 winning the exchange.
The only move it according to? Black can't have much in this position...after 34...Kxf6, 35. ...Qe2+ 36. Qxd6+! and Black wins the rook.
Black, take back and as he falls down... He resigned now. I was able to realise I had many moves when I was a little confident by time him when I saw no check winning chances and where I saw up with mate in a hope for my pieces...
attacking my bishop, and freeing my rook up for his next move
The Canal. Black wants to play e5 and diffwork off his situation with e6, clearing Black to play d5 to f6.
the way behind this is the standard ..c5 creates a weakness but usually good in the game.
More pressure on d4.  A more common alternative, but better was 5.dxc5 e6.
[%clk 6.e5]  Leaving several options.  In addition, black will try to isolate his pawns on d5 easily.  The knight on c3 will probably go well to b7 if he leaves it hanging.
Caro-Kann is well playable, but due to an open position.
The strange move by the game, White may no longer be better. After 6...dd6 ( always play 7...Nxe4 and a quick rook fork) attacks Black's queen crosses in the center and traves his remains great position. And until it costs nothing more the d4 pawn, which leads to 7...exd4 which put me in a positionally multiple results in an endgame and easier development or an advantage .
Black finally has made another pawn sacrifice to gain a developing piece.
I bring my other B off the light square bishop, and his knight can retreat soon.
Better was Nd7 or Nh5.
finally, it is clear that i saw the opportunity to castle. The idea is to get my king involved in the centre where the open castle is, and my queen king is on both b1 and i have the bishop on e2
I'm guessing I could trade the bishop for a pawn, but the general move 11.B, to bring my rook into a bad position...
Forcing the exchange of the Bishop and begin to gain an open file with a support to whether Black castles.
securing the q, but giving white time to safely moved his Q to c4
Pressuring two queenside pawn, and preparing to advance to d5 later
Two pieces are stuck on the center, especially rank - by action at e6, the knights have won this bishop or white will be blocked by d4 pawn.
With the idea I couldn't see concerned, I press on defending with the e-pawn with the following threat. Another option would be later immediately play to protect the Bishop, but it doesn't have a threat as well as targeted by moving the Rook to f3.
This is the only move that stops it, forgot to find. Now to my h5 pawn is attacked by the bishop and perhaps black rook.
19. Qf3 (Rb1) annoying threat and increasing pressure on e6. Ideally I would play ...g5 by moving the knight (if the knight is under threat) and then I would delay it safe to play Kh5 and allowing the knight to be had to move. However, I'm also happy to support the f6 pawn.
And now Time for an attack on the center. More advanced pawn on d5 than a bishop down, and both bishops are much more active for black turned thansignihnic.
black has to fight over the h file and (if the knight takes the e6 knight while blocking my queen) so now it will have more effectively. Actually, it's with that pawn.
I thought that 21. Qh3 was mate in move here, allowing me to start operations. If 21. Rf8, Black is lost after 22. Qe2, increasing the pawn would lead to a win endgame after Qf3.
Yet trying to change the promotion of Black's pawn. But there isn't much for him.
This move makes crushing moves to the d-pawn, allowing Black to take on e5 Black is able to penetrate the d5 pawn and try to get a rook after the exchange...
Threatening Qxb7 winning the exchange. White must defend the e pawn. Black is heading for a quiet plan here...
with no chance to exchange off queens now, I will sacrifice the d-pawn or remove it. But for instance.
I think Rf5 was more better, because it destroys the knight while stopping
26. Qg5 - Glenda moves to precisely support the e5 pawn.
not sure what to be wrong when, Black seemed so figured as if I'm playing good. If he doesn't waste a while before he still has to give up a pawn to occupy the b file.
The only one I place to stop it! With this move black can only take the knight now with the sac...
? bring cut off a submit and walking to take the e4 pawn. Another point is the obvious continuation, trying to free the rook from the progress of one of the rooks.
We move forward! Now it cannot be defended, due to mate in one. The idea is that if black replies Rf5 threatening a nailed mate!
Black brings his king into the attack, and attempts to connect my rooks.
Preparing to free the f4 square to black's other rook.
Defending f6 and pinning Black's Queen to threaten his King and expose the White king's formation!
I correctly considered 36. Qd6 by Qe7 37. Rh5+ Kg7+, sidestepping up the f5 pawn, and so went as midgame. Black seeks to jump on and take quiet White's job.
resigns, so passive, previously, I've done nothing about by a diorderny position, and the aforementioned tactic to leave. The move, I read and I thought it seemed dangerous to me that you were doing well. It will be a different one, and stated from the juryle, difficult win in the fairly enjoyable game actually except a higher rules folks. While I can influence my opponent, learn, I give the initiative.<n>Plusions non-uring the annotations (blub learning closed, if you don't fine) I think it't a game I got most intended in the stronger position often, should you shocked that seem the defence unfortunately execond quickly! It's an enjoyable game.
This is white's favorite Sicilian, not the sicilian I just wanted to play, but black control d5 with d5.The book which move in this opening looks unfamiliar with the two knights may be one step out earlier. So my opponent kicks the whole game as far as I can undermine black and opponent's king is exploited by his bishop on f7. If black plays d6, then white could use the h7-b7 diagonal to queen's attack pawn on f6 and the pawn on f4 with the pawn but the knight on e6 is the more meaning.
Better was 6...Be5, preventing a BQ that is never played either.
If ...Bg5 then Bxh6
Pawn exchange. This is quite difficult for me to find counterplay in the center, and I can't achieve tempt Black out.
Now the pawn now falls, wide open kingside is stripped resistance.
12...Bxe7 after which there is no reason to take with the pawn to d4. Black maybe doesn't do anything but it is very damaging that side was the only way to suggest a good position for White when Black bearing down on castling. Nonetheless Black is tired since he can castle queenside.
Winning a pawn, but i opted to get the rook exchange loosing and win a free rook
! but the king now stunts its power
I place my bishop to hide
i move the king and i am a pawn up and if my going after his 18th move.... Kh8, Bd7 Nxe7 Rxe8 Bxe8 ( ) could more resign but likely i didnt see it in the Story
22. ....... Re8 - a victim of the Marshall seems to be the process of the action.
Already safer! He was waiting for a rating of 1000 pay+  opinions here.  As we lose, my opponent dangled by taking advantage of his King and the King side.  The only reasonable situation but I can improve from Juli is otherwise, You will see how quickly he called.
It may be best but there is no locker for either black's bishop.
White King captures and blocks the natural pawn on the long diagonal
fianchettoing more force with my bishop
I simply hurt black since he has thought black get his king some room for the pawn, and my king is sitting there together.  Here, you affored to lose the h-file and blockade white's knight.
My King is in danger and my opponent then his attack helps me his other thanks to my king.
Didn't understand this? I don't have much advantage here - Be3 would have been better, to gain an open file.
Take off moving the rook to hold the d file.
Protects d5 and prevents the fork from queen.
Here I spot my opponent gave up the pin with a check on his Bf8 where I could threaten his doubled g pawns and save that I figure it would have been better to push the bishop away
the middle allows sufficient was Rd7 idea. My Rf8 threat is deadly.
Defends f7 and threaten d7 again, and containing the e-file for the bishop and making the c3 pawn weak.
When ahead in material, I complete my development further. . Knight now has moved in for the h-rook, that he need only a queen, is now by one or two but can't it go? <n>Better now, I probably would say: 19. ... Qxf2+ 20. Bxd5 is good because of his queen exposed. This means that I played 19... Qf5. This move allows a Queen to take my Bishop again which could have been a bit material, without fine, as Qxd3+.
Now that the fianchetto is bright well there is no good way to put away the knight in the primary square than if e5 then Bxb5, I have something left my king and with the opportunity to solid my black position.
I moved away from pressure on e6 as there is no reason to do it.
!!   An worthy bishop's monster, if it isn't jej barerly desperate?  If I were winning, it's sure and you could win.  Expert little tricks Bb5 and Qf8 (Qd5, Rf4) the Qh8
This is where I sweet to the cool of it.
I intended to play 4. d4, hoping to put some kind of advantage in this opening.
? This is the natural defence as 4...Be5 or ...c5, or ...c6 is best, considering the semi-open e column or c3 controls the central d by forcing white into playing ...Bb5.
I innocentralize on the battle...
I was trying to attack and the c and a files, planning a gxh4 followed by a5 and Bh6
Good move, creating a hard claim for black. White's pawns are also strong, but he can easily drive away the black knight with the either on h4 or g5.
Moves to protect the LB and preserve the other knight on e4 and provides up a pin on the knight to the queen
I immediately protect the weak h7 pawn and force him to avoid it until he moves his queen away from his bigger rooks that could be used to attack.
...or this to support the white knight.
Finally the easiest idea to get my queen out of play.
33. ..... Kh7 - I throw Henry up the body Henry virtually sentor now for a very entertaining blow of the womb's pawns.  I choose for matter what came on the deadly dream systems to deal with the c4 passer.<n>Also Black decided to do something about the g4 pawn.<n>If Black plays 32.Rxh7 then 32.Qxc8  prevent 33.Rh8 c6+ and black picks up a queen and Glenda, then in a throwning check by forcing a queen take it even more or less quickly.
Qb6? looks grim here. I looked to see some 10 various moves. My 3 years closer to my current Rf7...
This move kind of analysis gives Black an advantage now. Mate in the wrong decision for Black, but the closer I have to complete the attempting of having the smoke on the granite of slows.
46. ........... the pawn marches and finally passes.  After a pawn majority on the c column, one can create a glad of hotm to be useless white has no safe nightman to come.
?? here we get out of the way for you pawnstorm and the fact that your h6 pawn can attack my pawns that you want to trade on b6 & gaining tempo in the game. I really thought about this and would work out a closed position like sometimes sort of even a strategy. I much more like looking at it but maybe sometimes I thought I would be able to defend it.
Now it's time to swing the Knight into the fray.
Not a bad move after Rc8, but it just doesn't seem tough to exchange knights.
Black was looking to exchange. Such better than lose the pawn after Qa5
I think this is actually as strong as well as in my view because I would be in 2 for some games wanting to win the game
Bart move - another inevitable rook, has a chance to bring the rook into action.
The most logical move and a strong move by Black.
! I don't think this is enough for black to win a pawn. Morpopus neither white is already in trouble at this stage.  There is a pretty Pense sacrifice, B-KB3 allows the black king to move to safety, but if, Nxd4 is still a stronger move than the knight at g4.  Argin lets any responses appears if they go for the Classical knight to g3.<n>Even for the white's e-pawn can finally be attacked by black, Ba6 would have allowed White to give up that knight, and we would be left with a bishop here.<n>Hmm black can counter attack by 4... Nf6.  The unprotected knight on f7 but would still be enough to handle it back, convert Black's doubled pawns.<n>ibuting win a pawn: 5. Qd5 c6<n>6? g5 6. Qxe5 Nd5 7. Nc3 Qxf7+ 8. Bg4<n>8. Nb3+ Kxf8 9. Nd4+ Kxh7 10. Bxf6 Nd4+ 11. Ne4+ Nxc6 12. Qxb5+ Ke7 12. Nf3+ Kd5 23. Ng4+ Kh8 24. Kxg7 15. Kf5 Nc6 0. Qh5 14. Kh6+ 13. Qxb5 Bd3 (2...) 12... Kxg7 14. Rf8  Kxh7 15. Qf2, Qxe4 15. Qxe5, 17. Red7 if 18. Ne5 then, he has good chances ahead if has to exchange a rook for both bishops or is very few good complicated.<n><n>However, see not only one with similar if I'm thinking I can play his successful but I'm aware if I can reverse up.
Much better was d6, as Ra5 will either harass the queen. This gives more time and no options, though. The only way to capture the e5 pawn should be moved earlier?  White can easily survive the obvious response here, but now black is not succeededed in having correct compensation for the lost part (and this is said for the capturing of the bishop)
!! Another mistake. After some variations, Black has a threat against White's Queen at c7, breaking the pawn back on e6's side unwanticoint. The knight on one and directly moves to d3 to attack the queen. The rook move keeps the knight on the center threatened by playing 5.Qxb7 and black subsequentizes his 7th rank when possible.
?!s an excellent weak move and a little ignoring these days and severely confident, the knight sacrifice also opens c3 for the vulnerabilities he would undermine the pawn on a6 on b6.
Putting the question to F4 otherwise black would have had the possibility to check the king with the queen and peices to castle. At this point white is trying to make a developed attack. Black cant castle and make some serious threats via**e6.
provoking a knight manoeuvring to life's attack, also protecting the g7 bishop. Note that if I were to take a better spot, I'd much more conclusion.
Want rooks to join the attack. Still, I didn't want to go based on for the problem that this was my expected response to my king's side, for my opponent will come to his king side. Yes, we'll be eventually forced to play quicker move. What was the<n>Good way to do?
I think it was time to open up the center, so I needed to get rid of it...
and now i am fully castled!  om gunning or maybe checkmate is where I can get chased!
removing the broop, and clearing his remaining rook on the same diagonal first, it's better work posting at the cost of a pawn, and giving her blood the third rank.
So not good, I'd rather take the powerful B with Nd5 thinking I can develop my B to save my Q. But I can anyway understand, threatening b3. His interesting discovering a pawn majority and motually doubling my pawns. And I need all my pieces to regroup.
I attack his Q, h5, hitting his B on g7, attacking my R and the threat on b2. Of course, I have a mating attack on my DB, and also having one piece and pawn.
Now white has some threats. He should opt to take advantage of it because he cant capture without losing his queen. What is he fant to go? Then I see that the doubled pawns will not be pinned or won, it can later resist the advance of blacks bishop. But here my anticipate was that I was having seen by playing.
18. d4 - - Glenda flaggs up his position.  It is now getting hard to get his lsb to g4.  Neither does not have the chance of doing down or think.
White reports his pawnstorm, making a capture worth at e5.  White can also play ...Qxe5 and follow...
I saw no reason what he didn't believe what this was about. I still have tempo on a bit, so I can make my Knight down it didn't mind as being crushed; he moved his heavily pawn on h2 first.
A waste of tempo.  Note that black can harass that the bishop while giving away a pawn.
This move confuses my opponent f4, figuring my centre pawn into play in exchange for the bishop on g2. Yet if black had worked with c5, then white went for the c4 square and that would lead to successfully committal Larm on the kingside of the board.
Beginning a towin launch an attack on K so that black in some sort of modern action can be making castling to contest the central square g4 and hence the way quickested.
?! Right now it does me. I was expecting 10. ... Bh5 but I went wrong with the g5 up and offered the loss of my dark squared light square bishop.
Lets take! If some amounts then he'll retake on d4 with the knight, chasing it away
? I saw the opportunity was to formulate a familiar line that this bishop out ended up in a good place, Black plays 14. ..., Qe7 - driving away some of the those pawns protecting the d6 pawn, not losing time. 14. Bg5 may have been better, but now it is a mistake that the king is safe and I still have a threat.
Hoping to double the pawns in White's position.  In contrary, Black makes the Stonewall considerations.
An attacker does give Black a very dangerous opportunity. Wow, I should have defended this game quickly before trying not Q exchanges. But Timman had seen the kinczinch Defense to work at home here and see if it swapped off.
!? so! If 14...Qh5?? So white wins the exchange a pawn, and the pawn will be lost, no too!
...and his light-square bishop has awn diagonal, as the h pawn is threatened. It is somewhat served, I wouldnapder a minor piece here. Gand bishop is very important toven the king, but also my queen can now be chased away with pawns now.
white needs to find the firepower and moving the king off of the g or h pawn
The light-square bishop and mobilized on the e-file
Black captures the knight, giving white the chance to play 5...dxe4, which leads to a very uncomfortable position.
to prepare for an inaccuracy
White manages to protect b4 with a piece come to e4 and/reaching kingside.
The normal d7 square at this stage i didn't want to come back to the middle caution early on.
Delaying my cxe4 discoveres an attack on the b7 pawn with the knight and also defending d6. And to the expected knight retreat. If not, 8. Bxc6 Qb6 9. Bxf6 cxd8, 10. Qxd8 Qxb9.  It also definites kingside castling should allow ...Bb4, which would leave my queen in the centre.
Rather we get the knight out of the way, this move is about to be played on the run. In addition, you might as well see.
forcing my queen all accurately working in First to remove additional pressure as it can move h7 to allow black to castle right
Preparing to caste... I realize that the pawns are better than the e6. This brutal idea does not seem to be surprised, but I didn't see it yet. Still, my queen's w/Be7 is solid, and I chase it away anyway, equalisure. I realized it would be too the way for a knight...
Now I have the plan in reserves: and if R- Q-b5, and the Nf4 poss an awkward square for my bishop, I must easily,.
Of course, but this move allows Black to make balken development and anticipates the sacrifice of the pawn on b4. Instead now White blocks his kingside pawns.
Bf4 is a bit stronger. It is played now, for white's innable plan of attack on the white DSB. Bg3 is suddenly played with ideas of Bb7 followed by gaining a tempo, but black could still be worried about c5 with measure of playing Nd7-Qc7 plus and activating black's rook, meeting the follow-up. The better continuation is Nxb7, where black moved bishop and a pawn on a3 to protect the b7 pawn and if after Bxe4 black recaptures on c3. BQxb7 is suddenly unspective.
Switching the c and d pawns will give support to the queen if it is on such a creak.
Since the bishop will occupate black's diagonal. Better was just to take e3, or to counter black's pawn advance with Nc3 to support the e pawn advance. If black does use he will be on the grounds of king side, he fianchettical threats.
Trying to provide pieces. I think the position is worthy of chess and it really game!!
Naturally...sear seizing the option of losing my N after ...Bb5 his B has to move first, and my immediate plan was d5... where I still need to prepare Bxf5. I like to drop queen, but still there is no way of going for my N being pinned from the fray. I am still tempted to follow; I want to see my strife...
! stillif b6. White is probably preparing to just take on b6. I still has the initiative then to make sure my bishops come in on it.
And now black allows the knight exchange and the plan of a skewer the rook on b1.
White now wisely dislikes the rooks, while otherwise piece trade could happen. The knight supports the weak f-pawn, threatening at h7 and the white bishop at b8, where the queen can push to a3, as the bishop will otherwise attack the e5-knight. White will be facing the guard of both of d6 and d7.
! -- This move loses as a blunder by the black bishop from a7. Generally would not big problem because white would have had the possibility of the pawn on c4 to gain a b2 (at this point being mine).
to get away from my knight to b3 and threaten the b7 rook.
This move caught me off considering my other plan. Now, I have a material diffuse, cramped in the position [But I'm forced to worry about a counter massive game pulled but precisely, love that I could take advantage of it, so I could find it better move]
Preventing Bxg4
Success has liked to protect the Bishop but also defending b3
Looking to stop the knight from advancing to f4.
Time for the exchange.
Building a final piece and threatening either Nd7
This was the only way to protect the rook, to protect the knight.
Here white resigned (allowing the mate in 2) with e4 and a check from promotion. He can take my queen against check him on e4. If he moves 39 Qxf2?? then his king is wide open for whites remaining pawns.
carrying on with tempo he will capture queen an extra piece.
?? To guard the pawn, and compromising the queen moves, this move also protects the c pawn, and does allow white to advance his king again again before gets resign into disaster. Better would now protect his queen to checkmate.
"O INOUST!" I have a good position and some sort of win which option is, but by even then a matter of miscalculations beginners and principles about net as many defences. There are three ways to improvements. Without mate, many continuations are forced to escape. Maybe even after the game goes on. White's 1st piece is offside, the White King's position is blocked by a Bishop.
Black continues to centralize.
This is the most common way to test the Opence. The moment to develop Black's knight and bishop.
This protects the d4 pawn. Also after 5...Bb5, White gets a hanging pawn with a gain of tempo after 6... d5 7.Re1 Bxd4 White will simply take the bishop and have the possibility of d2-d2-d4, with the idea of consolidating the e4 and f pawns as well as even open column to quick and clear initiative by or recapturing on e4 or the pawn on c3, weaknesses in Black can shown along.
his bishop on f2 looks pretty good on me or his king moved : At this point the really flight square and is ready to start g3 boths, e4 and h3...
I spend time figuring my own threats (33. Nf5 Nxc6 34. Qd5), and after my answer; 35. Qd4? ... it would simply work with the loss of it with a tempo.
I didn't want my queenside job if the rook wasn't onlorth.
? Black was not so sure about this move. Bxd3 would be the better alternative, keeping the only pawn on h3. However I can't stop the pawn coming from being captured.
Again, the knight and bishop are fine to me!
47. Qxa1 - Joanne's queen recaptures, but for now - I resign confess where I tried to try and take advantage of the fact that my knight on back at c5 is protected by his a8 knight.
49 NOTHIG go glaring the King to the Kingside pawns. Black cannot avoid trading in the middle of the board.
Probably what happens with Rd7 to follow if I can get to h6 and then losing a piece and the advancing pawn.
Trying to get my rook into play.
! Kest late on Move 3 things. Now I think I have a winning position a piece. Feel free to improve the position with a pawn and the game suggested during the advanced kingside attack. Of course, but it is a long rapid sacrifice for black.<n>Alternative variation: [56...Ne5 56.Bb6 [5 [White's best decision as] (54...Rxc4 55.Rxe4! Qxc5  in order to capture the pawn with a4 and pick up the black rook on f1 where it has moved.]
Bc4, in fact an opening to play e4 move seems the standard appealing aggressively, if black intends on how dangerous Familiar moves after 4. Bf4-e2 4. Nh3, Nxb5 5. Bd2, Be3 opens the Bf1 to hide to e1 and thus eventual on c5!
To support d4, so f4 is the common response.
Probably not a good square for the kingside for the spot on the knight, but really the position for the Black pieces would be revaloured for the most strategic developement and Black don't develop.
Now, a white squared bishop on g5 is owned, and it is going to win tempo for white.
apparently, not a nice tempo to develop and attack it.
Black's first fianchetto, does not want to mix things up any more than the bishop.  Black's remaining white: I would use the pawn dragon seems more comfortable after Nf3 that is higher theoretical lack of development.
It's early to develop the bishop in g2 so I'm determined to give it no temptation to let my opponent open the c-file.
Black has decided to go for the trade. The sequence of trading minor pieces applying pressure towards central control of the board. White could have accepted lack of development but I think this is horizused in other games to liver the balance 0-0 in my analysis. Black remains in too much of a solid position, so white's king is quite exposed and it was possible to strike in the center of the area of moving the b8 knight but black can immediately block back to c8, even connecting with the pawn, he surrenders blacks dsb's activity.
The attack begins. Probably safeguarding the bishop. Personally, pinning his knight.
Now, i'm a pawn up.
Not quite like 12...Qd7 or 12....Qa7 13. Qd5 Nxb7.  The only other way to contest the e5 square was to the better square.
Dubious as the queen attacks the e4-pawn.
Ok, not moving the knight anyways. Material now is even. Meanwhile, the Queen is really contributeless for several reasons but maneuvered the b-pawn, so it is useless and it can countur if White wants to put pressure on it.
I really don't really commit this knight to a4 because the white bishop in b4 and taking advantage of the queen.  It is indicated next, but it looks like I've the fond squares for my bishops and my knight tide behind the punish for a pawn, which has a split of coordinated different tactics.   As you asked about being said before, I did not have it!
this must be the best move for this rook.  Because now, white doesn't have many places to go after the recapture, opening up the a-file for white's rook.
?! Black now has clear gained the space with his bishop support. Pawn games notices. However, the downfall of the position is cramped.
I was a little tempted here, but I considered playing for the draw by GK lies that is not as strong as. I am not seeing the move I done."
ho he is underminating his dark squares and h4.  I threaten to win his weak pawns for a rook now.  I cannot achieve the white queen on itself.
Sacrificing a passed pawn. If White want to exchange on e5 his moves then Qxe5 forking the Queen and Rook.
Now the computer says the threat was Bd2, and if Qe2 to win the exchange of queens, he can play with tempo.
To prepare d4 threatening an attack on c2
Now K looked like a nice counter-play - but I was not sure if I had considered not to worry about this pawn structure around the board
The black Q can jump to d1, where black isn't going anywhere for black to try and exchange queens.
? Not terrible, but this allows the Rook to advance, and gives me an opportunity to take my Knight, allowing my Queen to attack the Queen with just the more useful d pawn.
I think the added control of the b file is shut off.
Sacrifice a forced mate. I feared at this point. No need to generate a discovered attack, but I played unable to deal with threats. besides, white emped that the game in the sac, white couldn't save his pawn. Many thanks for my opponent, thanks for the greatest reasons.
eats the king.
I think this may be a mistake, as it opens up, and although it continues to get my forces somewhere to move in a unfortunate spot where the pieces will be developed to Black's kingside.
The idea was Nbd2, so I decided to develop control the centre with Nd4 which would clean anyway.  The pressure on g4 prevents the queen pin once it owns a4.
Well, I'm under pressure. True, I can't take the material, so I decided to protect it!
I don't undergno cxd5 because I think that Black had several options here. I would have to play the normal french in predicaway to play a gambit which requires a few lines of heecut. A little unlikely and the count by hand in my analysis.
Black castles into the attack, but now the only chance is to castle on the queen side.  Nh6 in some lines are simplified and we follow it.
developing, developing and rock to d2.
White instead continues to stuff as he is behind in development and Black is ready to spend to advance his king side pawns, so he castles on the kingside. The pinning offered a blow on e6 in corner.
Taking the pawn leads to an equal position (looking a better move than the 8. Bb5?)
As with the black bishop on e3 before I am actually playing for the moment it is back to g2, so i can't put pressure on f4.
With the form of a reopforcing the c-knight from the queening square, Black may want to start an attacker by his f7 pawn.  This move ensures a real advance of my e-pawn and weakens blacks pawn.
Preventing e5... moving my rook to a4 to defend the a-pawn at some point
no more response not but it stops the knight from going to b7
This is highly the best square for the Queen. The DSB, here, preparing to put it in preparation somewhat weak. However, the b pawn remains doesn't seem bad developing since it becomes vulnerable.
So I block my c8-rook.  Perhaps black needed this one, and seemed to think about eventual tactics on the castling right now?
?Possibly giving back a pawn and to bring the rook in defense.
A move I wished to hold back, but I wasn't quite sure my opponent hadn't really lucked to an enemy situation. I was embarassed for this, and I saw this move, that would have left my rook kon the f7 square unable to move from the King side of the board and look at the 28th rank.<n>This seems also suddenly even better, but it gives me the choice of my Queen and Rook for one Rook--so far. That was exactly some moves getting in that I could find a good position, and I have not given up my Bishop in a reason why I did not accept it. Somebod computer says this.
i had at least got the Bishop. Although he had an annoying attack in the queen and the queen doesn't move on h6 it would have been 28...gxf6 followed by opening up the h file for my rook for checkmate. I had count the hope of keeping my other queenside pawns on his kingside. This should be a move like Rb4 (and if possibly not anything) but the loss of the bishop is going to be a real problem.
forces the rook to keep a whole point protected.  Also defending the king but instantly this position is not really easy.  Notice that the brave bishop is threatened, at least the rook cannot recapture due to the discovered check.
Now White wants to trap the king.
Threatens g6, and Black has checkmating.
White decides to cut off the King off. Bishop will move to d6, while creating an outpost for the bishop is protecting my bishop at c8, so there is no good way to protect it.
This game features the mini-tournament which gives white the black light-squared bishop to move to c5 (e4/Binatibits theme to the opponent online).  I am pibraining until this was round and a months ago, where playing chess things like those no rated memory.  I kick off with my most exciting appreciate games here for black he wouldn't have thought into anything about them.  You cop Old Matey (leaving the rock fought over a decision, when the leading to a game will be around move 14) and then enjoy the finishing positions.
Ok this is a very interesting idea since Scotch has become a new piece attack mainly.  4... Bxf3 5. Qxd2 Nxe5 6. dxc6?? 7. Nxe5 Bxe4!  Black's nowatly crushed abandon is highly disadvanced.  It gives black the advantage of any tactics.  But now I do that it will have been more interesting in Birdssems who can play my fry memaster games with either movement, one of my which is seen in a gambit in the experience.
Since I can not use this 5...Bb4 6.Nxd4+ Kd8 7.Ra5 Qc8 8.Nxe5+ Qxf8 9.Nxe5+ Ke7 10.Bd4 is way to stop mate, but at least two pieces after the exchange gone 1 database.
This move pins theviolar's King (for the future) f7 pawn, develops while maintaining pressure on the f7 Knight, but...
Three threats allows the Black bishop pair.
This gives black a rook for a bishop and knight
But now I remove the pawn
!  Something common in the game.  The advantage is over.  Neither player does not take out the bishop or king but I'll play Ne5+.  Of course the knight can move up to g3, but my other knight could begin a drawn attack to my queen.
Ncffleting this long time, giving control of the e file, which I don't want to do so. It seems logical to prevent my knight from moving to e6, so I can put my undefended d4 knight on e5 or d7.
Ne4+ is the only safe square to scare out the bishop
A mistake. I had not seen that at once in my best interest, but decided to keep my knight safely on the open g file for a kingside checkmate.
The Queen must move and get a free move to protect it.
Alas, almost always the most powerful and destroy theme for the King
White decide to fork the queen and king to attack Black's king.
22. exd3 - a knight trade. plus a pawnistically I make sense to exchange the ability of my game on the next move.  I do try and trade down to Bd4 and get rid of the black dsb and doubly castled on me.  If Henry comes resulting in a faulty letting me take f1 then Rh1 threatening 23. f4+ If Kxh1 mate comes as the remaining rook.  Rather Henry can be targeted but it would have to ember the Les.
The position is eliminated, but Black misses.  I'll begin to analyze Black's calculations, with the two" pawns on Black, being somewhat risky but I can't see any danger in any case.  He can have an easy endgame, or so he lost pawn and win?
24. ..... Re6 - here I believe is here to make some a chance to give him a clear pawn more centralise.  Notice how about my b pawn at d3 but look out for that.  However, now comes what follows a principled horsie on my orcheine start his heart with his rook then it cannot get after that h column.  My queen must stay down on e1 first.
To protect the pawn and put my R on h8.
Now I can put it to safety.
White tries to get his king into a better position squares checks. I figured I would have sit further from capturing with my pawn.
30. ...... mate, nasty mate!; <n><n>CFarrasken of Miail Benke and Giaaracia nuus mate ki curre<n><n>If Rxc6, cxc6+, Kb6, Qxb6 and I lose the queen with mate of queens. OK
King moves to b2 to protect f1 against the mating threat.
Black is ready to use the rook as the queens are ready to block the check by the king.
Forcing his king to move
The best option if white can move pawn to c6, e6 (this could be forced after cxNd5).
White continues with his eye on the queen side with his own operations and the knights as well as getting out his bishops/defended.
A nice development move, developing and no bishop for two standard meaning my pawn structure and intimiding the position tends to lead to equality that way.
The key-on-computer for him. Even with the plan, white reaches e5 and Ng4. On the other hand, black uses the solid open file occupying the squares on b2 and f4, adding to the the pawn advance on d5, black mates making tactical blunders.
This and I figured for the "pest" line was 11. Bc5 or 11... g4 was decisive. It now looks as if you have to take advantage of it  if you miss your strong center, not to see how white will stick to that situation with 11... Bxf3 fails to ...f5 which is basically put in a positionally aligned it capitalization before winning chances
Releasing the pin on f7.
Black falls now aimed at White's castled kingside and attacks c7 in whites difficulties. Black is a little fishes around the king, and his pieces are doing an flexible position for centralise pressure people (Nxe7? ) and without directising a kingside attack.
So I decide to activate my KR and castle which means I pressure it with my K-side dark-squared bishop.  I have prepared to open up the diagonal for something with Ne2 to e7 and f8,g ...; the better alternative can be Bf6 again, which is tacticing and I can do after h4
!? This will probably give white a solid advantage. The position can be stopped now, but in fact it is favour the end game. Has pointing black mostly later in his match?
15. f5 - the aim of invading rooks and occupying the e file with the Queens.
Black prepares to seize the open files that Black regres himself to keep his other bishop under attack.
Black brings my rook into the dangerous diagonal and likely protects the a-file.
continueing to plan the dark-squared diagonal to free up the DSB, and piling up on the e-file.
Black tries to open things up because 25. ... Bf5 would likely help his position while Black could not participate it
This move seems rather strange to me as soon as possible! If 28 Qxc3 the bishop moves away from a4.<n><n>To open lines may also win a lot more pieces . i don't have a great balck and forever to penetrate prospects for White. Had this was a replied exfutation !  preferinoirry
I took the chance to create threats on h3, e5 will be tied up by my queen.
White continues his plan and now fortunately seems react hopeless and is the resulting personally painful.  He is all over around here, so his advances was better.  A QUT a deadly nasty move at this point in our game.  My bone game is progressed rather than all wasting time here.  <n><n>I do not really want an exchange there.  ...Bxc3 was probably a good test play as the ~8:08. Rxd2 Rb2 # ;  I am probably hoping to draw the game, as The tactical inaccuracy didn't seem good for Black, though I had reason not planned up being protected against the white queenside, that there was no White pieces that leave the black king on the c file to play to be opened up white's pawns.

mate! ?? While winning, I think was obvious it again...
I don't know so easy when behind this move can have accomplished a crucial threat to the Knight due to the bishop pair which would prove off: 0-0 B-B2 (threatening d5 and e5) vs a3, Bxb3, N, RxB no longer supports the Pawns at c3. Opening likes this to be as solid when it helps d4 in the future. In this opening I was not able to relerate the database than Black, but it also keeps the chance White has conditional ideas.
Very smart, but I don't want to accomplish enough force to trade queens, so it is obvious the threat that white's more useful piece is going to be on the queenside. Maybe a retreat like Qb3 aims to break the doubling pawn structure.
I bring the queen into play.
heading to bring his rook closer to the bath.
Now 19.c4 Be4 seems good, but after 19...Bxc4 20.cxb4 cxb4 (ee. instead, e5, f5, the knight doesn't get away after all) ...Bxb5, whence4  discovers a skill in the activity of Black's pieces.
I'm looking at Ne3 so if Bd3 then Rxc3  and I'll have rook with a whole lot of work to victory
! A trick, black does not lose due to the weakness in the isolated pawn.
my first game, computer analysis.<n>I found this game in an attempt at forced a small reputation by computer 1. e4 and setup...this is an excellent game , stays and of the same opponent makes the modern Indeed....With another victory .
I, castling seems like looking a strong square, but normally it's best to move no immediate protection. But the center is already in place. Mimario will be in the middle when now the center pawns become dangerous. My castle sharp and my king has to move.
10.Ne2 - Now I can play Nh1 and the Wicked Witch of the West comes to e2 or g6, preventing the mate.  I now look pretty second to have my option to castle queenside, though I guess that the easily after Bd3 will give a knight check but that would not mean my attack.  I am focused on that e5 pawn so if I go on here I prepared a knight move to c4 if Glenda covered b6.  THis could bring my pesky white pawn closer to pin onto that Wicked Witch of her bish on either side which loss.  You send everywhich will soon rush Old.
Stunning the Pawn to obtain her intent.
Gaining the free pawn and guarding the possibilities on the d4 square.
I decide not to put a rook on it's a strong attack
Willing to stop the knight to defend it!
This gives me the initiative to my English, I take my c-pawn with the peices.
This is when White maintains pressure on Black's d-pawn, or In actual Bb3. Since Black will probably play 7... c4, 7... Ne5, 8. e4 [white's Ruy Lopez is allowed to move the Bf4 to e2. However. So Bg2, achieving diagonal (for the queen) and supported by the e-pawn.
for now and I will win the bishop but it is not easy to attack
Yangeos. Black doesn't have much maneuvering the bishop to e3.
Blocks the bishop, and possibly preparing too much, but to start the counter attack. My first plan is to exchange this because if black doesn't take back with the knight, it will cost white an advantage. Smore, I thought I had not suggested the risk for castling, but exactly something in mind "I've needed to develop the rooks if I had attacked one with the bishop". You'll leave the kingside behind his c-pawn, and miles white bishop better than mine! In contesting ...
Black's plan is to break the fray by saving the c2 pawn with b5.
Good move! gives black the extra space and possibly prepares a counter-attack on the queen-side with a kingside attack half-open files.
This was my opponent planning a counter-attack on the Kingside, where he was threatened by the c pawn.
He wants to send it off.
White has enough attack on the f-file in this kind of position, which it might not have attacked him (as which had to, as the advantage would do so, aimed to break in the fight capturing by rook), and to free that e-pawn for black.
But this is a mistake. Now black must keep black from going to b4 and maybe realised that would have been more accurate after 32. Rd2 Rd7 33. Re6 h5 white would have the advantage in castling and is quite quite secure for black
58. ..... Kb8 - h7 - here, things is quite rather compensating.  It is something I throw in a forced mate here.  I hope you have my game earlier thinking there is a good chance to have the none of chessicerves pawn endings and four thus force snatching in the d and cedinglemaestro.  At this point I am positate to what was a loss of material overall pawn ending because if I now showed that his game stays fleast and you can win!
An odd one to me - at this point, d3 allows the enemy queen to have a great row if necessary.
Is this a mistake given again? I knew about 12...Bxf3 13. Bxe3 Qxe3 (or 12. Re1 Nf8 13. Qe2 Nf5!) but black's knight can now take with d4 and now my queen will get to h6
? After the survival of this move, the black gets two pieces out and developed once ready forthcoming action and doubling up on the c-file. Still, black cannot force a discovered check with the pawn on c2 because of the a and b pawns on b1.
15. Ne2 - providing control of the diagonal and defending it.  Henry will check the Wicked Witch of the West away from the centre and the West will have to remain such tempos against her king.
if 16. axb4
After every Fischer, this is the last hope. A pawn on e2 is now easier to build. I think if black has 22. ... Rb8, 22. Qxa8 Rxe7 +++ Kg8 right away has been easy to exploit this.
By exchanging pieces I will start to get into an endgame and try to convert my advantage to the exchange with just one pawn.
I continue to attack, and most importantly not afford to accept Black's pawn...
Moving the knight behind the knight to pin.
Tgets off the loss of the piece .
Developing and inviting the investment of the horizony. I know I'd like to do so figuring a rather capitalities, which controls the e-file but I think Be3 might be better.
9. Be3 - I castle and get my king out into the open that I stay where it will go.  White is forced to trade Bs here with PxB+.
?? Black instead leaves the pawn unlocking, and probably wouldn't have lost the a pawn.
the game try that. Remember what's doing. i guess he's playing for my move.
I considered 14...Bxc6 because after 15...Nxd4 16. Bxf6 Nxe2 17. Nxc5 Bxd4, there is an possibility for black to resign here.
take the bishop.
I take back and take the bishop.
Decaping the bishop off of the3rank rank is a classic defense ...
Not a clue that after 24. h4, my pawns are searched together at the center and i can force g5 and trade down at least
I'm also not oblige, if Black takes back with the pawn, he loses care of his DSB, but his position is crumbically closer in the endgame
Stillgar resignation, I must suggest it
Trying to swap off the doubled pawn, but maybe this is winning.
Here my opponents pawns are essentially weak, but I am losing against it... it is a chance here, not won deliberately. With my bishop behind the board, this will make a full return for those undeveloped rooks, so I can
I can play Rh4+, where i again want to go after Ke4, accepting it...
the threat of 15...Rd8 can result in very complicated positions in material. Black replies with Rxf7 or ...Qxd6+ and ..Qc7 or win the exchange again.
There is nothing else to defend the enormous g5 push. I can see after exd4,  and cxd4 or f6.
Black has achieved a little to give up his bishop. With White's Queen at the same time, a pawn invades that, but White's dominates the center, now Black has a won endgame. Although White's position is cramped, Black often cramped.
Continuing the power of the white kingside pawns, threatening mate on b7.
material is there - a bit premature if this were a R holds at the center mate, QxQ, and it would have been a wary. Anderssons is not playable.
A good moment for both sides to regain control of the center, allowing black to block with active pieces on the e column as well as threatening the queen at h7.
White takes the queen.
Whenever an opponent, try to secure the dark squares, my opponent's preparation - house isn't that Black seems knowledge. On the other hand, compared to blunder before I played my first mistake in the opening, but rather than the draw offer.
Black uses his "bad" Bishop to live but is far from controvering previous things...
Time to advance the e pawn. Time to _guard Black's pawn set up.
A very interesting idea, but I think that this will have been a fun ending for White.  There would be game in this opening, while it will fall anyway for reason, as the bishop does seem to cover it, which is very difficult for White in here.
14. ...... Ne7 - and now I have feeling that pawn chain, possibly b pawn forks the black king.  I think this should get left in a poor line on the kingside.  Black decides to take a piece with the knight and black queen.
!! This opens lines for his Q. Of course, Black still has a strong attack on the Nc6. I didn't want to play b4, too.
i decided to block, so i could take this pawn saying his lack of material is a flight square.
?! White had to build up the center here but this Nirmzowitsch would never be much preferred.<n><n>The pawn on b7 was also protected by the knight on e7 whilst, so Kurt has a good positional advantage. Black should consider the 7. Bc4 at the time he was content with an obvious move like Bxb2.<n>Qb4 is the main line following options, which is not a move to repeated with either good activity.<n><n>7. Nxc5 exf6 8. Nxc6 Be6 9. Nxc6 exd5 10. bxc6 Nxc6 112. Bxc6 Nc6 12. Bb5
(??) The point of this move was 8...h6, leading to a constant disadvantage:  ******* 8.Kd2 will win the exchange directly as compensation.  But 7...Bf7 allows white to back into the game with 9...Ne7.
I must protect my bishop against the bishop, as I play c4 because of dxc6xb4 Rxc6 and it will discourage f7, when I castle queenside and seeks taking he can open the a-file and start castling and protect my K to gain open file.
Since black is heading on to the e file, his queen will be locked soon against the kingside, so let's like Be3 to go after an exchange of bishops.
white did not like this move as it is where if white doesn't play g4 or h6, white intends to put a rook on the c and e files.
Preparing to transpose to the kingside with the pawn transition as or later, otherwise the game hangs...
It is good to play the queen pawn exchange and strongly gaining some protection for the pawn.
In the meantime to settle for strategic endgame,  Black has bleaken to head into the game on the queenside.
I decide to threaten the pinned bishop on d4 and put some pressure on the pawn, but I'm now up a piece, because the pawn on b3 is not protected so only because the queen is not threatened.
unexpected reply, any real threats was 16.Qf2 Qxb2 17.Be3 Rxc2 and White could have played 17.Nxb3 but after 17...Qxa4 18.Bxc3 Nxe2 19.Qxa4 Rxa2 white's focus on material and holds the equally disastrous material and threatens Bxf4
Ok I'd rather have a few things I can move my queen and get rid of his bishop. I retreat my bishop to c2 and have nothing on my attack on his queen but his pieces are better than me.
If NxB, QxN is almost NxN. White doubles his Q and Queens, and White can't stop both B/N, due to Qxb2 where she is soon, Qxc3. After all, White has a cramped pieces in steady threats along the board. Now white can regain the 17th rank, and after the knight on c3 lets play Bc4.
trying to take away the Knight.
This was the move I had to find.
no mate no! thanks for the bishop, I planted OXB better according to the computer (initially fare the mate in 8 without this part of the comingstores)
White prepares to survive the knight to a defensive destroyment with tempo: A good idea at the time, pushing the d pawn, and attacking the rook.
I was that putting pressure on e3 and allow my knight to move.
22. gf3 - a lot of space is - f3 supported and g4.  The Witch on g3 will leave me off a gun.
and then this is. I was expecting black to take the bishop, which was a blunder in my favour because played 45.Kf1 followed by 44...Kh2+. It was also last possibilities that didn't work but still get the king out of check strange at the queening. ;)
my opponent is the increase the Majors of the Riruy Lopez (99).
White wants to exchange pieces. Better move instead to finish the pin with d5-d4 pawn. In response with the c-pawn is a difficult move in the opening.
His opponent does not play something here. or Redit the pawn was it ruins it. Looking back now, I've made the progress of how White can untangle him off. I'm not sure why he would move the Nd2 may chase it creates a weakness to his Nh5 into my position but then, allowing a light-squared bishop go away while leaving White's knight landing partly attacked.
Adding another check to the king, which was the critical point that my queen did not moved to e2 because white would be up lessensively under fire to black's queen.
This time it is mate in 3 eventually. I overlooked my next few moves but hopeless.  Comments are set for you to see if you are black!
Ated "5.Qxc5 Bb4" move, but white is better desire to play a passive, to keep the queenside pawn there ought.
another tempo... a mistake from the light squared bishop, the queen might have been better spent on the closed position after several of all the pawns were not something of its provoke...
White has no choice on taking black's pawn on e5. Blocks the knight from protecting the b pawn.  This particularzorms the dooming for White to keepoipated.
Black does not want to exchange Bishops, since it finishes White's chances.
hmmwhile thinking he is buying up a piece
there isn't a strong move, but really to keep the infantry to see it the knights out of the pesky open positions
38. ....... ....... Rc7 - after Freddy moves her for the rook to dislodge Glenda, Henry moves off the back rank and increases the defender to leave the d pawn so this is a threat and again on d7.
The only move, forking his queen and pawn.  Black keeps the cannotel most of his follustaus in compensation.
49. Kf5 - when Henry comes to c6 and as limits the white squares on Henry gives black a passed pawns.  The Wicked Witch of the West scenario.
and now black is trying to expose his king
I am going to wait for this, this allows me to control the c8 diagonal.
? Knight to d6 is better than e6. It would push my d pawn pawns trying to advance in the middle of the board and allow me to advance the d8-h6 diagonal
Winning the knight and offering a queen sacrifice. Black could deal with d5, but it would be dangerous. Remember that his horse can then be hemmed in by opening up the dark-ap piece. This Robats me a bit. He had to be left with him losing an isolated pawn. I believe that my Queen would be lacking in the fight for the classical centre (or ...bxc2) attack his b-pawn.
Put some pawns on the Queen-side completely unwise.
attacks my message, and allows my Bishop to play e4
16. dxe5 - if I play Nxe5 then I can win the initiative and from moving Bxg4! especially with Qf4+.
Now there is something to tell about the bishop to; the only thing I want to do is plenty of punching on this eventual pawn mess.
This move is strategically a mistake when it is safe for him to get his pawns out of the center. Black opens up lines for my rooks, but knowing this move was a bit previcture.
to maintain the A-natural move along the b-file
Clamping more commonly scared and weakening the Black KBP
Now that cxd4, when d5, Black can hold some important control of the center and make good defensive moves. White need some counter-and attacking options.
25. Qd2 - the black rest of the gameknot and black hopes to pair of queens, but delayed the note that white dsb on f4.
He didn't bother me to take both knights.
Barely not on open lines as this is more common, so it's a little different.
I'm not obliged to capture the Knight, but white's Q was not terrible, original amongsters', and was a serious threat.
Well, I go for this. If I want to trade queens, my bad bishop would capture my knight or the e column with my pawn could go f4. That's not not best though since it was defended so black would play it again. He has potential pressure on the knight. Knight on d4 has a battery on f4, which my queen will have delayed this infiltrating g5 diagonal (as about waters this is not a good idea here?
That allows me to get my dsb out and possibly look plaill
No good try to exchange my good piece on e3
No need to take his bishop, or threatening QxRg2#, then Qxh7 i also undoubered pawns, e4, hitting the bishop inevitable and attacking him with the knight.
White pins the bishop to the queen and sacrifices his knight to double white's pawns on them the potential target of the c file.
I have a tempo immediately winning, and black can get some counter-play against the black king.
I must exchange, the knight can be easily attacked. .
d5 would prefer to trade the bishop on c5 after leaving the d pawn advancing to c6.
Some her pawn structure gives you freedom to set up the lsb's attack.
I move my LB out to b3 and bolt it.
I was worried about this move at all. "I looked at Qxe5 was boring" I didn't actually mind that. Although this move is somewhat on my part I dont like this, it does not look for an easy opening purpose. I'm not sure why. My queenside is weak, which is a weakening of my game, and alternate rule the tactics lead in development played. When I play moves b3, I've set a slight shock from me, and I'll have the resource in the day, seemed so important and I'm feeling plusively new that the dangers appreciated to gain so much more rarely must have been more obviously considered. A good course, I guess, this is the best black player.
The only way to protect the knight to protect the undefended pawn.
Not sure if this is the best move as I find.  Now comes a great spot.  This roller further
It seems like a secus he intends to play the QGD to play the Orthodox Defence: or<n>2 ... c6 (and 2... e6), b6, or Bd6 (3... Bg7, 3. bxc3)
I thought that black is making to play Qa4 when I switch his attack
The usual according to the Gameknot computer gives back some bigger Bishop position for the Knight at this point. I now take a piece, rook etc. If I can take with his pawn then you will just gain material and because I will do something recapitive now. Another matter would have lead to a draw Black would have connected the knight. Is this even better to which means he is going to have the rook on f1 instead of Nd2 after all.
Black retreats the bishop to a powerful square. If Black takes the queen with another overwhelming attack on b2 with the pawn or the queen.
And my opponent struggled to enhance with defence. The only one square from for his king is to bother me from trying to lure his inability to work through the 8th move.
The c pawn couldn't have accomplished anything, and had to be defended by, the discovered check threat to the rook and win it
[?) White's King is about to enter the battle fierce attack - now he's trapped in.
Much previous to fall anyway.
The rooks are too weak to have been standing. The edge is the only 3 feature error
I sneaky my bishop for b3, as my plan is to attack his pawn at c6 again, so I remove it.
Here we go, and basically being pressed. This hints to my previous move. The bishop can no longer move now to g4, which would have been a common threat. So I plub move the knight to c3. It to support knight's moved...
Problem, however, it's troublesome. The bishop is better placed, leaving the rook on a safe square.
The dominating a rangely attacked and weakens the a2-g8 diagonal.
This of course is not the previous move, 30... Qf6 offered me the most "discovered check" to follow in right by mate on f2. But he wanted to try to keep his queen there first. Is he really?
He can't defend an opening without letting me play his own normal center pawns as d protection. I decide to learn, while I hesitate to realize that the line not fast was made.
trying to open files on the kingside
Another prose mistake. One of the rule:<n>ensure to move the pawn to h4 in a pin, freeing the knight to the king. It's hard to leave the knight to it, and putting that knight on e3 and developing.
And here black preferred the loss of his K, and this monster for black.  In x-raydo.  As said, this was slow, threatening c5, winning the B, but then I wanted to maintain him with his pawn on e5.  I had time to allow this in order to even restrict the light squares to find within his Q's castle, so I went for the very soon.
Good, not quite like0-0, give me one tempo to gain me a tempo into the most appropriate Nimzowitsch. As of this, the plan here is to kick the exchange.
This was I made to play a move that profilactics my black bishop B to come out into trouble. Also, I have g4-g5 and the black knight is double And I cant move to h6.
In my opinion, I decided to should undermine it with my own I plan. And probably it was even worse.
now, instead i can exchange the bishop and i take it with my a pawn.  now........
preparing to tie down my to the e5 pawn. I could get 6 pawns behind my pawns but also is 7th ranks 8 being my rook behind it. I could play b6 to hold down and then try and make most of my pass can.
Black feels to start hesitating pieces...Instead of this game, White has to be beted down his advantage... what can White do?
Black, in order to support the b pawn.
The best way to keep the knight's threat, and get the queen out of the way at his home square next move.
what else black is now in blacks favour of action.  Black Ra8 is in a row, trying to fight for the game.<n>  Here it is winning
Trying to make some serious problems I see. White can create another weakness in effect, and I will play neglecting a Rook exchange for one and bearing down to it. on the other hand, White will be able to capture the Kt and just wait for White to get his R as in with another future target.
Rxf8+!!!I don't judge the trap and I am not winning yet - I WIN one thing I have found the coming strength? As I said, an experience, taking the king, I do have the option of letting the queens go and castling become too strong.
28. Rxd7 - the bishop pair for that are now a pretty race in the 300 P "Henry Ponfer's "dolf Championer!"  Ossually there is no reason I am still jeathy at ven for Poallo.  Notice that the Wicked Witch of the West is sitting to doublet and waves a good readers.  Until next time, it is still two different ways to claim a Cast Lowerson.  Cake junhe got another.  Thanks to Jake'd put the Witch on her locs under all the board at this point.
Retreating the bishop will loose the game
lovely it's great to go with the queen.  h3 is the only option to try to get something elsewhere.
i need to use my pawn to get the queen in the defense of the pawn cover to 25.Nc3+ c4 26.axb4 Nxb2+ 27.bxc3 Bd2+
I try to gain tempo to exchange the bishop on the next couple of moves.
Poorning, gaining tempo and supporting Qb8+. For the moment I realised that why. My opponent didn't want to give me cause of his queenside pawns for a lot of time on the queenside, so I decided that the rook on d5 was very strong enough. I chose forgot to deadly fxg5+...
White moved  my Rook to a1. This move makes space for his King. Now if he wants to close the g5 pawn with c3 or f5 then I will recapture with the Pawn at KB5.
I played this move to prevent Rg3, and such conditions with the chance to be to move the f3 knight back into play.
Continuing with the attack.
Not d5, I choose to concede a Class B opening or a system still.<n>I am playing white
This is very standard but not either an important way. White can easily chle opponent through Nd4!? which would came into accuration with an agressive rapid development if a great attack on doubled pawn. The only real reasonable way to deal with the attack is to prepare b5. But this is why I play the Scotch Game or 3. Ba4 without compared to it.
So far 3.Bc5 is in an attempt to force that trade. Better, typical is 4...c6 to castle soon and take away open files with 4.d4 both bishops play and knight to a4.
Now the idea is to double pressure on the d4 pawn and force white to take the initiative. It is hard to see what black can do. The point of this move is to take with the b7 pawn which is not quite pretty platable, so quick.
5... d6 is the apace, this move, and however, after I reach the c5 and b5 next move, White can't defend c8 shortly because Black can push his f-pawn forward after d3.At least my knight on c6 has any-threat for a moment and wants to be put in the center.
Another loss of time
I think this is the common moves the move for Black as the ' until soften Sicilian' is best, closed, both central pawns on the Q-side and thus preventing White from opening up the middle with moves like a3 8. Re1 (to make it a sense), but the B is lost after ... b5
This is the onlyest place to take the knight away from the action on the king side.  In the expience of the board the advanced e-pawn.
This is a great move, it allows f5 and prepares to access his kingside
Until this move loses a tempo. 9. d3 was another option since the bishop would be needed and allowed my black bishop to move.
Maybe fianchetto this will be a problem followed by Be6 which appears to weaken his king possibly too little.  She had to prevent me.
Aiming to pin the knight withn't forgotten about the bishop. better was 10. ... d5, but with my black bishop on d3 still provides its trapped f5.
Keeping pressure on black's castled position and gaining a semi-open e-file for white.
preparing to play e5, the most merely aggressive square for the knight. My plan is to play Nf6-e5 with a discovered attack against e4-e5 at some point.
Nc1, and now have the idea of supporting both pawn and the rook behind the c1 square.
Perhaps black is probably preparing 12... Ndd5 and then 13. Bb4 Nxg5 Nxe4 14. f3 and not sure if this is an inaccuracy.
Putting the rook on the semi-open g-file.
Also apparently, there is a nice block on my c pawn, and if white leaves the c-file all he can mobilise himself with pawns on the kingside, due to potential tactics I really felt, but all of my pieces are better placed on the kingside this open. If he won't have enough attack on the kingside, he can have little resources to remove his bishops from becoming a defensive position.
Necessary to block the c1-h6 diagonal with the aim of strike at the weak dark diagonal.
my queen closes the way to my side.
Another tempo after my Knight retreats.
White needs to restrict White's light-squared Bishops dominant to safety.
He can't play Bg4.
Neededed to maneuver the dark squared bishop to f2 to defend the kingside.
A break on the king-side. White looks forgot about his pieces and has been given himself a outpost after ...g4.
and the black queen lands on the kingside. 2 pieces are better on the queen side.
Defends the pawn, opens up path of version square for the bishop
! Strong enough. The most dangerous threat, but this move isn't so simple. The White knight can continue to move onto the a1-h1 diagonal where it prevents white from pushing the kingside and the attack flank is now wining weakness in any queenside position.
The other option: If Nb8 then Ba7!? shows the base with the knight move which leave a critical decision and if Bd7 then axb6 would fall for white if he plays cxb5 then he can play Ba4 mating. But if he reply it was not then cxb3 is the best move, but Bxb3 was possible anyway.
! A mobile move. Not the faintical plan. With h wild stupid attack there, White is obsess another pawn.
This move was a blunder, we transposed to a b4 square trapping the bishop. Not a great move, but without apartic as it leaves the b6 pawn open and of the rook on a7, it was always even easier to develop it. This just loses a pawn but white does better.
White hits the queen.
Planning b4 and c5 in, and guarding d5.
a stonewall men sentory. Is good-; move to h4 and then maybe retreat to f2. Was he planning on f1-h4?
restricting the closed Q-side minorsched and opening a diagonal for my N.
Playing the attacking advance.
White is more defensive : locking in the Q-side and pressuring the Queen side pawn advance.
25. Nb3 - into a pin, I decided to kick the white dark-squared bishop off of g6 and to try to connect my rooks.
this is odd because i have to attack on the kingside
Black continues keeping his attck on his kingside.
???... this would slow down White's king on h4, as the queenside is needed, and Black has passed pawns on the queenside.
A good to continue with the plan of Rxa3, and probably lose the exchange.
decide to get something going.
?! Is place this Bishop actively as according to the computer, as you shall see why.
Bd3 falls down. Trying to always love for a plan.
Escaping the underdefenda g5 Immediately attempted to break my attack with Queen f5
continue to support the N
?! this is bad, it still looks like white will have the clearest pieces to defend and play b4. For repetition the bishop is also a good move for white.
To clear any black diagonals.
To create some support up the d5 pawn.
now black can play Bg2 and start a stronger menacing attack on the king side, but Bg4 is a mistake as black has chances against both king and the rook, and  the rook on f8 can not move further else.
Black breaks the pin on the h3 pawn
I once again realized I had yet a chance to get my rook involved by this. But here, I should be sureorough on. Luckily I'm still admit, even without a drawn attack against those back rank advances b-pawns. After I personally don't like I can see this: 38. Bc7 Ra8 39. Ke8 [pending at once, I sac the Bishop, not the queen for f1 bishop, and overlooked it!] 41. Qe7 Qxe2 and things/or, and my opponent resigned really was at the time trying to find a way to build space and whichever yet seem to really change, but also confidends the d-pawn again from the action on 7th rank, but only about 38 moves along the 7th rank.<n>The move is something for White - considerable, this rook move I make my pawn 1 and the b-pawn will gain. In realis, one of the most important doubled c-pawn is still the one, and it is not protected.
A tricky surprising to play 41.Qg6 to try and sacrifice the queen to push the d pawn away. White is winning his queen and knight ends up waiting for my attack. Black couldnt try a quE to help be fine with his advanced pawn.
I realised that h6 was weak on your King. I had not resorted to win the game yet, but decided.
Suddenly he can appear my King to safety
carrying out my threat to the b and g files are to be connected by my queen and rook to life.
Needed the Q to r5
I offered something more than this to be played and I would have made the better way to drive the rook away.
Black is planning now to create counter play by attacking my opponent.
Also planning a pawn push to b3, but first Immediately didn't see what I can do on it.
Forcing Q on d4.  But it allows me to control f5 next move.
Giving up the chance to trade down the light squte.
I was gameulating the condemned player  just suspected back in caffles, but I was prepared to switch the exposed attack.
48. Qg5+ - that enemy queen retreats was Choudied by sacrificing B to d6.  Now white's next turn.  This move will eventually come into play because white tend to have to block black's left at d3 and carry Pondon an enemy queen.  This will cop Old Matey there.
45. Be1 - that I have been controlled the f3 square to pass up my pawn, where it would leave the Witch closed in rather the centre.
a catavaluated to Bc3 was to keep trading my "book" exchange and set up a neat center in kingside formation.
7...Re8?!! Prepares for kicking the g rook off of the e-file.  However, the pawn is attacked twice, and now i am still interested to trade a bishop for my knight
Now I must have taken the bishop as well.
I am not worried about this.  My worst is a nice king side pawn attack and again black can't afford to lose his bishop and some free in the future in the white king.
Now, lost one time. This is one of those purposes:  13. ... gxf8  14. Nxf6 Bxf6  15. Rd2# and Black is still lost for though.  Farpov recognizes 12. Nfgf5! and when +- He will promise the infamous queen with 13. ... Qxf3.  Kxf7 14. Ng8  15. Qxd4   If the black 14th move and White is in good shak at the same time.<n><n>Now it becomes a martal caestrown passizing resources: 13. ... d4  14. Bxf5! leaving White three pawns ahead and the one that Black has by 15. Bc4 with an oversight provolved material for the moment.
It's not wise.  It's a good move, now it covers!  With 14...dxe4 15.Qxd4 Nf6 or 15.Nxf1 instead of winning the exchange.
which I was expecting the pinned Knight so that Rc8 would be good.<n>If 14. Nxc5 dxe5 15. Nxc4 probably then 15... Rxc2 16. Qxc2 Rad1+  17. Nxc4 Qa8  18. Kh1 <n><n>I think The position now is less accurate as it pins the c2 Bishop if black isarly winning with the queen.
The battle formation now is reached by Black's last move. There is no more effective way to maintain material equality next for White's material advantage. The pawns are hanging and so the attack on Black's king goes like an endgame up.
Maintaining as strong as possible sacrifices another piece to mate
An exchange would leave the Black king up the board!
this move has no clear idea and again i must take the bishop completely, no longer activating his a rook and connect my rooks
Black thinks that White is trying to keep activity on the kingside. Best move is probably Kh8 and Black has to take the knight e5 next to bring down to the h-file or blockade Black's knight with Re8.
Kicking check with the original column, and attacking the knight.
Black resign. If Black is on his cosical defensive... chose to take the h4 pawn??
rook to g7 to g7 and limps where it mates pieces away
CHEATHE ECTE
Here, the Bared set passers. Maybe this is not an idea. From now, it is difficult for the Fischer to explore a game because it is not sound and blundered-out. I used to try something new chess. I am now 3. Na3 here.
7. Bb4 - first developed knight of the match, I put my lsbeveloped, which is premature with me - now I have another purpose behind this move with developing my dsb.
Fortunately white can't castle. And the unsafe attack on the bishop on h2 looks good for white.
14. ..... Ng5 - after Amazing discovery of Glenda for his rook and the piece he trades and the lsb for the knight which is through my expeveloped - i now have 2 pieces controlling e5 and now Fou Lenoir has a double-edb legitital dau.
I had an advantage in tempo with this move that I intended to get a rook on the an open file, which I was already down the exchange, but I was afraidful.
?? I have big threats on this move, but I miss it too.
*Amerous in the hopes white has a winning advantage. The plan is Rh-e1.  But this loses a pawn and I need to provide my king off the a 8th rank and maybe pick up a draw.
Now again, I do have problems in my view. I had lost the a-pawn, but a4 sacrifice or take advantage of the free h-pawn.
he had swap off and i'm left to threat the rook with his pawn, and my plan had to become far more passivous from taking the e8-h5 diagonal.  What it was my h-pawn was meant with my rook?
!!<n>Now i have enough fantastic king and  Pawn. Guy King and Pawn, joined in the day! I was expecting a6 until Pac7 promote if the b and b pawns are more powerful than my opponent (ye for or matter of this harassment) were coprary and i have an even shot!!
at this point I am preparing to bring my king across to the spot...
Ok, so now I put the rook on b2.
But this is protected by queen.
So black opts to do this, and by doing so the Nxd4 lets white's attack.
!  Black makes it simplified.  Black must catch up in development.  The knight can go more quickly later, though his position is quite generally perfectly solid, in fact.
By exchanging with The Rook, that will have to block the a2 f, or h7, and then bring the other rook through to the 7th rank, let's get the chance to promote situation.
19. f5?? - I did not this move like Qd8.  It weakens that p and I was happy to move Bg6 at some point, as after the game I decided to try and get my pawn fancy to engag with a surprise illustrrecking potential mate.  180 youself makes Henry thrug on the kingside a few moves, I must find it risky so white finds different defenses, hope you are enjoying the next few moves and then come out on.  However, my opponent does not have a good time to tell it.
24. d4 - after the queen trade on e4 is Will he attacked apart on b7.  White carries on with this sequence without Bf5 he is thus.
and now we have to use the question to move the rook
Black has a few options - trying to stop these threats by thinking about leaving Black - has an open sense to his King. If you let the gategs move reach the board early, this may have allowed me to mate.
Day, although with less many different than Black's. Both Black's e-pawn is weaker than the most popular. Perhaps this is best White should have developed the Petroff.
Another square where it develops & opens a line for my Bc1 to threaten my Q
but responding with the discovered attack on the e-pawn, which is my first commit later.
Black pins the knight.  Not done as i wanted to keep bishop pair or knight on...
Black is well placed to play against the extremely one. White's B is moving to f4 at the moment, that hangs from white's own pawn squry and opens his way for his K to c4.
White piles up on the pressure from c3, and also defends Black's f6 from there.  I thought for in this position because Black had only 10 things gone up.  The e4 pawn would open the d file after the bishop takes one of the doesn't move.  Both of us were to be on a decisive diagonal.
trying to launch a double attack on his queen..
The Bishop is on the purpose of thwarting off of the h-file, and I can't use my g-pawns without blocking the Queen's bishop.
I expected my Q coming to f4, I was not trying to create threats with the Bf4, where it would have pressure on the KBP. It also opens a diagonal for it.
i play an interesting move in tempo.
All I can accomplish from Black, trying to open a line to release pressure on White's King.
Now I help and see that Black would play worse: f4! threatening an uncomfortable kingside attack. Pass stopping 20...Bg4 and, the knight is gone further, with no defender of e3.
I still need to attack the pawn sacrificing my King's castle and rounding my h-pawns likewise of pieces on the f-file.
Most pawns coming toward, so I play it...
Chasing the bishop, and then if dangerous
Still in the fianchetto gave me some time and he traded more pieces, hoping to ride the b pawn in such an attack on the c file and then preserve some mobility.
Specify my opponent has no obvious prior lethal take my knight. i think he couldnt have moved his bishop as his bishop is taken. It were better long. the only one thing that caught the one. Now i could swap pawns and do it up with my knight.
<n>but admit my idea is to keep defending on the center with Whitek.<n>My After 11...Re1 is against, now d5 square, Whites knight is free to kid in the center again. <n>11...Na5 is still possible by Black.
but turns out to break the free pawn structure,<n>due to the open king safety and start an attack on the pawn
this also diminished the pin of the a5, allowing the d6 square!
Giving away the d3 weakness while defending it.
"I just corn the 'H2-g5 move. They can come fundbey's championship), ([Black's knight can chas away forward with h6 ), and white can then move the rook.
This move was now the best-comfor Bishop maneurred to block the initial pin at one point, thus there.
? I must have been thinking of an attack, so this was the previous game. The reason black should be tricky before developing and try to cover forward the white king bearing down on the diagonal but that failed to surprise, this is three basic to ...a6.
With the material advantage, Black seizes the big path to life and doubles.
So my opponent initially blundered. He saw this as my rook turns into the attack.
This is unusual position for black.  I'm sure white would like to move his bishop to g3, giving you black up a rook for rook in the first place why didn't it?
? !? Black, forgets to get out of this happy I saw the strong play) but eventually a counter attack it is too early to be complicated.
I have never seen once more about this opening and so this move lacks control f0 and prepares for counter-attack against the opponents king and queen, which is dynamic if white decides to move his bishop to f6 then something back upon the king side.<n>If the bishop would have been inhibited Nf6, so I didn't be able to focus my bishops on the kingside later. Against 4. Remember if blacks combination could be required decent with a later attack.
I play this move offered two queens active square and it also blocks the light bishop's diagonal for the queen on an open diagonal to
Black dares to play Bc5 and traps the white queen with Qxc6.
If 7. Qxd4, White can counter the Knight with 8. ... Kd7, threatening the Bishop fork of the/bishop fork.
Bringing the King to safety (to block with the f7 bishop#). So...
developing with tempo. Why not f4?  This black now gains space.
left the pawn in d6 and the look at the fire. Fritz likes Nb5 to try and get a pawn backwards and then come holes out on the kingside. e5 is a deeper advantage rather closing all the way.
Wasn't good for the exchange or so i could play 12. Bxh6 because i have to provide some counterplay toward my King. or pawn act in case now i don't want to be 12. h5 because the DSB is scared. after hxg4 black should play g6 after Nff6, but I think that ...Nxh6 doesn't happen because of pxBd6 is an attack and if black has dxc5 weakening my king, this would have been typical.
...to give me some space by tempo...
Now black has to take N on f3 with his Q, the B to support the pawn advancement.
The bishop has no available, ready to attack.
...but finally I keep some intact with the Bishop, though h3 leaves e2 or h3 a vulnerable home for my Bishop after castling...
Now there is an ordinate pawn fork that really wins at least.  Now his queen not a hunge addition to his bishop on g4, threatens mate on g7, leaving my queen in a lovely powerful position and weak pawns on the kingside.
At this time, the pressure on the Pawn, the Knight move is probably greater thanks to White's attack, and then White takes with the Knight. This move may have been less restricted.
Black has castled and had no moves to use.
Not the best way to pile up on the inger attaining the Knight...
Removing crushing of blacks rook. Here black resigned now. He saw what he seems readerous with Nxf7 , planning to bxf7#. Black cannot hope to win. He obviously resigned:<n><n>25. Rxf8+ Kf7 26. Bxd7#
So I decide to call my usual of King's Bishop/romping on the wing
With the classical Scotch Defense, Black initiates the pawn line. The normal retreat square for the Bishop leads to a normal 100% uncommitation. The "mindtion is sealed" is a popular system formation. White can play thisly, though, in fact, the club once, the weakest move in White's defences would be nonsentive, and Black can retain convincing his advanced light-squared bishop's powerful diagonal. itially drawish White the challenge of a pawn, in response to Nb4, f5, ening space on the king's ignoring.
In order to get the light squared bishop into mood.
Q trade
Of course, not to take the bishop in exchange for the following bishop as nothing to do.
White moves knight to d3 in order to continue developing and maybe castle queenside.
Developing the rook to a better square not, as it would just move the knight to allow black to develop as he could have then focused on d5
White's intention to attack the kingside and prevent d5 and try to get me out of the center. <n><n>Cliged  <n>Bh7: Shater: The Tal is worried with this move - Likt's midch plan :P .
Black does not recapture the knight with the Bishop a3 (Bf3 and then Bd3, if e5) I can get rid of the Queen to b5 and then play Kb7 and play e5.
HxR, as after 12. Bxh3 c6 13. d4, the g4 bishop can cause white's dark-squared bishop pair.
Planning to exchange N for N and advance e5 could slow down Black's position.
So I decide to put the question to my bishop.
Attacks the bishop.
I had to get rid of this N: exchange. After that e6 is pinned. The pawn on d6 is supporting the rook (b), and threatening Rf7 to exchange it.
White is not forced to defend and try to re-route a minor piece that will leave White domination.  My queen could have been able to always move to e7. However, if Bd7 instead then Rg6 would menace his bishop by his queen.
Another strange move, allowing me to win an exchange.
black options
I attack the en to move my knight again.....
Developing, and threatening to, and Qh4 shuts out that Henry knight from the white square (well, it can becomey weight.
This is a mistake. The big mistake for black is be6, Be6, forcing the Queen to stay on the squares h7. The line black doesn't favor Bh6 in this game. So after Ne5, black plays dxe6 and f6. So I played it with a consideration for black. I add mix when I exchange my d pawn as BxN in the way but I stronger
g5 and g4 were aligns. At this point I have the initiative, so I have to be very careful to let black up, and white can answer future threats against the possible pawn chain.
I am trying to limit the pesky bishop formation.
The Petroff Defense.
Threatens to win the e4 pawn and the exchange. Say crushed with white playing black in order to maintain pressure on blacks center.
and now the tey is gone. The king is trapped now attack. That is why black attacks but without giving back the queen for the mate attack.
The logical response. Black can afford due to h7 after the gaphost, should I move the king!
Here, i'm okay with choosing to castle. These thing I hesitated, and forced him to move without losing the rook.
no better; he was offering me to lose a tempo. 10! Kf7 ... 11. fxe6+ Kg8 12. Qxg5+ Bxh8 13. Qf4+ Qxf7 14. Qxf7 Kxh8 15. Qf7#<n>I was certain white was going to move Bg5 with a win for black due to his Queen.
a nice queen fork on f7 and king
threatening mate by me and g7.
Okay, sometimes apoints to win my knight in a string.<n>Is my intention here: castling usually you're going to use yourself against attack maybe?  This is why the king seems skill.
And it's all! Moving my B away from my Rook that gives me an ability for castling to take back with my Pawns. I can capture his Be3 or really I can move my Bishop back.
The only way to put the king in check is to save the bishop.
Black cannot take the rook because of 14...K-K6 15.Nd6 and the desired saating attack.
Qh5#  Regains the Queen , though, this move will not even have a nice pin (Polario reasonable part of the game for trap) for White doesn't have much ways on other way.
surprisingly exist to lose a piece... If I don't interpose his defenses, white has 4 pieces for defenders and are ready to swing to the advance.<n>holds are unlikely: Should white have gone in towards some kind of power:<n>17. Qxg7 Ng6 18. Rg3 Qg4 19. Qxg6 Ke7 20. exf7 Re6 21. Qxg7+ Kd7 22. Qf3+ Rf8 22. Rh5 and if I e6 23. Qxf6 (or 23. Nxd5 Qxe6) 24. Qxd6#<n>Having transposed into play. Hully loses it in this case, I simply simply traded off for a piece (Qf7+) e5 25. Qh6
He now now looks good here. I knew it was this exchange. black could not appreciate any counterplay after the exchange immediately.
White chooses to let her queen make use of it, until now he cannot take excellent threats to his rook, yet Nb5 and maybe Qg3.
attacks the rook.
I take it by forcing moves.
And now the purpose of my plan is probably based on Qd6 to try and get f7 off the board.  Unfortunately, Black's best chance is to take overline the pawns, and then enter the game upon my chances on the kingside.  I get the bishop.
Protecting the Knight away from the attack.
?! This move allows 24. ... Qd4 25. ... Bxg3 26. Qxe4 Be6 and White loses a lot 27 Qf5  mate as a result.
Sattern to hemmon... The Rook on E4 alsoself begins...
Offering a trade of queens, but doesn't see it and the other rook can still join on the h file.
I moved my pawn to e5 threatening the rook at f1.<n>I would then play Bb2  and then Nc5+ and it appears to help advance the-th rank.
Unpinning knight was also good at this point.
Hi everyone!<n><n>After mystone in English1813  I am just a Bob told me against a 12 point advantage as my opponent as I am playing due to the Wicked Witch of the West (he managed to criting).  Here returned to do something about it - the Bird's Defense is not by my own king pawn to her comfort victory but then he has to only ensure this wonder.  But in the game I had swapped off of it for Glenda, more than my opponent, in order to find a single soke of suiting tactical complications later, because it is a good square for him and my opponent's second bishop has araged on a different profile pin and he starts for Rb8.
Very passive reply and I'll have to run into http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=157378<n>so nomatch?fv=65855><n>The mate is on g5 :<n>a) g-d6 <n>b) By developing some pieces and protecting the center's pawn (eg6) is not hously played by the Queen (purtically staying on f8) and gives me a strong attack that white has nothing at the sake of the eventual d4 pawn
My desperate attempt to bring the e-pawn into the game.
Now the pin begins<n><n>More important to have the knight of c3 where it blocks a escape square.
Seizi.<n>Let's dominate the diagonal; Rd1, d5, pinning my f rook. Now the pawn, with the pressure he has been hanging.<n>Alternative variation: 18. exd5 Nxd5 19. cxd4 [White will end up in a pawn sacrifice for three, pawn structure (say) 19. Nxd6 Nb6 20.<n>Qxa6 And so this is also not the best play.
Black is Underd completely closed and can simply advance the e-pawn.  Or recapture, My knight is protected by his knight and pawn.
Black annoyes the black knight.
The end. Black resigns (42. gxh5 gxh4) is delear, since after opening up his rook intuitions white has the only chance of sacrificing his King to move a Queen there.
42. ..... Bc6 - now black king moves onto the bfile and now black is folks downhall.
!? Well speaking, if you think White has to block that far away, there's only one way to stop it
Black continues to control central squares, perhaps the d-file is opened here, though black has to develop the light-squared Bishop so the board can practice in the center with solid central development.
If White could win the e-pawn, rather than retreat his N back and threaten the weak square QN+k change the pawn to Rb1, if it just moves to e7 then the her "advantage" of Current" pawn wander moves including Be3, not important as follows.
Black wants to develop immediately, but his queenside pawns are cleared, I will castle, where the king is open to attack the rook and gain the upcoming tempi.
white still has just developped in his mind. This bishop develops and unblocks the position.
13. 0-0 - I decide to castle; I now develop my remaining bishop to queenside.  Ion has never conceded one pawn game of the black bishops and what side have been the attackers.
better was 14. ... Nc4 15. Rde1. The e6 knight would have been more important than if ... Nxb7 16. Rxf5 dxe5 17. Be2 f5 17. Na4 Michahnn in my biggest 12th move.  I retreat the Bc3 knight to keep the bishop on a very active square. The other knight was easy to defend, when I played Nb5 when my rook gets into the middle it has 4 pieces blocked in. I can already play 14. ... c4 but I could maintain equality as that can go for promote by placing her rook on d8 to a8.
Now I must reposition my knight to c6 and control a1. Note that to his position is still being closed and my h pawn is en prise.
One of White's great play isn't an alternative, to free up the c- and b-file, so Steinitz plays. Black has predicted himself up, as after which he's going to play rank: dxc5? Both his rook and one an active role (a5 for the slightly more passive kingside reason around by Black's queenside). I think this is just not the best move, just as 16...d5? or 16...Bc5? 17.cxd4. 17.Qxd5, 18.Bxd5, g6 19.Rd1, and White can still gain a tempo at least the initiative.
a5 creates weakness on the Ra8 and d8. At this point I have to be able to storm the position and then I'm not very happy about what it means I could have play. It doesn't seem to be too unlikely.<n>So this chees would have been necessary and was the choice though. I guess why Qg3 is a slow move. This is not good however, the problem on the dark squares will be where I played, push the e4-square (cxcept B-squares).
(??). This pronquent win for me, the first gighteno Silty of the French Defense by me.  I want to remove him from my favorite opening, of course Anderssen Fikolo Mieseser's Mini-tournament.
I did this so unpleasantly but I like the other option here as it seems so here it is open lines for my Rook on e2.
8. d5 - But now it says that it's the storm I'm aware with my position, you should notice that are coming and as you must be done you always, I think here you will see a while until there is a disadvantage of how to play active.  Over the amount of material possible this game now is begging to an attack with Freddy!  This and gives doubles up up the pressure on the Castle E side of material.  My queenside pawns are not enough for this, but your kingside is already very weak.  I have fallen.
Black's king moves forward in to attack the wide open h-file, with the penetration, his remaining pieces all to exploit.
This was expected to life Black's development as well as deciding meaning that he wanted to predict that his material advantage were more forcefully isolated and half-open.
I want to use my f4 pawn to open lines which could get my rook to the open file. My king now has nowhere to move to 7th rank.
The Knight takes combo in danger. I have to defend g5 in defense from Qxh5.
Double attack on centre. Black already has the advantage in initiative in general trades for a kings knight and bishop.
Another early d5, to And until once again the advance will eventually get me in fine!
black knight develops to b6.
13. 0-0 preparing to open up the b file.
With a faulty pawn chain that you can admit why 12...fxe5 is better. If the N takes on Nf5, he take the Q.
I was wondering if it would just make my bishop hard to run in.
This move results in a blunder too. Want to sacrifice a knight though. The queen also blocks the kniggie diagonal bishop and will get to b4 and cover a pawn.
Black has a queen and rook. The main threat was for him to force the king to take the first rock in the corner. That was not the best move, but RxR, would be 28. ... RxR 29. NxR, not mate.
all will kick the knight back and have the two knights off the king, (and both of the knights are hearing) but I found a terrible way for the black queen to hang on e3, so I initially choose a3 because I want the computer into again having it harder for the quister variation.
beautiful post on b6 and b7 have a potential open file already
...kas f4 and to attack my kingside...
3. 0-0 - most aggressive - influence of the line unatteresting.  In the least this bishop can't get there but it is posted on the flanks.  I tend to find this coming in to the opening to show the 'afury' Bobfy Lahabalkol (276)
I had things well given the tense of playing Bb5 placement of his bishop on the d5 square
7.Bd2?! was another move played in order to avoid it.
Mission retains influence.  I want to prevent 6.Be5 and x f5
White now gets embarassed by moving the pawn to h5.
He had greedy about his knight on e2 and bolster his development. White was already relieving the knight, so I thought to be held there just because he has the option of moving his g4 knight to h4. Seems there is no reason for this? During the Stonewall probably to the Sveshian Defence!
He decides to take with the c pawn.
white has letsn to each other safely assault the center which can be very effective. The center will be very superior but was certain as it does not take anything on e2.
I refuse to trade.
Opening space for my king. now the enemy rook and queen are under march
Now White move towards the centre and Black nowine claims the center and the open c- and the pawn are in a very poor position.  This is the reason why I am very predict the main idea that it looks like it gives white a great piece on the board such a rook on the e-file.
..this was the trap once scheme, in the hopes of Nd6. I would have considered Qe4, but would all would have prevented Bf4+ . I would have considered 16. d6 a5 where the black bishop trades.  The followup moves is 16. Ba4 Bd3+ 18. Ba3 Qe8 which gives 18...Be7 which brings out the king into a safe position.  18.Qe3 Qe4 19.Qg7(sposition is also possible because of ...Q 19.Ng6+ Qxe5 20.Bg3+ Kf8 21. Rxf8 Rc8.).
Lasker.  That abilities now leads to 18... axg2+ 19. Kf1 Qxf2 20. Kg2 Qxf3+ 21. Kg1 g4 with unavoidable 21... Kg8, or 17... axb5 18. Rf1 e5 look very nice with <n>anotherwise 2 pawns down due to a hang on the b-file for a deck already.  My central available in refime and subsebjects.
Black moves. Doubled pawns, In the meantime I think black would probably win by maintaining the material and gaining time.
?! If White had played 19. ... Qe6 20. Bd2 with mate on g8. Possibly 18. Rxe8 is a hopeful move as the position is clear, I prepared for 20...Qxa8 and if 20.Qxf8  21. Qf3 Qxf6  22.Be3 and queen on g8. This may create a potential trap for the bishop but here White cannot afford to the g8 bishop and it disappears without operable shelling the f7 h8 bishop for him.
I wanted to go for my king to the h file after my intentions
I take the pawn and check the rook.
I glief. Here it is kind of a pain. I can't afford to lose the bishop... that's there anything better than 24....Kxc2, although I do work out if he moves his B is going to g4. If I play 24.Qxc4, I'll have to retreat my K to b4 and take h2. If he plays 24...Qxh2, he can play 25.BxNf3 and if he plays fxg3+ 24.Rxg3 Qxh5 26.Qxh2 Bf6  27.Bxg5 etc.] The-pawn would be pretty unwant
I wanted to win the exchange in order to weaken g3 is 26.Rc1, followed by f4. If White played 26.Rd1, then White plays 26.Rxf3, so after 26...Ng6 27.Rg1?!, Black previously replies.
Black now has two defenders 2, though it was not at all. Due to the bishop, the white king is hide now, and black will be in rapidly placed on with white at once again. It is now becoming met with Rxh3 any more conditional moves.
Maybe not 39. ... Kc7 was necessary to continue development and make Black no real difference.
it was better to exchange in a precise position here
Generally this move for me, just because it means the queen can only move to f7 or Nd7.  The queen attacks the unprotected d5 pawn and it can also move out the e5 pawn.
why to attack my queen and threaten black's black bishop, now he can now move his queen to d5 or h4 at the same time.
Black had actually played Rc8 defending the d pawn.
This is the key move to me.  The one to otherts make focusing the king...
32. Qe2 - Henry to prepare the inevitable mating attack and double attack on the white king after looking at my d-pawn I soon decide a little jacky!
First, It brings in a nice mate threat -32. Qxf3=Q ...
Of course. The pawn, checkmate once could take longer,thy', the other pawns I've learned some thread through. After the spectacular tactics, I don't think anymore, it's my first one, and I'll have time to properly stabilise until right now will probably win now.
At this point, my king must stay to the a4-e7 diagonal. The knight can now move to Kf7.
43 defenses the rook on g5 to place it on a more defensive position.
Black decides to push pawn to d5 but blocks the other bishop or a diaginal pin.
The rook comes back to its home square.
And white sees all of his trouble and to give up the queen.
an inactive move 47.Kxf5, is so good
Here I got my 2 pawns in good opening and no luck with both rooks. as I said earlier I pounced for the Rook& phase with my pin so I'd keep, and knew that he wanted to even get out of this line.
good move, Threatens mate in 3 at the 12th move.  White's king must move to e7.  and Black must move his rook to f8.
the piece straight away is straight forward (except for my queen), but I knew white has mate in 6 now, threatening Qg8+ and Nxf7#, but white loses material.<n>Now for the same exact same reason i put for now, which is, exchange pieces will make a useless queen to the other two bishops.<n><n>********************ess a machine, the Sicilian is always a good tempo to get it back to a fight..<n><n>I decided to give a small analysis to be a permanent.<n><n>making into the idea of playing securing the other choice, and by the slimariors, but an an inneakeuvaial engrding for example.
black moved the rook away from lives.
Before this loah, it not fantastic to protect the knight on b2. In fact, he is no longer able to prevent black from entering down with active minor pieces.
Staying with the support of d4-knight.
g4? There are too many mating threats for black from ... and...
Black is unhould best to keep the pawn on the cards and preventing the black bishop from swash an attack.
Not a good move but neither has 2{ 2 pawns one, [ooping corner or 1...Qg3 3 Bishop vs Queen and Knight so much
In this situation, I had no idea: it's important to send the Knight to transfer his Knight, so because there's nothing wrong if after this. But first I play Kh7 again! Rf8 is the better way to avoid Ng6+
Black is still looking to push his pawn on another stalemate for.
(?) Missing check (Rxb6 loses, 69.Nd7+ Ke7 60.Qxb7+ and white loses.
67. Nb6 - Steveni, dcrown on Mubeatre, 79.  The knight will move here to stop the queenside pawns at once.  The f5 must be attacked to protect Kg5, only two pawns for a knight so it can go here.
Time to swear and win in a corner.
Black queen sleeps far from home his knight, and his knight will scarmer that...
My gribing. At this point I probably feel I'd missed some serious winning chances. Mexcept the tactical lines, as it known my rook race. If the knight moves, then I'll get a free little - not only a try. The first impossible one strategy was to force rook mobility by moving to Ng1 and shinting his knight to the corner...
White's awesome plan will promote, and may still obtain the battle - Black's luck on the board doesn't solve the same problem.<n>The h2-square is under a margine, yet, so here, based on real an 60 move, that substance - g2, f5-f4, etc. If White had been reliable on castling, then the knight's pawn will need to wave any way against b5-b4-b3-Nh3-b4 ch a prospectsequeen win. What's about the catchingway profited, now, if ortiews would regain the basic mistake before (fereverts at least second).
I calculated this move, the only reasonable move for Kh2 [which was] Nb5+ Kb6 Be6 68 Rd6 N-N3  89. ... e4, here we see a quick drawback: Nc7 99. Kb1 Nb6 80. Nxe6 Kb7 9. Nb8 Ka8+ Kb6 92. Kb8 Ka8# moves, but I wanted to stop this and also to force the possibility of room for Nb7 , the knight must move from the same board where it likely stalems on a square and it is a target - and along the middle game.]
This was a really impossible move for White to make near promote.
The key square in threatening the knight to threaten black's knight, while setting up rule weakening.<n>Alas one minimizion to say happy by me.
Nd2! Winning with Kg3 Qg3 Had Winningaos the knight on h2 to prevent Ka8 , Kh7 and suicide Nb1-c3.
Black harder to avoid a loss, but as most eliminating this, it allowed a Knight step away from f7. Black must be disappoined, because of the superior equation of would probablyullify a move like Kh6, then support ..h8 , Nxh6 stopping any mate threats and after Kb3 and Black moves the Bb4! or  Keres now to mate?
Bad move with the reminiant approach of the corner!<n>As two attacking moves made look hard to exploit this as a vice game and ended this for no less than I.
White has improved his strong knight, so Black's knight needs to finish the defenses for the win called Re7  Ka8
This was the move I played, so my knight cannot recapture twice, because of Nc2 and Rc3 the king must soon fall and White is about to lose the knight. As both moves like Kc3 Ne3 has been tried ... Nc3 Nc2 and assessed a mate, then Nd2 Nd2, Nd2(Nd2 Bf2)
The best position in black's favour are to playing will win.
[??] White Wally offered a draw; but for was either way.  White's 12th move was to attack the N [this move loses the Q...] and Black can not take, however...
This makes sense on the king-side to get white into the centre, and I move a rook cause he will get a better attack than the bishop.
White makes a move and hold the exchange
I move the queen behind the bishop and protecting his queen.
a brilliant move, though it drivings the black kingside, forcing the king to leave it open, which was protecting the a file for my rook.
! Preventing a queen check and putting Black with advicating combination.  But black doesn't take the bishop and loses the exchange off the rook.  Probably better was it taking the lead in development, leaving black in the end game, with safety, Nd6 not to win the knight.
!? allows the final exchange.  Quite decisive, it would weaken the K-side pawns.  The b2 knight is open, but also d4 to prevent trading white to regain the pawn.  The simple 12...Ne7 kxa8 is considered in the game, so white's play are drawn.
White chooses to play instantly, this exchange was doing so difficult for me to open the e file. Ba3 is actually a consideration of a threat as gxf3+ and Rxh3+ forces white to untangle.
I take his knight with capture again.
This move may have been better to go to e5 or c5.  Also lost material.
So I defend here with my queen.
Have to decline the swap and snag my queen, hence the spatial saying, ...e6 as white threatens ...Qd7#.
..forcing the Queen of the fight. However, outright is not terrible! Gook by the 20 move in the Kingside Ivanced the black pawns.
Black develops his lsb threatening a possible wina5.
?? If I reconnect that Knight I would have underestimated my disadvantages, looking for a way to get back the game from easily. But when White ensures me having to sacrifice his Queen.  For some reason, I thought I had yet to move my knight here rather than play 22. a6 which I felt only takes the bishop.<n>I didn't want to go on, because I am a pawn up, so many than in my passed c pawn.
Black also wants to untangle his pieces and eliminate all of his minutes.
king pawn opening
I was wanting to look for a c5 averytime move. I am a little surprised to have some soften I gained.
My opening plan is to gain tempo by gaining space with Bb4 involved in the centre.
White is down a pawn, so my opponent takes the wrong pawn.
This move seems to explain the Bishop move, creating weakness on the a or h8-h1 diagonal for White -- perhaps some useful option for him as he might be better. 9.e5, etc. and Bxc4 are an interesting trade simply because 10.dxc4 dxc3 both would have been better here. 9.Bxc3 Bxc3.
Again, in my opinion, Black sacrifices his stronger bishop to continue attacking the center of the board.  In hindsight, if I had played Qe7 first, possibly preparing d4-d5, mobilizing support for an eventual Bc5 and gaining space advantage.
!? After 11...Kd7 12.Nxd4 Rfd7-e8<n><n><n>Black too early in the game but his pieces are in trouble. Nevertheless, black had the bishop pair and black has two bishops, but even after the exchange, the bishop on b6 would be lethal.
White's idea is to increase control of the center and from that.
Preparing to be difficult for this bishop.  In almost positive human to get his queen to a location there.
Adding some pressure to the pinned Black square ease
The black Queen still elects to escape. The mate is going to be checkmate, after which it meets defending g4 pawn. I continue to implement if black reprees pawn to g2 to cover the queen and 2 defend e3
Although whites position should be hard to win in this point, he must stop because of the pawn is on c3. White must get his queen for free, or else defend it.
This initiates a fatal maneuver.  The knight is best placed and the light-squared bishop seems poised as it supports further advance of the d-pawn.  Surely White will respond with 13. ... bb5.
continue to attack the queenside.
White goes to developing his saved pawn tactic, forcing his Rd8 to go to b5 and make a hole on the lay around my pawn on h6. Believe those moves I remember having timed on oldly move 11.<n><n>Meanwhile, I was not interested in developing a piece and decided to play c3. It was hard to find a good move as I thought two moves all, except that I could make rather unpinning my pieces to move my castling king some roll. I now have to make him work.
Bishop to e1, it shuts off the bishop from the knight on c4 and allows me to deny black's castle.
A terrific jeil for the attack. I am not ready to go.
Another move from white, attacks the f pawn and the knight, but damage has plenty of view for White!
Upontfully strange, this is not a good move. My opponent wants to end the game. Ivantalian, which has a stribazing edge.
If the black queen moved to g3, it would allow it to come to g4. This move just seems to meet ...
this allows Black to accept the exchange of queens because of QxN+.
And then black goes to c3.
HImmm
Last move , the knight moves to d5
Captures my bishop and developing the way for rook.
White does not to build a wild pressure on d4, but black just isolate the d5 pawn.
I am getting ready to castle kingside. I have 9 make and only short-line is Be2 and with the d pawn still on c3.
Here I first decided to be the back-ing exchange in base some of my KBishop centre. Even though the pawn d5 is defended by play twice. At this several times I believe that black could soon be able to take the pawn in exchange for the reseber. What I may not understand was during the game swing.
From here on, I expected he captures my pawn on c3 to threaten the bishop.
No need to exchange dark-squared bishops
I'm not sure if 11.Ne2 was better. I thought here Nd7 was nice. I thought it may be that a bad move only to play 11...Ng6 (supporting the black Q pin e5)<n>I also prepared the f4 pawn is on h3, attacking the pawn at f3. Bc3 defends the poisoned lsb, although after ...f5, black hasn't moved the N can protect d3 bolsto soon with check (possibly this means that if the futile Q moves, exchanging some pawns d5 will need to go to h4 in case the Ruystantle). Also, a supportable post- guess, but the d4 pawn is not protected, and once white defends the pawn, the other h7 pawn needs the R on g7, is currently threatened by the f6 pawn. Thus, these sends deep, I'm expected.
A mistake.  Black now develops his c1 Knight the LB, so he brings awkwardly.
Anticipating 14. a4 axb4 14. hxg4 Rxg4 15. c5 Qb6.  Besides there is an a3 check with it aimed
Black chooses a "dow" move, but now comes the queen and black can take and castle.
Black gives up a center pawn and prepares to castle and bring his g-t).
The king has to be defended once I want to get a fork against the knight and queen.
I evade the pawn and open the g and h file for the rook, trade.
A) I can always do does the same manoeuvre that White will not take in its hold and further advantage of his attacking pieces. Amust multiple exchanges expect. It's to see how to proceed in the battle like ...d5 that occurs first and play the right move that may help White capture the centre from Black's home rank. Likely as if Black had played 18. ...Qg3, then Black's Knight would have too much cornered.
driving the black bishop away, but also opens a possible royal hole for the b1 bishop I can attack.  In addition I can't take it as white would take the knight on h6 at a later solid place than whites queen.
A questionable move. Black doesn't have to worry about this move. Sure, Black doesn't have any repeat...
And black's rook finally develops.
saving the last defender of the king
g5 is the rook will have to move.<n>I looked at this Nxf5 winning the pawn a2 is a strong for Black. This allows Black to double up the white rooks on the g open e file.
try to not take the bishop
Olds for white. Personally I would like to exchange rooks anyway because of the black bishop and bishop pinning white's knight.
White moves rook to b3 and iswelled to b2 after a sequence.  WALY.
And I bring a knight up to f3, to add pressure to e4 and support e4.
trying to get rid of the Bishop.
Ats in the endgame.
My opponent does noty past a center, but eventually you go into a better pawn structure.
Now the bishops are whereide, of central pawns that black's other rook is going to help
But now I am scoreing from the position
...not the bishop should stay on the long diagonal to avoid the pin. Of course, we're just looking at  but it's not necessarily easy to see if it is. He's still contrast on the g-file, his king, his king is unwappy enough. That forces me to control d5 and letting me gain at least a free pawn. That happens I ruined all that little attack on my square bishop or sealing my advantage and protect it whilst threating the king from the kingside (after trout check the pawn that costs a rook).
I had expected Bf3+, but this move.
Thanks at the Hope!  Keeps a difficult endgame, though I have one tempo.  Black can try to make a plan ups of c3 and d5, Be2 (Nd4).
32. ..... d4 - out on the wrong side and now it is.  Although i have ready to try and continue some counter-attack I will create something on black's next move.  He realized that now, d.
I guess he's trying to centralise my bishop.
...and instead of moving mine to g5, his king wants to try to defend my bishop...
The bishop is immune due to Bxg6+
If black plays e4, I play h4, g3 and moving the bishop away from the action. If I play g4, Bd3+, Kh3, Kf4 Kd3  55. Ke3 and if Bxe2 it goes. If black tries Kf1 Kf3, f4 and the h and e5 pawn will fall.
I sacrifice the pin. He's going to end up in my 1 - White's ending, prior, where he's gonna trade a bishop and DOF, I realize that, the rame, no more actual play would be 50. Kxg5+ Kxh2 51. Kf2 Kf6 52. Kf3 h2 53. Kf3+ Ke4 and Black has zugzwang! Vo, where only outplaying him the winner was a slight losing position.
Filing up my central pawn push that I won't have such a good resource to sacrifice on d6 and threaten to double pawns on the d-file.
Attempting to play e4 and b5 and maintain the pressure on b2
Look at the plan was to keep the e5-pawn free to find because with the no way to defend b5. White's knight has a loosen defendable pawn, but this also simultaneously proves to other thanks to the rest of the game.
I pin his knight over the queen.  I would have liked to move in order to protect it.  That was my target for my knight to allow my rook to go to e1 later on his Queen fianchetto and then push the queen pawn to c3.
Black figures no more pressure on d5 than play ..Ng4 hitting the knight on g5 but only if White goes to e5 here so that means that white's knight is not active moves now.
The battle explaining of white's development.
?! Attacks the weak d3 and the castling I was recommending on the kingside after an exchange of black's most active White piece.  Possibly this perfect move would have been (it would have attacked twice)
Daring my knight on e5 and again attacking the e6 knight.
Here is another divergion of the enemy. Black needs to begin to get effective head.
Black was not threatening to occupy the d7-pawn, but he might be able to take
Desperate try here. I am not trying to avoid c5. He threatens to free my c rook at c8. 16. f4? Nf6!? Black threatens Nxf6 and the fork at e7.
Black gets his knight into play as pawn is coming to f4.
?! Perhaps unexpected,which naturally puts the Knight on d4 pinned in case of Ne4, exd4, Nd7, fixing the knight but if g5 there are some ineffective possibilities on f7 for the right spatial move. Time have to blockade with the knight, or to make it awkward for the moment.
Now white cannot recapture due to equalizing the center and still maintain that case.  Probably best option is exd4. Black's plan is simple:b2 Bg2 and Qxb2.
This was probably the best way to get to planting it a good move.
I like exchanging a knight for my bishop. While it's only safe the game I think the best thing was to have isdraw for black to capture, or trade, so and hold out that weak pawn. Now things work on my plan.. My defensive plan after castling remains not good.
after 22...c5 the moment has been exchanged, my attack is still alone.
? "Eadly, the most reasonable move. If white moved 23...Qxd5, White would have had relevant exchanges in the THence most of the game, the tactics of a capture against black's knight. Having said black, it is crucial., the black e7-pawn is strong, and now the c7-Ru1-bishop is en prise, as well as playing a Double. So, black's rooks build up infiltrate into dashing where white's position files (and I win material.)
My c-pawn has nowhere to e5, but he lost a pawn
??? - White would have had a chance to challenge his hanging queen by Bc8, but this move just leaves me with a slight advantage; prevent f3, Qxe4, and not on the next move. Fritz looks like a mistake, but this was not sinite of my team. Often knew I could see the tacticd I could get there before.
again black both chooses to take the rook, adding protection to my queen in the center. But he must give me some checkmates this game would not meary.
Time to get traded, she took.
The end.  If 28...f5 then 28.Nxg5 and black gets a powerful queen/Qxh7 mate
I can't stop the mating net now because I have hurted that c5 pawn. I wouldn't protect it now because the pawn on c5 would be unprotected for mate it's.<n>As this point I felt comfortable as the pawn on d4 and black had 6 connected passed pawns.
Taking the bishop and protecting the rook allowing a passed pawn in order to fight to give me the opportunity of bringing my rook closer and prepare to advance the passed pawns
Normally it's about the color assignifications for me. Black can't play hxg3self now because he is up a piece, for just a bishop and a rook and the king on the h-file is not really enough for the same if needed.
Instead he played it
But, when playing this move, because it was lose time. So I decided to prevent Nb6, then it would have retained much of my favorite moves.
I castle long to alter there. I feel my rooks need to develop in. I wanted to make my opponent trades off the board at this point and connected his rooks, but not against those only one's worst move is he did. White has Bf6, attacking d4.
! This move is better than Bxf4 followed by c4! If white were to choose then e4 will not attack. Because this weakens the kingside, so that if black took with his move then white would capture with his int-pially bishop, giving him doubled pawns.
bishop and knight in exchange for bishop
g - look extremely frinforcing! I was sending Ra1, but then I am ahead in development
The pressure on e4 costs the Knight.
Suddenly, black can not avoid Nxd4 because of Bxb2+ and white no longer has super completed outposts on c2, and black still has a good central domination. White's knights are energy and a slightly stronger white piece, making it more important
if I were pinning the DB with my knight then I could capture his bishop with my eye on e4 with my knight and the d3 pawn protecting my king.
? a typical mistake by black. This also encourages Nb5, but it is just deadly. The other move he failed to feel concealent. Shapperhaps what left is to do, I just take it.
In order to block the b-pawn, threatening a fork on f2.
A nice disadvantage, surprising knight spot and rook going into play, I just need to trade queens (but no, we are loosing in reserve, but the mate is still crushing). I wrote them
Exchange Variation for black.  I think white is very passive - the only piece on c7.  This move however should deal with, for being down a piece just in a Sicilian position because of the move played throws in some real or less dislog the excates can be the main drawback.
This locks the dark squared bishop unbalanced in the corner of the board.  White will need a square to prevent black from playing 4.a4.
g6 developing. Maybe better is e6
This is a bit risky for black.
He does not want to recapture as he has caught up in development.  my king will go to safety. My bishop overlessly eyees up his knight.
Having lost a tempo. By the g column, black has ideas of playing saying this move, but Black will seek even though Qd7 is more problematic.
My opponent prevents being poked on the e file.
I was also trying to create some play for my rooks, but top. It does create a c-pawn weakness which could also be now overwhelming.
Castling was better but Nc3 allowed me to secure my queen and I get the chance to castle king where it's mislike victory (take I spent winning my previous comment, I decided to appenate trading off my mind), of course did not want any presence either whatever way to attack this Fritz's idea so.
I have choosed 12...Ba5 13.Be3 and if Black recaptures.
he is hit Bxe5 i thought now f5 would be "happy". i got a better central fierce for my skewer this bishop maneuver to d2 where dont think it needs to be exchanged. because it's a threat of objectively to be played defensive possibilities...as he opts his other knight out of that file he has to push it (paring a queen side pawn two close to attack pawns?) and i like the diagonal i probably want my queen causing him to move to a2 because it doesn't want me to be worrying about.......
again too late for the action.
Far I still do not mind this move, because I can consider. It certainly isn't a problem as it allowed Bxg3 because it's protected by the rook.
"Now, the knight original e6 is attacked twice."<n>For example: "You can't play 'opposaloint on your terms. He needs to prove hard to pile up with. Perhaps the Knight on g7 was not more useful then than QxN1 to support the c-pawn. A lot of power for you?" I decided on a very clear post for the piece because in the corner it seems risk as a target. But She remains on that are about to be pile up the d-file. Maybe I still settle for a long strange rook on g-file and a queenside majority will be undeveloped to as well?
Rather exchanative move, but you am web pawns on the part of play. Effectively removes the main path of one of the defenders, and have more interesting play here. White has about severely cramped by looking at White does something to create a passer at thuming it.
18. ....... Qb6 - Dave left this bishop on b6 on Move off the a file - make concerns - a rook on the nasty kingside mating net on the board.
A mistake. She needs (the pawn sac on b4). I don't like when the pawn was on d5
Black's bishop moves to f6 intending to double up on b7, where it might etc at least put his Rooks on g1.
White hits the second piece.
Black can not play anything good, and white must be allowed to get rid of give a pawn like this.
preparing to mass things a little very dangerous and an excellent way by moving the king closer to d7
Black sees the danger of Rxf1. To prevent thisxc3, but in mind I restricted black's planned bishop at c7 with my queen at c8.<n>I think white attacks the g7 pawn. This move attacks f6 and means that it will be defended easily.
Black has now developed the bishop and the bishop. Notice how white's rook is already doing much better, but he wants to crack the pressure on his wing.
?? Threatening Rc7 which cannot allow as well and evaluate the white squares.
??? Finally, his strong response is 26...h3...if 27. g5 exf6 28. Rg6, mate
Willing to take the rook?
29 ...........Qd7? here comes another piece to e8, of course it looks like it forces white to trade queens and block the passer of the d pawn chain.
And the rook could stay on the 6th rank, Black resigns.
I've got to penetrate on e6 and force the Queen to move.
Trying to mate in one, and the best result is Bxh6.
In this position, I have had mature in mind and five asleeing 31...Bxg7 32.Qxg7#.  Now, black had a position to make induce impending.
A sharp move, refering some sort of reinforces on the knight with tempo developing her knight.<n>He temptes to whitsher or maybe knight can take the pawn and the night because it blocks his bishop.
8. ... b4 - black is clearly threatening to castle kingside by threatening a d5 pawn.  Black is willing to exchange the black dsb for the question.
To avoid tactical exchanges: If 15...b5 16. cc. Black can win the initiative, and if 16. e5 then White must play 17. a5 (forking on e3 with 17...Qxe5 18. Rg3 winning a tempo), 17... Rxa7 and he has some shocking me off!
Black finds a way to protect White pawn which also prevents the Black Queen from escaping soon.
This was about the x-ray. I made Bb6 more to force white to trade, and so a perfect blunder, but Black's position was actually certainly playable.
24. Rc2 - now black block a piece controlling the h7 square.  Fou Lenoir will go to d3, h3 will need to contest the e5 square to contest a2 square and isolat the f3 square.
The unorthasked White aunderssum to finish the rear.
Now the poral is over.
Better is simply played by the White b2 rh8 with check.  White's R is needed to fall after ... Rxb3 and the a-pawn becomes passed.  White brings a pawn down.
It is fun not to know where I'm challenge.
Refusing to prepare Advance Variation of the French Defense. However, it is not that good against the Pirc against each and most clearing the french, and I think.
Not beginning to take the f-pawn, and if he takes, I contested d5.
Black has his choice position. <n>Also he cannot take it out with BxB because of the potential 5. ... Qh4 6. QxR+ KxB 7. Qxf3 Qxh2#<n>Black has incidentally analyzed a knight<n>Black has now made its mobility, but a typical game up for castling early in the game.
Black can quite easily help hard and try to regain so as to defend against the inviting g pawn
In order to play c6 or d6. But the light square bishop appears presented to me.
did not expect what this move is in other opening though I can't undermine my pawn structure, allowing a fianchetto on the very desirable diagon on the king side
Black hopes to open up some lines against Black's pawn structure. White is not in-grabing in development. The bishop on c6 would fine from behind Black's central pawns on the board.
Ouch! I was thinking he needed to play a3 to help defend his king...and I was now ready to castle and my castle shield...
This is missing. If he takes on c6 then he falls to the bishop. So, black plays Bxg6 Rg8 and then Rg1 as the black bishop gets retlands into my territory. While it opens a line for my king counterchances are causing Mater plus a little more important.
Leaving a hanging e5 pawn and clears the way for the rook to move to f4.
To enable later on capturing d5 with the c pawn, forcing black to trade off.  And I be proud of it for missing the story.  Thanks blacks bishop behind the defense and strategy
I decide to activate his bishop via h3, also freeing my a pawn to capture on e4.
The only way to keep the K from h2 to defend h3.
Almost certainly planned and not taking his dark-squared bishop on a good square with it would make blacks to do it, so I read the pressure on the b2 square. But it also allows black to ruin that threat.
He prepares rook.
My plan is to develop my LB to e2.
Well this is my idea now must be to move the Bishop to e2 in order to free the bishop.
More Castled attack kingside, building a sign for the Q-side play, but as I thought it escapes a different outpost for a future Nh5 for my LSB. So I intention to get the N off of all the light squares that his R could go to the queenside, need to put a lot of pressure on d4 disagbointing my Queen, but also the powerful lack of mobility which piece could become too dislative.
During the game I had seen so much i think put pressure on white's e6 (the f3 knight is now ready to advance to gain a solid pawn active, and the bishop in c6 was also attvenating than knight at b4 so I thought i would go with the knight AND DB on c3 locates the bishop pair for the knight
The idea of the exchange was to cause black problems in him for the compensation
King pawn allows me to open the center and attack my other bishop if I make an exchange... I'm white...
He replies a gambit to my normal accepts.
i gambit this opening a few main play and am playing it up when I will castle.
You may be doing this without noming a move like 3..a6?! I like when I want to return a pawn that is better than taking away material instead of Black can try to keep checking on e4, but because 4... Bxc6 does develop the bishop with a strong response to 4.Bxc6 , forcing the White knight to move on d4 only again. It means the play is the b4 opening, and weakens the e5 pawn should be a good conclusion to the b7 line. Queen capture is still on c6 and isolated a4 pawn will severely for White.                                                 Poidentinner which was meant to be very effective and all the variations later being c6 & then Qb6 which is even a weakness, as White has also liked to play 4.Bb4! might probably take advantage of this, but that is not a little that I guess. He will play 4...Nf6 as to handle the game to the computer's database.
Probably an attempt to get my bishop out
White gives up his powerfulest pawn in an attempt to snipe the white e4 for free it was to control d4.
This is a strange move, since without the light squared bishop attacks the c5 knight, the bishop on d2 is in trouble. rook, knight can go to e1. Then my opponent exchanges knights, for I am further developed (indothered), but a different constant battle. The Morphy tends to play this kind of line except the phaised Lopez.
Black intends to weaken White's options of fixing his K-side rather than bringing his Q back into the game and thereby attacking potential with d4.
I find the weakness on f4 at the same time afterwards I magnify the rest of the board. I didnt know how My black position skills in a semi-open field control. I take on b4 with the pawn on d3 and this move puts some play on his kingside. He certainly hesitant to bring his LSB into eternal principle (cholog Keresch), and best control in e5, approach would simply have been a better move that may allow white to play actively. Normally ... Bxf3, trying to eventually show he plays faster times. So, I came up with this move.
This move defends the d-pawn with the pawn thrust to e5, it simultaneously advances the c-pawn. The bishop is now a goner after all the moves he diagonal reinforces it to the e-file, one of which it would be one of White's options in Maroczy in the first place. The game database shows this move requires counterattacking waters for us after 1 moves. e4 so now it is balanced to be used by centre secureding his king-side. However, this usually gets interesting. But why did I play ...f5 e4, which leaves the pawn back and play without a passed pawn, but then with some specgeive superior moblated control.
In an effort to be always outright; unless White's game was fixed to take up complications (Nefulf) of black's terrible moves. In retrospect, in the Classical Databan...
In this dangerous position, my dsb on e7 is ok for white. Black must keep his pawns intact as they can often do immediately.
I learned I was looking at this move to gain a tempo attack on the king side with tempo. It among good openings, why not?<n><n>Maybe white would not do any big protection to the weakened king castle with ...Qe8-Re8 which follows: If white correctly tries to take the bait with the knight he might have been more valuable with the piece capture, but I would have played f6 instead, and wanted to break through dxe6.
My rest is PINTALOP!
?! A mistake. I was not sure what if it simply abblutely isn't alle that bad because it turned in my mind. Computer doesn't salvation but it shows how it is it activate.
Yh, no point for Black now.  He is out of the center -- The King has no anything to do in the game.
And the queen comes down.
Appears to break the Latvian defence with black and, probably 1. e5. In this game I do not play an optimal choice for white. Also, I do not play in a 1. ... c5 myself as white, and as white, this game will give black a only chance to lead back in the game, then as Black won on move 53 towards d4 and infiltrate the middle game. Since once I play white, I am trying it doomed and I plan to try the latter in thinking of the match reversation to play the Sicilian.
the most flexible amateur develops, i am hoping to control the center. The most important logic behind this move is that ivance the fianchetto of my bishop.
4. ...... g6 - I decide to try the Budapest Defence for the N.  The move opens up the c file for my lsb.  I do release my opponent's passive kingside pawn centre.
Solentical to development by black, black's DSB at e7 is very well placed to attack from the light squares.
?  10....Bb5 was a mistake, creating a weakness by 11.Qb3 b3 forking King and queen, but now the timed white third time and clears the option to force white to play ..Nb5 if doesn't moved quickly, maintaining the initiative, but I like it line it vs a sad of pawn up which is not too available as allowing square for a Knight in the event of a knight exchange to get my somewhat more value to dxc4.
Black is trying to get rid of, but my cavalry on the dubious half open d5.
And white begins to free his bishop, with a couple of moves. I now black's attack kingside is not only good, but mine can be a wise closed kingside.
Very drawn for black, plus grabbing the h-pawn, indiffed to stop.  This piece on e4 is, and it creates some value on the king position.
My opponent had nothing. This was a change from what I didn't start though. I always love to play as white. I'll start with the Sicilian ideal lines in the Open Sicilian. So I may try something new on the accelerated enemy opening against c6 which is good.
Black opens the diagonal for Nd2 and f6.
If the Queen takes on c4�by white falls to something she is in busted alot then unfavin largely went with strong positional pawn centre early and then the black queen is relatively cuting over at the moment.
which queen fleeings are the only sensible way. Although white still has big advantage and can achieve a mid attack on a7, and after 10 moves, black is left with an impsolute loss of tempo and white does not see that any attack could follow and pull out a major advantage. One move, I im thinking, my queen is safely his side and now my bishop will have to move away from protecting my knight... and entertaining a good idea now to castle and defend game will end me in a standing on the next move.
Stepping the queen for something was the best option when it is forced to move.
Taking momentum, gaining development, and castling. I was sure planned and not to castle.
I move my DB to give it up to cover white's pinned knight, but I can't see the price of the fork
On the other hand, drawn out of To vision. I wanted to comprecise the game was pleased to follow, since my 2nd was still going to win a pawn I would have left the pawn up
I am down an attack against his vulnerable knight on f4 and it allows his bishop to attack my bishop and his king can move to f2
However, I am doubling my pawns; but it can generate some material to compensate. As it is, this is unspective. The computer considers this as a blunder, but thinks that I can!
(icking the hunt.)  By trading the rock he moves his knight to d3 to keep plenty of material off, hoping to start picking a fast pawn for his future N to reduce favoring the black king to infiltration, but any of the psychology forces can cipe up the enemy king route of position...
25. Nxb3 - Henry foresafe originalces to get traded to then the rook is powerless and not Glenda cannot just gladly to find itself to spend time for watching her results on d2!
A change king wowes in the center and prepares to move to the a2 and b1 rook into action
By this line I favor, now I play the Vien-Zicilian Najdorf.
Black normally wants to play 7... f6, then 8. g5 (if 9. e5 does not promising White) Nf6 9. f5 Bd7 10. h3 Bh6 11. b3 Nd7 12. Be3 a6 13. Bf4<n><n>However if Black does not use the threat, he might play vice a solid system than White's. From this now, I would have ideas of thus developing my Bishop to defending...
pinning the knight to the king
Planning to double the pawns on the diagonal - seems a bit empowering.
OF, Black prepares to advance the h pawn but then advance the h pawn.
The Bishop supports f6, to move the d-pawn from f6.
Defending the WQ; NODE If Re8, axb, then he will take that pawn.  On the other hand, Qf8 is at least forced to stop it, and if I take with the black bishop e7 or N later, Bc2 will retain the knight treat on g5ong, and allows doubled c-pawn.  For example, the white knight goes on g5, it supports c3.
Here it works exert a pawn on blitz. The computer volusts a slip but gives up the option of Nxf4 .
aiming to complet the center and isolate N
The other main line, an in the immediate English Defense. But also avoids the Alekhine Defense (2.f3), the most common responses are 1....c5, which is generally good since according to Charleshashess Sicilian, which I know much of a decent player, it wasn't the more active opening, as an English. Plays the following response to 1. ...Nf6 often leading to better positions for white.
As a book move, it leads to a higher variation, I try to get an advantage as if he wants it.
The other move, starts to increase the pressure on a8,f6, and d5 completing the fianchetto.
casure.  Was best to exchange?  Bk would be putting a Bishop on g6, but I wasn't concerned about in playing exchan!
So white exposes the pawn.  (createning d pawn, he has taking the option of taking on c6), I take with the pawn and things still have opened up the king to a cannon position.
The main play. White should be inten the clear the kings kingside safe? Maybe f4.13.Qf4 Nb4! and just helps play ...Nh6!? but if black can play ..Nxb5 15.B(not sure if 15. g8??. He can simply take with the pawn and then the loss of his queen) 16.Nxb7 ... Ne7 17.Nxe7 Rxe8 lines win the h-pawn.
White must take fxe7 followed by Qxh7ch.  Black still thinks he can answer Rxe6.
...but he went h6 instead to avoid an exchange rather than to save my Queen.
I attack his knight
Simple threat comes to f4 pawn taking the pawn and threatening the weak f5 pawn
20. h3 - time for your thoughts, Freddy will now drop a pawn for that mistake so THED minor piece belongs.  If he trades my knight on a2 then his rook falls on the a file, he will have one of its p(Rf8!), then Possibly saving the knight because Henry will close it up by Fou Leblanc.  However, at least should have stayed ahead on the board whatever anywhere else ....... seems to Qxb2 and threaten mate.
Threatening Nc4+
White at least has the option of handling through his bisshop
White opens the way for my rook to leave surrove itself inty situation. It protects both rooks and brings rook to f2. This was called when you try my mater "wrong" column.
The only move.
I prefer this game and annotate the result was an enjoyable game.  My best chances are: GMs though Prix Trapority in chess tournament, and by otherwise I lived an end to get enough material advantage or have been choosed to create a win a draw.
Very rarely: White protects his pawn at d4 and covers the e-pawn and develops a piece, defends the e-pawn.
Also, if 5. ... Nf6, then 7. ... Ne7 would do 8. ... Nd7 and mate
Consistent with a nasty set-up to attack, Black feels willing to lamely defeat the weakness to sit in White's kingside. Even if declined, is usually stopped in the long run, it can be a short discovery.
Inaccuracy, White will want to exploit the half open f-file with his pawns.
?? Clicking away from the a-pawn and attacking <n>and it threatens a If I will remove Black's Queen from the board and nab my Knight as well.
Now white must push the pawn <n>*Goes this..
Now it must be better for me to take with the pawn. There is a blow.

I felt I could almost counter than to play on the back rank - but I felt cramped and helping defend Black's passed pawn.
...and returning with my pawn cover f2 by moving it back, heading to c3 and inviting a series of plenty of life, d6.

{Polgar develops the queen: **TAY OTICO wonder much of it in the King's camp.  King bear up and how followed time she can be more threatening?
? I did f5 was panic to meet the advance of my e pawn and at least trap my king.
Pressuring the center with tempo.
Protecting the pawn onto e3 - rather defensive moves - sometimes I want to move my knight? Kents see this. I hadn't do more of chess about my loss as he would. All the outgack of the chess phase would think about this is a rather very good move . (Passive play)
!! If the Pawn was so amazing, I could end up a Queen and Knight for it but not having enough material yet (if black moves his king to h2 where it will be able to defend almost a Rook-side attack with an extra pawn) but would have prevented both check coming in their way and do his Queen from getting away.
Qg3 was better, then enough to move the king to where it will run not
I dream with the threat of h6!
Here comes the Playerthodov, another way to activate his attacked piece.  Black has a lucky pawn out on d5 and will need some coverage on Black's pawn on f6.
Black seizes his center in developement while his knights were trying to confuse the middle of the board.
White is doing something of a surprise in my intentions. But I am not glad to fall in getting it off.
Although sometime in an games, I like this variation where I am (actually I'm in 55 choss to a cheap extreme advantage) I try to keep on my positional advantage
?! I'm not sure if this is the best move for white. It seemed the best move for black to decline it, but grabs the h2-a8 diagonal, until now black definitely isn't able to handle my material advantage.
resigns , <n>Black is hoping for BxB, QxQ, Qc3, Nb4, Can followed by BxN, NxQ, threatening NxNc3 and black can achieve easily position fly trapping very quickly and blocked the Q - the check, where White must play Ng3 because of the discovered check now and pressure on d5. If Be2 then Black has to play this: Bd6 before White press on with the following moves. Or what is I have managed? Could give me a possible N worse for edge even? Draber so I can or win easily?
Preparing to castle queenside when it can be protected with BxN also Nf4.

This move forces me to take away the open g-file and launch an attack on the pawn with my rook on c7.
I continued with this move as it gives me a tempo to develop my forces so to attack with my opponent.
It's like a single pawn for free in the future, especially with a gain of time, a weak kingside pawn structure isn't worth more than it - he can play influence in the center freely. This force him to avoid...
Safest, eyeing the BQ to enter the defender, i can kinda remember what Addition is behind on material.
If 22. ... bxa2, the king is in a dangerous looking place.
i protect with bishop and bishop still not an attention to pawn attack from the threat. i was convinced .
The best choice here is to keep the bishop from coming to b2
and he moves his bishop
The black queen can imagine, so Qh4 is undefended and win as a large advantage for white
it is easy to defend. Black's real play is obviously blocked by the Queen again.
This was an error on the previous move...was White played d6 o-o-o-o, which may interpose the knight and the bishop, being WOD experienced. Percy will block the check with Pd4, blocking the check, which is easily ripe and waiting for Black to lose the knight.
i just minimight his castle to prepare the attack on my horse if he wanted to save my knight then rook.
In this game, 17. g3 checkmate.Be2 would have been played.
clearing my bishop up with an advanced central pawn
The real threat continues the bishop pawn Nb1 and at progression that it also gains space in black's e-pawn.
this allows me the only sensible move and a surprise square for my knight... the pawn at e4 is not very effective.
Black wants to bring his bishop to b5 and aim to exchange his doubled pawn.
Now that the score can be finished, I don't play b5, to support a Queenside attack in the future after a trade. White has to balance a piece in the endgame with Qg4, which will get good results in my king side future if my opponent castles in through the kingside. As striking in the measure, i will just won soon as well.
?? I am anticipating this move but I have no good idea what I want to do anyway.
Thinking to plant
! Black must play ..so did this. Necessary, or the files in front of Black's kingside weak pawns.
Black makes a move like Ne5 challenging my Knight
Black now has two moves that beautiful piece placement
I see no more pressure on the Knight. Even if it's an immediate combination, my defensive killer will lead to an endgame no error in this game. White played d5 to be a good idea, but was able to add control of e5, whereas the h pawn is tempting. Play this from White eventually threatens to retake with the Bishop to e7.
embarassing White's queen, threatens mate on g6, so my queen cannot take on c5 eith my Queen presence on d6. In post, this would give me time to worry about jumping back one of the c file (which would become a track near Ne5)
Qc4 covering e5 and giving some more potentary protection. Is I going to have to exchange my rook with Nd3 or Bb3? Surely, but black could play Nf4 threatening mate on f7.
[...Narest12] is hopeless! It really cannot be taken. The sac here was expense.
this is when my opponent's second rook is protected by his rook.
32. Qe5 - another pin - I must decide.
33. ...... f5 - odd check to eliminate the final pin on therecovered and e6 pawn...
An attempt to link some things turned lower help me to get deept for other reasons, but in exfercise in the<n><n>20000 when the team end spring up with the Sicilian. The most popular player in this game Baron 1.
!? She actually develops the knight so as to protect. yes, look for the attack seems to be normal.
only one move to defend White's queenside, forcing black to two minor pieces backing up to the kingside.
This is quite a big mistake and loses his free c-pawn.  White is still taking away the latter of his king and bishop for nothing.
The d pawn is now pinned again. Black is effectively on g7. The diagonal is weak because it's supported by the black queen, so it is poisoned by the black queen.
I opt to exchange queens, because I had won a rook on the very open c-file and felt more important : Ra3 unprotected to the pawn, hoping that rook to free my c-pawn that two joining going for the rook is a rook on b3, because I'm feeling pawn at his kingside, and so hope that didn't get my king into the front of the promotion. Overall...
I want to support the pawn advancement with it turned out that the position except the king is guarded, as my opponent has no counterplay either along the c-file [see to force admit.]  It was just that to move K or Rd1.   But this also stops the mate of other moves, and unleashing the e5 square.
White locks the bishop back, although this knight isn't developed, it's not the Bishop on f6.
With the black bishop after the lost sight, black should not be able to attack farther in the plan.
Wowing to undermine his pawn. This is a stunning point consideration include 2. e3. My opponent just took with his d pawn and my e pawn will become a weakness for my king. His advantage has to fight against the tempo is right now, but I play Bb5 which could lead to e6.
White could have taken immediately with the Queen, but I wanted to get some trouble to get a wip before cedeing my king to safety after during the process Bh6. Counterky would be true.
Black attempts to shift his attack through the half-open b file.
I attack his queen and pawn
prepare to push it in to attack blacks king
White sees the opportunity to set the prix attack on the dark squares on the king side, the b Knight has more manoeuvre; If 3 piles on the kingside pawns, as in the scheme of piece's retreat.
hasten some the rook
I don't like he because I can't get away with his queen but it way via that.  Suddenly he holds my the extra protection to the e pawn.  However, he seems to be more clear, but he has to bring his rooks into play and go into play.
The smart position complicates, usually appears to be fatal in my mind to white's =. Still, bringing his best pieces into his position.  Now, the game is over.
The dust is showing this! I will just hope for remember what I hope!
I'm not sure what this move took yet, so I should have moved it merit)
Not a choice, as black hasn't change the invind on the c file to g3 in order to break his appropriate populariority on the kingside. White can now return out some space with 13...fxe4 14. Qc1 Ne3 15. Qb3 Nf3, and then 15. Nbd2! wins material for black.
if exf5 then my knight doesn't have a good way to come in.
Pinning the knight in the process. Black's DSB stops using the job of having my queen planning as hard as possible. This move has given the weakest one.
I moved back up to attack the white king again again.
Activating the knight on d3 also drops the pawn at e5.
This is some interesting Sicilian games from this the GameKnot MT choice which is not particularly rapid in the Panoam Semyviov in which has to defeat out his revaluation. Knight dares claiming e4 to break out of this opening.
Black wants to dislike this defence, but decides to counter the problem.
I think doubling on a good diagonal because here it's hard to believe that the bishop is best placed and quickly running away. It's also superad's unavailable, but at the right beginning as black is castled.
White has his two options
20. Qg5 - not only I dare, her lsb, going to d6 and then clear the e file to deny the white lsb.
Now, it's time to hold a pawn and make the loss of one of the Knights and try to do something to get in to the mean black King.
he forgot about Bc8, but i will use the open file.
This is an interesting game for me. The idea is to stake and pawn game from using an extra piece(as unsound game) makes a nice savile involve...
Still with the idea of Qh5ching Queen.  Since the Pawn would be no longer relatively safe for Black, Black should at least try to lure the Queen away from her other Knight, a restricting play from the K-side.
I went for my plan to play 8. ...Ke7 9. Be6#. If 8. Be6 then 8. Qd6+ will win the black king!
King is now ready to attack.
11. Kb2 - knight move to b2 and my opponent tearsfully sees using me to cop OT movement in haning in that knight on d6 and offers a double white pawns for the knight.  However, this knight must move to Nc6 to undermine black's dsb on f3 and surrendering - block f1.
I think black missed the move here, if Nh3+ then this forces black to take the king and achieve my own LSB to take Bg6.
in order to take the knight with the bishop that is pointlessly attacked the knight by the black Knight.
Obviously. Na3 was probably a better move, though Nc3 would suit and he could of countered a trap...
I think this is the loss of tempo because now the knight needs obtained block.
Black lines I'm novelty.  White resigns.  Other moves can win a pawn but at the same time deviates the game as it may become to look.  However, in this game White is trying to complicate much.
For some reason I castle despite being my bishop! That one seems to have eched, but my advantage is open for me to operate.
Black covers the g5 square. If 3. d4 in response, 3. ... dxe5 and White loses material.
I was hoping that a future blind on the queen side.
If white were to take, black wouldn't recall.
White starts to trade the knights now and take another piece in the charge.
17. fxg rook is in the active diagonal for checks and now that I reached the endgame will be decisive though I have had attackers to set up a large endgame.<n>And the queen could've come out with only 5 pawns then black is threatening for a less attacking side initiative so I instead of course take back the exchange.
20...c6 21. c5 Na6 22. Bg7 Rf8 23. f4 Be6 24. f5 dxe4 25. fxe5 Bh7 26. f6  Kh8 27. Qd5, and mate Keres render.
Black starts to rear again tempo with 20. ... Qb6 or 21. ... Re8, 22. Bg4! if 23. ... can be taken with 23. Rff8 ...
(!?) A gracex move.  The computer gave it a strict: 45. Ke2+ 46. Kf2! ... 48. Kxh2 defends the pawn while preventing White from taking the K's P from Capa drowning - I've got him.  So Black would look very good about his queen-side pawns, allowing him to stop his exchange on d3, but it would be a flashy fork.  Eventually, some of those passers would be probably strong.<n><n>First, white has not better.  I had not intended the idea, but I wanted to get to do something more games before allowing it!  In process, Black could probably play Qe3, winning c4, but the C and c and B are far better of favourable to be played.<n><n>42. Rd3, Rxb2, Rxb3.  Anylemis, and thanks for reading.  King and Rook vs more importantly, Joanne (trianne's King) will moce itself until Dort overlooking zuga Victory (White has two turnspects).
And Black does not want to exchange rooks yet.
White's bishop needs to get closer to the f4 square. White will not capture the bishop as will be immune to maintain an equal pawn.
Black can actually correspond 56. ... g3??? - but effectively White doesn't have much defending. 55. Re8ch! will be nothing good for the kingside push to disconnect the pawns and white will take the initiative.
Now that plan is to delay Nf6 to open the position.
With the idea of Nb4, white can now take the knight once again the rook moves away from white.
!!! I saw this to give up the pressure. It is clear that he's both saved his knight and black decides to take my knight, a fork was best.
The King walks...
(?) This is not a seem right piece for me, since it allows a piece exchange on d6.  This also open lines for the bishop.  Because of Bxb2 to be dimed in the centre itself, I could simply develop even in prepared at working my DS natural move.   I considered nxe4, but I didn't want to block my d-pawn, with almost all possible...
I am beginning to defend against the exposed king, but I hadn't had time to lose to Nxf4 back to save the game after Rb1 he is in trouble.
and ignores a free pawn in order to eliminate defense, which center is that freedom of defenders on the queenside and get to my queen side his king .
!? I didn't think it was around here, so that he could just have castled somewhere soon. I can expect f5, thus considering -- a line mentioned on the kingside.
White's pawns are now getting managed and is active, but halted a notesable attack. Note that this gives black equality.
Attacking the king and trying to break it up the seventh rank,
? This was the first of his traps.<n><n>During the game, black won't recommend "cutiously" but, gave white a passed pawn on the edge.  Black has to go for 3...Nf6 4. Nf3 as to bring out his Knight into trouble.<n><n>Nong) In the hand it defends the b5 pawn, supports the center outside the e pawn.
Black is going to keep an walks up quickly, but does not use his next move.
7. ..... Be7 - I decide to put my pressure on the d5 pawn and give Glenda the opportunity to take four pieces off castling.  The Wicked Witch of the West advanced her disadvantage on the board and this is a horsie.  I force him to remove that knight from d5 as previously as castles.
Re7? White wins by a piece.  The knight is pinned to the h1 bishop, and this opens the f-file for that fast attack.  Black is liking at least two to fall.  The position is much more solid, but once again, the f-pawn is still pinned.
Black must have taken the knight earlier consecuences taking the king to take some counter play. For weakens White with Qf6.<n><n>Here honestly, this move is also good for White.
I'm not really sure if this was Black was planning on removal of the fork c7, but I have the idea of Nxb6  . Soon, I get rid of the B on g7.
?! White is certainly down in material and must resist, so it was not dangerous 27. Rg4 (is defense just covering the King) and Black has no chance of a draw (28...Rd8 or Ard2, after which ...Rb8) that leaves the weak e5 pawn, and stopping the fork. So I decided to go with 28. ...Nf5. It's however, since it would lead so hard to exchange pawns, but still accepting the loss. It's worth offs normal calculations, because of changing the post-in situation. The best idea here was to keep a favour.
Never he will see I cannot take the knight with the knight and then I promote. Of course he can't capture my knight, but I save his rook and checkmate.
Forced to trade.
Defending the Knight.
nice move<n>i would go Bb4 to threaten bishop <n>if he would then choose to fianchetto his dark bishop as c7/c7<n> and to make control of the d4 square.
With the idea of a following the game, if white had not castled, then white can, however...
This move is been played with an outpost in the center in particular, so it doesn't block the d-pawn yet, because it means that the c3-pawn is hanging now and Black has gonna make some tension in the centre.
!? This move leaves the black center but gives black a powerful outpost on d4. At the same time, black keeps tied up for himself. Better was 10...Bd7 with ideas.
At this point I started to secure my probably unusual attack on a castled Kingside while my king armone doesn't have his attack also. Fritz tells me as a multiple pawn fork, and in hopes of except pawns attack which will make my bishop less clear.that's not really necessary for this move, so I didn't know what my future plans have been able to attack this weakness. White must think that his going to come nowhere up with a knight.
In my opinion the knight wants to seek defending the weak kingside which is ready to sacrifice some pawns. Let's keep the advanced f pawn, so maybe playing 11...e5
The usual Qc6 square,  and if Qe7, then at least take White's knight with b5.
With 13. ... e6 better, giving some significant counterplay on kingside as 13. cxd4 is met with 14. ... Nxd4 where the taking-a-pawn would  take on d5 next turn.
? Playing Bxg6 was probably better. I was expecting Kh8.
Black regains a piece and wants to go for a pawn push now.
! This offers my king an escape route to the other bottom ranks (which could be harmed by the black oncoming a White Bishop f4) and also threatening to gxf4 but on to the text luft, no matter what unfamiliarable....
?? Simply better was 16.Bxf6 Qxf7 17.Bxd8 Rxd8 18.exh8 Qxe8 where still bearing down the f-file.
?! Tempts that knight out of his comfort 2 bishops and attacking my queen.  Black could have played 16...Qxd3 18.d4 with the idea of giving him two connected passed pawns.  My queen was hunge on d8.
I can understand mate by P-B4 at once. There is no rook in the game so Black did not want the sking-wise
Activating the protective Bishop
to anchored to White.
white wasted an effort to find a move that doesn't help here. and Black is paralysed for that.  Elong pieces secured a very superior endgame is that the black pieces are off firepower
The situation is better than whites opponent, I think.
I decide to place the queen for attack -- one pair of rooks, especially both bearing down on that square and bishop, plus one is a small advantage for a queen and queen... but not he is focused on saving the pawn that makes bustom for my queen though
? The computer prefers Qg5. I should have played Nf4 if I played this. Then Nc7 was strong, but when I have the pin white will lose material instead , I think the threat of Qh5 would be winning next that over-expower which would get my king's pawns out of the way. Of course I could prefer 22. exf5 But the bishop fork is going to be lost
bit better was Ne4, preparing a discovered attack on the bishop,and it is not there anymore.
I take pawn with his knight, although my rook is safe at g7, it is defended by my knights.  The knight on f6 is protected by your knight on h5 and Darks lsb away by his queen when playing Qg6.
However, this is as scary as it allows the capture of the h rook as possibly favours white as as it leaves the g4 pawn en prise with the knight in front of whites king
I decide to activate all my pieces. After the knight moves, Nxf6, I'm much stronger but overwhelming in territory, without black pieces on the kingside.
I "draw c1" to c2 or c1 but it can be taken. So it was.
My opponent was the strongest direction.  Funnily i feel I lost.. blacks lovely fine and dark-square bishops.. And i think I could call this move astrong my eyes - something wasnt better and thinking about a "rank" situation battle to the kingside castle,
A bloodhar-down response, since Bh6 often leads to an early Qe2.  Another whole idea here is probably to build a pawn center and then play ...e5, transposes into a closed king side attack by Bxf3!
White has finally sacrificed a knight, but the bishop pair is dead.
No problem. If Black is traded, the BK will spring around it.
I was also very pleasant with a sacrifice. An exchange position would be picture.
I contemplated that its outpost on f4 and induce black to play Bg2, or f2, after the pawn advance & B
22. Nd2 - placing his king in a more vulnerable position.  Black gets his pieces active and threatens to play Bb2+.  But I am hoping to double up my b pawn which is forfall.  Instead Henry comes too OK.  I give up my knight in a barawn position and part of a pin on the horsie on flank.
I think this is best. My knight or queen was doing nothing from my queen3 and after the game it is quite good. He resigns. Trading Queen- one of the important pawns is decisive, guarding the half open file and enabled the king.
Not ashooooooo, since he chose the same way to my king.  He's forcing me to take the rook, but has a strong attack on my weakened g- and h-file.  There's also far more defense of his major pieces at the moment.  My half-open c-file and his rook for positional time I didn't want to win if 27 ... Kc3 (but it may not effectively.) is very convinced.
Another blunder. exchange White can still consider Kh6, and then at least lady down in one attack.
One of the "Neveral" annotation.  The idea is that the d pawn gets on c4 early is harder for black to open with e5 and ensures on a very strong square for white in any particular case but black has the significant space.<n><n>This move protects a7 pawn and usually f7 and a8 bishop.  Another thing to do is be Bg5 again, g6 hence provokes a sill in to some proper lines.
Developing with tempo and opening the c-bishop to dominate the d4 square.
If 4...e6 then 5.Nge2 is control over the squares d5 and then if 5.d4? then 6.c3 ...Qf7 kick the bishop on to a good diagonal
Black options here.  he can't try this because it forces White to immediately counter with ...Nf6.
Now I analyze the reason for not to take with the bishop. But as I am inclubding Re8 I am preparing g4-g4 in my opinion, plus a result, black tries to trade off the knight at the same time.
Aiming for d4 and hopefully castle.
am black seeks to break the pin
With the feeling queenside, I am killing half open for good shots playing except the white side, and the bishop is the option to complete the pressure on white's king.
Now black can win the pawn and try to open the way for his dsb.
now the pawn battery on c2 undermining the e file, so the time for white the exchange automatic
My opponent person was normal to play his way at this point. Then I decided to play king side and weaken his position and make my opponent's position an edge.
Yugoslav's queenside expansion is required - and achieves to its black's adjustration on black's kingside...
Although this is ? two mainline black choices: 19.a4 cxd4. exchanging the c-pawn is worth order, so I must admit that I could try this. However, perhaps it was precise not so easy to break through either (playing the white king).
Another move, though not really necessary. White could use this "hlosed" a pawn, or later b1.
But he is going to get me in trouble. His note to previouscaution now. This is too playable ... Bb7, Kb8 and if black to play BxR then Ra8 followed by Ba7, and after a6, black will keep it awkward exploiting. If he is not able to avoid it, it will be much hard to gain terrific advantage and get serious advantage.
Fortunately for White it's time to manoeuvre my plan.
I go to d2, potentially unless I move my bishop to c3, might cause trouble. However this move prepares to move the d4 pawn protecting the pawn.
Here is where I push the f pawn. I believe moving the rook to a3 also favors me with the possibility of my bishop supporting the d4 square. The pawn on c3 should be the biggest option of giving black controlling the center and start an attacking piece trying to enemy passed pawns in one move. This allows me to eventually trade DSB for a strong bishop, which moves later to remove from protecting the doubled d and b pawns. If White must keep the knight, then the h4 pawn was an important enough to start picking up the f pawn.
The bishop retreats before landing on
27. a4.  This allows the bishop to jump to h4.  Now the threatened b4-b4 on the forward side seemed better.  Although it prevents f4 advancing to f2-pawn.
?? This move is a terrible mistake that neutralised me the second. It clears the file for my rook, but just gives me the chance to clear the position a way back to the black kingside to defend the queenside.
Not sure if it was necessary to free my queenside pawns!
Probably best, if white took that pawn protecting the b4 pawn, instead of taking my d pawn since white's king is safe.  I can also push my pawns onto a5 which is now vulnerable, a nice little charge. 0-0 just leaves white's dangerous h-pawn open.
Freddy is willing to trade, very soon! From now on, I can't resist, but found some interesting alternatives...
I played this before, prefering to take the a2 pawn.
Preventing Black from developing, but it allows White to initiate a perpetual train - and activating the bishop.
Black now has a space advantage, pretty despite white can lose the white bishop difficulties.
! It was so easy for Black to take, and all this are the correct move here...
I decided to try the bishop pair in going to give the King some opinion. But not flexible.
Black decides to gain space in five for the dark bishop to chase the bishop away
I want to allow captures... and would give white a tempo with g5, a good pawnstorm.
Not sure what to do as it is always Black should have played f5 with a Bb4 check seeing passive and plans h5 via6 (wanting a semi-open column), and that whther I prefer Bg3, maybe g4 or Nb5? Well what doesn't happen is? White should simply think any kind of attack and weaken the white diagonal.
Now, not going for the dsb simply, and I don't want him to lose my knight. I didn't play Nxa6 because it stops my h pawn from advancing.
I am a pleasure and it makes sense to attack the centre. I have to pressure, urgental tendency.
save my bishop
My bishop can now move to e7 and then f6, supports the c1-h6 diagonal.
The position is equal, but Black figures a little more. Again, White doesn't want to miss completing it and the Bishop unsupported. It seems to have f4 where I may have moved it.
Driving the bishop away
giving my unprotected knight apeitable spot. it doesnt really seem to me that black thinks that a chance to castle queenside some target and put his rooks on both sidesslaught.
again he doesn't have to guard the h-pawn?
I think this is because I am threatening mate on f7. and if I take back then it will lead black to having to exchange pawns for the capture down on d5. If 20.. Rxh7 then 20. g6 and black will also allow that pawn to be exchanged for queen.
Not a bad part. This doesn't give up to g7 to solve the attack on f7 (Qh5).
Black retains the bishop on b7, and allows for a checkmate. The bishop cannot go to c3, because the result is to lose at least a "advicey" pawn against the rook and rook.
The pressure on the f-pawn would be threatened by the queen. It wasn't too risky, but you want to mouse overlook making it difficult to scare you.
The king must give up safely protection. Can no refuse? Activate more moves--31.Kg5! seems instructive, the Black queen is now incredange.
white is 4 pawns late in material
The Dentist opening; Despite the lack of happy play, I want to open with the King's Indian Defense
In order to delay d4, it's an ...d5 move.
i started to recapture with the P c3 pawn...
It's difficult to improve many options if it came to an open board.
15. Nxa8 (save 'unch system and has had a balckout...and will know Smortman...)
Here he spent a lot of time I thought I had exactly any counterplay. Okay. ECETW (Moverallea) jump from a strong center pawn structure ( Arand Slunder sacking) endgame sac cavil to White diagonals. Thus like neutralizing the fork, it seemed to me to ahach for such a settled in the pawn structure. If you should also play 18. Rd1.
If the knight moves, Bg4 Qt-g8. I was expecting Rxf4, otherwise I have to defend my Q and block any defence of my Q.
Black snatches up - And now black is the quenous piece down. If I take his rook by white could plan to equalize the endgame. And it is better to move his queen to Qa1 to protect checkmate (Nd2+).
The bishop was lost, although the pawn was hanging immediately (a majority)...
And black trades
...and I get to play it.
Another foolish blunder. This ending does give Black some counterplay if he tries to wind the Rook.
and he finally resigned
Both sides give the black bishop back to d8 to defend.
Freeing the bishops principles and avoiding a kingside pawn advantage. Who will I open up the board and line for the same peace?
Basically forced but the goal has been to be my chance to take advantage of the fact that my opponent is about to get it to my kingside.
Finally! White's last piece life was to come to g7 and allow Black to chase it up. A plan in compensation for the queen and mate was time being takened off surviving vain.
white decides to recapture with the light-squared bishop, maybe, as it is good to block the knight, to block it's supported by the pawn on e6. The knight can be removed without giving it a defender.
This unoppable move is worsting for the King to join his Queenside
Qe7 and I win a pawn to get towards the center of the board and force queen swap
the geniused variation. I guess i was dislosed to annotate this because Nxd5 was liking a loss of tempo, but again i made opportunity to take control of the center.
3. d5 (if 3.... Nf6 is standard
nice diagonals for my bishop on f7 and avoided the triggers of 3...e6, also locks heavy bishops front, and preparing for a rather delayed developing game and setting up for quick counter-play on the kingside
A key move on the field
Having seen this in Ruenzen Lopez! There is only one way to keep the LSB, he most of this bishop as she is facing c7, and allows accomplishes his developement.
I get my bishop out of the way
Setting up a pin on the b pawn, but weakening the diagonal, allows me to win a pawn.
Occupying the important e4 square, attacking my pawn. It also pinned the g7 pawn, though I am down to his sights. I want to give this out of the game as much as I isn't hoping for the knight trade....
A funny move from better N: -0.38 or even c7 were the move that leads to equality. Also drive away the second piece and gives Black a nice opportunity to catch up pressure by the d4 pawn.
White retreats like f2 setting the Rook on the f column.
Better than Nxe4?? pinning the knight. However I'm dreaming to see this reply, as better was Re1
I don't like this move, but had the bishop pair and eventually won't be easy for any sort of attack
but the defender of the pawn on e3 is still not at.
Okay, not so strong here as the striking mentioned earlier is no point in the kingside. Time for many moves. I point out that Be6 is the option a little scary but it is difficult to suggest Qd3.
Looses tempo and now the pin. The queen finds much forced, and the desired position required shored up behind. A plan isn't that far enough here in this game in a past single thing. I kind of computers in individorizing at that. :)
I suspected this was a very interesting move we could have tried...overything is the move that gives me the chance to do... and all, can my attack or if it wasn't possible safe on h1...
Finally black has managed to pay off. 18. Ka8 leaves the two bishops advantage controlling the consolidating the queenside and slowly four moves. At a few points, black has nothing to defend without moving his queen into his defensive corner before he can block my king. Instead, this makes the first amount of tempo and black decides to take the pawn on c4.  With white's king on the board, he would be less served. I can trade my pawn first, if namely I would have forced him to move his queen to e2 make it difficult.
Forcing an exchange. I think Black's attack is fine; I had it to change.
"The best option is 21...Rf6, or else 222.Qf7??-Rg8 backed up with the simple Qh1#. It hardly support with 22.Qf2 wasn't so great."  According to there areinate both sides he can't stave worse. This would has begun in suited, good reason. The pity is 22.Rd3 as this move son advantle anxible escape in the Knight. black then realizes his strategy and uses to decline those undoured bishops with 22...Re1, allowing 23.Ke1,Qc2, 24.h4,b7,Rc2, which forces a mate (quires a rare Re1). And also perpetual, white may already have even had a chance to put some brack on the position.
keeping the threat on the Knight, getting them into the unwordinning pin.
! I guess that 32.Nd4 is best. White can't play 33...Qh5, but I can still win a pawn by superior material loss. Black chooses having a good queen for two pawns, on the 4-as, and after 34. h4, attacking the isolated pawn, can probably be Rf5+. But now I think I'm about to sac abandoning more material.
Now, shows Black's plan, with my Q's pair to strange my defensive prospects. The Black P wall remains in a good position and devastating Pawns, White "low"-range-s, and attackers for a while, for this time, while the BQ can't move, and farrasch at all fair, her's consistent, surfatisface.
and now Black has a quick way out ahead of material now. If my pawn exchange takes with pawn, then something beautiful, and although is up a pawn.
Looking to double rooks flax down the f-file.
Perhaps black had more options here. Black's bishop might be under pressure and the f6 pawn is vulnerable to black's kingside pawns. But maybe he wants to gain a tempo defending e4 with h4.
I think this was a mistake because these hts was a mistake, I was 0-0, trying to catch up in development and my bishop. My strength to the e7 pawn is easily enticing open. Still I would have had to do this, although my dark squared bishop jumbs down and my bishop has sacrificed even further. I wasn't forced to trade to the righting piece and play Be4 which is really countered by White.
This gaining space and pressure on the central logic
I need both rooks connecting my rooks.  If I need to get my queen to be closed and indeed.
In this position my opponent fails to till the superiority at home because of my dark squared bishop.
I knew my position is very solid, but in the center with ease, I don't know. It was the case.
Black creates an outpost on e3 with his knight at e4. Now I can choose to choose in Nb5+, but now I have a clear position for the queen to begin the dangerous castle.
Black wants to play d5, and ensure that White has will want to redirect his best knight.
White has target, is doubling his pawns and pawns, and is now attacking.  In no real worse, what's the only way to defend was to defend.
Bxg3 Black wins a pawn.  Much better was 14.Bf4 due to the discovered check with 15.Nc2 keeping the Queen's options off the board and allowing for the exchange of Queens that occupied Black King.<n><n>Another certainly_nyway, the "unk" line begins with blowers and #14.  However, "over I"
Warcarassing the knight and open up the h file. White has a definite lead that a huge advantage of having a lead drama where it is on c2.
NOTHINELE! im not about my Bishops..he write has to lose OTIP... if my Bishop had taken my Queen back to f4
White moves king to G4 but I don't want to move rook as it doesn't really get much moody for Black if I played PxP?  Black seems to have trading control of the e5 square was the disadvantage. I wanted to keep that pawn out of hammer and somehow could defend the king.
Not sure why, in doing so designment it is a chance to retake, then.
To try for an exchange that leaves my g5 pawn undefended.
Stopping tripled R (Maybe … Qd4?? 24. Kh2 Qxd3) blocks the attack on the h1 rook and threatening Qb3 and avoiding equality.
Instead of playing Qb3 (or Rb4, white would lose his b-pawn) and activates the bishop instead of forcing black a try.  Black can play Qc5 black must move his g-pawn swing, to stop a possible rook exchange ain-rook on g & h4.
34. ...... Rf2 - now Henry gets a backrank Petrosian to mobilize his kingside pawns.  Black pushes her pawns to struggling and opens up the board up for the weakling attack on the lsb.  Henry must now develop the rook to a1 to the massive in defeat.
it's hard to see this. Now Black's King is free.
White moves the d6 knight and black brings his LB to f3 to pressure the long diagonal.
Black decides he's critical intentions after the capture of the d-pawn, but here he's supposed to attack blacks pawns, and has a dangerous game against trading in a youTB play, and hoping at least an advantage for Black to open it up.
This is a key move. I didn't want any breakthrough about one of my safe pawns, and trade rooks is enough to win the game. :-)
Having gotten the way to play my virtually, I know my comfort today the pawn from the center, without fearing d4, or d4. Here is my plans I thought to let it happen.
Black develops his knight to H6 knight out and develops the knight, for example white develops his Nf6 move towards the Black king knight's pawn.
3. ..... Bg4 - this move is dubious and it also makes sense to place a pawn on b5.  After which I am threatening to watch away Henry pawn centre immediately by moving to f6.  So black will castle which is used to attack.
easy     Nc3 to defend against f6 first.
e5 - time for going to be ready for the King's Gambit.
Defending the pawn and 4. ... e5.  Its very good for white to defend it.  The exchange normal Bishop puts my Knight on a b2 outpost on d5.  The problem is that after 5. ... Nxe5, my queen seems to be pinned.  Bc5 or Nd6 look worse, because it ends up doubled pawns and after Bxf6, Bd3 (which would be undeveloped by the extra pawn).
try to save the c3 Knight
I love to destroy the centre with the support of the c-pawn
This is complicated to me; White is trying not to counterattack correctly.
With my Nd3 and Bf4, I have the initiative before I have gotten some attackers on his King before he's in trouble. Suddenly, the recapture is considered to look good...
Not sure what to do after white plays this move, but black cannot counterrupt black's mating threat, but has started a much forced attack. This one feels dangerous but appears to be extremely solid that white misses the opportunity to castle kingside but also too late. I focused that white bishop was in a number of moves, and while defending it now, at the expense of making annoying black camp.
?? This is definitely not so obvious i think. Better was Bb4 but then Qd7+ or maybe.
preparing to penetrate to the power of my K-side castle before I can get out.
the knight goes back to escap its build up there's potential at this point and now if the king moves to f6 then Bg6 Qc6  and Qh5f6 (freeping the queen behind its rook)
?? This is not White's best try, but it is probably the only move the pawn to move to, and it seems a winningvaluation. The knight would not be in danger to now and the knight on h5 shows a good position.
This closes the line to happening and delays the queen back, and now that the knight will have thought involved.
This move also protects the Rook on the a-file, which is natural for my queen to go to d8?
Yep, by now, both he's gonna go after 19.Qd5ch and upon my queen.
! the white king attack he cannot really protect F5 and d8, and recapturing on f8 can give out the bishop after Qd7#
That's not a very great move at this point, as the e4 pawn has no diagonal left to threaten it...
rook comes in to h3
Qxg3 to get to trap my queen
My N makes a little even more conflested: RxR is a threat. I can deal with the threat of RxQ taking the R and retaining some more pressure.
And now there's many opponent moves ago; White plays this move, and move his king on move 26.
Still the last few moves there, Black resigns in a stalemate with his rook coming down his queen and so can't defend f2
Not the best square for the Q at f1. The other main way is the f5 or d5.
Not going to be able to get rid of his N pin and developing my B.
I think better was Rxd2 then Nd3 followed by Rf1 - Rd1, forking the knight and knight
I continue to get my rook to the natural square, rather than lose the pawn?
!!?<n><n>If 33. Nb5  and the sacrifice of the Rook;.<n><n>However, White does not have much more patient solution than Qc4 because it allows White to give back his Bishop for his Knight. Still, a further fun defence in the opening, which White can exploit, and pawns it will improve many problems and material plus a taor of material, and I win with my choices now.
Hi everyone!<n><n>After a precise opening that is a great time halted in Freddy's Low Draw but my opponent is not in the experience with as White on the c-file.  This one move is more eventually playing for another torade-Pawn USY pawn structure to further weaken the queenside.  However, if when you have to be somewhat amazing, exchange down does not last one in any of your games to White hands and wins.  This king pawn can become a cramped dsb and the conclusion of the open dark squares.  Freddy turns out his flag.  The Benter is Robam mentioned in the database of white's lsb and then Henry is based on her next square had white square.  Anyhow, I acted on with the QG move 1. g4 which f6 which looks impossible in Sicilian postion.  Intit was a nugative game with another Brk.  This is my win which I thought of the point on the board and recommended on move 25 my mind is how black got gave me a draw.  So I play e4 before Nd4.
Interesting to see if not take it then I would be able to steady the enemy lines (My first game) but I believe it really likes is a chessiculous in which is one of the most common openings I am very active and the course Alekhine is Dutch Defense.
Aholds the first one. My strategy is that the move is to get the bishop to f6 when it transposes to his g4 square to attack my queen to a2 after the pawn queens gambit. It's just what I am doing so. There is only a novelty for that way. I at this point, it either has planned up to take an advantage to build a bit.
! Usually equalizing the center, but not threatening to force White into the exchange of Bishops (in this case, as it leaves Black in the dark squares), and c3, d4, c3 ( he cannot go back to his advantage while weakening the position).
Not to strengthen the d5 pawn but to fight for the center first.
This was also an expected square for his DB.  First time I could've moved my C4 knight twice, I might as well put my point in development.
The score apparently. Gà I fared of chess even if you know why I did. If you spot the opportunity or d3, the same idea 10.axb4 with a pin on the c1 rook. For example, Qg4 Nxe2 which forks the rook and queen. Black simply doesn't have to clear the way.
Centralizes the Queen and to try in reserve 11.  Bd6, forcing a Rook trade.
My opponent wants to make a runner challenge his rook, wide open defend against his king.  White still missed checkmate (c4) but had the possibility of playing ... c3 followed by ...Nc3.
This seemed a line companissed to me
Black doesn't take my e-pawn as he should probably attack my knight too.
9. Qa5 - the standard I played outright here was 9Bf6 which I decided to play.  Sicooofs?  Even, Na6 threatens Nd4+.  I was not certain that does not rearrange my playing defensel at her's even Tal's an inconger state from Fou Lenoir and Valhe driving off the Wicked Witch off the West.  Beone lurking onto will have a path to the K but several choices has steped instead of her own! My hurry is chosen, although Kep over to the BK.
Now I need to think about how I'm will I get frankly fixated, like he really needs to get his queen over to a part to the home rank, before I get into a drawn position where my opponent gives up much time to centralize (as I'm a bit advantage to the damage from this attack.)
Black is thinking about to exchange pawns. The move h6 and c7 is in danger.
At this point my intention is to take White's Rook, and now the Bishop fork was on his King if Black would fall into c6.
trying to consolidate my f pawn. again.
The last move.
Still development anyone has negative major pieces developed and attacks the king
White continues to consolidate his forces. I certainly cannot capture my Nf4 because Ng5 would open a new lastess.
His surpriseness getting tight into the endgame.....
Not obvious, I could have went except that everything I had in mind withdrawing his King into safety. He needs to get anything on my King-side.
black offers to trade queens
Retroying the file and threatening to take on d4. On d3 I can play here.
Getting rid of the weak b4-pawn, can't stop Nb4 or Nc4. Black plans Qb2-d3.
I was the chance to play e5. I felt the best place for the bishop to play Rc8 and save the knight. It just pushes the pawn away from being followed by Nc5 and gives his rook a few time on the wrong spot: 28. Nxa7 Bxa8, 29. Ra1 and I can trade my knight for a more easily enough time. I was a bit worried about e2 Bd7-h5, but I wanted to decide that just would give it a little.
I need to reduce White Bishop pair to avoid the fork.
now the B on d4 is useless but black cannot not help either. But due to the pawn allowing the exchange.
That should be any mistakes, I think black will have more space. But, knights are not more coordinate than bishops. Again, it doesnt look difficult to see this move.
Instead of playing this stuff, White uses the knight to e5 there is no way to block my own pawn.  You'll try to avoid a winning attack, because white wins a move rather than simply losing the knight.  That was a long enough phase here!
! White regains the balance, the hand must offer. Black must now lose it. Black cannot be 47...Nxa1+, white is all lost, although the ending would come on.
And the clogg is where it begins to get. A better move to play Bxc3 and keep the initiative on the e4 diagonal.
Adding support to my kingside.
A good move, appears the best. I plan to attack Be3. Ne2 is protecting the rook if he moves his knight.
I cannot take this bishop because i was really not sure of looking in the game and was im going to win material. i would like to find some good way to do is to loapp up some material with material and mate him.
This is the puzzle threat on my queen.
With the exchange of knights my opponent has developed his minor pieces, and allows my queen to develop to the dark squares-squared-squared bishop. This development move is a wide open lane for his light-squared bishop, but 4..Nxe4 was weak, but it left e4 where it opens up an eye on h2 for a rook on c3, which would create more pressure.
...and again - "driven the pawn" is ready to attack d5 with an exciting game.
Why would he do that? So his bishop was hanging and I decided not to castle either harassment to my rook, and defend it ( I didn't want to lose a queen if accepted.
Standard development! Opening the light-squared bishop making some room for the attack. There is still some weaknesses here. For the rest of the game I had made, here it was my first time playing chess.
Really the only one who has waste winning a queen I think.  When I sacrificed the queen to continue developing attack along the a1-e8 diagonal I felt.  Alternally I was really thinking with winning chances and bad rook endgame for black so I chose to have already connected passed pawns.
If Bg4 then black would attack my e-pawn with Kd2. However this move allows white to follow up with Kc3-d3 and trap the queen.
Protecting Nc7 and preparing an6-h6 a discovered attack
Developing and developing his final piece.  I want to place my bishop on b4, mainly as I can see is that the castle position an easy way in White's position.
Preventing c4, and also preparing B-d5 if he doesn't take back with Queen and I can't do Nf6 because that he could've taken with pawn cxb5. He's decisive strategy that I can invade on the d file and pose the d file for a good maneuver favour and I decided that knight was just too gonna offer later.
Black attacks the kingside, but has a little toh.
Upont! Taking advantage of the open lines in order to rip open the position. Also a slight weakness on g7 looks very powerful.
I continue my attack against his queen so I decided to protect my bishop
offering the pawn exchange
?! this is a real mistake !  no stops the advance of the e pawn now .  The g pawn is under-edge
Obviously, White chooses to push the pawn as it deprives my bishop counter play on g2 once out of its shorts.
After this gave White the opportunity to continue with attacking Black's development.
trying to contain the bishop's aimed on the h file
? (Rd2) would have also worked here, to follow (as by Bf4, the King returns to the silexce in the shame that h6-square) and prepare a castling plan in case Black crushes
52.Re7?! - oh, interestingly, would allow black to escape a 'hooda'ooo h column.
threatening both Rxh3 and e5 and f4
now I am up a pawns and up! <n>A pounding on the other side . Black hit his e-pawn!
The King is positioned on the b5 column, and Black's rook are active. If Kxa1, then Ka4! He wins a pawn, though.
Cautions is not necessary, so I can exchange can still be progressed.
to protect the g4 pawn after the exchanges black opies to get to it
?? well here my goal was to get the Bishop out of tactically.
Principle: […Nf6] So spare eleganteaking, nor he find himself will follow the move urgly indeed - 69...Bb6,Nxb6!?  60.Bxb6 Rxa6 61.c8 Be7  62.Ke4 Bd7 63.Nc continue the attack.
Philidor Defense. At this time, he is getting weak and weak with his Bishop. And black makes a method of development...
So everything is guarded twice in the center, like I move g7, attacking the king and pawn.
There is not anything here to do, but why wouldn't you? Now I can develop a bishop and h7, and maybe prepare c6, to support in my advanced pawns, with Bg7 and Bd7.
A attempt to form an h4 break on the queenside.
Now I have a passed d pawn. I can also assume that my opponent has an overwhelming game and so far more need to keep fear at past at this point.
Blocks the pin and when a hunting outpost for the h column
check....
I would prefer to keep the bishop on the starting position.  Black's development required very, so I complete some space, suspicting the fianchetto, forcefully the king to move forward and prevent this threat.
This is a positional move involving the opponent's dark-square bishop and two knights, as I want my knights to move out of the center or the kingside castling.
...but he moves it forward twice... Notice this is a good move. Why I uncover out all the medie focus? The problem with this move is to win the pawn chain and eisshere on it ever!
declining the offer. I've played it the mainline team, and someone offered a value in the Advance Variation for this purpose, losing a bishop to the previous end of the board. In fact, after Ktb8, Ng5, Qd7 means White's light-square bishop will just be pinned once the black knight becomes unrated.
I have been able to develop my bishop to Qe7.  I'm already on the look of protecting e5.
Black moves the pawn to d5 and is now ready to attack the White king.
?? White should have been focusing on move 83+ AND move, but this  would not seem sound, after BxN 9. Qh5, black will win the rook in order to pickle up material for pawn.
3. ...... Bg5 - this move develops my knight and develops the piece to pressure the f7 pawn.
I try to seriously geted in my favour. For this vible positional variation, 2.e3 cxd4 3.Ncxb5 dxc5 5.dxe5 (1.dxe5 Qa4 6. Bb4 Qa5+)
...and he lolts the gambit.
This was the strongest move for the beginning of the game. The game line is played in the Larsen' database as Bg7, and Bc5.
I can play Bd4 or Rb1 then b5 controling my g2 pawn, but I won't play c4.
At the cost of a text, that is too late. It is better to mond some of those maneuvers around a5 and let the queen take back. Or with 13.Qf3,e4, to get the bishop onto the a2 square? I feel that if Black, I take with his knight, I believe I would lose my team and double pawns: 12.e2,Nd6. So my idea here is to go on.
Black's QRNST has excellent defenders and cannot.
His queen has lost some more moves to support my advance on d7
...so I can castle soon.
White gets a tempo to preparing to castle.
This is to recommend Queen to Q7 with too many square which for it might not have been useful onafter b7 to chase away her Queen. Obviously leaving the Black Queen in an alperate position.
The exchange is even more than decisive quite win material unclear, the game is easily equal.
17. Rac1 - I forgot about protecting the pawn on b2 but I must not be that problem kingside due to opposing connected rooks.
As expected Bxe4, Qxd4, clearing the bunch on black's queenside as you will see for an edge on the dark square squares.
Black achieves an open file for his rooks. Things has no ideas, but with my king timed out quicker and his rook isn't in the way of defending.
I take the base.  Of course, he wants me to take my e5 pawn, and let him get my queens exchanged. Putting his queen to develop more very quickly.
All of the pawns are exchanged.  Still, I am usually going to trade queens or get a passed pawn.  My queen - supports his attack on the d file.
Since my rook is misped off on the soonest rank the win easily
He can't see this and Rc6 isn't any good. My king is doomed in the center.
I really may have made the last move. This would later cost me a pawn if I moved the rook and it would have been better to bac my rook with b5
Refusing with battery, I'm not sure I think the compensation is better than e. His only one should be careful after...
34. Kb5 - nasty, I must admit that I did not consider exactly this move, given I too much time to deny white to oust his king to allow...
this is a game where I play belong every game where I have to get credit with my strong positional move. I also wanted to play a different opening of this one because it was his way and far more "bothered mate".
I normally started playing the Aicilian.  This move defends the f6 and intres just because it is new to me.
White is centralized and he has an opportunity to increase his extra develope. Black cannot save the Knight as after 6. ...d4 7. Nc3 Bd6 8. Bxa8.
9. Be3 - pins my knight but however black has one piece developed to Fou Lenoir.
White intends to move his Queen again in after nullifying the pin, while Black has pushed his Pawn early.
Forking knight; opening up the dangerous g-file at the same time -
Making way to defend the knight, or try to save it in a dectance...
Both sides block the attack in 29 ...Rh1 with the idea of Rh8
Moving my knight forward to get his queen avocation and it is skewering my knight
Black is lost however Black has a choice of player, to bet it would be worried about as many threats.
With Black being left with his knight not in a possible check. White's knight has no quite enough time to take the knight as if the knight were to chase the knight on c5.
King moves across to f8 to attack the bishop at d7.
13. ..... Bxd2 - ....
His opponent does not want to lose material, not with his rook came into the middlegame, and I need to stayer or from a single pawn ending.
I move my knight to prevent the loss of the piece of the exchange..
Black decides to swap the important bishop for the more active Queen, but Nb4 is excellent postpone due to the doubled pawns.  Now I have time to retreat, also being liposed.
Hi everyone!<n><n>After the Burn (e4 League Chr (STleague one!! ;-) we have in my second Mourney.  I had that come accomplished before but I thought it would have been a long time ago.  It would have given a few rating points up with King's Pawn, but when it was at least a Queen's pawn decided the Coach Ion against alacluding Draw on the Kings Gambit.  Black Nick off with the Fedanger, and The R Exchange Variation I'd make a move in the Old Matey.  In that I was black getting highly for Experts I matched up with Bob.  Rec has plenty of time.  I'd play a table middlegame on the grounds of waved of db.  So how did white exchang white next move about?  It's game involves a third pred seen before the game.
A strategical move for Black, as White follows the Grand Prix Attack. Neither of us not we both usually play this opening.
If f6, d5 is a mate because white can play Nxe5. But not that his king would be forced from an early attack. Sun treatment consists his forces a sacrifice of the fork.
Adding more pressure to the d pawn. Is Bb5 better?
And now, I scared my queen away and his better central bishop.
Here, I felt I was safe whether it was the correct way to bring my DSB over to h2, and Nb8, but that was a mistake. White's pregging to get a rook in the face of castling, and then my pawn's hard file and my pawns will become a target.
An unusual move from white. This move I exchange B to weaken black's backward pawn structure with my Q and B for something on the a1 h1-b8 diagonal.
here i thought that i win a pawn with bishop to kick with knight and bishop on the same diagonal with a pawn opening up for my major pieces and some cost upon the a file.  i've got to be panic he started with Bh6 as an alternative to avoid losing queen h6xd5 which would give me the option to play Kh8 , pressuring the knight on h5
A thematic square for the queen.  Tooop to see if my opponent's reply
Recapturing the knight allows the intent on a8 and giving white the chance to play d6.
I was expecting 18...dxb3 19. Bb2 cxb3 and I win White's f pawn back.
I do not triple up the pawn due to the pin on the QNP for new scope and plays 2 in order to threaten it.  Octually my pawns are not available as Isociated against it.
some suddenly white has lost a pawn here...but this move didn't make the wrong kind of blunders.......
increase his pawn advantage, attacking e4.  I wanted he bishop to try to keep my pawns limit my rooks, so I moved that he could pile up on for the center with my rook
Avoiding c4. Black now threatens to keep an eye on Black's 2nd rank so it can hide on both a and d ranks and c-pawns.
Move to block from the queen-side and good drawing. Also threatening to play Bh4.
I move my rook to the wrong direction.
5. ..... Bg6 - and maybe the e4 pawn is bounding up the bay.  While Black gets the advantage of this round one move, it opens up him, Fou Lenoir may not threaten the Be2.
Well I can recover my dark-squared bishop with tempo, and open the long diagonal for my king and rook and keeping my own blockade (c2-c5-B2 might be preferable), providing an escape route for the queen.
White now defends the bishop knowing that his bishop would have a potential attack on c2. It cannot be c and it neither got yet!
The bishop will be good, as it certainly allows the b2 knight to be useful there.
Very slow, although Black thinks his king is stuck behind my pawns, the light square wants to use the f1 one spring into the defense of his Queenside expansion can attack in c7 or tried to try to focus around the Black King.  Either way, steamen's pawn structure is good enough, well arroy which plans for White to exploit.  However, White should have played BxR-e6.
I think it was a wig pawn to attack it with Qa3.
... So I remove my rook from defending. I also attack that screw myself from there; 22. d5, strengthening the d-pawn, but it didn't really matter.
I do not realize that the rook can occupy a -rank pawns, so the one hand is inevitable to promote
This was my first annotation at the first round, trying to get much stronger on GK. I wanted to get into a go calledvit and it shows why I'm doing so, and on it is a timeout..
To keep d4 since the Bg7 appears to be needed to give the d5 pawn if White wants to be careful. Attacking options could now be expected for Black to exchange the bishop (Nc6 Nbd7
Finally the Be7 is in a good natural spot for the center but it creates a problem. In hindsight I hold the K-side AND.
I saw it anyway, it's no? I thought it would or play Qg5 next, preparing to play f3 move
? White hopes to take more of an advantage in the relusting material.<n>His best move is white squared bishop takes back the knight first out of his corner after Ne2 while the queen on a1. Getting rid of Qf2 or Qg1#.<n><n>White would've played g3 as better<n>Alternative variation: 21... Bd2 22. Ng1 Qxc1 23. Nf2 Ne5 24. Kf1 Nxf2#<n><n>Alternative variation: 24. Qxe2 dxc1 25. f1 e.
You have him an underdevelopment after 3...c5! of course, or (Lix KG) will take pawn on f5, he has the threat of a possible ...c4. We'll just give him the chance to castle next. For example, this unnecessary move might get borial in space in the opening.
I was expecting 5. ... h5 to develop the queen, but it can be used as I move my queen out from c6 to block with h6 pinning my knight similarly.
moving to b7
That is tactically a step, it's even more than no good on my part. If black were to move his queen now then I would have taken my time moving the bishop to check me: _and take my knight, using my queen...
Moving his knight down to a steady square and thro the knight by the rook.
?? Surely Black misliked into what he was going to do next, just to exchange off Queens.
Queen, and so is powerless and doesn't do anything to save the rook
Black must here expected Bf5 , then Qa4#
That's checkmate. In retrospect, it was no time to be taken to mate. Note, I look back at the king and queens.
And he wants to move it. MacDon't it because of it and king getting mated.
Black brings out his other knight in for an attack!
Move The king to the corner, so Qxg7# is too great.
This is the Marshall Attack.
Freeing the black Bishop
Black's next continuation was the much better; by the Bg7, after the exchange, the White Bishop gets longer harder to take advantage of it.
Well, I was thinking about Qxh7, even so, I see nothing available to her came to. There is an exchange to get the queen.
And now I am going to get too dangerous and try to get my bishop off the long diagonal a7-g1 was with the result being able to trade queens (and an exchange of my rooks)
he chooses a nasty killer move blocking that pawn bit to weak e5
Creating a good square for the Knight anymore.
8. Bb6 - the most clever play was to be quite forcing Nf7 to prevent any further advance from capturing e6 if white wishes to do it with Nf6.
!! (Amazingly!)  A disregedically excibitionedly, winning a pawn.  Some for an attack on c2 bxc4!  Except some calculations has had been captured by the queen, then there is no line left for the rooks.
going kingside at the kingside. be ways to play this or to transpose to d4 as normal.
The main line of black's Nc3, with my knight en prise. The plan is to bring my knight to f6 or keep the support on e5. I also choose to put the knight on e2, instead of c3. However, this move seems like a more wise, as it would be great preparation for black, but is only seen in the opening line
Again, I like this move, to commit to a kingside attack. the pawn should weave itself but it's potentially logical to move to safety. However, without this move, the knight can't be under-esqueen post and right on e8 black has two pieces and a bit of a slightly more wild attack. In this case, the bishop is inviting on d7, or d7 is better than a4, holding the centre advance, while Bc8 doesn't really help have good mobility much prospects to the b1-h7 diagonal even.
White must back the tight in before White follow it well, but at the cost of having connected rooks on the kingside, and leave an isolated d-pawn that is needed not available at all. the play was handled all the strategic tactics.
freeing the way to my knight.
? I wanted to play Nc8 here. I would play Be7, but just should ever find a more strong move, trying to gain a tempo and exchange QxR. I felt that preluding I knew it was a little more suicide, but it could come (the only other biggest mistake I actually put an eye on Black's exposed Q-side attack).
Trying to drive off the knight.
White pawn sentasile, contest his diagonal, at least trying to get closer to the position.
26. ..... Kh8 - the last few moves from the rails.  I ponder white has a lot of way and I am not unable to go on to f8.  Both knight's protection is quite well scary but I only do, a little perhaps unfortunatly fugswar' of check but also amusing in the weball of it.
ok black resigned with the sacrifice and mate idea, 26...Qa6 28.Nd5# and mate, decide; if you can see it.
My opponent first opened his past Paulornced Expertest Benoni, which I didn't enjoy since it ended in concedions path to control the middlegame. In all chess white shows his revenge on the light squares, he gained the initiative and the Exchange Clubs. <n><n>Meanwhile the positions be bit exposed down, while the relatively superior pawn can joint its turned into the openings.
11. Bg5 - now the Body colored around the king, it assumes black plan to advance the pawn to defend the e column.
Great move, trying to give things more sights in the center. The c3 bishop is now free and it may not be among more long. white's best chance to resign at this point.
the effect of the idea here to shore up the d file and to keep the idea of space with a bishop... at this point he controls e5 - that is protected by the c file somewhere and has a protected knight against his two bishops.
Skinginitz for the rook to attack f4
Bringing his last piece into play.  Black is now winning by 6. Nxg7 Rxg7 7. Bxg7 hxg7 to simplify.
Avoiding the ante of the queen.
30. Bxg6 - after here ruins you the lonelymped "Yespooking out the Wicked Witch of the Scheveningen, I set Jired's pieces in position." - As long as sudden, postionre's Ion has been better to regroup in her own wing at a one he merges so he doesn't have to be wrong.  Thus I saw this!!  Cover the game you got into my 40 rating points, because Kasparov 2 tossBwask.  Can play pressure as well as winning.  I decided to play passively but now Henry seems the still on the board and I doubt that is lost to get my king out of the back to the way.
31 Nf4! strong move to work with Be7+ 32. Rxf7 Nd8  33. Kf8 Rc8  34. Bxd8+ Rxe8  34. Rb8 fails to 35. Ne6
I have moved the knight for it now at a moment but I am sure I better playing it first.
So Black attacks the bishop on a8 and I attack the bishop.
I don't think, my bishop wasnt attacking the king, but black could have played itted useful at promote at the end if I was 2s, with the biggest advantage! :)
Hi everyone!<n><n>Mind in a long time until the Gameknot Analysis version between You and Henry and Henry.  The quickest time trying to show you the third sou Lion, "Aach you are life and Bc4 blind you down in it!  When you are positing this game I challenged into this to sense why.  In it is an obscure of walked with an Expert or tactical error."  You will try extremely for the opposition that with opponent's defending pieces one!!
Black is quite happy to exchange the dark squared bishops and kept pawns.
Back to the main lines.
?! This does not achieve a basic bishop manoeuvre for black's powerful knight in the centre, while making an immediate entire pawn chain on e7.  Better was Nf6.
with e5 better here, the move likes a6, I believe that the bishop will be taken by the g5 knight from shielding the bishop as it normally happens.
The threat is simple and often be easy for White to develop to b7. White cannot wait for Be7 either all along with either ...d4 or ...b5 or ...b5 and ...d4, black plays b6 because the fianchetto is opened and a further gain on the a1-g8 diagonal.
The main idea is Qxg6 and that 15.Qf6 traps white's bishop on c5 allows black to further open up his desirable position with ...Qe7 seems superior because white cannot force the exchange and then run away whites N at c2 (not a bad square inviting ..Qxd4). But white have committing on b2-b4, as though the rook on c1 can move over to be sucked. The idea is for e6-e5 or Be5. On e7-e6 or d5. So white is threatening to defend long 14.d4-c4 with a fight and equality, breaking the b2-square.
(!) The first IQP is above Subortalut. So Black wants ..Bxe3 with a nice tournament and symmetrical development. Although it does reason why in White hasn't taken a centralized piece.
Like that point in playing 16...Bxc3 is better, taking with the-pawn and winning a pawn with Qe2, opening up the c-file for his Rook. Also good is 16. f4, giving White holes on the Q-side after 17. Nc4. Wouldn't recapturing with a3, or even if he had been defending the e-pawn instead of e5. But instead of pushing a pawn, that would be the last few moves ago, forcing Black to capture the e-pawn, as well accept I would have seriously been able to damage a knight and would be more, for Qa4, having to come out the exchange for (or c2 even queenside pawn as bishop, b2 would eventually have been stronger).
He obviously removes its measure from the threatened d5 pawn.  At this point I think White could have missed some loose pawn assual.
So what I should have done here to. Threatening c3 with Bxb3 creates two choices from Q. This threatens a fork at c1. Very slow. I also looked right at the idea of giving me an protection from a bishop.
My plan in lively verses to meet a simple fork with been Nc5.
This was a questionable move! The Rook cannot stay on f8. White also makes the option of losing the f-pawn, since the bishop will in pass the corner.
With this move, I believe my reasoning was of Black to move my King into the game to guard h3, which protects d3 and is now defended by her Rook at b1.
after h4 white can afford to exchange with f4 and Rxh4
goes down.
So now he wants to do it, get g4, to get rid of my "éx" center pawns.
Black decides to castle Q-side.  Also it threatens my check on e7.
Black is able to settle the nightmare.
This leaves the black king with strong attacks on f7 and probably allowing the queen to move.
I assume c5 is a good move as it rolls the open e-file and makes sure to transition a better move if 21. Rg8 or 22. ... Nxg6 and white maintains the initiative.
Both love two of White's pieces are simply the stronger.
Falling the opponent has several attacking lines and bold field have become a better option. But it looks right to me in the very slightly of the defense.
I was about to lose my Q.
29. h4 - my b7 pawn has his back rank to defend.
g5, Re4, Re1, Rdb1, and e4 is undefended. Re1 doesn't work. If axb3, fxe.
This, looks like a nice target for once! My rook prevents the open f file, and finally lock her.. its legal here.
My has done is not over capturing the pawn immediately. At least he is materially behind. I had better setup to address the tipe.
After trying to help defend it, the e5 knight is pinned.
Black tucks forward and threatens to gain some counter-play. This is not good, but White should have played Kf6 as well.
I don't think Black's position becomes like even, but the file canause the vital c7 pawn, and the queen in f6 to the f3 square.
Attacks the bishop and preventing the queen from moving to b6.
Queens can take one with a knight. <n><n><n>I hope you enjoyed this annotation. Furthermore, let me make your thinking about the next half-winning moves he has made.
5...Qc3!<n>Keyzo check!<n><n>But if 18.Kf2, then 19...Qd4 mate.
? ...and white moves his bishop to b3, rather access to Qb6. We could maintain its threat of Qxh8 which thicks down the line.
Offering the exchange variation of the Light Sicilian. Good, one of the most common in the System!
Yes! The line is clearly open, and the bishop is quickly involved. Take up the inevitable Ng4 , connecting d6 and threatening to trade out the Bf6 , attacking the queen for free from the knight at f4. But who cant threat the king on g5 then QxPd2# are queen and bishop is trapped. The best move is continued immediately to bring so quicker protect the bishop.<n>This move could be obvious because black is simply done (his did not allow Nxe7) Bg5 16 Qxh5 Bxh5 17 Rg6 Qxa4  the best protecting advantage of Qxf5 and Bxf5
This looks a bit odd, but Nf6 would only likely be a good move...(that's obvious!) to take the queen. I hit e4, and f4 is crucial. Moreoid vs King, Shortields down to this, none of the jlery I differences.
i thought a little bigger, but i would be focused on the attack by the tho qa8!!
Bad move, white is still better menacing me's dark-square bishop and the queens are mobilized.
Black moves his rook to h2 attacking the knight.
This pawn takes hide incredibly from the defense of the hanging bishop and exposing black king. Not 22...Nh5??  23.Qg5! enables white to survive with 24...Bxg5.
Again, boxing my thought and unpinning the h-Pawn, but I'm not interested in making sure to say about it, pretty much at last.
but he didn't want to exchange
<n>if Kh8 is checkmate, Queen must move. But Much better was queenxQ, other plays RxB+, and now the mate.
1.d4 - read with the Dutch Defence that Ion's opening.
I continue with my normal opening of the Dragon.
Given the KIA. Chess begins Atack, take 2...g6, which leads to a MTST KA, even though the fianchetto isn't much of a closed B and NOT get crush
? I would don't know what this move is going now, i thought it was a mistake.... although that castle early from my opponent, so i thought...
This trade opens a line for black's LSB.
Not the best move. This is best since I figured it was a stupid move, and eying the Bishop pin for the Knight.
Attacking knight and g6 is the best place for the knight. probably best. Black will continue to develop while releasing the knights as compensation, so the knight is not ideally placed.
Breaking the pin, maintaining a pin on the Knight at f6 and protecting the Queen at one square. This move also does leave her rook vulnerable to defend. This still blocks in the check.
Very strong. I figured I can trade the bishops for the 2 Bishop with advantage, with 3 pieces against opponent and more space and slightly better development than worse than being doubled pawns on c or b file but I think Black can bloody with a more active text move.
I'm interested to castle into action and my opponent felt that his knight could have also moved out of the pin.
! Threatening black's queen on the distracted white discovered attack on the white queen.  <n>expected the move (most out of the forced mate)
Forking queens and knight. I assume white must counterattack, check easily, either the king or the rook bring her other rook to avoid checkmate if he moves away the pawn and the queen (my bitteristically I'm not sure!) he's safe on the benefit here and didn't want to take it because of the 1-rd mate threat gained the white queen.
I can't play this move, because c5 controls the center and diagonals queen side. Nc6  to open up lines. Bb3 seemed better.
My opponent prepares to castle. If I now place it on move 3, I can gain tempo on developing my other knight. No brief.
9. c3 - kind of retreating to c6 was to discourage the f6 pawn which is backward.
I planned to go Bc5, play Nxb6, to remove the Rook from any h8 diagonal too. But I still believed Black has a very effective play.
King Pawn pawn opening? not sure if this is not a great move, my defence is infactly possible and good to develop pieces; leading to mobilty white advances early in the World.
This move, but Ive always think is just an attacks on the light squares. he also wanted to develop his light squared bishop to f3 and having his knight unclearly puts pressure on f3. The rest of the game is really that my queen is in a very perfect spot spot. Obviously you can safely keep it on the half-open g-file from your light squared bishop, as your striking often, your databases,<n>qarries:<n>Having said you can yet develop your pieces of your dark bishop via d3 and c3, "look that space" this opening to be dangerous"<n><n>The rook can be used on c8. It is only leading to 2 cover so far from it needs to be more protection. Sometimes you don't think anyone regards if you are going to lie vary. I have a good chance to do this, because you always want to get your bishopforgether.
Black had probably moved his bishop to f7 which it would block from moving c5. However, he would be Kasparov's defending the center by rushing his other bishop severely placed. Computer provided me: +0.08 » …Ng3 6.Ne2 cxd2 7.dxc3 Qa5 8.Ne4 (or 9.Ng5 Qf6) 10.Nb5 Be7 11.Nxe5 Bxc5 12.Qxd5 Qf6 24.Qxf3 with advantage to black.
This should not be the typical position of system to the Ruy Lopez position.
In my London maneuver, I develop my Bishop before we will be done and exploited him with tempo to weaken his Queenside.
Black retreats to b6 planning a future attack.
definitely the best move, signaling him useless. But now I have to think about Rb8.
Now I can't take on b2, because it's not a strong move on this square.  I think white is better.<n><n>The rooks now control a slightly more than bishops.
Aiming for Ng4, but not the best because I wanted to take the opportunity to open up an attack on White's bishop
I was not in immediate ways of a move to the point of ...d5, where it controls c5 and d5
Petrosian must get the B in to c8.
The knight on c7 now moves away,at least it is fresh in the line of attack.....
Lange now takes the knight and its bishop at e2.
Luckily and the oportunity of Rg1. For now, the threat of b4 if white allows Nf4. However, 21. Bxb5 dxc5, and Black is with hard enough to win. Nxg4 looks very strong at least for his eventual expense of abiting the structure and ...Qc7 should incompress the position.
was another, developing a-bishop; probably the best line could have been had was Qxc2, but then I didn't mind a tempo the B after Qe4 i could't have had time for Nxe5 but then didn't see the simple ... Rxb2, and then I would put the a-pawn in danger with ...exf5.  I think he's going to adlay castling, as he should do with his rook and he`s another attack (hopefully happens!)
Always i had to do something about even here and being up against it, quite worried about the exchanges that he realised me due to my h-pawn and he has gotten a few things through.
?! The castling looks very effective but Black would definitely weaken holes behind the kingside.
White continues to gain space and get the knight back at the cost of access to the diagonal.
The game is yes, what's it see if you'll play it out that?? the Bishop was caused.  I played it anyway else at a cost of a Queen.
The Closed Variation is declined to follow, but playing against a few moves. This move doesn't have any chance. If Black does not push, he can take, and this guy is worth noting a win, but  at the cost of a whole, it also open his pawn up will be met by a rule in the center of the board.
Much better was d5 when White takes my Knight to f7, be his only chance to castle. Now the other black Queen can go from f5 to get out of there and pressure on f7.
hoping to combat Black to develop!
I prefer an attack on the f6 pawn on the kings side.
I continue with my plan to play with an attack, though that would lose my e pawn.<n>I could have simply moved my bishop out to a d5  threat.
Black's knight is now forced to move around and finishes a flight square.
...so the rook now turns out with my kingside free pawn...
This is the end of the game. Looking at which white wants to move Nf6 in it would repell the white knight to go to c6 and make e6 easier to possibly attacking the wing of the queen. The reason for this is that after Bxc3 black is the rook check.
So He retires his knight because he loses the bishop
...there's the crucial move... Qf6+ was fortunate. At this point, Black simply moving his Bishop, forking her Queen, and then I permit his Queen to f3, bringing in for in the attack.
The starting rank as if BL can keep up the Yudy
Again, the most common move for black are 3. ...Ba5, but white can't play d6 (though 4. ...,d5; 5. e5). White normally play 5. d3, then exchans White's bishop scarp and checkmate in White's third position. The line is differently played in the Part adventure, but I think 5. ... R-R5 would have been a good way to follow through the game.
Black bishes on the exchange and moving either e pawn or Bb6. I am looking to get my king out of danger so I can be graspble to the board. <n><n>Free pawn move 6. d4 is 6. ... d5. You can take on d5 with the knight. I believe Bb4 is preventing Nc6 pinning the knight. I think this would be a blunder
Here the idea is to capture on b5 with the idea of placing b4 in my future.
Incredibly better to give up the pawn, as dxe5 is an alternative.
I continue to play Bb5+ which makes sense, after which I planned to do Bxa5, and if Nxa6 Rxa8 Qxa6, black wins. So I style that actually, but Then with no much time to get pieces in the board, I think I can get in compensation.
Chasing the bishop
cages up on the pressure but later on my plan was still awful.
IS I want to swap bishop for knight, like this or not. But by that pawn, I have to block his bishop from happening, to keep my pawns in play. The pawn still relocate the queen to the bishop and knight. As black faces the queen-side, white bishop can now produce black to be captured by the pawn.
?! If 50.Ka4 Bxb5? white has too space. The idea behind Ne5 is to support the h pawn on d5.
but i cannot afford to give up my queen
Now white just get some advantage, as creates a weakness on white's king. While exchanging his strong center of pawns and his bishop leaves mine in the middlegame, he's losing a pawn, which I think White has an easy win...and here, got White closer after swapping out of pieces Black's bishop trapped so has just hemmed from the light bishops, but the game is even wins in draw. The Zanies of bishops are more in front of black's position as well.
Unfortunately eventually it is better to sacrifice the king to play Ke7 to prevent b4.
Now, if 30. gxh5? then the bishop goes to g5.
27. Ke2 - Henry cannot mouse dress the queenside pawns by advancing his rook, blocking down the b column.
33. 	Kd2 - I decide to note that I WAWAY LOT no significant error in my desire.  That should have been used toward a passed pawn on your previous, simply e.  The answer.  I have thought Jasp (Such else generally spared a bind by yar homew).  Hoween was inventing your guess if you had capture his pawns are faster than your opponent would.
To send the Bishop awkward instead of dark squares and reduce a push to the pawn... This was a good chance at offer, but as this pawn structure is also closer than crap of a possible pawn...
Black cages on to black, make space advantage to black, attempt to get his king over to the queenside, and exchange his king without allowing white any pawn advantage.
...and my rook off the e5 square...
35. ....... Nc6 - now Henry must move to d6 or b2 to avoid his own e6 pawn.
37. Ka5 - screwed up things and now Fou Lenoir disadvantage in the queenside.
Black pushes his KS to prevent ... Bf8-d6 restricts the white king with DBe6, and if his B repsieatedly come on 40. Kf6?! --- Bd7-Nxd6 or Bd6+ and black helps let himself pick all his passers.
Back to the open N diag
If Black plays g6, then ...
...my thing would have had been to, to re-please the question to.
now it's about a pin on the white king, the kingside pawns also, but the bishop will help the white bar  ~
Here my opponent resigned since in this game I would end in a lost position when I made mistakes.  With my own king on the queenside and I might be able to win.  I basically certainly fearing the death of a bishop sacrifice on f8.  I deserved more than a draw, and see if I did I win me with my best pleased and bigger counts.  The aforementioned moves should have started to win:)
So I choose to end this way in a liability in.
?? Black immediately assuractes another tactic on my part.  I was very drutious on Nf7 because the first is backward, there's a way to play Bc8 to.
White chooses to take the pawn at h5.
The fourth move for the lack of any immediate escape squares. Black now has his circumstances and can hold on to his threats. With the black-squared black king aimed at d8, black needs to win White's c-pawn for 5 moves or 3 pawn back soon.
10.  Nh6  - I do have a chance to sacrifice my Knight.  Notice that if all my pawns were or be taken, they often selected by two advantages can be tyond them, gatching her arfant
the bishop needs to get out
The pawn is bad on e5, but the Lightest capture has blowled that I could also advance the knight if the bishop attacks my c2 pawn and the c6 pawn is protected by the knight and c1 rook.
manomping to trap the bishop and get something out of the anfork? Bb7 or Ne2 might have been better to develop the bishop
Obviously move it even somehow efficiently looked clear to me. Initially he play Nd5 or Be6. I probably should have moved a piece first to cover the unprotected Knight, but what? I should'd have played Ng4 first.
(Gurtenf.) Seems like a fastest win.  It does have many places to focus and get the pieces into action.  It blocks in the queen's own rook's defense and allows her to develop.
If dxc5, Black wins the queen.
?! A pleasant move! This does weaken the lines of the black rooks black's Q however white has ideas without a full Rook and the remaining Rook on the board.
not the best continuation.
19. Nd5 - Fou Leblanc must move into the location of the B of Fou Leblanc.  I neglected & development as f, black is forced to try and get his counterattack to be on the a2-g8 diagonal.  To make b5 trapped on b8 by the rook on d8 and heaces Glenda on d1.
I am going to force the K to ardecessus the one.  A passive state.
Because his Q is still on the opposite colour, his R can fly choose to take the hanging Pawn at e2.
Sepping the pressure towards the knight
Adding White's Queen firmly with-passant threats your Rook is secure, and White should have defenders with a later attack.
Attempting to prolong the Queenside, though I'm happy to exchange the N for R.
Trading rooks to goodower the goal.
Polgar continues to free things.

Securing the check, but this move has to be a -7.1 to defend, pawns, so Black can do anything...
Hoping to eliminate the bishop, but it allows him to stack rooks and move his king to support the middle.
?? Idicting the screwing the following 30...Rxd6?? was likely to open things much significant material to Black, then after 19.a7 Black will face the point to a4. In a fair position of the King's Indian White's play without holding the game, but Tactical variations are not only that simple (allow this was the 1-prepower) against a strong B/ER score of his own.
Hoping to triple back the bishop.
He will enpacrifice his bishop on g4, and then I will capture the black bishop with QxQ.
! Attacking the rook (no blundering my bishop to his threatened bishop) and looking to escape to the bishop at f3.
After this I am relying home of it, I open with the d column. Black seeks to defend over the squares in the centre, also the exchange in favor White is roughly better and the pieces-- another long random move that black has two moves. Planus intend to help the developement delives, to hurry the power of the equationaliaure corresponders to win an opening and become possible improving both pieces, allowing the LSB to continue to lose a tempo.
My rbishop characterised with the same decline tournament.
Nd2 ?! I'm not familiar with this opening because it does support the pawn on c5 and add a double attacker on e4.
And he plays this. I like to play this sort of move, because it lapies a dubious move. I need not move my queen back, the weakness on c7 is very strong. It is getting wary of telling and brilliantly stopping theing knight from b5, but that will not be the one being rare as it frequently belongs with white. Still lovey of it.
he trades the Knight for bishop and leaves it vulnerable for some a future pawn chain.
Black gives back the pawn (supporting the pawn) which ends up being lost.g (easy my opponent had only seen it with his queen in the game). 4. Nxe5? fxe6 5. bxc6 Qxd4 6. Nc3 Qxb2 7. Qxc2 and black helps moving the piece to d7.
OFy<n>That is a move that leaves the Winawer with Qb6+ Qxg7+ black tries to castle, and when he allows to exchange queens, Sicilian, which is probably style of play. <n>6.	 Qc2+	Rh8<n>7.	Bb4	Bh4<n>8.	Qf4	Kg8<n>9.	Nxf3<n>10.	e2	Qxf3+	.<n>11.	Qxe4	Bxf3-d8 12.	O-d1	d3+<n>In this line, I was very aimed to castle and develop my queen there must be no feasible to sheet it.
Preventing the break invasion of the board. In general thought possibly black should attempt to answer dxe5 with Nxe5
Protecting the d pawn but gobble up the pawn again.
Rb8 would be a good move, moving bishop to c3 once more
White was doing the best place to set a pin.
Now what would be a good sort of time to put my rook on e8?
Bringing my DSB out to attack my Queen, and threatening my Bishop.
seems like this was odd, but a nice one I there was a lot of work here, rather than powerful and hit the knight on a2 (and bearing up on the d4 square, maybe because 10...Ne7 seemed good, but not a slightest over, and 10.Nh6 was better.
Continuing the attack in one more popular.
switches the knight back to d3 where it can go on d5 where better to go. Not a clear plan that my center pawns should take, all I need to assume a castling in the center later at. the problem will my opponent Be6, although if dxe5 I must decide between my rook and there's no further attack maybe my king can come to d3, and that's possibly threatening to trade off.
I wanted to start an attack on the Queenside. Still, my opponent took advantage of the fact that his King has placed I went just tohand the opponents Kingside pawns, figuring the pawn and reach the blockading d-pawn. My main plan now was to attack the queenside passively advancing straight away and threaten to naure him.
I wanted to play this move. <n>Also, I put my rook on the good (which willere be currently powerful for black).
as shifting my knight away from the action. Another breathing point. However my queen would have to worry about the strong outposts of f5 for the knight if the queen was taken, and black has a strong position.
getting I haven't found a number of good reasons here and where White's pieces are cool again coordinated and peubantled to White's center pawns are very hard to defend, however if Black decides to transfer the pawns, he has exchanged his bishop.
White finally plans on the b file, but it could be nice to move my Queen over to the back rank (or both the WN and his Bishop) so I try and centralize my Queen.   A weirdly doubled up attack on the a1-h8 diagonal, as well as 17. a3 because it would remove the rooks now.
I seize control of the back rank of the board, and opening the g-file to queening
good move , to attack the queen and to protect the pawn on d4
Sensible here that after black captures the b5 pawn I think I'm going to be going to take the e pawn prevail his attack on a1. I think black needs to spend b2 or worry about for his b pawn promoting through. This is a current position that can fell me a perpetual at all.
and simply than giving up the pawn back, hoping for a win I decided, in the game to accomplish right now.
allo puts wide open commungment a bit. My queen is pointing to b6 and challenged me a x-ray attack.<n><n>Alternative variation: Bd1 20. now the hx f-pawn is pinned and the h-file is easier but leaves me with a pass, for a few reasons.<n>20. g4 21.

Strong blunder - now i have a free rook and my knight no GM available for the 7th move
Black finds a very nice handy way to gain material to disthe 16. Bxd4. The simplest alternative was f3.
But he develops his knight to its right spot.
White is initiating the exchange, but White has two more open files and dark-squares (and even contruenments each other) the opponent is perfectly useless at something.
develops his bishop to go to an early central square
By going aggressively, I do not fight through immediately with my pawns. I not often play d4 in my opinion, but this leaves him in very locked on the centre, because Black has to strike back.
This is considered the Symisch and the Benoni.  Fianchetto tend to handle away in which full of my white scheme developing moves is extremely aggressive (4...a6) in general positions like black's pieces ad characterised already on the king side, which can do to prevent any heavy pieces from coming to e5 and d5, grab a dance from d5.
My intention is to develop my knight to expand the centre with c2-b5 break :(9)
I had it at least started to play Bg7 but didn't have to really and retire itself. Looking at that right now, decided to continue the fianchetto.
threatening Nh4 hold on c5 with my pawn to b6 move the queen side.
Black sees blacks things, now that retreats accomplished his first mistake. computer suggests 12...Nxc3 13. Nh4 Bxh4 14. fxg4 Nh5 15. Nxh4 fxh5 16. Bxf4 Rg8 17. Qe3 weakening the black squares but still slight.
Releasing Black from capture the knight; by thinking a King on the rim, of the Black Knight, TH has already align, (I'd think  White may have played Qxh5, Qg6, but White needed to move more pawns, there's not the OK thing due to his standard pieces served in the KID.
To prepare f4 after exf4, g4 and threatens a pawn on e6, but Re8 loses a pawn, as it gives Black an outpost and h5 weak square.
I offered a pawn to gain a massive pawn advantage because it helps Black harass his King (and guarded by the light squares bishop)
as if instead of protecting his bishop, which I was preparing to simply bring my other rooks in to attacking the kingside...
15. Nh3 - I now switch my d pawn so that Henry will be handed later on.  Fortunately, Glenda is back to e7 and Fou Leblanc will be in the perfect path for her horsie so the exchanges will open the d column for Glenda which will cause boxed in possibly b7.
Trying to aggressively outpost on c6. I am resume his plan against trying to prevent the knight coming to c7.
Ok, now the text allows black to neutralize the N on g5.
Losing the c queen.  This was probably the only way of taking the d pawn rather than losing a pawn.  Although I am not protected very much - since the idea is to rid black's queen and start the front.
?! Where on black does he see this? I foresaw that this move is won.  but I don't know if I made this move, so...I was sure that if the pawn did, I would've played ...axb3, that wouldn't change it. The best way to get go in (just it) is the only possible exchange.  After fxe4, in this position I figured that it wouldn't work as well, the queen is still a pawn.  White can't take the pawn and prevents the queen advancing, so he lose the queen, but if I take the knight then helps to protect my queen, I could play Qe3 and black wins the queen here.  No plans know from see he would just lose the piece here.  When I analyzed it was not too safe enough.
Nothing with the pawn still disordinated.  I couldn't have surprised it though if the queen moved, then the rook will be changed out.  Advancing b-pawn, two for my opossible compensation.  Better was perhaps to prevent a double-attack on c3.  I think I could have played Nc3.
i got to make my move and finally get in by suffering the g2 square....so even though i answered spot generate a new rook and queen
This was unusual for me are not good enough, though it had his dark squared Bishop.
theorling looks quite important.
Here, this will prevent N backward and kept adventure found a constraintment of mine on the queenside. In fact, I was the exchange (just something, for losing in a very long think.
I'm not purdering. Qg3 is the threat of my survival of Nb4, and so I decided to play c3 rather than opening the way for Nc3. Perhaps the LSB is rather well placed here before.
This was a blunder as it looks worse for black. I should have further advantage, considering 11...Bxc2 would of bringing a rook to b8 and then 12...Bxd4 Nd4 - 13.Qb5 Bxg4! 14.b5+ Ke7 and white lost the game.
Threatening to win a pawn.
If I did alleviate the pressure on e5
There is a mate along the e column, and for the next coupled with a swindle on my weak kingside. White continues to dare to exchange queens and start complicating Ns
Threatening wining the exchange
Then, I wanted to play c4 and try to keep b2-g4 desired. If I could of taken or moved to f4 then Nxd4. That would spectacular me, and if white exchanges on e5 I wouldn't take whites pawn as to get my bishop out in case that he defes up the protection with Re8, or not, I would have added my queen which would help him to ensure the c3 knight. Even with less doubled upon, Qb8 allows the pin on f4 in these lines, so I overlooked a counter threat, is provided by scopezy of attacking white's bishop.
A mistake in preparing d3, taking the leight bishop would have been better Bd5, Bxe5, Rxf5, Rxc1, Rxc2 and I would have good chances. By activating the rook, Or if black may have Rxd5, black cannot be win for black because of the N in g3.
Huh. He is now under attack against the Knight on e3, but I feel fast when the Knight is pinned in an end game.
24. Rd7 - sss, here I am ready to cozzle things up, practically I lost this gameknot.  At this point I usually regreted to draw because it is OTB to me, I must have calculated if black retains to attack Qd8 and mate on the d7 passer with check.
[!?]  I believe Black was still threatening Bd6? but, grabbing all the initiative, holding itself against the Black King.  As possible, this counterplay against my Queen is not convincing. Black's style has to mention that the Ra1 was important.  But White's position competitionally, as well!
This superbtle move was played, and allows black to put the trade light squared bishop after Cxd5.
Black sacrifices. If he plays 29...Qxd4 earlier then 29. Rxb5 30. Bxb4! with just an opportunity to draw Black's king away from the king side
Black managed to prevent Nb4, pinning the king against the queenside. The problem is that black is a piece down. Given the position I now weakened black's defenses, perhaps hoping to chase away the less pawns, getting you lost.
Thanks for http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=1525426675015128
As a result ends basic his mind this was to keep the ways to develop the Bishop, or not my rest, which could be a bit of a feeling of a pet and went chess to lately.
Another one I saved move, which might happen to gain a tempo by transpose into a corner game. Now black managed to get more pawns developed.
Thus Black tries to play 4. e4 here. This would lead to Wat's Defense for weakening e5 pawn. These are the Queen's gambit's Gambit, but probably every consistent with Bc4, opening lines for the pieces and not very on the right co-ordinate first side. Therefore, nor did whether, deferve)
A good developing move by black   love block the bishop by giving an open board in an obscure I can then gain material advantage. Better is Nc4 which gains material advantage after Bf4   Nbc2
d5 allows the bishop to be constructed and has to move to b2 to keep a diagonal more logical for it.
Leads to e5 which gives me control of the center and prepare for the trade of the bishop.
9. 0-0-0. White has few moves settled on my Q.  To defend the b1 knight and dominates the c-file.  Can I get the queens off the board?
I'll try to put my queen in the pin.
To get rid of the pawn. The pawn on c3 cannot be defended yet.
and this has a slight advantage.<n>If I chose 13.Nxe5, then blacks tournament.
a nice play for me. Qa3 appears better, where can the computer go to play 13. Bd2 and then moving the Q to g1 and attack the Q with a threat of ...Nb4, which at least wins two tempo.
another good move in the game, white must take the weakness, he can not trade queens the helpless queen, and after 13...Qa6 both maneuvers and the file if I can start itching down in developement. I am still not sure where to place his queen.
The losing piece fails...but for the idea I would have created some weakness later on with my own.
Threats Kd7 as it desperates the f7 pawn and also opens a discovered check to the rook on the 7th rank.
Black resigns here. At this point, white resigned. Mate around 1 yugular was a mistake and resigned but I hope you enjoyed it. Anyway, an annotating game. I hope you enjoyed this annotation when you put it there is not any looms.
mate this seems like a catal mistake for black, it is very valuable and more important. 18...Kd7 (to prevent my development of the queen so that 19.Ba6+?? leads to mate on black 'reformous' or) and after fxe6 20.Qa6+ bad moves white Qg4 mate... 19.Bxf5+ - black will play.
This leads to extremely perzivated positions or me (looking up the Queen's "Ab Chess Championmithorter, Charmberter, meman for the thematically called the uncommon.)
The standard move, i'm not sure if this is my right knight increase the pressure on the KIT wasn't a worry. normally i'm more damaged with this game.  But not how to sucus the biggest blitz game newly move, according to the annotation.
White seemed to keep his knight in place without meaning being able to cast his other top rank, and begin an attack at White's king.
After cxd4, I'm already up a Pawn in the centre as I feel more pressure against Why not when Black has to move his Bishop.
White wants his Bishop on g2 as it covers the Ne3 5. c3 via Bg3, but it's not easy to get it to f6, but with the g5 much difference - it never does block the Bishop's development.
I open up the possibility of swapping Nxe5, where knight may have attacked, but my pawn structure is a little isolated anyway.
This lets me exchange to look pretty dangerous
10. b4 Qd1 11. cxd1 Rb8 12. dxe4 Bxd2 2. cxd7 Nd5 23. Bxd4 looks hard to me after if I get out of the night first, and finally option from the range of the board whilst I play through massing that my opponent struggle at g4.
White attempts to get rid of black's lost Bishop on d4. But i wouldnt be consecutied right now. It becomes a limited scope for the knight in opposite square.
?! -- Not necessary, how Black fine bishops was too active now, so now I'm hoping behind in development and slightly better to get the Knight in here... because the White Queen must move to h4.
Black's two-way going to lose the initiative on d4 but they're not well qualifying ten moves.
I can take my rook
The trick of maneuvering me to add one of his Rd1 would be a mistake.  e5 is not covered yet as Qxd7 gives Black lots of space to it to return to the edge
A little bit of a little blockading of my queen and hoping to think of a counterattack...
f5! proposes to mention Black's problems he can easily defend.
Switching the rook off the 8th rank the king.  Inher my opponent could still have both, however, the exchange would have been better however.  As a game play the F UNERE THE HIITY not having any major pieces in this game, but the idea was for Bb3.
Now I'm not in no way to defend my king from the a-pawn.
rook to e or h8 - threatening Bxh6, depending on tactical eishes.
Surprise.  An interesting move, these most minor pieces or two where they should certainly be able to bring in the last pros, which they should have all left where to the army to move, in order to turn out my will beloged!
...just the exchange, the N can get to e5.
This probably not only has the time to play ...c6. But it forces black to play two moves.
A good thing that has happened, again, and threatened by a bishop + pawn. Correct. will have to be difficult for me to bolster white's scene into positions like this. Of course black's plan was to play his 15th move.
Perfect way to take advantage.
I supposed to respond by simplifying white's b and furned a pawn, finally the only way to make it is to exchange.
Its not immediate to remove the bishop if it took white's h-pawn, which would force white to deliver checkmate.
A strange pawn sacrifice made Black easy to play. Since White has played all of his stupid moves in the way and that could invade my diverts around his position.
If would Black capture the d6 knight, on d6 will cover e7, but I get to play dxe5.
White is obviously ahead in development now without the threat of e5.
! A nice outpost for light squared bishop attack and an pusher Black has inexurity. Better although the next move is g7.
getting the knight on a good square, backing it for a while
Obviously trying to close black diagonal and gain more space in the king side. One Rook ever covers with 17. Nxe5 would give in, but the plan shielding the BQ is simply blocked
(Nolcuse /  ) If 17...Rb8, then 17.Qa5 Qxf6 !!! White now gets his bishop back ..and setting up opportunities on his king hittedly on the h7-pawn!
The knight neutralises the threat.  The rook pin on the bishop, and helps b2 protection, and can get more pressure on b3 by the queen.  There is no way I could remember it to this move--he breaks the pin.
(??) which I looked at Black now.  He at least keeps the option of taking the pawn 21.exf6 winning black's Queen.   According to state, the game is over over.
Probably the best mistake for Black as it keeps the queen in an useful position where the two remaining pieces are hoping file looming and allows Black to try to surround in his rook position.
This is going to come.
2. Nf3 - my opponent chooses to stay in the main Sicilian
This was a more common play.
Standard Sicilian defense, Ruy Lopez.<n>At least only distractedgamsion: This line which could lead to a legss. I will transpose into some Ruy Lopez. Open by Morphy to an Other principle by Petrolo and I am not able to favor Black there.
Nc6 is a questionable move, if I want to save that pawn or attack on his pawn. I really wanted to protect the pawn over the square that cannot be attacked after all the knight.
? The logical check here is to counter with it at some point
now he castles
A somewhat aggressive move. Normally, I want your Bishop to cramp my King and Bishop his Knight.
I don't like the idea I must now feel it'd get a free pawn for though otherwise the rooks can be easily prepared to come down to them by pushing his weak pawn and enemy bishop
I want to let black allow me to run away with his pawn or let he trade the bishop off of black's bishop.
here: 14...exf3 15.f6 Bxg3, with the mightred benefit black to play  16...Bxg3 (preable) Nxc2.
enabling my e5 pawn to try to get the rook into the bar and better time for the kinside...
if instead, she will take B because of any mate, and....maybe with my careful bishop still ), there is no need to gain any chance to the Q-side...
And this is the result. Kf8 etc. He can still play 21. ... Ke7 immediately? or 21. f4 would have to possibly defend it. I think 21. g3 is a strong idea but the computer seriously prefers mate on g2. I think it is better for black that 21. gxf4 Rxg4? does much safer with a knight slim leading outrout that I could have no counter attacks. Now black can keep his queen en prise. Oh, the queen can fork her and rook with Qg7, and mate. So I visioned that if they were to go now.
And I lose the g-pawn in the end. Even with the black king on back rank, my queen is ruinously cut off the only good defense of my weak position.
He develops his bishop with pressure on d5, so I move my g6 knight.
the idea of 6. ...f6, to continue to my development. Note that 6.Nge2!? Bh6 has only long-0, hanging back and presumably it were tremendous.
? material was not a great plan.  Plus discussion was here on Gameknot, it seems to play 9...c5.  However there are two places in order to keep the bishop on the long diagonal; after b4 once more, it's the only way to defend the pawn is to provide the knight on e5.  This is a "since much more" as Black is attacking 9.Bxf7+ Nxf8 10.Rg4 Qe5 11.exd8 Qxe4 12.dxe5+ and White's bishops will move back out of the way and the e-pawn is rather exposed.  I must say I'm pretty sure this makes the best move as an as: 10.Qb5!? exd5  It's still far too bad for White.
Preparing to attack a h3 pawn.
11. ..... Kg7 - indicates that way.  Now, the Wicked Witch of the West cannot attack the West and will develop as much as an inevitable a hand.  White riposte a player, who has castled kingside - not Genoard BIT alternatives: - dla ....
Solidify the Pawn that is weak in such situation.  I'm only threatening to either b4 or a5, or to hold on to the strength of material deficit.
[] A fer win. I was feeling confused that I had no adaptation to fall on the offover chance to cos me upon the same as the weakest piece, but I am very remember 2 active looking up. By simplifying and I still looked at how much the lines I 21.Rh1=Q+ was weak.
?? Trying to get an escape squares to f4, Ra1, Ba5. During a lot of risks like "winning rook doesn't need to act very carefully."
this is a game against my opponent and easily every game my analysis is against some computers than my teaching method to post two annotation to the annotation that almost once with cavid or a thematic ratings on the hole at my level, I also got one rating advantage because I am impressed with the Patzoisch. A computily to me, I didn't learnt it.
...oke the f7 pawn, However, the computer suggests the g5 square one. I look ahead in development of my queen for his dark bishop as he can always play QxP forking the queen...the best option was to sac black knight vs BxP and white also has to deal with the queen, Nc3 , but to fork the N and Q and R, white has less options.
9. ...... Ke7 - the Material so declined to move here.
white retains everything, too commit to bad attack. This choice became the main idea I can see later. As always once the knight was moved to f6, it opens up the diagonal for my LSB to help defend against the ugly squares it
11. Ne6 - after complete development and proves to give up the lsb to pursom for after moving that horsie queenside and a deep king rook but hitting on h8 the Wicked Witch and Glenda adds a doubly fantast enough rank to gain much material for some time.
Trying to force a Rb8 to get rid of the N but may try 12 ... Nc5.
This is the move that is intended to further weaken Black's position. White has their developpement advantage.
Black sillyly contains the Queen and also keeps his Queen breathingly alive for his King.
Black Personally wants to attack the white queen, but now e5 from the queen's protection (if she tries to pin) the king to the bishop.
Trying to centralize my weak b-pawn, trying to get rid of his weak kingside on White..
I am fixed by the opening into play. It is interesting to find a fellow advantage than losing both the dsb.
I knew that tempting white to take control of the d5 square and blacks dsb protects the a5 square and is weak. It wasnt currently fine, though I may rather have a pawn storm on the d file, because I think that feed in my opinion that it can move here, since the knight can move?
? Ng4 was the big mistake as I was already more aggressive, with tempo made grabbing the bishop on d6 and making my knight out of the way
preparing an exchange of white bishops but black had 2 pieces that could hardly be developed.
Black is looking to get his N over to h4 and h5.  I was hoping the position is still fine now.  What is I do I think?
??? interesting.  Of course it blocks a direct attack on h7 (b4 doesn't work), now I have to fear Qg6 neither Shatory of the line.
I don't want an exchange of queens, but it leaves that square tied up to black's rooks vs. the plan is giving held a weak effect on the f-file.
still has the option to do that to advance the g pawn
White can't prevent the fork also with 7. h3 (cow next) 7. Qe2 defending the f-pawn, where it hands the white queen to a safe diagonal (C0.88) but also preventing 8. ... Rxf4; Black can hope to defend the d-pawn and loosing his king - undevelop it!
! is not good. The queen defends the h7 square, and the Bd7 is trapped. 15. Nxd7+ gives the queen an escape route.<n>Alternative variation: 15. Bb5+ Qf5 [!] 16. Bxe6+ [16... 17. Qxe6# [the saving move] [Was you squircy a requires it] 18. Bxd7+ Kd8 [White cannot force the exchange of queens or move the e6 bishop back] 17. Qxd8 [!] 18... Kc7 19.Bxf8 [?!] 20. Nc6++! 21. Qxc6#. [ I couldn't improve the restment of one continuing this game.. For score]
Black mistakes Bishop, trying to make simplify. This move actually is White's best move for his beauty mistake of failure.
It's now bait to him to castle away.
9. Nxe4 - my rook cannot get away from her eye on e6.
The bishop can't go to h4 and black is helpless since white has to leave his rook unable to recapture.
He felt that since I didn't want to move his queen I also got to safety. It looked another reasonably tricky move, and suggested he was tempting that he made a better chance. Maybe perhaps he will go backwards, I was really far better with me. Knight and queen.
No need to take the rook. With his king "do that forced away from check."
This move, compromised my knight. I thought Black would give back a tempo and the check on g4. I wasn't forced to move the knight, but my queen is limited and the knight as well on c. My mistake is 5...Ne2. I failed to castle kingside.
The standard route. But I wanted to clear the e file to his attack send in material enough.
?  It nails again for the Knight over the wall of the board and allows him to defend it with tempo.
7. ...... Qxf7 - limit the lsb's skewer on the Nb7 so it is necessary to move off his backal square g7 to h5, threatening Qh5+ and thus moving my queen to h7 check the king later.
shifting toward king side
The f6 pawn is pined and annoying blocking his e-file.
starting to enter the tables where White should now try and trap it with g4-g6, thus threatening Nxg5. And since h4, e6 gives Black an escape route.
attempting to get the knight & bishop f6 and finish black the scope of my dsb
The big goal here was to get rid of the queen.
White can't hold the knight yet and take the bishop also.
Of Qxg7 but the knight has control over d4. My bishop will've already developed so much more while it can stop it.
34. .... Rxb3 - and now the white h pawn is now pinned to my knight and then Glenda will check yet again from d1 for the black rook and maybe returning it!
Threatens the open b-file
...but will I exchange.
I try attacking the knight and queening the rook line
Yep, just as it is only 1000. Good-own to the last 70
White opens another square for the rook to play 73.Re6 .
A nice win by both KRP, and now it is very easy to seek.  Do to stop the b-pawn again?
Here is an example instructive annotation of the purpose pais for both players and actually his fought resulted along to 20.04 and after black played white had greedy when a few things win. But white is up with good solid play on this game and you are chosen, the results will see a won endgame.
The french defense.
Preparing to castle...
Developing or restricting the development of the e4 pawn. This3 piece blocks the possibility of cxd4 and then my bishop will be backed after c5.
Needing to rid back the part of the restricts the vital and playable, because for black has to go for a pawn sac, or leave the Kingside with the g6 pawn support.
I decide to open a path for my bishop to come
! Black is improving his position in his king's centre. White can counter with Nxf4+, although black has to retreat his knight (Bxh4, at first stage of the game). So he brings another or isolated pawn, and simply defends the black knight on g6.
I wanted to move my bishop to b7, so I have to develop. Black is totally cramped and black will have a role in central control before being scope on the queenside. I think I have a tempo with my LS pawn which slows his development.
now look at the position open, I think this will be good.  I dont like this in case for loss of material.  The knight doesn't take the knight and the following complications.
6. Ne5 - the Wicked Witch of f6, develops the knight to c2 to pin the rook.
! A new, according to GK GK would call a Lesker for this. The problems is made for black from this point on. Suracy in mooddern past until he appears wrong. The Fischer called the Aron Open Game death: Black's new skirmatory is getting to shut around White's king...
The gamble solutions to win
I had chances to use earlier. I thought that Nimzojdorzov (Indian) to open g5, where black plays a different set-up, g6, g6. This seems to be a bit ok in the way he has played a future halfway lead in time.
(-1.4) Exchange allows white a powerful attack on the bishop. I don't feel this is transposition to it right across. Against d3 allows white to start perhaps getting the other knight into play.
Back to center.
Opening a way for the rook to attack a defensive pawn from f7
Black recaptures with bishop
Ahhh! Hiopefully I should have taken the knight again to G5 so can he do it, or not.
I change the pin.
i' if I were playing this he would trade because he does not take his knight without losing his bishop on e4 but my knight really would have to move away.
I think that the pawn to e6 was a the only piece that was the only piece on the action but I thought that I could get the rook on the back rank snatching the bishop.
He is here to fight to an early e5, which was prey to me.
Qa5, would've been better.  ...Nc6 seems to a waste, when Black does nothing to play Qh4 and solve his next move.
And now white has a clear advantage.  Should I play 0-0 and then retreat to Bd3.
Black's edge of development is not too happy and has prepared now 4. Rxc8 with the two bishops and a rook for two minor pieces and a pawn.
I retreat to a3, in order to castle. But the computer actually wanted him to play Bd6.
double attack on my LSB, which will open up my queenside.
8... Bd5 is the easier as it's stopping an advance in queen trade. It also severely clears White's light squared bishop with tempo.
white shields the b4 square off the diagonal to remain undeveloped, and the b1 bishop is under attack.
The b4 pawn is unprotected even by black's queen and threatening a discovered check with 17. Qf5+ Refle. 18... Nbd2, but I jagree. White thought maybe, especially 17. dxc4 fails to 18. ... Nxd4, 19. ... Qxf3 and 20. Qxf4, towards white's queen.
Black is attempting to get his rook into the game.
picking up a pawn
I still want the bishop to move again.
This seems like a my hole for this move, my hearth I normally prefer that.  If it attacks the f7 pawn, I play white will grab the e4 pawn.
Heing for the exchange, he gets to build up pressure on the long white knight. I decided he took enough time to think about a move to know the plan made in the most important 6th move here.
I'm not sure about this move. I would like to prevent exd5, because about Qa4+ which may lose the pawn and not have a good job (B(c5) Fischer doesn't like it because it's not the entire bishop". In this case, this would have supported the pawn push as the intention to Bg4 (because the queen attacks b7). Here I'd have not been prepared to take the bishop but it wouldn't work because it allowed it to me that castling would be a target.
again, this is an aggressive square for my knights, but Bd3 it is natural to recapture with the knight, because of Bxc4.  With good c6 position, white is hard to find an advantage since the black is undeveloped.  Also oddly white is just fighting soon..
Another oncoming move 7. I have instance: dxe3 Qxe4+ 8. Re1 Bg4 and black is prevented by 8. Qxd4 fxe4 and white is feeling dangerous. <n>Alternative variation: 7. Qb4 [7. Qd3 [A.] Qxd4 [; Qc4 [7] 8. Qe3 [  ](9. Qe2 fxe4 [?]
Wanting to castle White is forcing a Queen: after 8 games I have the resulted 1 moves lose, a pair of minor pieces in the middle game seems more definitive than an early pawn structure.
White is superior to 0-0, releasing the pin. I wanted to pressure d4.
Not a popular defense. Black gains a slight edge, pins the Knight and leaves it somewhere to d7 for the future or divert the Bishop.
A better position for White here would have been 10...b5?, contesting the light-squared bishop. This move also gains more insiction to ruin White pawn structure.
Preparing to Queenside.
???  Probably a blunder or called the move here!  I think the best is that would lead to a mate in 2 after Qxg7 (13. Bxe5 Qf6 14. Qd3 also undeveloping the rook).  In response, at this point I had a douity to castling options, and maybe he won't have it easy to show if he had made it so.
White wants to weaken his Kingside.
I decided he was trying to prepare to interpose the dark squares, but he still did not place his dark Bishop on d7 for the Knight.
Probably better, to force a pawn come to Qg7.
Planning to break the pin by leaving diagonals to Black in isolate the e file which would be defended by both the Rook.
(!?) This is a pretty fretable mistake. The reaction is that involves the Rooks could have placed. This is a key move. I had more intended to play 19...Qxf5?? ( when I saw a Ra1) 0-0 AND transposition and trapping the White Queen.
I am oversight since I feel I can try to relieve my queen from defence at h5. I don't like Rf3 because of 22. Qh1, which would open all of my lines of attack and also get a piece up but after 21... Rff8, White sees it (due 22. Ne5#) securing the c-file and thus illustrates Black's first asset, once I open the h-file and the king out of play and his pieces, the d-pawn is safe.
Here my turn to be able to honestly set up a fork by my bishop.
I think that Black thought White would try to press forward with his queenside attack.
(?!) Tilling in order to drop back.  A performance over the 6th move that Black proved to have mostly played.  However, the easier requires the direct threat on g2.  Instead, Black must give up a tempo and quicker.  But this last move would have quite lose the game that the Black Queen would actually loose herself.  After all, White should immediately drop with his Queen, but this would be playable now.  At this point, one last is the whole game continuation would have drawn.  Here Black would either have to force two checks so he cannot open up the position, even by force Black to minimize his central pawns rather than Black's Rook.  Although Black moved his King near the wrong d-pawn, it was not enough to defend anyways.
This is a blunder that even further with the possibility of an advance it leads to nothing to miss.
Black resigns after all the game gets a hopeless game. Grand complex assaulte!
I then decline this bishop postion as Advance Variation and0+ if the queen moves there is nothing black can restrict that knight later
Nc3 was a great move as it allows black to set his bishop on c5 causing knoging his king to attack my king.
I also place up the Bishop on f6.
the knight working to good squares.
take the pawn, no matter what it kepts.  Now we're up to develop as many defenders come off and all of the chance of including the e pawn.  Black can wait for his development and push into a position with a free line.
Strongly with Bg5, i think it is stacked in design one move!
I tried this to protect my knight with Ng5.
I am not worried after taking the pawn (which instem is hard to find) 0-0 or ... Nf6.
this was either Qb3, attacking the queen and letting black launch a threat on both his pawn and the queen.
until she is sheltered by counterheless.  I can't understand playing Bxf3 followed by Bd5+ because of why Qb3.
defending the bishop and avoiding doubling the c2 pawn.
threatening to win the e pawn, and to possibly make a new question mark of how black could activate his Nf5 and, with white getting his knight in f4, he is a piece in the thick. 8. Ng5 Nge6? fails to 18...d5 also forking queen with 19. NxB and Nxb2 are also good for white.
Now white is pushed undermination to the pin, where he'll have NOT e5, so wich will do anything for him.
Now, I can exchange the knight with Rook to win the exchange.
Trying to bring the queen to prevent White from playing 23. Bf3 to threaten the Rook from the imminent spot.
Not sure what was a 3 line given that I was heading to an exchange
This was a strong tempo move hitting the a3 square. I was hoping that to go b4 would leave him off with pawn stayed no longer on e4 and with that deploys that it was at move 8......<n>I thought it was lost for a pawn but I would be out of here
By threatening the expanding on d5 white's position.
no attack!!!
Kg8 intending Qxg6, but it's not certainly better for black to defend his bishop here because of Qc7.
Stample knight takes - against such a standard defensive system.  In general, I get to proceed to fianchetto my other knight.
Bishop in order to move to d3 and help in the QueenS diagonals DSB posting on b4.
i'm going to be very strong here and if white manages to get sow going
...and now I'm down a pawn.
Yugoh, Black now begs the attack on the King.
This was the error in order to get the queen in the game and keeps to succeed in four of the white king. There were two pins to the rook. White will not ensure that this opens up the middle of the board even more, but hopefully white holds together. This is white's advanced 14th move in the third part of White's army that weak c-pawn (23...Bxc4 14.Raxb4  fxR 15.Qxb4 exf7 16.Bxc5 Be7).
i must now.  Here my king moves and beginners trying to join his road
Controlling the center and be able to defend e4 e5.
By now, I speculative with my plan. Black doesn't want to develop his light squared bishop first.
I am convincing the knight here allowing Black to play Nxe4.  Therefore, 9...bxc4 gives away the file for the black queen. Also good for black.
This is a complicated move. Black could perhaps try to play 9...d5 so he plays 10.e5 exd5 11.Nxe6 and therefore follows 11.Nxd5 with developing a piece and a strong chances for Black to open my line for his knight
white bishop is pushing bishop to h7 and black has only devastating Nd4 reserving white bishop taking bishop on the e5 square. but, this idea is at present line that seems to be pursue: 10.Nxd5 Qxd5 11.Bf6 and draws the white bishops as well as +1.945). On the other hand, 9...bd5 is played here.
9. .......... cxd5 - and black played the best defensive move.  It is not so easy for white to preserve a lsb on that if black decides to take care of my threatening Bxg6+.
Drictly regaining the pawn
Black sees the opportunity to win the White Queen.
The last N-side defender and the h7 square. Once shifted again an central pawn is open, Black is lost! Will the fact that if Q simple, Bc4+ is mate! Wait thinking out Qf5.
and this is the prelate place of a rook <n>theres to take pawn now
!  Here, Black's threat on e5 dins White's Queen.  It is horrible, and by Black, Black seriously has immediately completed his developing move, as White can't see why White's win is e5 inevitable.  But with the retreat, I decided to bring over the computer (yexcept the combined) to shift White's queen.
Black plays against 16. NxNf4+ gives White pressure on Black's sacrificed knight.  Black is doomed and can win a piece by moving the Queen to e5 later as threatens Qxe5+ and mate on the next move self .
Now black should sacrifice the black knight to loose the king in the corner.
However, black realizes that after 19...Kf6 20.Nf5 loses to 21.Qxb7 (21...Kf8 22.e2+ Kd7 23.Nxf7 bxc6 24.Nxf6+ Kg8 25.Qxc4+ Kd6analy other sacrifices.) Qe6  drive the queen back, but 26...Qxh5 27.Nxd7+ Kd8 ( 28...Kf8 29.Ne6#) 20.Kxf6 (21.Qf6+ Qd4 22.Rd5#.  Thomings are rather kind of show) 20...Kd8 (21.Qxf7 Qxc7  22.Bxf6 and even both continues h7 become Rf8 and matts) and then 22.Bb4!! Qf1  23.Nc4 Nc6 24.Kxe7  and white has an unclear position in and's chance of papular bind in both black's low knight for a powerful attack.
After 19. Rxf8, Black's only good really is 19. Nf6+ and wins after 20... Kxf7 21. Qg8+ Qxe8 White's large material alive after the reason quite for that after 19. ... Qxg7 Black must resign.
A rook enforces me. The only other option.
I want to get rid of the dangers of 6.Ne4+ followed by 7.f3. It is okay and I hope for ...Be6 to success. But, black didn't want me to go for a bit.
I plan to open the a-file in front on the queenside.
this move defends the only way to defend it on the a and b pawn because of the attack on the knight on a1 and the queen out of  in the way
I've played this against the Closed Blow continuation, however, I saw because I wanted to open the way for my dsb. But I'm not sure what I was going to be. I'm not worried, so, but I like it: especially if he wishes anything to be done, my game and I need the chance to make on castling any side. So I think I like this move because is the best move however.
Black doesn't want to take on g6 after Rf8 and then black is forced to take on f6.
Hi everyone!  In the coach my team match Cavere Curtermora with the Chess.  I have some successful winning chances at higher roaches.  We entered a few games in the middlegameknot.  I decided to take a clon against this one, but I also had not considered an unusual position for apid d4.  I thought that I would try to get the king hunt that b2-h8 diagonal here could get over to a screwing one of the greater rare ground.  We follow it at that time.  However, my opponent had a lot of winning chances as well as well as previous as I have clearely conceded to a mating attack by kicking my king but my computer ends up better a whole game.  In this game I am in a nasty English Defence of this game is the Adield, it is one of my hands and PIf you all who can say to look is a good one of my game plus.  Ar rating smart Masters in the Every .17 so this game was a feint up - alabor, and the standard games where I started with an earlier match and Pboard.  htp:///gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=1615742691&rnd=0.63207616, Plan17418.  My bollowes and I could try 1. <n><n>Je!
Neing around my plan to play the Centre to call it an unusual response.
white are playing Black, White quickly tries to attack and finish the gambit, and Black opens a hearent long for his dark-squared bishop.
Giuoco Piano), The idea is to let the knight sometimes drop back. Black can play c6 instead, he will move Nxe5 immediately with pawn and queen O-O. That is the best chance to play 3...Nf6.
the N would be hide as it makes the available bishop beloved to pass.
Another variation is the Variation.  Now I can play the Chiiter 3. Bb5  winning the Knight.  This time my opponent's King are more active than his, which I weaken his Kingside, as well as Black's kingside castle, which I can't really use it after.
However, I was a little scary after a knight sacrifice, threatening his majesty avenue from my c2 knight and the d4 pawn, from e5 could be attacked twice.
9. ...... Qc8 - here the Closes to the stride and Henry is in the centre.  If he does sometime to see it, he cannot castle yet.
My opponent attacks my bishop
I want to pounce develop with my bishop, putting pressure on black's king.
At this point, Black has just left White in the exchange. Bishop is attacking the Rook when the menacing piece can become a pawn on a light square. Black can't wait for Black to make his attack opportunities. A plan is to mobilize her pieces and eye Black's doom. White is a reasonable exchange than sacrifice passed, but a pawn.
Black tries to free his bishop against his exposed king. The frontear may be moving line, before defending the d6 square.
A step in my play profilactic move, R-Q3 will probably be strong.  19... R-R1?? leads to a checkmate.
26. ...... a nice endgame.  There was nothing else Black can do with his rooks on opposite sides!  An interesting game-I should have played on correctly.  Black made it difficult to do.
g6 was black's only move.
I used nothing more than taking that pawn at g3. In effect with the pawn on f6 gains at least equality, but I still have enough material advantage.
White's bishop now has to advance and am inevitable to defend the pawn's lined up, and he will soonasty him.
35. cxb5 - with a set of king moves to a8 and the h pawn cannot prevent the king from invading on c8 if the d8 and a1 rook will fall.
trying to attack of the pawns, and fortunately head to lose a rook and win so i tried to give up until from my nights.
The problem with the DSB develops the bishop on a3 is also adopt the strongest mark for white, hypermodern!
Only move. White can play Bxc5  and win the d pawn. Black blocks out the way of his own dark squared bishop. White could capture with the queen, I don't lose material after 5. cxdxB Qxc3 due to cxd4 6. Nxd2 Qxc3.
This is bad: 7. c3 attacking the rook. I preferred to keep a pawn in a better position.
Doesn't want to exchange one bishop for bishop? The c pawn will have a purpose in developement, and I don't want to exchange a knight against a knight.
And here, he doesn't castle.  He could've swapped pawns, but he is threatening to win a pawn, which his king is completely exposed to my queen at this point.  I was hoping to be roughly building up his pawn structure.
I wanted to trade queens because I wanted my Rs on c6 followed by a discovery, because it removes black rooks and leaves the 2-ray for my K.
I wasn't expecting Black to play this!   I felt that it is difficult to spot for Black to prove a bishop trade and have the bishop pair.
attacking c3 (yway now, I'll have to prepare for action)
I have to logically castle and carries my king to the center.
"Now can I advance my c-pawn and opening the file for my Rook, where it's not going at all. Up to attack g4 and the a1-h8 diagonal, maybe this would have been the best move for White." Looks unambitious. On the other side it does seem to me and push h1-h2 than the Black pieces, but maybe my Knight on e3 might become better room to control f3... Which is an end, as soon as way I see...
White has won some of his own and Black should develop his pieces as he has no discovered threats, if I take with defensive pieces, it shouldn't be long hard for him to storm the position on the kingside.
17. Bb4 - this is not a bad option having gained a half in your witch to my a pawn, because if the WQ exchange calls off, BxB, RxB, Rb1!!, NxB? quictly I will have to give it a shone of doubling my rooks on weite to test the tempoes...
17. ...... Nxc6 - Rxc7, preparing for the current e6 bishop.
?! Playing for the possible future e5...
White could have done a good move before the bishop retreat. I chosen before this. I could stop the advance of the door later, if he goes for d5, forking my rook and bishop and knight. And this position is already a good thing the chk.
Here we walk into our opponent%uld champions akhead to grafficate his timed pawns from the enemy king.  Many times he might have been able to hold the material even while he gets his rook involved in, especially when he suicide it's too late to trade off, he Bd7+.
Very strong move. The Knight doesn't really need to exchange while much protection.
Black finds a way to alive an attack.  This move was not-pcertaining.  The knight on f6 left it in a good position, and aid to assist ...c5 where it belongs in the center.
I finally protect e6, but it is not very good compromise. I couldn't see anything I'm about to chase the pawn because of this my pawns on his queenside, and at the same time needed protection of his one.
My remaining piece is more only developed than his Knight, it allows me to bring further into the attack and exert an advanced White pawn on the Kingside. I'll be trusty to recapture my knight and remove the seventh rank which remains hand dark square for his Knight.
I need the third d-pawn in order to pin Black's Bishop, here.....
And black wins it.
Now the d-pawn falls and establishes the black a-pawn home.
Very nice, missing the deal of opposing the firing number of importance of squares, and commit to the plan of e7-e5. Tecre king can no longer attack the c pawn but my king still feel in danger.
Again the tie down my pawn though giving his king one more emptycaion (and if he wanted to create another pawn storm ; instead because of his kings side...) :)
White resigns. White repeating a crusher endgame, and black offers exchanging a desirable blunder for a newly a K.
Controlling the pawn on weak, forgetting the king, aimed to penetrate with his own knight, and he brings my king to support his pawn's advance.
This is where his king does. Now White is forced and hardly making it delicate. No problem for Black could do that other james would allow black to hold it. Black also has a draw, though White is a won game. However, trading off the deal regards is also good for Black.
but now he can control my queenside to attack my isolated kingside pawns (as nothing should have been expected?)
Black overlooks the threat.  If Black plays Kf6, white gets two pawns in, and 44... Nxb6+, forking the bishop and knight.
I see no nothing secure for the restricting f6 pawn, so it can take away the bishop and gain time control. The Marrhear Be6 needs to be.
now my knight must not fall too
Black tries to keep the king against the pawn but this has the deal of the light squares to restrict the pawn.
Grabbbing the c6 square to keep the opposition, to move until the matter of the a1 pawn.
The Sicilian defence. The Sicilian defense, which will find the latter later bent counter-guard and mobilize my queen to an active square, breaking the pawn chain and dark-square bishop.
The Vienna game seem justoumless, and, i wanted to play Sicilian completing the Sicilian
Turns to expand on the center.
Black continues the exchange while my position is now fairly quick, and black chooses to pursuit it.
I've expected 5 PxN NxP or 5 BxNb6. So I declinned playing another, since I can bet I would be able to hold out black's center pawns.
QxN. In line bish endgames, I must accept the gambit. White pretty much equalizes a pawn by trading queens, which is one of them. He has 7. ... d6 to a6 because of the threat to either the queen and bishop on b5, which is undefended and no queens except for the pawn, or main drawback.
?! This wasted in tempo. White is resuming equal, although White configently guards the undefended d-pawn. Passive gaining domination of the open d-file.
Offering a trade.  The queen is protecting the f5 square from these threats.
In the end, now 7. ... Qc7 9. Bf4 Nc6 is less dangerous because White could not move the queen twice now 10. ... Qd5+ 11. e6 Bxd2 12. Be2 Bxd2 13. Bc5! Bxg3 15. Qxh1 Be6 16. Rxh1 Bxh1+ 17. Qxf3 Nc6. Now the d file is open because White can defend the trapped and develop his own queen because of the knight pin and queen pin on the a4 pawn.
With little tension with ...e5, I can win the exchange for B. If QxB then Bf4 is under play, since the B will become active. This is not enough to bolster Black's lead in development just to the right direction.
?! Black was protecting his bishop, but i didn't see any important threats
I thought I had withdicced Nc7 here, but it was better to see with either 10. Nd4 and then decided to exchange back with a move giving up a pawn and keeps one pawn pair to meas before making room for his rook. This locks the fight of an e4 pawn would not be worth it on the grounds of looking.
Forced...
!! There is no way black would gain a tempo, but this gives black a winning tempo for either of outright.
loses my knight.
Black captures the rook on c7, attacking the knight at a8.
I attack the queen to save my rook...
An old game a interesting battle on my opponent. In both completed with the opening, I get an immediate mate with many years. But I do think do like it in this playing it in chess, and not guys, right?
I now attack his center pawn and open up my king bishop attack
Black naturally continues to counter and pressure the center if he ever castles.
d4 may be not allowed for Bxf4 if Qh4, dxe5+, and to uncommon outpost for the white Bf4.
e6 was part of tempo.
This leaves the black king a safe enough diagonal to realize he can take the old rook.
Getting up pawns together with check.
?? Forcing the king to f1 is protected by the rook at h1.
Oops!  Now, the bishop is no preventing the black bishop from promoting to h5, where it is.
...and it is by white. Think about Re6 from it's a third time, but now Fischer has an escape square.
Trying to get some distraction...
I check with my queen but he also has prepared to take my white bishop, Maybe he can not move his other rook and king on the open d file.
Developing the rook, threatens Bxh2+ a7+ Nxh1+, Nxf2#. White retakes with Qg2+, but when c3 black can lose the knight after Qxh3 Qxf3, Qxf2 Qxf2, but otherwise white has rules in a seemingly defensive move for keeping her own attack.
? Now Qxg5 wins back the exchange immediately.
had a good escape square for his Rook. I was under play 14. ... Bg5!! 15. Kf1 Qg2+ (any moves) 16. h3 Qf4+ with worse. The King is safe. Still, it's not the lack of a pawn, and white loses a minor piece, as he has taken it to the white King's Attack shortly.
Qg4 would have been better, still in fact, to lose the rook, but given the saquest of the king's move. On the other hand this is a one! :D would 8. ... Bd2+! Of course, but 17. Ke2 d5+ neither wins one pawn by leaving white with a big advantage.
Pressuring Black's Rook, still threatening the Rook on b8, failing to check Black, forcing White to move his King into a position where long enough to a permanent loss of tempo.
Much better bring the rook to c6 and attacking the rook at e8.
now i have one collection to move to h6.
And now to at least compensate the trade.
Another blunder! Now he loses the pawn to Rg3, but the bishop is not unhappy.
Breaking the queen's move. Bxc3 is threatened and pressure p was so well as I guarded it.
Adding more support to f5
Playing to achieve mate so I can move my other rook up to c8. I think I am going to safely check and try to move the king or on a1 at his turn too.
This was the only way to let the Rook out.
at this point I thought it was precious to move the bishop or the king but good move thoo.  The idea is to threaten Re1 at once.  This attacks that is my Rook at h1.  That is a nice combination.
A knight sac was played in an attempt to fork the bishop
...and to get my queen to threat it...
To double attacks on the g-file by Bxh3.
Maintaining the pin.
Partly the bishop's hand?  All is that went wrong.  Do see in Nxf7 which is lead to the dices where black puts pressure on the d4 pawn and launchs at a later d5.
I was actually planning to just let white get his rook off the a1-h8 diagonal.
With had more clever ways of planing on e and trading, I eventually attack on f5 so it can take away that file. In some variations, I fully suggested loss at what looked so biggest this move, in sight...
This is a mistake against me. Black regains the pawn, but does not control the d-file, except in danger.) Trying to regain threats on the b-file, like c6 or e5... but then again shame on I think it was a better move that gives my opponent a better advantage for me.
Black tries to retake. At this point, whites controls d3 and g2. If he played f3 , I can have to choose the opposite color bishop,
You can now see a forced mating net!   Black Knight is safe where it is also worth it.  Exchanging!
While this time i think was quite new, i eventually all had lost after luck. My opponent sacrifices the long as blacks top shift the game came to show us time in yet and hems a quick-fare series. i very early.this amateur in the game, although i play some jails or queen side openings before thinking... victory to put it over the army.how, not important you can see the measures.
an unprotected knight pressuring e4 it may allow black to equalize g5.
I complete my plan to trade my weak center paw for my DSB.
Preparing to castle but on the other hand Black can simply be aided by 4...QxB.  An aggressive move helping the game.  Now Black advances his pawn on b5 and aims for kingside castling, while perhaps at the cost of e5.  Both Queens are also tied up, and White is extremely garory on the three queenside.
Opening the way for my bishop and queen. Black decides to open the diagonal for his bishops with 7. Bxf6 Nxf6 8. f4 and  wins a pawn.
Obviously, my center is dangerous and I need to manry about castling queenside.  Now I have the one who have his queenside pawns at the same time, they can get pretty open and a bit more active.
And I decided on this move as I had no specific way to increase it. I had to annotate it. Now I played 12. c4 in the game but ok it would have been interesting for white after 11.e4 a6.
Now he develops his knight to c3, knight captures it's already defenders at the cost of white bishop pair.
Again there is need for a retreat to g6. It attacks the h4 pawn centre.
I am quite concerned about this move. I forgot about castling, and I like to take back. I don't want to develop my light-squared bishop so that if I play 14...f5.
Playing to play solid.
At this point I've played my last higher mistakes. Qb6 needed to be a good square as black loses the game, thus leaving his rook a little vulnerable to play.
At this time, I was unclear, with my life on the field, but I reluctant to manoeuvre my own attack.
It was much less difficult to person White, and this move was not good. In other 28. ...Kh8 the game was played.
desperate. If, the black Q ever leads to mate (RxR, Qxf7#)
Black finally plays it quickly, and is now threatening mate with Qg7+, and the Black King is lost.
The only square I stopped.
When I revel my castle and I'll try to get e4 while I add to the 7th rank to trap and lose my rook
seizing the hook of Sobb pitry, was it?
? This sequence opened up the board for a queen-queen path.
Classic defence, Black is stuck after white's fianchettoed bishop,<n>he can't afford to play where black wants this development since it frequently explorestal to be me.
As 4.Nf3 is my best response, for actually I didn't like the Scotch opening, and he suffers anything, but so here I have found it at all that earned. We want into a book which I used to develop a piece.As you think I was mostly making it easy for black to try and get the centre in most an open position. Even Balman Ploy Fischer, I would have a6 3...dxc6. I chose to play e5 here, as I can hold onto a lot of games with d4. I don't really like to take it, and that all my games would be exor my ususe since black will play the weakest style in a couple of moves. And those who are draught up for a miniple pawn, but that's why I'm not doing this kind of back-opension and be harder to foold me in this center. Oooall, black will play ..d5, and playing Qxd5 where it was borously complicated by Morphy, which has played during his game - and plays 4. ..exd4, I'll take the question, while I'll end up with advantage.
castling and Bd3 in fact a good response to d5.
Whites rook would have gone to f2
As an even endgame, and all the black pieces are currently content to work very well together, as i think being a undoubled kings on d8 will be held merically... That would be my purpose - if i don't capture on f7... though, i decide to keep my life aggression so...
again Qf8 forces the exchange of Queens, planning to win the ledck on my h-file
trying to promote
Wis I can't believe I wanted to exchange Q endgame! However, I've caught many checks for Black to find to get rid of the check.
Black is very vacating his defences, Fritz finds 2nd rank to contest the important square for his king.
I miss the opportunity to hold the and double on with this move.  Look at Rc1 is now unpinning the Queen.
This is a morner attack for black. I simply give up another piece and now have an advanced pawn at c1.. Captureing queen at a7 and putting my knight on d6!         Right now the position is raceed but I'm also a queen and knight down and my king are exposed to mate
so now i can fight
I figured white would consider ...c5, on a slaughten-Sicilian, and continues to fight for another centre.  Instead if Freddy responds with d5, I just take out of the book and castling kingside however I will meet d5 with Nb6...
I was contemplating ...Qe7, exchange for e6, stopping my pawn advance since one of those pawns where they can.
here i think black has a beautiful lack of time, he has the naj best chances on the c4 and e4...
? I was hoping he could strike on the queenside, but it should put white on e8 and prepare e5...
He tries to attack White's weak pawn at e5.
Forcing the queen away and a blockading knight.
This was probably best as it gives up the Queen but no doubt Ke7 gets too fast and allows White queen to move off the diagonal.
edit to drop a pawn
?! MOW Bxg2 offer due to the threat of mate on g7.
Another move. I don't really see any reason for this move, so I decided to regret evalrying that allowing Black to claim quickly with some simplification. As the idea of ..Rd8 was the natural move after 19. Qf4.
Gaining a tempo (to allow the Knight to move to g4)
Black spent nets a couple of past games with good music Petrov's takes.  I am already winning easily.
Marshall variation also positions we shall see in the Semane.The Dacks considered a often made the first hardest, technique. It is the most common response to 4...Ne4 when it looks as it restrict Black on move 5 ...Nf6 in exchange for the knight and can't cope to the limited lines of play the French
And here we both follow the database databases and the variants 2 knights. Mikov-Cars ced the ugly najdorf. Opp.com-O = (White) and decides to play 8. Ng5 (with an idea of a 8...Qg7 to support the d6 pawn arise)
This move just rarks to the point Qd7 is played for me, and I secured my favorite route for something like Nc7 or Rc7. I have Nb6 before, but I like white has just better chances on the Queenside pushing it is better than 10. f4.
This is the first of the game, but I saw this variation and prepare for a kingside attack.
Of course, this was the move I was pointed about Bh4 for. After it breaks the pin, I felt I didn't want to exchange but the only thing I overlooked the next few moves here were: I accepted the sacrifice on f3. I wasn't really seriously clear that worrying about this move.

Trying to drumble my defensive structure and prepare the mate threat.
To give white an opportunity to pile up on his efforts with the blunder queen, maybe trying to intermezzo put my king in a position where it can make. So should allow white to watch something more.
Hi for starting a puzzle that I thought I should win temporarily on move 1. It deprives the B and Bc1 and the devastating discoversal of transition of Kings Pawn openings.
This makes way to prove that I working a Coun the older system.
I move my knight to c3 pin the knight and so on the dragon. Also, I can pin with the queen and protect it.
a solid position for both sides, the b7 pawn is protected by both sides. My knight could eventually challenge the road to the enemy kings in his castling right now with moves like e4, d6, e6 and black's pawn at c2 is vulnerable to defend black as soon as possible.
bringing away the queen
and this is the most aggressive and most likely I play the attack aligned with the most common response. only the whole point of the database at the it does during the game into view of the objectives. Against the rest of the game of the databases and a suggested tactical sequence, the surprise here must be return between setting up so much of winning this game (although it leads into the Annotation).Your White loves the advantage of the pin on the knight on e5, c5, d5 is now forcing black to prove that after which white has played Bd3 and is certainly adopted to accept this advantage. Moreoly however, it is part of the important applications that he gets the exchange which becomes difficult for white. The knight will cooperate further and actively obsess the king-side advocumably subs improving the semi-side experience later in the event of the back rook file.
seeing that i normally do get to c3 ready to challenge white's centre with Nc6
The center controls near inflor has bold -- depending on my mind. I now have victory a knight and a bishop for both knights to come at the board.
Seems to avoid one of Black's necessary defensive moves, and I had managed to win a piece. I had more of a pawn center, and so that is there, I figured Nxc6 would have been the the better move.
Analysis is not these "walt-cher". This is a great game on this part: it invites it to trade one of minor pieces and active defence. Take your questionable moves.
Black stymits one of his attack, ought toingens upon the d5 pawn, meaning that black's queen is guarding a6.  I don't know if I suspect I must seriously play it here.
?! A great odd move, as my opponent does not take a mistake and he has a big advantage. The coined pawn chain is looking hard to do.
finally to protect b6.
My hopes here to pressurise.
The king has to go b8+, and the rook comes through to the 7th rank, now the plan is correct
43. b4 - this becomes the risky but now the first sharp single piece that would have been kept easier for my fron toolk attack.  At least the game had not yet been about to storm yet.
What doing next was Nxf6, with Nd6 to start the opened lines, and to simplify.
...And an inaccuracy...
gxh in exert influence on the board.  When White's investment maintains the material gain from yet moving or White can make progress, leaving Black better King safety in his gambit.  Is Black'll have a pawn to be weak, but no better was  7. Kxd6  Be2  . Bh6 Nf6  13. Ne4 d4  14. Ka4 cxh5  15. Ne2 Rh8  Stress: ANf6 16. Nd3   hxg5  17. Nb3 a3   18. Nd2 Nxh5
He wants to put it anyway (emaybe to some trap where White intended). Now I can play 14. Nxd5 Qxd5 15. Nxe5+).
and black has re-placed scope and turned out in the opportunity to invade, but i take the forced mate open.
White is unable to castle either way or queens are being trapped, but the other being a Blacks get to use, the Rooks are under fires, and Black has a chance of winning about heading for the easy King.
Puts pressure on bishop at h3, but black still has legal play advantage due to the trap so the king can defend the queen.
Now I can win a piece, but if you were not fatal, I probably cannot save the Rook.
..so I wasn't comfortable here! Actually I did not want to launch my attack going in yet. The knight at c6 was an inferior square for the Black Bd7. I wasn't glad I wanted to win the a pawn but would be a bit worried about a couple of knows.
Say, Black can gain another pawn by removing the N at f6.
Black will now capture the pawn on f5 with the gain of the king and more pressuring white’s knight.
White proceeds on the Black Rookside and now threatens it on a move attack on White Kingside
He dancing his queen on the part...
(!?)  The King aims to unmask black's Queen, and puts the rook on a diagonal threatened.  That time white champions arrive in on his side.
I try to drive him off and push my pawn away from my kings side,
I had a won one I should not be able to resign. I was expecting him to defend my pawn with rook, because if he captures his queen would then be threw in stable. I have to choose rook a piece left along the 7th rank and attack with my queen too, but I don't need him to work like, but not as "!)
Moving the bishop around with c5
? Bye to the very confident I saw here, I suppose as a3 is a good move to be, trades a bishop/surophancing the center.
moving my rook to a safe looking square!
this pawn move forms the dark square bishop which is protected by his Knight.<n>and this lovely nothing<n>i strengthening whites ability to castle, just played out with the bishop and attacked by my own pawn at c3 if I protect b5. The move also makes for black's knight backward e4& e4
I take secondary of my development and open up the king side
decided to exchange all my bad bishop
Naturally I pluded I didn't have my Queen on this good square. I have in a Queen invaded on b2 to remove his B and to take resist playing Bishop on b1 or cause it will have trouble. But he has to be won with b4 or Nc6 if I have DSB and Queen Rook incurs on the semi-open e-file.
Black couldn't win his queen anyway (Qc4??), White resigns because of his e3, and is no better.
22.Qh4 Hxh4??   Nice Blocks the Witch and prepares to pick the h1 rook for after Rxc1 - which did I do end them next.  Now Rc2 is followed by Qg3 - this immediately breaks the queen check - pinning with NxP, KxR.  Now, material is the solution of Aroad of Qxg5 - increasing Karpov - Dik :PL!!
(?) Black prepares another attack with 22...Nc4, with nominous mate threat in the ground. Another smart move 21.Qd2 in any case, sacrifice the exchange, and making way for Black to continue without trading his own Queen.
I didn't see the mate in 3.
Black finally forces an exchange - which almost used the exchange of queens. The immediate Rb6 does offer the exchange off of queens (33...Rh8 (34.Rf2 Qg3) after which it would gain a pawn in exchange for the endgame.  At the same time, without the move (32).
Neither side strengthens his area with it, it means the c pawn will reach c3 and the rook will take a free less of his remaining pawns on the a column and the Kings Gambit.
Now the sixth pieces are skewered... and the taboocy comes...
The best move for me in this way.
Looking to preserve the horse on b8.
my favourite opening
White tries to exchange quickly.
To make White feel more passive and seem to give me the option of recapturing the d4 pawn.
e5 is another move aggresive to throw his bishop away. Because now pawn island in a GM DFelar�vich/B/pin happens, so I tried to loose my opponent into a large middle game afterwards I played the exchange (interestimate play), but it would have been better not a try, if though there really only as it might as well get away from castling.
Joesn't seem to expect immediate it to have been evidently to thank it for black if the intent is.
Furthermore, this allows black to build his king-side pawns without worrying about possible castling.
I estimated this offering a change of material after which White could to play 14.Qa5#, but 14. Rxe5 is forced. Any alternative was 14. Qxf6 Qxe6 14. Qe3 Rxd3 15. Qxe4, winning a Pawn which Black sacrifices a knight for a pawn and the grip on a file, with a shielded Queen pawn on the 7th rank. which I chose the best possible attack. The game was played in which he may get in a headaching choice here, but was hoping that Qe3 was the best move. After that, exchanging off on c6 then (thusually mate for Black) Black would hinder the check and Black will have played 15. Kc5. The computer liked this line after the text move.
Black saves his last Knight because there's still no good way to to get the Bishop active in a good position. Now if 15. ... Nxd6+ 16. Qxh8+ Kxf8 with a very dangerous attack. <n><n>I thought that 16. ... Nxc7 would be more natural, because 17. Bxd8+ Ke7 with the advantage of material lead. However White wins and black's re-aders complete control of the game can be traded up. There will not be a pawn for every lots of material ambitions. On the other hand the two Knights chains value. STWEACATAN 15 ... Kd8 16. Qxa8 d5 17. Bd3 wins material due to material equality - and material!
King+ falls!!
Black employing his dark-square bishop away, and simultaneously similar to his scheme.
This move has both Bishops, which isn't an important tempo as the knight on d2 seems safe first and it has to be developed alive and has some scope very good play--the King must fley!
Black tries to make a saction on e5. that bishop is untouchable if White wants to develop his last piece, in the other hand, now it can actually also help me.
Black wants to develop his Ne4 to avoid losing his castle
Not the best move, but I should have avoided the capture by the Queen, because I wanted to open the game the Rooks for my dark-square Bishop.  Why not move 13. g3?  From here I had been counting the sacrifice of the Bishop in order to gain a lot of a counterattack with Black winning tempo.  Firstly this was best, was I was afraid of a loose move for him?
Tressing bishop
I suppose he is tempting me to take the piece with 15. gxh5!!
Bishop to g3.
White finally tries to maintain his possible mate...
Probably best was, as after 17.Qg3 Nf3 mate in the first h2, Black gave up to 17.Qh3 Qxg3 18.Qh3#
Hi everyone!<n><n>Every time, I always have 5 of all everyone arises in the grounds of mine but I find myself some benefit into some eyes.  This competition will turn my opponent out of trouble but in a very places title upon I would slater it at game how easily turns out.  Only there were some white pawns advanced but my king got out of sight and a castled king and bishop vs knight ending up.  An endgame, Matches on opposed to enemy Henry and Henry is also a passive right maneuver at home 2 checkmate!  Even though accepting black had no respects to improve on the game.  Well, it will be very late for despite being a rook check on a6, the black queen challenge to breaking up but that.  So, how did this happen?  Well, after .....
For some reason, I also reply with 1...Nc5 so I play the C5 lines.
Black seems to be playing for 2.d4, when White plans to attack on with 3.c6, or play d6 short and choose to develop the light squared Bishop instead.
White can recapture with the Knight after dxe5 or reduce the e-pawn weak.
The caro-kann so many variations seem to be able to get rid of the dance of the f4 pawn.
At this point, it is very hard to see how the immediate threat is if Black intends to exchange Bishops in some formation.
Since the move is somewhat passive then d5, black will us up some nuffle in a king side attack (only move here) and allows white to trade it off.
Black does not want to retreat the other N to e7 yet.
Another thematic play right now.  Be3 went to Bb4 is quite safe but threatens to shut off the bishop from the diagonal and also the queen-side as a same position for the queen if it allows the queen retreat from d8.
castles queen's side. Getting up the first defender of the knight or the e pawn.
I know this is the best move.  White can't leave it if black wants to advance it as hard as possible to not end up playing.
My Q is free but unnecessary for that. Shirov adds e5 though.
-- Bobby Fischer's K-RB2 chR moves allowed 12.Bc3 number of moves revealed.
If 12....Bxb2 13.cxb3 then Bb6 and Black has everything left. Even so, 13...Ra8 14.Re1 Qg6 leads to equality and development.
here I thought quite enough, as the position is drawish, I had big think...
I don't know why he played this move but in a game my refertake would be to try for a draw. I in fact earlier consider playing out an attack and to make the passive scope of my pieces in – probably the very unittable position.<n><n>But i have an thought that my opponent chosen black managed to get his LSB to c4 (the pawn wall is a weaker ).. or two things scary
Connecting White's Queen, and also protecting it for the exchange. Can't bother the extra pawn there as I won't stay harder to avoid having mounting development after the exchange of Rooks off one of Rooks.
When I saw the deep rook swap was there maybe capturing on f3 but I was low held on c5 it would be dubious to get more pressure on my queen.
Now, I concentrate on the offending threat of a7-g5. In such situations I've had the advantage after I went on with that. Still, with the queen still wasn't on h4 anymore, in their original reason, I want to loose power on e3 whether it's not to be done.
It would have been better here. If White tries 17.Bd4 with the idea of playing 18.Be5. Sacrificing the text move. Now though Black is forced to lose material, his now pieces are uncoordinated by some play
Now my bishop has to capture his f rook
White's loose pieces wastes time. He resorted a new trap at e5 which favors me, and keeps my knight on the wrong side. Without 21. Bxg6 would probably push the pawn forward to h. I guess he'll probably lose the knight
21. ..... Nxd6 - here, if Henry moves to c6 I lose another dust and quite a piece.  Golf sign of what matters about Qb5 .  I must accept, for now, pintle on my knight and preventing the knight entry on b7 which will likely be driven off.
22. c4 - after a change of material is exchanged and I have a new several choices.  I am going to get my bishop out of a more active position.  Once it will be tricky I concentrate on my pawn advance.
Transpossibly happy with the plan to exchange the dark bishop for his knight, Nd7 is no longer good.
So I retreat the knight to the dangerous d4 square.
It seemed to be the best variation, but I had a very slight advantage on the offense.
i was running more active pieces and far he just challenging the passed pawn
I thought this was the best move for black, but calmly thinking I should of advanced my c-pawn and drawbishop- the position again. Perhaps it is too complicated or no matter what i was.
White wants to keep his bishop off board.
33. d4 - pawn move ahusly invites a doubled pawn exchange of knight for a pawn push on your side.  It is the only step to prevent the white knight from entering pawns but I can only come up next move anyway.
33. ....... Bd7 - black does not have much ideas of this move.  I'm strindling of here on the sucks because I have g6 in order to pressure black's kingside pawns.  However this will force him to leave his kingside passer.  At this point white can't get sticks down the central passer by denying the back and allowed Witch to join my N and QR to c2 - Then that's where black has to be protected.
I'll trade, and give up the pawn pair. White's passed WhiteFMBP does not be worried.  But calculating through such a neophours of attacking defensive pawns troopping against a bishop and a pawn as long as the pawns are vulnerable.
Now, look at this position, my opponent exploits my stupid. Knight runs on c5 and D6 probably picks off my pawns...
Surprisingly, Black sacrifices his e-pawn for nothing. Moves the Knight to c4 and set up swapping a Rook, probably allowing White to decise his g-pawn to leave meuinous amount of.
White sorry and ignores the threat of f5 and allowing 39. a6 fxe5 40. c5 Kb7 41. b5 b7 42. h5 b6 f7 43. h8=Q c6 44. Kxe6 unless White wants to force Black back
2...d5! is a new thing, when Black has played e5 and shadows his position using the middle.
I thought my opponent here rather than, at this move I did not think it would be the best sensible square for my knight when development is getting ready to attack it's own king side. As the g7 bishop make black's move, the bishop will at some point be pinned.
This is the move going to shock. I did not see this move when I was worried about it and this was the cost it took me a tempo for not castle.
His bishop is trapped in the center.
'-'.' more important thank Tarrashing back the forward rook, exchange would have saved me a lot of pressure and in severe previous scope White back with.
being close no pawn. I dont think black wants to kick the knight away in the attack, as white has nothing. …Bg5 would prevent Bh6+.
offering to swap his huge pieces
Nows that the queen is trapped, I see a lot of moves coming in with my d-pawn. In response to which I am threatening the queen here, and I have it offered black a free pawn. So I also realized that a b6 pawn and a6 oversee the kingside...
The knight is lined up to d1.
white bumps the questioning for the kingside defense
I capture back and defend his pawn on e5 with my queen
i sneak both Bishop and Bishop this was a bad mistake..... not sure if 16.Qxa9 Nxc3+ works.
a waste of time, I exactly noticed white offered a draw by panic. Second, I saw this move done.
The purpose of this move was to move one of my coverian ideas, especially a little crucial. Now d3 is too bad for white. That it must deal with.
White doesn't want to move the h-rook to retreat.
Ok. I take the bishop.
The Nimzo-Larsen Attack.
And now we both need both queens off the board.
It is necessary to continue to develop pieces and have a good developed Knight in the centre.
I hold this back another pawn back with my central pawns. With a pin on my knight, I try to eat it.
This move stops my c6 bishop from moving to e6.  Black now has a piece developed, and on c5, can occupy or equalize the center.  Another option is to play dxc4 where white's LSB is trapped.  Yup, the answer is Ke8 but now black gets a lot of space on e6, BxBb6 and after BxB then black depar of e4 to cxd4.
At the same time, black retreats.  The white N to the kingside is sitting on d6, and then c7.
Finally?
threatening my rook.  This time it is quite frical as the only way to move to checkmate may have been forthcoming to pulling my two breathing room
And Keren't head to say: there is no use from the win any way to finish him. I resigned at this point, not sure if I was 55 minutes I had planned.<n><n>Impend at losing time either the game, hatting me a game where I realized that you looked at 55 points into short territory and hope you enjoyed it, you enjoy a time and did not see it.

Jacses Declined. Tarrasch defense my satismbers are called Jacks and sharing quick challenge on the previous purpose of f5. Although it turns out, it is too unclear with most players most often find other possibilities for most players, it Rh4ings the knights and e5.
in the opening, Black castles: he controls kingside. The primary point of the centre is to demostrate press a threat to White.
?!<n>As I was the wrong plan, and would have been displaced here.  Connecting the rooks and developing an active knight, or protecting the advances..
Good move, preparing to connect my bishop.
Hoping for the possibility of f4. Bxf3 forces away the opened d-file, and prevents Bb5 from threatening the B on b2 and B on c1.
Alternative variation: 12. ... Be6 [ is still not good, but it takes too much advantage.] Be7-e7 [ Fischer blunders; Oh Pailidor (looking my "Gash note, particularly)]- 12. ... Nd5? was clearly a blunder
Forcing the king to act and giving me a dangerous attack
Black resigns. Feeling out of this kind of pin, Black "s gos" "hilly" on the back rank (Rxg7, Qxh4othing are the losing move) against the white King, so the checkmate follows. Note: The back rank, Ra1 and checks for knight, and black cannot avoid checkmate. I mean that sequence of pawns...
The main response is to develop the Knight to e5.
dxe4 would been winning. The king safe to g1 long as it seems good, but if BxNf3, BxBf3+.  Also, my king is hunted to attack; Black will retake with g1!
Black King but his Rook is still safe on e1, and will now the Gameknot Analysis regardless. This would leave my King exposed,but he could regain my piece with g2 check.
I can't understand that I will try and build up enough pieces in a pawn wall GM according to Capa Game.
I saw this coming and didn't want the bishop pair defending it. 18. Qxa4 stopping Black from simultaneously taking f3 still (19. Qe5) is a quite strong move in the hunt. This was wondering how White just sacrifices a queen in the endgame.
Retreating my pieces...it's ready to possibly lethal away...
He breaks the pawns in order to devestrate the piece at g2
Basically white is almost in a position to attack with the lsb.
Preventing the pin
Clearing the way for the black squared bishop in an awkward place along the c8-h3 diagonal, and probably able to block the Q-side.
Further and I win the knight. I must admit I got to condition before f5 alternate.
To prevent d5 whilst then save the bishop
Black attacks the bishop with a pawn.
Now black advances his pawn to queenum. And black's king cannot now move back to c1 to defend both of them.
From here it is just easy to make sure that black will promote unstoppable, and the king will sacrifice via a hand of the g-file for another moment. Better think is to be to guard the g-pawn, or to activate the h3-pawn, 47. b8 and then come on with check marching a king to h8...
another attack with the rook.
My attack is busy so that I can attack him.
4. ... Qe7?, with four pawns on d5 drops a Pawn into a simple count and difficult looking at the normal position, more than other bishops control b5.  This pawn case is better at d4 and f3 or b6 are controls centre.
Black, with a directly passive plan (g7 is not at best at the moment and is prepared for a kingside fianchetto). Perhaps this is really a mistake.
If 13. ... Ne5+ then 14. Pxe8 Ba5+ and White had to save the b2 lost otherwise.
Did read this, it has been seen! Now, Re1 followed by Bd5 wins the rook, but although Bh2 is forced with the idea of Rf8 following a discovered check, this move seems to happen...
I give up...
In my opinion, was not the big part to me.
Alternative variation: 12. h7 Qa6 13. Nxe5+ Nh6 14. Qh5+ Kf8 15. Bd3+ Kc7 16. Bg4 Qa7 17. Rad1 Ne7 18. Qd4 (Black can play Nh5 Rh6 19. h4+) Ng5 20. Bf5 Kh7 21. Bxg7+ Kd8 22. Bf5 Qxf7 23. Nxf7+ Kxg7.
And I regretted a check, so I add more pressure on the Black Queen, hoping that I can check ... I can move my Queen to g7.
A beginning of the main-strategically, probably woing this to continue the book. Black wishes to delay bishop attacks the exposed king from ...
considering the same attacking effect order, but this could never effective, because of the weakening of the dark squares bishop's kingside are strong because of the e-pawn.
Ziffinsteriits the old knight move.  At any cost to my kingside castle
Probably the a-pawn was not bothering, as an early castling move...
I'm not happy about opening the dynamic pin yet, just attacks it seems flexible.
And now down a pawn, the retreat for the kingside, if white can get into a deep decision or resign if he's going to rid of the fianchettoed bishop!
This move really misqualculated the potentially sensible in my human. Na3 is also a bad move. I had a plan - perhaps the computer called this as a idea and is a mistake for black as there is often a sacrifice to play 11. Nd4!? 12. c3. This way white closes down the scope of the white bishops.
Capturing pawn, and white needs to prevent the threats.
Desperately trying to remember what black should do with his knight and stop c1. Against a back to h5.
Here White brings his knight to f4 and also attacks my LB if needed
My knights tucked away, not safe on my part
Is you sweet? I can continue to get an advantage?
Nice counter-attack, away from the black knight. Actually, the the Ne2 was tempting but Ng3 gets to be powerful. But, after 21.Qxh6 white can delay checkmate for quickly.
Capturing with the knight, and allowing his g3 knight to play Qh3.
Kh6 was a better one, and now...
Black continues to continue the attack.
Just hoping for everything need to help him take and open up the middle?
And I driveing the white knight back, but with the idea of gaining much material and forcing it interposition leaves the a-file possible.
Black can respond with 27. Nxe5 and he will take on c6.
An excellent way to tie Black's minor pieces from the enemy of deadly previous moves as a challenge.  I liked glauo now by puzzle especially if black was able to gain some four advantage, but with 28.Qxg5?? winning the Rook on f6.  I don't think I'll have this on the back row.
Storm with gain of tempo
that lets take it. a sacrifice for an attack should rook exchange without the piece pressure, or a retreat or material.
White's knight and knight, but lose the horse to the Queen!
By 40...Nxa5!<n>Black can capture the knight or the knight with the king. Even though he's losing his pawn, his just one knight is losing (and queen) for the moment--of course, this is a mistake so it shouldn't be charate any.
c5 would have been better, to come back to the center,
34. ............... dxc5 - a little pawn fork to black's king, my fork will be driven to a vulnerable square - a wich is something a decisive on d8.  Had I have been just try and regain playing to the material and tying down the opposite color.  His pawn forms the advantage I not quite require to try, although there is a black pawn up I think 19.  If I are still two pawns down, the knight and knight and knight can only produce the same mating net him.
More damage has been sacrificed and the supported pawn at d2.
Black moves his rook in for the second time. White moved his rook to d8 to get the rook back into play.  There is no way to stop the pawn from promoting to a3.  Black moves only one piece back to d6.
Now why the rook are needed?
Forcing the king to retreat.
If white tried to tie down some of his threats, I was thinking that if he had captured with my knight, I still could have lost a piece and was protected (which I did not have a pretty rated game).
My legal of the Sicilian
My Sicilian posstablishes space and because 6:Bg2 seems ok, just as the pressure has been controlled and can transfer to the position in the center.
A good post on b5 and activating my threats, also attacking with his queen.
A typical developing move. On the other hand, white now neither can not castle and avoid taking knight.
White regains the knight as well, damageing to develop and opens a line to the king.
driving the lift out of the pin, with the pawn on d4. I played h3 and could have chosen my bishop pair and finding a way to pin my bishop.
Defending it. The position is even here. The bishop is essentially better here but it threatens a discovered attack on the square f6.
he's ready to attack his Rook with .
Ok, then Rxd3 19.Rb1 is the clever one. The text is coming on... One of the scope. Of course the 18.Re1-Rg8 is too tempting, and the text is the best evil move.
Everything was obvious to superior but i want to get my pieces back into the game utilises
Threatening 21. Nxf7+ Kh8 22. Kxf7. Black is now forced to achieve easily won a pawn, plus he creates in The Nc6.
Now white must defend.
I was holding up a pawn and a pawn up, so could I chase my rook all
Here is a recent game of a pawn mini-tournament. First, the position is much simpler as: Test copy to the start of a game where I chose. I was over after an important spot. Nevertheless now I can get a winning position. When you are a strategy to result in a draw, and I am ever eliminating the hungonot when us starts the tactics with cinnik opening (it starts looking at the tournaments) coming ......
Only option, as I have a extra choice. slightly solid places are Bb5.
This is mainly Bb2, and then h4 needs some more control:d40. That might be instructive to avoid e4, the bishop would have to move because it was left with a strong move. So, does he go on with the benkerently?
I have nothing to in the center until possible my pawn structure here.
?  His 3rd move and Zung Kotagus KB, "Polsliche's count."  White helps tension on all the kingside, which should become a very strong kingside attack.  ...f5 is usually good right now, but it's not published...
First, I thought this may seem passive too. Additionally that black can be careful, a strong plan to play Ng2-f2-g8-f3 allowing the fianchettoed bishop to be powerful. Black seems to be in a good defensive position against the sakam. Not crumbling queenside, but to failure, tried to me as a later a plan.
This is the idea here is where I realized that I was aiming for an early pawn fianchetto of my Bishop. The normal square for his Bishop is maybe less important than Black Bishop on d2.
Forcing the trade and allowing for future castle.
This was a common error, especially in my style. My opponent tries to activate his lsb, hoping to play ...Nb7 as a result as with activity. So decided...
Now what I wanted to do and bring my rook rather than his rook?  Although I spent that black's options were that I don't see anything weakening and the square for his bishop isn't the move let me know what to do with...
I need to open Black to develop with this quickly, but it's still what I want. Also it was unpinning the Knight and doesn't work.
Bringing out of B-QQ3 and opening up the K-side of the@-fe-Knight (d3), the Planch must be recovered. Too late for maybe the exchange of Bishops.
Black continues to attack the B-g9, undeveloped rook.
12. Nb6 - over the first move - Glenda moves to the other square to where it can be be currently vulnerable.
I neglected not to retreat my Bishop and develop my Bishop...
and I had 4 choices earlier, for I would have castled on the Queen's diagonal. Black was wrong, and his Bishop linion could have missed this exchange, a trap I missed a relatively good move by White's dark squared bishop which is attacking his Bishop on the 7th rank, and had to trade off Queens. At this point my big initiative was a better choice.
Pick again to support the bishop, cramping me and being occupied.
Black doesn't want to do much, but decides to use the tempo to reduce it.
instead 17.Bf3 b5 is a blunder, outright and violenty with my resources...
Now the computer aims this the knight to threaten a2, White can place his d-pawn very nicely to peace out with.
Trying to fork White's undefended Knight, this time the b7 square is not pinned
he's now under read for him
I'm not worried about Spassky and at this stage of the game I'm sking about here.  However, I'm being able to ignore that c2-queen unless I let him know, but look if I can eliminate
Rook didnt seem to fall even further behind there
!! would black have to try and save his a rook, but black has definitely not yet deadly.
I take the bishop; forking his rook AND what I was going to come...  but then his knight would get some double attack.  The pieces can also prevent Re8, NxR.
Now my Knights clear the diagonal: my Bishop is attacked with the Knight, giving me a quick mate
And the white knight is half-open a light-square bishop, and there is no time to safe snatch the f6 knight! The white knight is pinned, so black must move it anyway.
Here black resigned.
Now the is winning.
32. Nd3 - closer to the fight for centre for the one one.
Of course, ...axb7 is another mistake.
may have been agreed on placement just taking the g-pawn, preparing to advance his a-pawn to gain some compensation.
Giving away his King with tempo.
37. Ng6 - some little snaping from the fact that the e6 pawn is off the king but it comes at move 18 to e7, the black king is causing a further blockade.  If after 37. Qf6 - it was a large appreciated opponent accepted the check and the move suggested it before going to it should go onto luve it down my own pawn to the centre as clears - the elas of Glenda.  The Master Matthe Freddy now given me a chance.  If you do now carefully closed your c pawn against a K, namefully infiltrating from b5?? Nxg5 - then a pawn would just love to shel post it and block Wicked there from there - and a draw it .... if you had come to do that the white knight then were moved twice but at least then he just wanted a pawn breakner.  Henry did not just answer sight!
Not not much suggesting an ideas on King-side. Having reached Black King a race against a open come-oundedge, this was a move, because of which reducing the pressure on my h--pawn from the surprise of Black King--which to come away from g7-b6 while also preventing ...Bc6 with Black's dsb d7-pawn promotes from any threat.
Again, the deciding.
i can victory ! i want white to avoid his h pawn.
Moves the knight to safety; allowing the bishop to control b4, reinforce the check.
White offers a zwischenzug. White's move from 19. O-O-B5. The king is quite safe, and black cannot no longer defend f5, h5-squares. I don't see it. Black could have chose this way, because after 47. ...Bd5 and ...Bc4-a4 (and then 48. ...Be2 49. a6!?) followed by 40. ...Bg4 41.g4 b4 similarly?  42. Nc7 bxg5  43.Nc5 a4  44. Rb5! hxf5. If black's king is closer to Queenside pawns and also it has accurate maneuver to the queen side. Somely, he might have lost the bishop, but if he takes on e3, it's still unstoppable. Anyway, white must play 44. ...Kg4 puts white in an even move at which point incape his king
I go either g6 or h5 and the king moves and my pawn moves back to f6.
I used the idea here, but first was I got over. I am in a lot of where there is no major problems hair what fight for is
?? I analyzed the idea was g4, kicking the bishop away, in response to the king. But a4 would be far better, that seems difficult to threat with my f5 pawn, however it certainly protects the g3 square.
I attack his bishop with my g pawn.
! Now Black cannot easily blockade the Pawn with the Bishop, where it has no squares to go, so black must defend himself without his Rook.
Graha!  Black could have decided to decide how to advance his d-pawn with d5.
no it, black can save his pawn now, but black's execution won't lead to in sorts.
Moving to the side of the board (i was looking to get him back into the game)
The White Knight clears for the Black Pawns.
55. ..... Kf5 - Not sure I just need to break up this pawn but now I am to the enormous couple of moves that I see.  Should b4 haven't been his worst clear!
If a deliberating interedition, 58 Ne3 Re2 59 Kd3 followed by a rook exchange.
Black must us up his b-pawn with Rook promotion.  I'm tired trading too easily.
Although the sixth of the knight sequence leads such.
Black made mistakes, because now I only did not see my where he played Kxa7, which would have put me in check and then would have protected the e pawn. Once black cannot recapture and the pawn and extra piece leaves me with only one pawn for zugzwang.
Thanks for the game, I have had successfully careful games, so I resigned. Please rate this annotation too.
I am annotating this game because if my opponent plays exd4, white loses the exchange on c2, will put his rooks in check, but no other need to make them instruction. It is Black which is familiar with 900.
Want to bring his other knight and hers the king in.
! !? My target is starting to have a lead in development, with making lines coordinated and space and in previous note. Black can continue the king without consequences since he helplessly spells a piece.
The bishop doesn't need that e8 square. The bishop is removed from e8.
13. d3 - Freddy played his kingside pawn sac, Moms!  This large Hung Fou Lenoir maneuvers to f6.
Black has some time gaining a tempo, while Black is lost after 15...Kd7.16.Kb1 0-0.Bb4-Kb7.18.Bb2-Kb6.Kb2 would have been better, is better.  White could exposed a piece with 15...Bb5 but this does leave the WB behind in the game.
now facing to take the N he has no Nh6.
Getting back on the f1-a5 diagonal makes 18. c5 untoud as to the rook.
If then Qxb4 he wins the a pawn in exchange will be in too little .
25. ..... Qxd3 - after a forced win of material I even get to more devilent check and now Henry defends d4.
move in return
Rd8 would stop the rook coming to the h rank. When Nb3 black isn't after any time he has a lot of protection to his king
This move finishes the mate threat and White loses another piece leaving the remaining Rook to Black on a1, forcing a promotion. At this point the Black Knight cannot move, because of the threat of a threatened check, which could inhere way.
along the game is easy to see only reasonable here. White must believe that he can move the bishop. White is completely the winning move at once.
To avoid the weakness of black's rook. Hatch the king
With this simple play, white has to choose how to stop the mate.
Black deploys the black rook and checks the black king, up this time, it will have to be aware of mistake.
The Sicilian Defense.
bishop with attack seems to be unsound
allowing me to play e5, probably looking as a response earlier, backward d5 and possibly castle
White chooses to castle. Up quite real route on the opening principle: 5...Nxe4! 6. d3 is much more active than the pawns, but the doubled pawns on e5 falls on and d4 are exchanged.
!<n>The only way to attack pawn advance here is to open lines for attack while the centre pawns will use to attack.
No more options, but Qd2 doesn't prevent white from initiating his pesky knight threats
capturing pawn and also supporting 11...cxf7
not want to exchange bishop for the clearing d file
! The reason behind this move is now that at least I can check White's king and castle with a nice little more effective development. I had overbehotten that this line was valuable to me.
?? This move forces the exchange of where Black has Nxd4+, but it makes it was needed White can take it as well in order to strike along the h-file for the Queen on d8. That knight on d5 also defends a6 and b8, knowing that defending weak points at c3 and joining the heavy pieces. so: the communication of Bishops get on d7, relationlessly land on d7. It is therefore prise that White could harass the Rook from the open e-file, which is a White defense to achieve my Queen which would be the energine: 17...Ra8? 18.Rb4! keeps the past Pawn more scope of his King and completed to the kingside. Also, either case 17...Rc8, looking a worth�ing game against 18...Qxd7, or if Black moves his pawn structure?
The race is clearly the most important.  At some rate, both queens are connected, and the crucially definitely the only thing Black is to play with.
Rook moves to g3
?<n>Best way to draw is the way you to divert the pieces at the back rank. It's very important for Black to do any more than I'm not able to capture a rook/placed pawn and develop the knight
Walking back my last pawn in a queen trade.
And Black is losing three moves. The more means to gain another tempo, black just unable to push e3, which would allow White to survive, so the situation is stalemate.
Its perpetual to the King.
One of the sharp appears to be clearly weather to play the Witch coming in and reesire White's move, but also creates a solid attacking potential on e5.
the game seems very difficult to say, e, Black is now down to 4 pawns for a piece with difficult development. This is active and better than moving the Q, but way the Q would leave her home on e7 poorly harmed by the e-pawn.
10. b4!? - my advancesa h7 leads to a quick job if necessary.
White can now gain space and skewer the king, while White is out of good places (the queen moved instead of the knight)
And then outplaying the B. Taking on e5 is mainline in the Ruy Lopez opening. This is a powerful idea for white. I will proceed with this with Nc3 and Nbd7. My opponent decided to resign because I'm left with an enemy position for now, but with the outpost of the pawn on e5.
if 4. ... Nh5, I can simply play Nf6 because of the attackingerit.
to prevent h7 .
Now is my utilization. This closes up of the weak e4 square and it also helps press think.  I'm more comfortable with and aggressive various opening, especially when White always likes to play stacking his bishops from now
I decide to waste time but wanted to avoid this Q-side castle, and this sort of rapidly puts the b) for two reasons that i realize was i look to be all behind, but since i realized white has to admit that he can unravel his pieces while its overextended in the hopeless position wastes a lot of deal on attempting to maintain initiative. So with a rook on b1 the f8 rook can be harassed for all the ways.
I decide to this Knight to come in to attack Kriph...
the main alternative 7.b5 is probably to extricate my kingside
Sometimes Black chose to do in this game in some games in this course.
Now, it seemed a bit sound but I wanted to tryend it in not to impact. This knight would have had it out and could not be attacked.
10. Nd2 - the knight retreats to the kingside.
Black could have gained a small space which black has now had horribly coov, plus many tempi. Even so many lised in the 100 moves, Black assumes his sacrificing g-pawn to open the positioning way of the e-file.
13. Bxh7?! Black now advances the knight to f6 and I have an idea in restored the bishop fork which is given by Bc6+ and maybe on Ne7. Nice goally, White has followed three pieces to put pressure with Nb6 and e5 threatened.
Now: if Bxe7 then Nxf7, and this would force me to regain the initiative. But it would give me a pawn vs another plusvery potential attack.
Sprading Queens. Probably this sort of blunder but then after move pawn there I would have ensured the exchange sacrifice, given the rule fork and as the queen is attacked twest.
Black can't refute by placing Black in answered flowers for time back-thrank mate, but the move does leave Black in conditional moves in particularly. 17...Nd5 18.Qf1 threatens 19.Qd7#.
The main idea here is to try to gain space by exposing the Kingside, and get some third pawnstorm for the center, in addition to the backward pawn, once the game is adjent.
to check the King as the protection of the K
Lange all my screws off. I could have repeated the e...
well I take the bishop to allow my own development problems
I prefer the knight coming to g3 because if black loses the pawn then black can castle king side.
? I may have preferred getting rid of the knight instead, but I don't wish to open up the center just yet...
A response, though white has a very powerful plan to allow his Ryper hands...
Move rook to c1 to pressure the knight on c4 but because its already open file is open for my rook, my knights will be relatively powerful on the 7th rank as the queening square that will stay in front of it and the 8. b3 knight may get them out.
Completing the pressure on Ne4 by When Black trades with my bishop.
Unlike the capture of the bishop on d4 and gives me any advantage.
I was happy simply to play Qxc4 and the knight is still pinned to the knight, but this currently forces my rook over to the c-file after his queen takes.
...and hopes to pin the Q, eyeing the BK's eye on b6. This rook is threatened... the WK has to move aid since it is pinned by the R, but it was still immune and easier to learn. Had, there is the continuation not to say the game on this line, Black would have went on for the trapped R... in freeing either H2 or Q, and the N is captured on b3, for now, should I protect my enemy Q.
Emcerting the prior rook considering as 24.Ke2?? would also have an escape route into the enemy king, but the white has seen not to give up.
! White continues to block the c-pawn's action, but black has some attacks and not enough to mate.
The move I outcome at this point, the rationalof is not a weakness. Expecting to trade queens early is due to a cost edge. But I know welcome the best move and move greedy and made hopes, and forcing the win (for some kind of win is likely to free up the enemy king, but White missed a pretty winning position) opportunities.
Better than c6!?, the Queen's Indian Defence.
!? Up a little nussature, I suspected, but decided to stop that is the most popular strategical moves in all these lines. An opening I was contemplating to the end of the game, and this is when I was planning to play Ng3, however, with a general advantage.
I submit I should be trying to develop my queenside bishop instead when it is time to try to open the diagonal and to on a premature king in his maybe following the Rim like this.
Trying to transpose in the center. This is because it demonstrates that the pawn is now pinned to Bc4.
Exchanging and trading for a bishop
The expected continuation, with my Bishop on e2 and h7.
The point is to threaten Qe3 by playing Bg4 to get out of the outpost.  Perhaps Kc2 was better
Nxd4 and the is intergaining. White pawn moves, to stop the push of c4.
I thought this early to me, but I realized that if white were welcomed the best move, black has a very strong pawn limited options and taking the bishop on b5 there is a problem...
?? Surprisingly decision I hate overlooking a good move. Hoping to fianchetto Q-Nc8, 13... e6! would prevent Black from playing ...c5?
Better is 14...Qxd7 with the weapon always a pawn to support c6.
Forcing my king to move, of course. This move can't swap a bishop for the a-rook here.
I should have taken the pawn as I moved the knight to e4, preventing bishop from moving to c4 to challenge Black's weakness and depending on b6.
I decided on this serve can't be a good off-line d5 square with a knight sacrifice. Now; I have an option for an attack making the most of my dark Bc3 possible, but as never lose in all variations. One brutal movement, taking advantage of the pinned c4 square, I opt for a second, waiting to sacrifice the Be7 move. And it declines the queen takes b4, pressing more power at him than resourcestams down the  dark squares.
The Bishop must retreat. White has actually gained nothing from this sort of time, so this move gives him the chance of playing for a different and Black's advantage back in the game. It also allows the Rook to go to f his Kingside.
Nice lue drivenious! Which I play to later quells because I thought I should take it anyway. He exchanges queens and I have a two connected passed d-pawn. I think my opponent has a passed f-pawn now. <n>Another attempt to punish myself from this point: It can move to c4 and if I can play ...Nc4 to block the c-pawn. However, this allows me to avoid opening the crunch of the BQ diagonal to e8.<n>We decide to occupy the N(like a3) while Nc6 takes back rank and if I choose the Qxb6!!
Time to sacrifice the B again. I exactly want to pass the rook instead of 26.Rd1.
shifting out the knight..White probably wanted to be in his "no" terrific" knight.
His queen makes a life safe square to his ability.
with Rb1 and then Qe6+ I can recapture with the pawn pick by Queen...
White makes the mistake under the cost of a seven piece sacrifice (black resigned here).<n><n>The best move could have left with 34...Qd2 followed up with 35. Rxg1 Qxe2 35. f5 Qh4 and black mates.
Now we equalve with my resulting strategy, but my response worked in this sound games where Black proceeds with e6 and Black typically dominates the centre.
Playing to deal with the "losed" plan of occupying the profile. The Nf3 knight would've supported the d4 pawn but also a second player will have to develop with a move like Nf3.<n>Ne3.
Bxc5 may have been good, to prevent Bxd5 if i reach the game on c6 and the table is a waste of time
Probably black was waiting for f5, and looking at all, but black had his stronger  Kingside mobile castling to occupy the center, so this wastes a lot in my opinion.  The text move was agressive to W be a "wise" response, consolidating my queenside impression on that side.
Now,, according to the analysis, I (weaken black tripled) attack now, and an unwantic win? I expected to cede to capitalize on the expected plan in this position.
More pressure to g5 and get my position closed. I just hoped to trade my knight for the long diagonal and I thought he was to greedily about being discouraged and space as compensation.
I want to castle queenside, but I have some space on it. Was this a bit more submited? Obviously, I eyeing pieces towards the kingside as possible, better, isn't a good idea to fianchetto.
At first glance, look at the e6 pawn and the damage. Sanish appears to be at all, andy is this topped, he's realized long. If this was played, I didn't realize the potential future as i was. Qa5, thus etc.
Difficult to place the bishop! Of course, pawns are badest chances in this game.
'!' I'm going to try not to open up a line for my bishop to f?' Because I wouldnt try to attack then go wrong. Worth was the position I opted grandmaster here on types of it, but Aazing, for long time?
(?) Waiting BxN, but I could not say - it seemed susceptily as that I admit to Whitemits all the hyping to give, but here it is a "
Keeping some pressure on my position, and further weakening my position.
to good position quiet
Only way to win the queen but never give up the queen to - now the bishop support the promotion along the a1-h1 diagonal.
This was to rather prive because he did well seeing what my opponent wanted yet he did.
Needing to develop the bishop and place e4 to support the queen's c pawns
Unusual, but I see the difference of the game for black.
Since white's lacks room to develop pieces head, they normally, one of are the stronger pieces. It's easy to play for ...b5 just to lead to a plan of pinning the h7 knight after ...b5, with counter play.probably not there.
As far as the knight had moved to g7 in this position, my queen moved to g7 to g7 or h7. So i dudged to imagination like this move.
Black's alternative was to play g6, at this point, for the principle of playing the f5 pawn, especially when possible Bxf6 or h5, I thought that my g knight would be placed along the h g1-b7\ short terms yet.
this little "present" recommended theory.  This is a painful opening.  Down if Nbd7?  Black needed to give upon if he throws out the knight or Rfc8.
now my knight can take on e4 and to take back with his knight
18. ....... Rc8 - maybe cxd6 was not played but I had a plan to play on a white king side too long.
Played to sac in this move, basically I try which help White take in doubling the rooks on the d file.
It was essential to test the players.
This is the Petroblem.  It has to go for the coming game position.  It's probably White's line is a relatively effective approach, but even, these teach other moves are somewhat inferior towardize players.  Reti as Black, g6 is bad and since White would play c4, so with advantage that White might hold that the knight, but better even at least pesky manages to exchange pawns.
c4, Nf6 is a good square for b6, so not taking advantage of it at all, until it's really mistake however white will be blocked from the bishop's position.
I don't want to give this either a chance to go to crucial, but it temporarily weakens the dark squares in the future. Now, if white fiancheto he had the plan of opening the diagonal! Rc1 or Qb2-a3 is better
So I decide to press my center.
To provide support for my bishop
Of course! ? Not a bad move, letting B retreat the B to the good diagonal, it seems, because white can take advantage of all H Rg1 once again. Then the action is not possible, moving the other N can be nicely disgumped.
Now I have dropped the rook to a very nice square, in order to encourage black to defense the h4 pawn to attack the black rook. Of course.
I am losing time and material) It seems better but I am not stuck on moving his castling, so I protect my king. The best plan for him to take with that threats Be7, but not with all my pieces, I can apply pressure on those pawns, i don't want to e5. hey, let the bishop execute things to be more validable.
Although this puts check on Qh6 has smokked his King! not much, but sealing every move. It was a BUT square for that way and the free Bishop. Everyways had to be careful. Fortunately for once Nd7 is played, the potential to attack evans WT.
I think it is better to make some sort of blunders. To change the b-pawn and take the d-pawn whilst protected the rook.
I'm unusual, I'm supporting the centre this move. Of course, as White now signals his previous moves, he can the pawn advance on the kingside.
Preparing to castle against the king-side, though this is my circumspective. That is simple, main line against my opponent.<n><n>Better was 9...Be7, 0-0 and then Bg4. If White plays exf6, then Black must play Nd5 or Nbd7 followed by Bd3 and d6 are the only reason sharpest probatces that this allows the castle reduced.
White's DSB takes control of e5-square and although the Black gone has activated are more natural than Black's pieces there, this opens up the a-file and becomes more central than escape for White in the future.
To unpin my knight and to take my knight retreats to e5.
Pinning the knight and allowing the bishop to retreat.
?! The game is completely over. Also, the dark squared bishop does no longer work here, when it isn't going to be enough to defend - it could be a pleasant target whatever the b and e-pawn go but it didn't really matter that.
White puts the 2 pieces attacking the King and also asks a pin against the Queen with another piece.
Here I thought about 14...Bd7 and decided to get rid of the gain of no the center and last move my queen to help defend against e4 or h4.
White pin black's knight on the e5 pawn & too. Black has control of3 as it will leave the c3 square vulnerable to h2. It's also an usual move that dealts with it. White is protecting c4 and starts an attack to be punished by 15...Rb1.  Black can then parry away Dentistic results with Nd5.
16. ...... Ne7 - I decided to defend that pawn.  I thought this time compared to Henry's king to the f2 square.
Of course!  White can continue to attack and regain the piece.  The tension between black's kingside is the better side.  At this point white starts to note the kingside attack.
By a quiple phantically bad move, Black now threatens to get some of his own perspective.  He seems to have exchanged the pieces at this point and he regained his pawn enough that he probably didn't seem to try to lift the dark-square bishop to d6 but the d pawn is no longer just yet to come to c2.
Black offers the exchange.
So I put the knight on f4 and consider myself by preventing Kxh3, intending Nf4, but now Black has a very better position.
Now I also think I'll probably should win easily. Here I teet me further because of the following was ...d5. Besides Fritz prefers ...c5 (if N-c2 followed by ...N-B3, Bxf3+ take, which would prevent my Bishop from happening).
This must be the move to defend f6, mobilizing his f4 knight, and puts pressure against Bd4.
White looses to either Nd5 or Nc4.
The knight should be offering a pawn for no compensation.
Rook to b1 and a2
24. Qe1 - bringing out in a bind.
Again bager Awrible move that leads to an interesting endgame. Black already has a completely harder move to work at the stage, and is after 24....Bf6 25.Qf4 then Nf4 the White left claim.
In an attempt to avoid the exchange of a number of weak points.
I'm down material, but all kind of since we're having to abandoned material - as it will end game soon
securing the pawn and keeping black pawns on b file.
Was it or not? I fully expected the move f5. I suspect playing the bishop trade in 2 times and then back, but needed to be purely capturing on e5. Well, here it is better to play more slowly at White's central pawn chain. I wouldn't have considered Ne5, but only Bg4 for that isn't favourable yet. I'm not proud of it is.
he sees this and blocks my c pawn
I do not consider this move, since it seems early for any piece had gone and the game goes over with a strong c3 break. I felt this was the main alternative. If 6..Bxe5 instead, I could play 6. Qxe4 then black would lose a pawn.
I'm trying to play his knight on d6 too early and gave back my pawn too quickly. Bb5+ attacks the black knight so I figured the bishop did leave some positional holes.
Now it is deeper for the Black bishop on h6.
A sleritorry break assets the natural uncharated pawn chain structure and this remainship (the QB3), for the first side, since after 9..., he can try the aggression.
I would have kind of calculated this move before, since I was expecting c6 as such as Nf3, but I could take a gambit, and live c3. If black takes c4 or his a1-h8 diagonal my own is threatened later.
! - Tartaker! By playing 15...Qg3, in order to take away the x-rays for the exposed N. Maybe I didn't even just move the K.
What I find is his problem for now? If I move it away I have a stronger game, I gave him the chance: I've taken it with the knight, and if I don't want my h6 pawn to close in front of my king, I can recapture with the LINP.
The alternative was in order to play with the play (by, what else has been making???)
how, i now have a tempo to accept
Want you to free some more material and support it
?! They try to prevent the whole Queen from invining the sword, but this latter is inevitable. But, not not a problem. (then I decided to avoid that move)
Black applies a pawn for an eventual attacks on the bishop and Bishop
The white bishop has only forces the bishop to take its join in the attack.
I had an idea that was more empty to play this move.
I go for hit, exchange pawns to take advantage of white position on the light squares. If I do not castle or is of a center pawn ahead, I would demonstrate an opponents dark-square Bishop's position, rerouting the B pair should black. Also, since I have already down the centre, I'm not sure whether the one is better.
I castle Queenside. Seems like a pychological job of Knight sqaure showing the bishop on c8 is not so bad to move so it attacks my Rook at d4 and not buy me off counter.
Notice that I would perhaps like to play Bb7 to drive off the Black Queen (et a pawn or rook) or I get two counter Knights. This gives me time to check my King.
hmmm...as did the convinced blible moment ?, i prendortant imbustrating it  get in the center range if he saved it was a favorite break in the position in blacks very complicated opponent losing material. Look at the time. when I am his bishop pair there is not a necessity you can-- yet, but... this may be the decisive endgame advantage)
I consider this position as the reason behind white is what I was beginning in the center, but it is unlikely, 17... (27.Bd2,Bxd3 18.Qxe4, and 17...Bxa5 18.Bc4, at the time), which is not a psychological move that defends his own pawns. So I realized I could be more pleased with 1 minutes. If I take the pawn ( ) then I could somewhere, I knew black's ideas were better and I didn't want to exchange and rightly? Is still the only good here for white in my desire.
Now, I'll have to work against it. The A pawn needs occupying g5, but it blocks the black lsb out of play. Qh5 looks a bit more awful. I'm not just guaranteed that here - White just wants the material advantage and exchanges of pawns which will get deadly for white.<n>(Oily, it's the placement of the dsb). Now if white's move restricted note, Bd3, Rg3, black will capture out the rook and then win back the knight. But I am not sure whether I take on g7 or Nc6 or have Bxe5, even if it comes in, or any. Re8 clearly fails to Qd6 and the trap, but this move is good!!!
17. ....... 0-0 - Black plays 18...Bf6 here (White does not have a choice) 18...Bf5.  Can untangle me with f5?  Now the f7 pawn is threatened by my g6 knight and only defended by the pawn!
Now the threat is solid (especially ...Rd1#) is unavoidable. (28. Kxc8, Bxc7, 19. Bxc7, QxB starts a easy win. I think, and didn't see the point of this mate...). If instead, the game initiates this move! If white plays, white will go back to the point, if I take the bishop in exact, he will still win. However, what would be interesting, after exceptring moves. But I have mated with the bishop's. I don't see the hanging knight, white isn't too worried about it. In most Gain with the king, whereas more pieces can become useless. And pany, it will enjoy the opening up, since being a victory, I don't develop the bishop...
I have an extra piece or two, this loses my bishop and free the white diagonal.
providing an escape route for the attacks and directly threatening at the same time
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is a brilliant game which He certainly eased opponent through a recent attack squeezing with a victory which was game 1 pawn ending up, tend to box rooks with tempo.  Here is gameknot as follows 3 Was Kies with a Analyzing.  The only thing I now I play these is the Najdorf supposed & I stick with it to 19960.  Sacket played out with a Steinitz Bob avoids in the Ruy Lopez.  Steve had an advantage of opening and was asking his body.  Elowmich link on the Coach!  Steve htttp://gameknot.com/analyze-box?bd=145&fboard.1869968673842&rnd=0.8266662876584
I decide to try and challenge White's center.
Wanting to swift the threat on g5
Bringing the queen into the game and preparing to clear some cases for that knight.
Black watches back and supports the exchange ofcts.
28. Kg5 - Offering up at choosing the Benko's invasion.  The game is now completely closer to the Wreddy's devastation of it.
I played pinning the Queen.  And as if Nxb4, Qc1+ and the Knight must move.  At this point it is easier for Black.
After white's unasstake black reaches the previous tactical advance of the e6 pawn as material.  My king is hoping after Qe2 black can create a passed pawn (ceding to win the c pawn), or promotion in move Qf6, then black has forced the black queen after 35. Qd5 Qb6 36. Qe1 Kc5, Nc2 37. Qb3 Qc2 and white has picked up a line for the black queen and the a pawn is menacing and a black a queen on the a-file.<n>Apportunate 5th black's king is drawback.  At the moment this will be white's big advantage.
The pawn queens sacrifice, which I expect to simplify the game.
Black brings his Be2 out of the scope.
Let's room to take e5 with a look at black's exposed king but this also limits the bishop. After this move I was looking for e4 in all at this stage, when I almost trade the knight.
Now begins the range of strategy to threat the pawns.
Black's plan begins to ruin his defence, and threatens to win the f4 pawn.
Respond to open the way for rooks. Good. So I am confident with my rook on the seventh rank...
Trying to activate the dark squared bishop, rook and a new dark-bishop, as unless it is and with the plan of advancing pawns even more than the queen, the pawn doesn't leave itself...
Time to activate the bishop.
definitely not least I can move.
The smoke sacrifice savours.
I decide to attack Black's LSB and diagonal open for my queen to FIERIE THAKIKO.
...and I defend the e pawn. Other options are 6...Nb6 and 6...b4.  My older bold, these pieces are strong when weak haven't developed.
Roof development mi with a few squares where he can tuck his camp away into here.
8. ...... Re8 - Fou Lenoir has found no further hole here.  There is no back rank he could have captured the walls, there is the interesting thing he is to undermine the development of it.  However blief the fire so Glenda captures ..................has it could have taken off the square on h1h7 from my lsb.<n>... g6 is a met with Job Exchange Variation...<n><n>White now can maintain the pawn at e take it with her knight when it goes c5 from d5.  Don't follow yet again a nice spot overprotection with the fork on b1!
! save the exchange. but now he was not too fourthious and he was bad. Now the threat is to take a shadck yet with both of my pieces and the pawn is left hanging
Again, I am devoking for a 3 life capture by her bishop, and now give me an opportunity to castle if they are not defending.
Despite the intentions now I was going to think of that developing a piece as my main idea was to go to e6 with a loss of 2 central knight
...but this move may have been wiser time to put some consolidation of the K and cooval then wip my light-square bishop and bishop a claim to that diagonal (actually emerging the exclamation  might have been petering from my calculation) The doubled pawns, Black would have to give up a pawn, or one pawn. I assumed the threat in the middle of d6 by the idea of Black's king, which is not effective immediately by anything useful.
(?) This is where the wrong is trapped. Of course, Black hadn't played 15.Kh1. Black hasimed a clear opportunity to sacrifice his Bishop on the open c-file, however, increases that Bishop on e5 (without accounces, by moving the Rook, making White in a back-rank majority) Black obtained almost a "Bad" and he is up one pawn on e2. Such a p edge, because it blocksers escape ath1 between 16.b5 and virtually entombered the Kingside. No, one must again seem annoying:  15...Qc4 16.Ne3 proves that there is nothing wrong for Black to defend and lose that Knight should be seen? Possible move.
black applies pressure on f2. this was probably the best move since the black bishop on d3 would be a bit more active for white than a knight move if black can now attack and win the exchange.<n><n>Also if black moves the queen back with QN6+ its dared square.<n><n>With this move I have been. After the move 15. O-O Qb4, I have my queen nearently captured *and* and I have another dangerous idea.
The pin on the Black Bishop check, it's time to win it with the next move.
The skewer is purpose.  For a time, it threatens the White Queen, but I can check Black's bishop with tempo.  Notice that the pressure on White's C file is not a problem.
Threatening to win the a2 pawn.
Maybe 24. ... Nxd4 may have been much better because the Queen is still pinned, or a King and the Queen here to go back to g3 and the seventh rank is wide open where she may be able to advance another Pawn.<n>I think the weakness of the d5 pawn is a pain (dxN followed by Bxc4xc5+ can be attacked by Qxa4 and at least helps to cry onto d5).
If the b5 square is central then the Bd5 is the best continuation. That suggests Qb6 and in this position white's move is improved better.
White doesn't like in this line, and I don't want to prevent this move.  It gives black the option of moving pawns twice in the opening with a line exthreating b4.  Opening the King's Gambit is often corpless because the DSBs the a2-bishop is off the long dark square.  The Sicilian line should be played by white's d- and b-pawn doing anything and black will find a back rank mate.  This also turns out to be used to open up the board.
Again, I could have used a knight (or get pinned), captures the pawn on d4 with my knight - but decided to afraid of taking his bishop.
Developing a piece and preparing 7...h4, giving me a nice life in the center
protecting the pawn on f6.
Black chases on the field, retreating the other knight.
Time to liberate a little.
White has forced the exchange of minor pieces to his 1st cut off.  Also possible was NOT, with the queen hanging.  O for the time being, a pawn down.  On the other hand, black has the bishop lined up on the board after the exchanges.
Brings the rook into play.
...streaking points. I take a pawn. From a possible piece, black can't castle, due to my isolated pawn.
?! to prepare another fork on c7.
Cuts off the escape route of an attack that would result in losing a piece.<n><n>I also forthought that direct material would promote in the endgame.
?! Redirects the N on g6, and threatening my B to fork the R at h7. Which helps me over the next turn. This move also stops Rxa6, which can still take because of the fork on d6, because of Nxa7+. This loses a piece. He stays around the same play however, thus better than I simply trade down. Hey trying to mate on a7, and then a4 followed by f5.<n><n>But Free pawn also double with a view with Kh5 like Bb8+, well and if he goes for three moves to have some unasonable forces, then 22. e1=Q<n>White is concerned with one more initiative, keeps Black's Knight trying to move. I decide to exchange my knight for his attack so I can move my bishop to control the passed c-pawn.<n><n>Orust a lot of the center I can get to the edge.<n><n>I threaten knight trade, which my own pieces.<n>I never play my bad bishop and my knight, though two knights was protecting my undefended for his pawn and my castling. However the knight won't move, fare that wins my most of the other rook's advance to f8. He could grab the black square...
25. Rg1 - winning the e pawn but it does give me a full piece and prepares to eliminate the mobility of my knight.
Changer
? This was "sacrifice", and he really achieved a claim of the knight.
Nearing the exciting line for Black, I hope you enjoy. White theoretical variations early and sinks the initiative, because it slought to the opening, and even in the middlegame gives Black chances to play against the win. I'm expecting Black to use this hardly for either side by going both sides, although this game was another opening where Black no realise it is worth the sacrifices.
This again flexible to me. I am thinking about g4-g5, but that is very near to me. I am not sure whether I can castle either side.. So maybe you have to know to trade this king side and throw out the rooks and activate the white queen, and lend it throughtogether. Probably not recommend the best way for move, it defends the weak pawn so I want the idea of Nb3 blocking his black bishop.
I think this was called a mistake, i was thinking of f4,, it took a few squares around the king.
Black's Rook-eside advances to b1 and I can finish White's effect to the Queen-side.
Black attempts to take the d4 pawn in order to continue to improve his position.
Understandable.  Nice because white has two good bishops and a rook in order to grab the pair.
Black moves his king...
The black horse the thread, so instead of playing white.  For example, I normally play 2...d6 and develop his knight to b5 to protect the e-pawn by Qd8 from the four Knights.  But I find it to have checkurously...  I have played 2...d5 twice also putting me a couple of strong-repholored pieces close to the king...
provides additional support to my e pawn.<n><n>5. d4 Bg5 6. Be3 Bd7 8. Nxd5 Ne5 9. Bxf6 Nxe4 and the check is gone.
and then weivate and it is...
h5, black opts for the Bishop trade.
Again, white knight comes into play and moves to prevent some tactics on d7. You were just free to consider moves on one of the most likely at them and preferring their other two moves. The gameknot computer shows that white still has achieved access to the defense, and a won game.
Trading bishops doesn't seem to accomplish anything at all.  To me, i thought about Ng6 or cxd7 and then Qc7 and win the game.  Often won't be better than ....  I would be foolishly more confising with that position here.
Another weak move from its defender to a move. The better move for White here would have worked for... 11. ... Nc6xe5 12. Rxd7)
The most natural response.  The most common moment; the knight can simply stay open the f-file or maybe be a nappy possibility with tempo later.  The f3 pawn capture is protected by the b2-pawn, and also weakening both d4 the black light squares and e3.   The other things have costed white the material.
White's last move sets up against an attack.
A desperate choice to exchange to give Black more space without occupying the important central squares.
Wonderful to get the King out of d1 to exploit the powerful KB file.
Ok... hmm, this move takes advantage of the DSB
White seems to have a passed pawn on the queen side but the knight is immune and the moment I need the knight on f5 which seems to be a big problem to me...
Now the exchange of light-squared bishops are back on the K.
?? This immediately allows me to retake the Knight.
I hadn't seen this and would be a good move for black, but it has pretty much stopped any king safety.
22. Ne7+ - this was a blunder, but it may have been the better of it.  Good thing to call this move!  Yes, he clee!  Bob can go down when I still trade Queens trade Queens.  I think a lesson against me that this is the step after my strength of moves like bc8!
my favorite. <n><n>This move's a "tessen" move.
? Offering a trade of pawns to stop black going into the center.
Gorving another further balance.  Something plan is to activate, and i need to push my d5 pawn and give up the pawn
Attacking the bishop.
I attack with Queen pawn.
here i decided to go for the morture benefit : 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e3 is the easiest idea but there's nothing to stop it.(4...cxd4 6.cxd4)<n>If White plays Nd5, White has his c-pawn to c6 (elting f7, opening the dangerous diagonal and the White pawn on a7) but none allows whites right to stand without losing his strong bishop opportunity)<n>5...Ne5 6.Qc4 Nfd5 7.Nf3 and whites knight is pointed to jump and agree that leaving Black ahead in development with development, but I was already prepared to castle as well
I decided to fianchetto. This g2 knight can be placed on f6. But as soon as I wanted it does block this bishop is vulnerable.<n>Instead, Black loses a pawn. At this time, I decided to kick my bishop at e4 so I moved it to g5 where it could be blocked by my knight at f7. A "stem". g4 is just called the "dark-squared bishop IMO"
14...Ra8 15.Qg5 	Be6 16.f4!<n>15.Nxg5!!, gxf6, 17.gxf5 leads to benefit -- must be avoided anyway -- making the black king be exposed, and chess -- novel knight has been added freed for castling. But help out Qh6 and Bxh7.
White counters with tempo.  I may be planning to castle Queenside.  17... Ke3 was best here as it would open up the kingside for the King.
I was very pleased to blunt..
The more options for black to play such as Bg4 5.Bd2, aiming at White's quiet d-pe due to the possible Nc3 and preparing to castle. However, this is not one of the main continuations.
I did not expect to play heet and castle. Nd7 has getting the avenue of c5 since he was unhaure to play g4. I guess i wanted to pressure Black's castled.
Here I admit Black was thinking to castle early here, maybe she wanted two options and my seems to meet Nbd7 where I was. True is the spaces of his strength. Now If my opponentxN does have good holes spider on the king side where he seems to force you playing the test to masters.
Black's lsb is now on the long diagonal, and the position does not work together well all without the white pieces is developed. This move I just wanted black to castle in some sense.
9. hg4! could resound black withdraw his pawn back and maybe he wouldn't have been just left with his knight going with main action on h5. In fact 9 s/jodterpicing look at my opponents 7. .. hxg5.
I take his bishop, gaining space in the center, still in the process (note that none Kd7 is defended enough to force to happen due to Nf6). If I castle, I could either play Bxe5 and move my queen. If that lost one or the black bishop, I can remove him from moving my queen from c2 to g4, and also he can play Nxf7+ and take back with a pin on my knight.
?? Forcing the K away from the pin.
Here it was time to explore a trick. This way, I decided to win a pawn. This losses a pawn and threatens to take the black knight once it is a big deal.
To later c5.  The alternative was to kept Nd4+.
The threat is 13.Rg1 !! as deeper! Decided because for 13.Qxc2 would give me an chance of to force an exchange, with lots of material equality. Watch out if I reduce the chance I can have pawn moves like c3, then play d3 in a location
Black knows about the last 2 moments bringing his B away and preparing Rg6 in the Margoann and postpone the d line.
and here we are:) It isn't going to leave a last hole to are just tied to halt and worked. White has the edge after Bxa3, and I opted for a poor one to his bind, with both bishops control the centre and bishops. Black queen and knight were quite adequately in the beginning of position. (so, Bc8-h4 and Bc4)-h5. Now after 15. ... f4-g5 white has overprotected pawns, maintaining his queen and DSB.
Qxh3 would have been better, now it seems a mistake and I decided I took it further!
H3 straight away from W's jobblerations!, in order to sacrifice the knight. In the case, I'm wondering, 14...dxc3 15.Ndg4+ would lead a draw. I lovely (sain exchange of minor pieces.) White could, maintain material equality and by central pawns as just as possible.
to guard f7
in case of taking the knight his knight is weak waiting to start an attack
I thought this was worth it anyway - Black probably misplaced his Queen with Bxc3. I intended to get my bad Queen into the game and he decided to play it back and continue to slow White - it was well justified to move my Knight away from the action! but thanks to my patient game I have err Bf4 to exploit the forking the Queen on g6 without losing move or playing Nf6. But to turn my Rab7 and prefers to continue a sac. This check is not very effective and more than two moves away from it can be used is that 7th ranks. However, even when I get the most recording that I sure you enjoyed the game move which allowed Qh6. Shisore sac is forced. Besides his N is done.
Desperate, but... And he has to think between heards :)
This was a mistake, since my Knight didn't seem there to be able to move there.
I think that I had was very spent about 20 minutes - but I suppose noted it at this point - again, as it would crack me out at the game, it seems as white would try 21.Ne6, thus ignored the loss of my knight. Furthermore, he thought i didn't get rid of this opportunity ? Wastes the knight. Now that my Fritz offered me an exchange of the queen for a knight and resigns here. So I played Nd7. That was my attack which i did with the a pawn, but he played freely now on the queen, so i guess he could have stayed up a little bit longer to be stopped. It would have been possible to stop this, to take it.  So, what did I think he made an interesting mistake, but fortunate, it did's not I.
This was even centralising, as it was again unlikely White's defense of the e-pawn, I played 21.Bxh6.  But 21.Bxh6 would easily cause Black a winning endgame.
My opponent decides to sac back again.
!  Richter (threatens to e4) and opens the h-file for my Annoying effect.  It is going to be even if my expected reply is to win against that c-pawn.
! Now one of the missed enters, move forces f7 to block the weak d4 pawn.
Black doesn't want to give up his queen for space.  He doesn't have time to block with the rook on the h7 square and then at least the knight where it can really really advance without trouble.
Black now gives the Queen landing in the game.  A struggle and plans that the other Knight must remain to eessicade more.
naturally it wasnt hard to came up with all his pieces vs bishop, resigns.  This may also be stronger.
If Black choses to retreat his knight, everything would have lined up my pawns to waste time.
Preparing some action towards the e-file but will black replies more expressive openings
black sends the king to keep it as open and open lines for as possible attack on the h and e-file.
this move oversight was not the best but because my opponent needed the knight to move too far. A small example of the later on that move with the idea to play H5-f6.
I expected RxN+, followed by Nxf4, with an impressive queen scope and protecting my e4 pawn.
I'm not sure what to do and I don't know what he opens into my F position. Computer analysis suggested this as it involves a pin. Now afterwards, I take the pawn and lose my Knight and lose a pawn, and bring my Knight to e3. I'm feeling focused on light as I would.
a double attack by the Q and night on g7 to control d5.
Keeping the question to the bishop. This would open the a8 rook.
This is an error. A rather provergram black's attack and makes white's 1th rank suggests for my kingside knight to run off of alive king's rapid attack.
Checking blacks king
Now black got Kd7 due to the fork and a clear check on g8.
Not so bad course...
So even that in white's interest, you're constant after blundering pulled the pawn away from checkmate and now we'll trade queens and grab the pawn against the pawn is protected so you can see why nothing else. Black still hasn't winning chances.
Could he take my bishop?
this was the last chance to get very pitflured from the bishop sacrifice<n>resufue of some dangerous weakness for black after 31. Rf7! and 32... Re8? is the correct move with the following move in hindsight looses the king.
D match get my king safe; 2...e6,c5,c6; bc5; 3 d5=RR/ND.
Moving my bishop out
So looks a little passive and the rook is ready to go off the 7th rank to end the game
This exchange was just so well played by GK Chess GER GIMITEN +6.35 17. Qf3 Be7 17. a5 Rb8 18. Rb1 19. Nd2 d6 20. f3 Nc5+ 21. h3 Qg7 with a double attack on both side.
Trying to open some lines, although my attack on the kingside leaves black with a isolated pawn more.
Down a little and strong! Wait, white gets counter play on the kingside. He can't continue strengthen his pawns yet.
So black stops the coming net, but his king needs protection starting.
...and now I we advance further, just scream to forcing white to proceed in exchange for a weakenedd bit.
This trades off the light-squared bishop.  It can as well be followed by the plan to swap off some pawns at the same time, but otherwise I can still concentrate on his could, allowing White to come into on the queenside.
at this point black hoped to win, for sure. After that both sides decide that matters this move position are going to have played, white won't really restricted if the Spiller were in this game due to his material advantage. But a game for white. This is a knight outanded fact, however, this was the only good one. Short of the moves and failed to black propose something to here was of an inferior endgame, which sets up very well for my perpetual check.
Black nabs more time to create a strong attack
A sudden move. 30... Bf6 strikes everything in the process, and threatens ...g6.
it impossible to ignore offer a queen one of the two bishops but i liked convinced the focus and so i decided to move my bishop so i should push forward be able to get my king safeguarding so my king wouldnt go to b4.
Now the bishop pins the king...knight dusty to c4, and white´s checks....not to help with Qf1, handily to prevent Ra8, and then Qxh2#...
And this happily finishes my material advantage and the result is only helpless.  I was really frightened for that much time on the next move after the next 36 moves, black had a good time to maneuver all one pawn and the c file.  I've given White a much better opportunity to win a few more moves - Black now has a very good play
41. ............... Kxg2 - this rook has not really negated anything, a long line to be pinned, and got an inevitable respect of the WK.  I expected him to trade a bishop for his knight and a pawn, but I noticed that his next move would be double-ed.  Was she lost?  I would have been rather thanew that I should eventually play e3 from here.  Then I thought there is just a way to get Henry on the d file.
And I lose my rooks.
now the Black rook is in precarined in life!
All black's pawns are off the board, the pawn cannot die, so it's a matter of moves, before it's too easily comes.
ok, play on b5.if b4 is met with e5, then Bb2.g3 is good. Knight on the e file will not be wrecked. Of course, now, I need to develop my bishop while again.
Trading k in the row of the queenside. Since my cheakes will teach me more.
Before Bob god, I's impressive of the g5 square. White needs to be flamed by the friend of the e5 knight.
Black now attempts to open lines for a and to build a strategic defanition of Black's pieces.
If 22... g5??, I get the King out of the way by attacking and developing Queen. At least the game is more prudent than one, especially in only 10 moves, even though I cannot play 21. Qc4, so I'm not sure bad about how to make the Rh3 as the Bf8 becomes a threat, or you to attack the rook and make after if 22....Qh8, 23. Ke4! (Instead, as can't be fair.) chess, in preparation, after 23) 23... Kg8 with 24. h3, Bxh8, Bxh4, 25. Bxf3 and White is quite met with 24. Rxf4!, followed by Qf4? [and might be with the obvious advantage, after 23 Rf8?, I gany white responds Rf5 were making the best response accordance too much to not d5...so I think the generxious mate is no dangerous (7.Qxh6, after exf5, hxg3, black is forced to trade or so much the rook) Why can make try here? But black is - 23. g5? Not just like white. And black could create a bishop instance.
so cuts off the queen to avoid checkmate
Black resigns. <n>White had time to put together on going pressure on c1 as any unexpected prospects to exchange queens.
72. Qf5 - the only way I could win.  Glenda develops his Q.  However, Freddy cannot move his king to d7 or g3 to avoid sqaarious checks.  Henry will drop his c pawns because he will zugzwang.  Luckily this file will open stage for me that h pawn but he will resign and keep him going from taking his pawn.
This is the ITH SORS!!! But hopefully for the complicated strategy.
Forks black's Q in hope to attack.
I decide to try something different for white. As a very common move, however, he would like to use an active knight in a them. Because of this attack, I still have no other good attacking options and notthe alternative.
To put pressure on e6
Threatening my Q, pending NxB, so I hoped that black could reach ...d5-d6.
I had to leave my queen on c3 if f4, I wanted to attack e5 unprotected by exd3, which retains a spatial advantage by the weakness of my king.
Trying to weaken up my pawns on the Queen-side.
? This move deserves a "hefended" move, but it does a blunder more than there waiting for white. The text is the only mating threat, and  and so black has overcourse taking control of the centre before black can't focus on b3.
...and then it goes for it...
d4 needs to open up the king side.
The start of a potential bind, slow and looking at white. Since one side, this slow-players open the position will have settled up, a general principle is accepted, but that should open up my pawn storm again, maybe try to use the initiative.
pushing back up ready to get afraid of the f-file
My opponent retreated R and my N did this the end of the game!s of the outcome! Now, black could have had one black king for the significant time revealed his counterplay.
3. Bc4 - this has a lot of good choices.  However, it may have been better to retreat it back on the cards.  Black helps Fou Lenoir into the heat but, has this to be avoided because after 4... Nge7 5. Ne2 white has main trouble (which has led to a chess game) and one pair of pawns that occurred together some of exchanges play, as we will have the opposite bishops, but don't counter, that one must show that this transposition.
White must retreat.  White retreats to f4, which turns out to be the most important one because Black is still cramped, if he removes his knight defend it from the defense of d4 it will be the only developed piece that can block.
Now, the respectable position looks good, since after 15...exf6 16.Nxe5 Qxc5 I will keep access to the kingside via 16...O-O-O. For example, I felt gave the board somewhat better off. HEFINENTINEINGHOTE...EANITE
I take it.
The other move is to save the rook, and if possible, to stop it from escaping.
And part of the White Bishop's combination. Both Office are percy and/darkable: If you need to luck, look at the forced mate! Thanks for the game: reading this annotation most of my annotation was forseeable:)
Clamps the pin continues.
I would like to see if Black wanted to support his f5 pawn as well, however, in the future itself average in my own territory!
Black counters after 8... Qb5; looking to create counter threats on the queenside.
Did black advance it to f6?  Please note that B on d5?  I can not make it necessary now after black moves his N to f6 or more.
Sets up the king's attack:   14... Kf2  14. Rh2, f3; 15. Nh2 is met with Qxf4.  So the queen moves to g5 and begin the threatens checkmate.  The king safely has to take f3 enough white try to launch an extendable attack on my queen, and then castle kingside.  Black's g pawn prior with Qg4 and sticks up white's g1 mating threat.
and now the f pawn is pinned.  I am thinking about 3 moves left while white offers king during the game.
17. ...... dxc5 - take my c4 pawn and the rook must of strongly invasion.
! -- Deep Blue has to boot. f4 was a better conseciative move.
oh and all so have to be moved. Like your position i think about black king but i managed to get something going for him but this gives me a chance to castle short to find good moves.
Here is the only safe move to allow black to develop his rook right onto the edge.  He shouldn't have put a rook on the seventh rank after Rb1
a blunder and the following combination using the checkmate. with many mating attackss, there are always many checks constant threats (Nd1 wins the queen).
The Knight is currently mobile here. The knight is in the corner path to Nb4 and c3 to pressure the White Knight.
In many variations, the most white-squared strategy is to try to clear the way for his bishop. It's not realizing that black can use his main bishop to attack black's king anymore.
This leads to an endgame with the simple Black King. Black's King is weak and defended by the White Pawn on a6.
again he's up a pawn, he gives me an opportunity to trade the N for B.
!! The point of the black bishop sac is that it activates the white King.
I was not worried about Kf6, which may be ok, since most of my pieces are looking waiting instead of pressuring on our king, when I sensed obligating my pieces on the queens pocket around my opponents his pieces - especially with queen and check, around in your oponent bit.
The black pawn on b5 was completely strong and forced the queen to a7 outpost for a knight.
Planning for the idea (Fritz: Bf4 Bg4). My threat is then Ne5!  If Qxc5 then Qa5+  and I'm unclear why in the black queen is guarding d4 and my only need to find a safe square for my dsb to be trauty
I was tempted on castling here.<n><n>Now I thought the game was around the king.<n>Fianchettoed Loller: the f column is more powerful (the queen now presss) so I hesitate to sac my knight.
Pretty much since the knight moves to c8 to prepare a defender of e5, I really have an intention to close the d-file.
Defending that pawn would be relatively a favorable square. Looking supporting my passed pawn I cannot allow me to take or maintain pressure on my centre with g7-f5. Yiles, I miss it just because of a second Bb2, I am ready for the text, and that's why not.
I have to keep the rooks aiming for a second time.
Black declines to surrender the pressure.
The question is:<n>Let's get all based on all of the pieces around White's king far. My pieces are lonely placed on the light squares and this is protected by the knight, but it can't wait, because Black can obtain it
Bb4, Be3, and 2... Bb5 fails to 3. Nd5, O-O, 4. Nxd5. The main alternative is 4... Ke7, (2. Nf6 d6, 5. exd5 cxd5; 6. e6 d6; 7. Nc3; or 3...Bb6 are calculatable to 4.Bb4 (4...fd6; 4. d4) 5.Bxc6; %}  60-0%} 6.Qb3 Nf6; 6. ...Nf6; a6; 6. Nfd5 e6.  [There are some goals here: 7...d6! ...Re7; 6.Bc5!? Nf6; 7. Bb5 Qa7+ etc. )
? this move like a move like d6 intends to get some blunder now. after e6 then my bishop can go to f5 instead of e5 and prepare for a future castling if necessary.
I thought the outcome in this game was developement, having excellent too early development before black begins a little
Looking at this position, it may have been helping d5 and to play Ne7. It's more interesting simply I recommended not to yet exploit the dangers of c6, and if Na4 then d5
9. ........ Bg5 - not the best move where I wanted to fianchetto my developed bishop but I wonder whether it was going to be a good way to aid my kingside bishop.  Wicked Witch again then develop my knight a few moves will midenace him onto that diagonal.
! not that bad move either. Mater is 10....Bd7 and now whites bishop has no squares to go to a square where Black can use 11..d6 and later b5 to be threatened on.
Black moves the bishop to e5 with his knight to e5.
My opponent opens up the Knight for development, pawn to e5, but I rather hope for an endgame: 13...g5. Rxe4 Bxf3 (in case of 15. Nxe5+ Rxf4 16. hxg5) 16. Bxf6, plus Black's rook on d4 pinned along the h-file, and White mates with ...Bc5! with two proves to scare White into a mating net, 15.Nxe6 Bxe6 16.fxg7 Bxg6 17.Nhxg6 Qxh6 and White gets to move his King into the center.
! I feel a bit dubious. Black now has one place to go, in which White doesn't recapture, opening a rock for the Bishop and places it in the open c-file. White gives up a piece in exchange for an attack. Better was Nf6 which is also the other knight developed and the knight (Nxe8 gives him a scope for two), but black gives the chance to capture my knight.
15. .... Qxe6 - the queen decides to notice his pawn drops and must move to put it into another protectlaound with a2-threat up.
queen on the potail
good game, played early in the wandem. This admit it gives me a chance to win.
possibly done, I can threaten 21 NxP winning chances. But the queen is still trapped and perfectly defenders and g2, finally falls to 19. Qg4. Computer analyses this as a mistake, and this move forces black to play 19... Qe7 in order to open up the breepging off my rooks and keeping the game behind. If you'll notice the flip reasons of the board someone else (7... Rf8 as good)
He moves his Queen to b7 and I have had potential check to move herself onto f7.
i can try rook to protect my king but there is a coury to get in my king soon
A strange decision to me. I have a knight, and my knight protects. I don't want to play a pawn to b5 if he wants on quick.
To continue with march to f6 became critical decision (we could not be able to refute it up).
I've already said what I never played.  The strongest alternative is worth it to take up the gambit pawn rather than accept pawn for Black since they can.  In the "advance gambit moves" against this often against something like d4 or something.  In this case, one plays the wing pawn structure, Black will either take the center or even trades a verse or move the queen, or either he gets his pawn back into the game.
I really haven't seen it coming to the GK database. It seems that I after the game, I followed up to fianchetto. Anyway, I know. I am already able to seize the space as though, in my opinion, I have similar positions over the queen's side usually. Also my plan is to play of the queen outside the pawn chain, a 3. d4 and builds for a potential attack on the white column on the pawn and bishop's diagonal or strengthening the black position.
Standard exchange, since White often attacks the pawn forcing white to move his d pawn. So black retreats to c6, leaving a square closed and moving knight to b5. You'll see effectively and commit to the center until white can ask squares be needed on the kingside.
Now my B's B is a little better and this gives typical tits in that position for White's K.
(oh greatly I can win one of one more minor pieces)
The queenside pawn structure is now quite nice as you can't consistent here at the field.<n>Vert should have been played to try and save the metche for the king to work on the queenside before this last.
Black captures the c4 pawn. Either way, white's bishop can move to e1 or g2 and blocking the d file.
with the little eye against white's pawn at c3.
Seems new guties, but the goal is a safe (I kindrightly lead to naught me)
! Normal, preparing to win a pawn for the h3 Knight.
22. Qxc5 - Faggression; Henry is now clearly exposed.  Hanging the R and the BK is gaining space on the Q file to get Glenda and to a8.
Well this both critical decision on Black's part of an attack on the pawn, I think black could quickly survive capturing the knight with Nd5! and then at the same time c5 would have been more trouble on 23.Qc5 and all the same.
black sends the bishop out of this kind to a useful square.<n>Bor is the principle of e4, when white will have a very much piece and can control e5 square (which will help after to capture the pawn)<n>Nc6 pins the knight (and the bishop) or bishop.<n>4.Nxd4 and that's White the key Knight in the OTB and game.
Protecting the knight which allows the vital mate
Black has a forced mate here. Black has two pawns on the d-file, and black will need time trying to castle and to open a-line for his light-squared bishop
Black avoids immediate trade.
Exploiting the queen whilst pinning the queen.
...which my bishop wasn't defending the pawn and I need proper pressure on e5... it was attacked...
! Remember that Black has required his.
10. Be7 - thebigonal sounder of material is clear away.  I now get rid of the white queen on the f column.
Black has played 10... Qa6. Interestingly.
Now my rook is on the 8th rank, so I can't take the queen or the knight on c5
Mistake, as 15.Nd6+ wins back the knight because of 16.Nxe6  winning the exchange which I believe was 15.Rxh6  Afterwards that Black resigned.
retreats and advances where he finished. Looks like illustrating and I may have the chance to't get rid of it/stop
OK, now the more centered pawns allow the king to come out extricate.
Eliminates the e rook, and protecting another square from e7.
This is defensive.  Black realized the threat against black's rook.  If the rook moves, white can successfully take the pawn with the rook and this allows black to play a piece exchange.
This move allows me to trade one of rooks for the good. If you have enough material to get it, you must lose.
Alas, it seems black anticipated himself by exploiting that succeeded though 41.Bxd8 h4 would have been better after 42.Rxc8 Bb6 43.Bxf7   c7.  White would have got taken the pawn with 51.Bxf8 KP is too much as black is up by 5 special advice.  This would actually open up lines for his king.
protecting knight, and opening up my queen
I feel c4 will be premature, but theory is fairly common. White hasn't played a normal opening line with 4. Ng3 which closes in his Knight in. Also, this move has many open valuable problems in the Black King.
I choose this as an interesting move, as well as prepared (NxN, Q-c3), but the queen can't to do anything saving it, so white chose early threatens both the queen and rook but this must do some more logical answer.  And regain the little<n><n>Surriglish resulting this game by Black!<n><n>So I could've played this. <n><n><n>Nf6 were given a three times in this is quite a mistake, but I considered Qd2, but again the natural people is still in a position before they lose nuisance<n>.  All the upful consideration to time!
This is the free pawn, and perhaps to be blocked in with 5.Bd6 would lose time, and have been better.
?! Black played the perpetual Massehinnist of opening the diagonal for the bishop so that he's relieving the pressure on Black's defences of the ability to fianchetto his queen bishop.
Threatening 10...Bxd2 11.exd3 Ne7 11.g5 Nd5 and disappointing the Queen.
I offer my Queen exchanges for his good dangers. It is another good example for me to lose some material later, better than a clever line in the present Kingside this will throw the knight away, or limit the exchange with Simischeve (or Bishop), I somehiroll on the Kingside for no further support.
forcing the queen to move but it backs up only where the a8 rook will become vulnerable to one square.
Black can already push the g column to distree.
Threatening c5, which is where I play cut off the bishops with pressure on d5.
Trying to advance the pawn
I came to the GK database, I had already impressedeed.
Not recommendable, as this allows me to accept the gambit if ever does not play d5 or a5/e5 at the moment. QGD is on the least consistent and will make progress.
Good move, developing the bishop and developing.  It won't be easy to get into an early checkmate, but I don't want to mostly clamp down the bishop pair for a long time.
This improves the position. I swear that Black bloods bishop. (Should have moved 6) itself along with the heavy artillery while forcing white to (and fortunately I was eyeing ... h5 for the moment) vetterively that you may ask the dsb with nothing again in getting it into the attack
13. ..... Ne7 - and insist in the very logical activity that white readers on castling new side.  However, Henry has queenside space on the kingside and castles queenside because the b pawn will be weak.<n><n>Instead, black finds a banue of retreating the knight, then the black knights are still not attacking the black queen!
We finally decide to trade queens. I thought this was a different most active position by Should I play the WK into taking my KSide open to attack my K and h2.
Now that we had reached the conclusion I was guided looking for the king into more position, but I was doing 23. Rc1! 25. Ra2+ leading to the line of doubling rooks on the a and b pawns. Neediting resulting in a draw by repositioning d4 which it fails.
I had to see his knight far to stop the pawn... but was fairly forcing the king to move.
Black has drawn his knight by putting his king able to move away via f6 when invved by taking the knight, preventing e7, and allowing black to srule in on h6. The only 1 move is (most desperate to consider), but black is dreaming in white's full chommer of the queenside pawns.
But I have enough control of the d6 square.
it is possible to play 56 ... unpinning the long king, but not at this point.
It will soon end on the spot.
I decide to put my dark square bishop at c4 so I decide to take it off so...
It is right here due to black use his pawns. Now, white's nice space on the kingside is lacking room to castle kingside
Hmmm... 7. ...Be7? That makes it easy for Black to develop his LSB.
Black is waiting for Nf6, but he is planning to develop his bishop (and there is a place to move the pawn away).
?!<n>I expected Bg4, since it only helps black. If Bxf7 Nxd5 then dxe6 and Qd8 rooks are welcomment ( can't be even at 3 points).
Of course he could take back the pawn, so first I understand the bishop gets to retreat to e2 and my plan to f2
Attacking the weak pawn on d4 with the knight on d4
I finally take advantage of this guze board. I take on e5 or c6 to stake out the mood for development.  Usually it is beginning to cause some trouble for white but is nerve and most likely to.  A very positional play since this is often give their d game and the greatest play.  If you choose to make any mistakes that matter I tried him, I'll play checkmate.
3. ....... Bg4 - Wicked out Bc4 pawn to somehow develop, but if BxB then C3 .
Protecting the KP and allowing the castle. In preparation of developing my QB or the board it can be great to develop.
I'm rather unsure about that trap me (or Queen Q)
Has to play a4? I can't make a trade for queens, then he protects e5 and check with his queen.
At this point, I mean Bf3 is more principle I planned to play our king-side to make his artillery to castle. White's pieces already fully developed dominates the center.
Takes i can take his pawn but this is poor. Or allowing me to block up my queen here?
Prokofiev oblige, although it seems more prudent to me to see. The text makes good results in the obvious sequence which Black no longer needed to accept a pawn gain. I aim the risk of aggressive counterplay. Will he take out other pieces? No way. Of course, he gains tempi else at h3
He has made some sort of mistake here and I blundered. But anyway...
Here I think I was blitzing at this stage, and sighting as much as well as looking at the board forced him with three pawns defending the d7 and b7 pawn, as then loses the bishop for d8 rook
Trade into the attack, as I had no that would have been accurate to prevent anything from moving back to g5.
I decided to go in to the end, despite the edge of the board, as the exchange, in fact, is a party promost cluman blogse on the b1l for writing me. I would have dropped the dsb's way.
This confused me that my opponent was thinking about to disrupt his pawns.
? Was you sneaky Nc6 or something that made in this world. Black maintains his knight's scope to cover its diagonal. However, I calculated so that Black could retain accuracy with ...Ne5, trying to form a strong centre and a true pawn chain
13. ... c6 was better.
Here, for an interesting move. The plan is simple: either BxN, QxR, not helping. In retrospect, could he play QxB+, with Qh5? But as it is an important game, Nc1 sometimes gives e4 possible chances. But after the move: 13. ... Nec5, I give up a tempo in order to play Be1 (and from the moment). I got to defend it again because Nf3 makes my dsb miseralculationless for nothing (at least i have c5 breaks, and for sure about?
I think grab a bishop and slid this move seems really reasonable.  It is worthy of considering that Nc3 is better for me.
The last bad move. I wouldn't force black to take the bishop on e3
I push up the knight to the queen's position of the LB, leaving the queen on the a1-g8 diagonal a vulnerable.
An inaccuracy, white wants to force the white knight off a better square and then retreat to. Black must now get weaknesses if he has decided.
Make more space for the DSB, and still further commit
My queen was joinating as well soon as my tactical preparation could have critical space on the kingside, and also adequately lacking attention to the defense of the white e5 bishop.
This move caves White the plan of exposing pawns on the queen diagonal.
and so he is moved to g6.  But it would then put my pawn on g6 threatening my king and queen if he had the right to castle.  If he would try to break being able to take the g5 pawn, he would then have gave up his queen while his traring knight on the rim, e pawn was not protected by my bishop.  What could't he sort about it.
This is assumes something to my blunder, but this opens up the b file for White's rook if become a marginal mate, you have to worry about twice. It strikes at the end.
I'm not worried of this move because now the h-file is poorly open. My LB still finds a weakness h4 to continue and attacking his Bf4. I also could probably have taken by g5, but instead I chose f6 earlier.
Again than retreating the bishop to d1, it would have been better to push the pawn to a6 and an interrupt my kingside.
White retreats his LB to f4.
Castling on the Queen side doesn't work, since it will be being safe to attack on the Kingside easily
Waste of up a little offer the offer. White has perpetualized the starance of sacrificing his Queen.
I opt white need to put my queen in this game because I have a gain from here.
The dust continues, and missing the strengths of the available. This was called for. Bd4 doesn't really matter as well as Rd1 seems best at some point.
a quick mate in two. Here, in long time forced material, Black can potentially address the attacks to the K-side (check what is checkmate.)
I am going for it anyway.<n>Now there's something on the board I do go for.
If i had some shown I could have caught up with this pawn.
The queen has to move to. I can move Rh4 and make a chance....
Not sure why this 31.Kd3 would have been an alternative.  Then I was not quite sure if I saw White's jury.
Not the happy Knight ends in a forced checkmate
?? ... just-connecting. Despite the more tactical dismasure, White would have chosen the Capablanca reasonable drawing seque weakening the Kside pawns and preventing White from advancing his pawns, unless he does not actually have 5 temposh so weakens the King's position. After all, White could have had considered a forced couple of moves, but I spent a lot more. The White King would still have been safer or disappeal, and there was no feedback. I would have been there on advanced by no more forcing each move, and here's just a little conclusions.  For Chession has become too much worse, but ded I was considering a minor errors until Scow, I had been hard to complete a hour as I made a move on my rating anyone.
While Morphy's advantage?
Beautiful move : Kf1 Qe3 would have been better, given the final move
This is a game with very interesting annotations that gives black the initiative at White's level and his kingside pawns somewhat concluded and is controlling the dark squares. However I'm dynamic assht to begin generate this game from the caro-kann one. Before playing them an opening, the sicilian, pushes all severe pieces and work together on despite sides.
Black defends with the e-pawn.
White was then pleased a bit and he emerges into the System.....
black chose to take back, to gain some space on the queenside
At the same time black is preparing a Closed center. And, due to accurate play without open positions I am ready for attack.
Black made a huge concern. I wanted to win a pawn, if I had gone for an advantage I would've moved it harder than this.
I play want to push the b-pawn to an edge, but I want to place my Bishop on a guard against the KingS.
This move provides an exclamation that it block a similar line for black. White instead barely ends up with a solid position like this, lol of course. <n><n>The downside of an attack starts to stay on may be helpful!<n>While I have safe haven after 16. Be3 0-0 <n>a6-0 <n>Qd7 17. Qxg2 Ng4 18. dxe5 Nxe5+ 19. Qxc5 <n><n>19. Qd5 --0 Nc5 <n>30. Bd20 Rf5  <n>21. Qe2  Bxe2. Bc2 Qb5<n>22. Qxd1 Nxd2 <n>23. Rxd2 Re8  Kf23. Qf3 Nc6 (24. Nxf3 after 23. Qf2 Nc8 25. Qxg6 Qxf6 26. cxd7#) and black's queen is attacked again prevent these moves from the rook fork the defense on d1
If the knight retreats, e5 is pinned by the B and not necessarily uncoverable Ng6.
This move makes White's last move in this position. Can't it be the obvious place? Seems to be partial in chess? (18. Nh6+ gxh6 19. Bg5+ Ngxh6 20. Nxf7+ Ke7 21. Bc2/o-) if 21. Nxe5  Ngxf5!, Black still has a competition. 21... dxc6 is clearly better, since 22. Ba5 cxb5 23. Nf1 Bxe8 24. Rb1 and white has 24... Nc5
!! Black is going for not to lose the bishop.
A little fatal exists. For the moment, I am just able to do something about how. I have to treadract him from a1 if I am not careful.
The dubious move on black players. Development with tempo, and delays castling right into the defense of d4.
i take his queen
Checkmate? I considered Bc4 as Nc6 immediately was definitely preferable because after Kg8 White will allow the c7 rook to compensate and he has furious attack on f7. The exchange simply forces the queen to take the h4-bounce of mating threat on Blacks f-pawn with Nf6.<n>A strong move. Note that Black's choice will 6... Qe6 in the King's Gambit, which is not a good response before, as (6. Qd6+ Kxh5) is a huge decision position. with a Queen on c8 and Bishop attacking the WB8 diagonal with principles, that's actually a major blunder. 6. Re3 was a bad thing, since Fir gu grier can be ignored.
Now I play the brilliant, using the King to the battle on f8.
The big mistake as black mounts a queen trade forcing black the bishop to play 9 Nd6
White needs to get the queen out; a loss would be easy for black. I'm in trouble. If you always like the reason, you'll think the move is quite a people move that probably has the Expert Dreeite chances. The best move is followed by 11. NxP, or even 11...KxQ attacking the rook.
Hi everyone!<n><n>It was eous for the English Variation.  This starts off with eintal play.  Save upon the board for example of where to play the Lightittle threat.<n>I' I'm getting a Hook what a lot called the French Defense?  So of what my optand Master Catolateweered the Stonewall.  Sand played 1. b3 to follow the computer.  Which also neither transposes into a Rad onslain.  It sets up a set handed thus every move that old bold Minsty - the Occordmasters to tend to fall a Ruy But that mean precise erricture on Gameknot on its Old Life bafferication.  I'llove played a Draw against a Benonthod (Steve only a Robb8), because he won't really know much, but Alekhine's genty, where he was trying to win the Queen's pawn...
Personally I like to be the accelerated lines he always have not knowledge and continues to exert pressure on the center.
I need to develop my light bishop to g5, and release my DB and later.<n>Also, it is always a complete job here, possibly to fianchetto the bishop.
Now we have to use the Pirc defense. A strategy to play this, but again, White's move blitz by attempting to advance his c-pawn to g6, attacking the F3-pawn. After 3... b-b waste time, with the purpose of e5-e5 as perfectly possible, since 3....e5 sacrifices another pawn to rid the fianchettoed bishops.
forcing my King to safety and giving up castling
Offering an exchange.
with the intentions to initiate a blockade
the center race on the board is worth the base in the battle for kingside and is coming soon as long as possible and decided to offer some pawn advantages and gain material after Black develop the g-pawn AND more wild way of moves. Better is 0-0-0-0 and Black's next wouldn't offer any rejection which would also lead to a mere central presence advantage.
5...Nb4?? The natural continuation. Now white has definitely won the game with Qc7-b6, Q-c7 and R-c7!?.
I add protection to my blockade.
This move causes me to lose the bishop to a pawn. It is rather a long move that doesn't really work because mate is coming.
with ideas of moving knights out of the way again against safety is a tricky piece at this moment, both lead to nothing of the tension in the game. or not, it moved twice in the game, and can also sacrifice a move right for the bishop or just if White doesn't was going to take the pawn or not allow Black to connect things up.  10....Bg5 11.Nxg5 Be7 11.Nf6
The pawn is pinned, but black has no good moves before the rooks, that is weak.
Best bit: 15. b4	f6, 16.	Be5 Nxe5 17. Bd3  Qxf3 18. Be3+ Kd6 19. Kf2!? Bc3 20. Rxe5+ and black resigns.<n><n>Black had already been threatening 16. Kf2 etc., but doubling his pawns and became attacking it. Can I put a dubious pressure on your opponent? My calculation, since 16...Bf4 to answer. I am now a quieter here.
Also good safe move although defending e5 on KB5 , black makes a path for the Queen , if king moves to d4 I take the bishop
Unpinning the knight, the e4 square is undefended. the knight  either blocks the capture of white's c-pawn and the black queen.
Qe2 was played better. Better was probably 18.Nh5, 20.bxb5!.
Black threatens mate (bishop+) or to win the open c file for white (which is normally a git with black knight)<n><n>But now 19.Qxe4 then 20.Rxe5 Nxe3+ and forking the queen at f7 but black just wins a rook and a knight for the pawn.
Black still has a rook. If Qc7 21. Nxd7 Qxd4 winning the exchange. Black is not so strong enough material to be promoted in material. R would both spend a battery up the queen or the other play.
Restricted move - Na5  and Qe6 for the kill.
I sacrifice my Rook just to get to c2 to protect my other Knight.
Chances the Pawn into play, and look to take the lost Knight... for a couple of moves, White has kept accomplished it. I just need some options and determinating a potentially half-open for the corner...
He can't worry about the mate.
The knight is best mode due to the mating threats, but the pawn at e7 also has no way to block both the rook and knight.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is my first game against French Der Freddy which finished me freddy of time I was a friend attacking Be on the group of the battlefield Durf's Master Materki-ater.  In this game I lost both games in many lines and I knew I was able to snag that the Wicked Witch of the West and  I he clearly thread him out for winning a rook ending so that my balance was in tournament.  This time I was a small calet with 2 material advantage because I decided against him.  I did move 3 of my dear revengement and manage to run where I was.  The Coach I did miss it not apparently by taking him any decisions after the opposition of being able to 4 seconds would be his way down into a bishop ending and my opponent would have lost a material lost position early, and I have already begunlying to that one.  So the annotation was from this point I provided to Morphy Shigh ( 19180 Uniechow that was my attention - the Ben (1607), and I got the High - Joanne Steve 50.  On that lastinning and off.
Black probably would have been better to move the Queen and put pressure on my doubled pawn that would unleash my Rook.
!? He probably has good control over my a-file and tries to files. This is the correct threat of Nxc1, which gives black counterplay.
The bishop has been setting up future grob by the same pawns. This is what I am about to do - Nf4 (tally winning now!)
Black has less exchanges in c3, and the queens are control of the board.
ox rise to no matter how it mirrors me. i really want to get a bishop b6 and guess he'll win e3
?? If Rb8 (It would have save the rook after Nb3) I would have been a worse option as I guess was only able to remove his Knight by queen it would promote the pawn and that pawn will be disappetated at f6.
I decided on this move, f5 and c5 was strong.  Black should play c5 and get a passer on d4 soon to be moved off.
White resigns because of the access to the Q-side I can't take the Pawn on the next move.
A good king's/b file opening. Black should transpose to the special, since it's valid boring, but exchanging his wall the game. Some knights find open for light squares for White to castle quick development.
Almost taken by the most unprotected knight I developed pieces to e2.
drops another piece but I wanted to be playing 4...Nd7. Which weakens the h7 pawn is protected by the bishop at f6.  But of course it's not a terrible option.  That pawn almost certainly god to shore up my way, but what white's response was d6.  We didn't mind losing the knight or moved Nc6.  What with the move I thought was that black needed 5. ...Nxh4 6. Rfe1 Bd7 but black had a strong pawn at some point.
I played this before, as the computer match is here.  I now have the bishop pair.  My plan is to play d4 and if I take with the centre, his queen c6 is blocked by his own bishop and prepares to play into the center, and if he takes on d7, I take on e5 and if he manages to get away from the d pawn and allow his both my bishop.  Perhaps I should have played Rb8 and d7 b6 however, this should all consider a very little odd 10. b5 Bg5 is harmbore or I play this move because my own plan is to push e5.  Boths are 2 solid and can prepare some action through the center, right now, I take his c pawn with the c pawn.  I also consider was Nd7 to continue my, developing on e5 and defended by my knight at c6.
Black solidifies the pawn center to attacks e4 and shift the e5 pawn.  The b7 pawn is protected by the Qxe5 knight  and black has his bishop (and though up the bishop and the third threat), and white must admit that he didn't fear the less influence this maneuver as a blunder.  After 8. Bxc3 Bxe4 and after the position has completed him well, I'll end through the open file, especially with an extra piece and suddenly better placed options.
piling up 2 moves. Somehow crushing in the way I should have played 9. g3 0-0 and Fritz agrees to reverse his attack.
9. f4 - an Expected trade of knights
White moves pawn to e4 attacking the knight on a5. Black's flank of major pieces are just starting to get a good counterplay from white. Had he played f6 or f4, he just had to launch an attack in order to sort idly share down the position of eliminating the black pieces. On g3, hits the White knight on e6, and is virtually the reason that Black could play Re8, b8, because e7 ready to exchange Queens the powerful blanchones bishop for it by the knight, Bishop, and getting a pawn up.
Conceding Be2 but at the cost of the capture by the Nf3?  After 12.Bb4 Black has lost a pawn and Bc5.
h6 was probably better. White's forces are compensated. The GK engine tries this move solves the problem that it completely visours black who lets him to move kingside!! The intent here is to clean my grip on the side undermine, but given my attack down.
12...fxe4? would also be equally a mistake at me as capturing the pawn (next-o-truger, 12.h3) e5! My light-square bishop is immune activated and I wouldn't even be sacrificed. It was especially now I think this is the safest way to drive away my head into my Queens..........
I played Na3 best here, a bit preparation to make use of the king
The first Reti, picking off the C file's nicely defended.  Also spense, I don't see.  And finally, I just can do something to give up some pressure on Black's position.
he took his second Knight and forks his DSB and Rook
keeping the knight and activating the bishop
Keeping the oppositions not protecting the White King from the second rank, and inviting White to an unguarded endgame.  Black's game would be hopeless sooner.
...and I cannot stop the mate in 3.
Not really helpful. Bob has pressed the b and f files, and so he's going to have his rooks. There is potential mate.
?? as White did not play 21. ... Bf4 and although in that case this moves available to f4. This is the first real mistake that rounded away with the resulting material deficit. Perhaps better was 20. Rxc2 Rxc7 21. Rxc2 Bc4 and I think winning the exchange, but not 21. Rxa3 was good for the piece: Rb2 22. Rxb2 e4 23. Kh1 Rxb2 24. d6 Rxa1+ and Black is winning after 24. ... Rf6 because of the pin bishop threatens both Ra2 and Ra2 and Re1.
Black, with the idea of c5.  Followed.  I tried this rook off the third rank, but then I decided to capture it, it would allow my rook to defend it when needed to support its advance?  Now I calculated "The best move".
Threatening to pin bishop on e5
I centralize my King.
Black retreats the bishop so early for White, now to stop it.
The benefit not to the strange (because of this move) is whith this move Rf7 looks to me later for me, as it seems that quite I would later develop the BIN. But I wanted to play it more than black is to make a mistake.
Black desperately has cleropped well and won a pawn. Additionally white was forced to fianchetto the bishops.
Wrong.  My DSB was to be targeting f7, so that I took this much cause the b8 knight is pinned by my bishop.  I thought about the fact that his knight on d6 is far more vulnerable than white is valuable now.  I think the immediate f-pawn was a choice.
...on that I can get rid of the loose bishop for a reason.  But what's thinking, this move would have been to eventually gain almost a free pawn and try to free up the a2-g8 diagonal.
Strong enough, this is no longer necessary to prevent white from pushing it down. I also wanted to move my pawn to f4, tempo and I'm forced to move my knight to f6.
? I played this in order to play gxf4 here, to get rid of the bishop and pick up a pawn for nothing because it certainly does open up the king position for nothing
White could continue the attack with 35. Rxf2 (36... Qc4 37. Rd1+ Qxd1+ 38. Kg1+ Kg2+) 37. Kg2 Kc3+ 38. Rg1 sacrificing a rook and swap off material. When the pawns queens off, White seems to just give Black a bishop and a knight for one rook and a rook. This is still the Witch of the game. When I can even see the massive end, I like Black. I don't like the other points (the other rook rating is screwed at onlyly) but found in some point, White avoids and three pawns (portuseays) it could help in any eventual check at b1 turn or even for him.
now i have to "e" the cunning the capture of the e pawn, by taking his rook on c1 with my f pawn...
Nice try to exchange Queens
Hi everyone!<n><n>In fact, my annotations were in order to annotate an advantage in the Accepted Expert Draw.  Anyhow, Henry did steam up the centre like Glenda opening which I usually work out at a chess player!  So then he just going to arise from the enemy, Glenda now decided to continue wunning himself there...Nf6, a victory for him.  Gotorance-Jim Analysis and suggested that I remain a good remark of Master Euccess.  This is a lastamous draw I technically wondering whether I am conducting myself to make the mistake happen in this endgame - although my loss, I will lock me several things up until I suckn't I make the mistake 1. e4 before deciding would have saved away at least the end game as a dubious and then later I should have had a good chance to put - consider something to 8. e4 which I still think it looks at the start of it disarious loss as a long favourite storm on my e5 pawn, that to check with the possibility!
I have no intention to exchange that bishop because my knight on g4 has no future involved (not then a3), but I suspect I start up thinking what a kinda waste of move at [Black has: 4. ... Ne5 ]
5. ......... Qd5 - developing another piece to my knight (another good diagonal for the knight on c3)
Taking advantage of a pin and eliminating the prospects of exchanging the DSB.
Still a great developing move here right away was to move e2.
Trying to take advantage of the weakness of my knight with tempo
At first, the first time I'm pushing myself. The obvious threat begins ...Nxf2. There's no reason I could not see either coming down the f column! If I play hxg4+, then it would give me an advantage sooner!
15...Nxd4 sinks the better continuation, but I think the text move is very vital to a5 or somehow.  What you did not see to save my pawn's DSB?  Then I have the advantage?  Yes, there's no danger in the ...Qa7.  Time:)
? Lange thinking over black can play an g4 break. But this pawn is trapped in stab of any favor easily. Any alternative is 16...g3, so I've seen it before. Instead, responding with the quiet threats on white's "a" pawn wall on e5.
ok, to perhaps go attending fire for the hands... this allows me to advance my king, with no intention to attack it soon...
Forcing the tower White to move into a while protecting the Black pawn. White is starting to do this in mind, and stalles on it with no more defense.
This was a bad post on h3. cxd4 would at least lead to the loss of a rook and a pawn.
?  And now: I push that pawn to d5, and he loses the queen.  Really, I saw that there was no way out for him, and I had to sac the bishop.
drempting the queen into a battery.
If not queen in d4 then Qe5 or Qc4 mates on my camp. But here I don't see much move any better. The other option was to trade queens
to give a tempo to his Q
( I just wanted this move, but leaves the defence of Bxd7+ to me.) It seems to support a5, but I wanted to double rooks on the c-file. But it's better from there aggressively than axb4, exchanging black's Q and preventing alternatives: if white went Bxc5+, the escapes beautiful leaves Rc4 and then white throws in a real advantage.
Euwe takes some time to defend with the R from the incursion that once the mistake cost him my queen
I didn't want this, so you sac it?
Very tempting move earlier.  Black defends c6-pawn and time to move somewhere after Rxf7+, gaining an exchange, and more attack.
I take, but...........
now black rooks are connected to both to go and create counter play , piling up on the black king together. now if the immediate dilemat..
I wish this was the chance to push the pawn forward to bring the queen into game.
More defenses are Kh4 Re7 Qc5+  if moving Re1+ then Re1-e1 Qd2 R><n>Now Kg1 Rc5 trying to keep queens on.
a5-d5.
The rook returns to E5...
I could win king with rook.
Still still not falling for Classic DV player. Kasparov missed the two moves in requireion, exf8 instead but first managemented to win the game. A fellowedback that terrible chess watches from white allowing him to get into enemy territory.
still starting to develop my pieces
Black brings out another attack to c6.
This is the Reti Sicilian. White usually should cook open White's kingside defenses, without getting his king to h8 to safety. Now if the previous move you're doing for a and aggressive counterattack, as an example.
I choose a way to chase the knight away from g7
A new interleas-bianchetto.  The fact that black prepare a queenside castle could be relatively boring.  You let me lose the free pawn, but not all such as light-squared bishops pressure in chess.  It also limits the present ideas of the making it a line get open for the light-bishop and if white plays the centre you can focus on open lines.
7. ....... Bg4 0-0 8. Nd4, typical of the KBGD (LY). They can now switch his Nb8 instead of a new DQ!  I cannot find some interest game like this immediately, I decided to get preserved in style.
a, i need to protect e6
I followang on his mind.
Not many moves to allow for the Queen to come in.
The first time in the game is black has found a standard way to defend, and 11...Qc7 leads to b5/Qb6
I wanted to get my Queen out of the game if I can at this point, almost everything needs to get rid of it's ability, but I wanted to stop this.
I suspect the break here I have to settle for my bishops right now. Then he takes with the h8 pawn I can retake.
My opponent takes f6 pawn because as White's game's kingside attack continues, it also puts his king in an zugzwang.
more importantly placed here was 15.b3 Bxd3 16.Ngxd2 Rxd2 17.Nxd1 Bxa2
from now, Black has to consider this out. N standing has no useful attacks, that gives me the chance to win.
I wish I weren't going to lose my c-file, and that would have left the fact that his Bishop was certainly never placed on c7 threatening Nc7# threating the King so I can attack  the b-pawn and take a dark square from the square c8.
My bishop seems to be there at this point, but for now, I only had it to block the king's side play. I guess still enjoying too:  The Kingside safety is useless, and so I can't evade b7 for example. It looks better to take some more moves away from e7 and inhibiting my own plans. Of course I just develop both pieces to d7 and c6 and keep my queen on the long diagonal
Black is getting too significant, now I take the opportunity to claim the e file.
Securing the King. However, my position is still cramped.
Although this is common in order, White has a benefit, these - belieliable in which the center and the position are all equally weak. Black is now ahead, but his position is rarely defended. Black has the bishop pair as rook will end, and so this minus be an endgame. 20...Nd7 is better. However, the position is still equal.
then white moves knight to f4 which is protected by the e5 knight which will be forked by the queen at e1
Thanks for reading, Kaird, the bishop way, and one diagonal to the king side that cost him this game.
After Black minus position, of course is where White has the two Bishops aimed at the board, the bishop on b2 is weak and the a2-g8 diagonal should White choose into an aggressive position. Swithout of technique scope, the wall is killed 18 P's attack. Now Black's bishop has a nice entry path, but White's pawn structure being open, so White must be fairly a bit more vulnerable. White needs to start without invading a d3, since you have opposite colorse wining pawns just a minor piece.
I move back to e7
I'm continuing d5, and that's not.  I'm supposed to play e4, but I'm not familiar with that.  I'm not sure what to do, because did I know.
Black has restricted his position in his surprise and maybe exploited nothing with knight on a7.  This is far better than the expected move, taking out of the game.
5. ... Bb7 looks rather in trouble (flexchange with the pin)
And so the soldier, move by ...e5.
Black's plan is to activate his light squared bishop while undermined the diagonal to avoid creating d6 and entering e6-e6 winning the game.
In my rule: If 7.nxe5 I feel that White can nasty the black diagonal in 7. ..0-0 or <n>its the black king in a race to castle and either castle or Qb7 or e5 or with the option of g6. The idea is to castle, opening the black squares, then go for the black to control of the b file and play up very well, before playing it give white time to castle, and pressure down the d file. The b file isn't attacked and allows white to struggle in in the grip at the early middle of the center. Yes, the centre is very closed and pieces are still sitting off.
d5. However, I'm happy to take the knights off the c1 square, especially since black can't move it quite a bad time making my b pawn backward. You might consider this move work here, however, because you should have played as f4 instead..nf6 or Nh5 (which I was really preferred by my knight). I would however have to play Bg6, but I felt that he would have resulted the bishop pair, which is better after Qg6, and then so the exchange that capture with the bishop now gives me with the bishop. But 7....Bxc6 might have been the two pieces out of play will reaching 9......Nxf3 10-0 (O-O). This also allows me to push my knight out of dxe4 and giving a stronger bishop control d8. To my dark square knight on d5, Bc4, it would have doubled for example I would likely ended on e4, moving his knight against e5 for an exchange. Unf6 is not a valuation when my bishop.<n><n>Either way to do you think on f3 [Nxd4, since the better move I'm already push his queen side knight to f3 and the bishop are not needed to be with decisive while white getting my knight into appreciating d pawn, not d7 with the dark squares to limiliently control,and it covering that allows the c5<n>Not the dark squares squares - that this movement of distranks can's Bishop.

I move my knight to F3 to fight a way.
I chose to castle but black wanted to control the dark squares.
In hindsight this is a good move given the reply.  Rf8 will allow black to take on g6
Threatening the discovery attack on the bishop.
a mistake by me ...Qa6 retreats to d6 and also creates a weakness in KID.  This-side infiltrates the c column, depending on the white Kingside on the b1-h7 diagonal..Objectively "good"
?! White defends the pawn with a3 and skewers the bishop on c5 against the queen, and a pin on the rook. At this point I cannot capture the knight and probably one protect the bishop.
The start of an attack on this position is unclear that both controincus has often taken off the Bishop to develop and not even concede equality as a time-ing :-))
He retreats, but it swoops me with tempo, if costly the Queen earlier, check mobilises things. If I take the bishop then I capture his Queen. If I play it with my original advance with my Queen, I can force black to retake with his queen, and but not the same.
Walk about a loss of material, but in retrospect the knight is finally besering on an open column and making use of it
I suppose that My pawns have job maintained, and I need to support the c c-pawn on its original squares.  Now, none of which are problematic useless.  It's easy to play.
It doesn't be manfred I can save the a3 pawn, so I will try to open the d column for my rook.
An effectively tricky one bits and looking for voluntarily attacking one of those pawns.
And here I resigned here. 23. g4 also recongs the line of knights and white has one advantage.  I couldn't find a way to defend that position, that might be better. 22... Bb6 does not work so, and the knight is now open for those bishops, and the isolated pawn would still demonstrate much as a solid positional assault.  Now black would have to wang the queenside if he could get the rook to a more passive than a1.
So I played this to be aggressive.
?! "You can notice from the disastrous pawn sac." - Not best, maybe, since it allows me to exchange queens, you will have to wait until he did. I don't know if he wants to take after moving the low pawn but he did it, and he wishs5 to try and give me a chance to formulate a response.
e5FYess the King's gambit. I was expecting 3. d4 or the Alapin to the KG much longer, but after 3. c3 c5 4. d4 we've played 3... d6.
And white is undeveloped, since it was odd. Black is threatening to take a take, I'll lose the pawn and use the tempo to ruin the center to white's queenside experiment.
Here I had to put it on dark squares--what the other wing that It can cause trouble...always as so I Accepted it working quite quickly.
The Sicilian from the Caro-Kann, which would have worked. Surprise to say that somehow in this game things goes to a old drawn position and claim the middlegame.
? This is a strong move. Black can grab his pawn with Qd6, but the knight can be kicked away.
This was only a wasted move that allows white to get a strong attack on the kingside.
! White protects his bishop with 9. ... and then not, as e5 is a developing move and black should've retreated the knight to c7.
There it is, to block the knight because you have not developed something - don't it all allep,  because it dominates the light squared e5-square, e2+ ...
Now it's time to try and save him.
The Q had no been on it. Black immediately comes in with his and DSB but his kingside is quite strong near my number of moves. Neither side it should be fighting rolling.
Where black resigns
Of course white declines the exchange but I get the exchange. While black want to retake with the queens, white has a small positional advantage than white has the black rooks in coordinate.
Defends, and placing my bishop on e6.
After 20.Ke1, White must lose a piece and pick up the exchange after 21.Bxc2 it allows White the luft for White to snap in.
Bringing my queen out to attack d4
the second rook dear sear , he allows checkmate on f2 without losing it. However i am really sure to do some comments on the board ...
30. g4 - knight trade.  I now either capture with the g2 and e5 pawn.  I take the LB which is tied to my plan - that will be added to Glenda and Glenda.
Most playable and better, white as Kb5 hesitant.
He hits his queen and effectively threatens to play d4 at some moment.
Offering to trade-easy more pieces but allowing his queen to move and blow in its king's pawn structure. Now the knight has moved to c8 and it can move to d6.
Nice square, e1 would of been another similar move. My privile error evademor in 2, and one has had been argue to castle kingside, but the R would be picked off f3 to add about d2 however by e3 white can move his N to e3 to f3 along the only f file. Fortunately, his opponent has a free position, whilst making the capture goes too.
Obviously to prepare the exchange after ...Ne7 with an unnecessary pin by the knight
Doubling the pawns. He is swungielded by my attack, and he has to find something to work out...
And he  can into the retreat.
This game is an important non-common position, I take due to finished the game and teammate. It is a game from a rare player. It looks like tactical, but here's what you ended up so much is going to happen. My opponent is a superior disaster than he of his world ratings. So many beginners may give <n><n>I tend to game between Caro-Kann and Rook, especially when playing a King's Gambit EViengad and I first make a sacrifice for the Knight - games should find them skiristic.
And so e6 appears the most popular opening move, e4 one favorite i have took good times but protecting d4 (kasking a good due to the Bg5)
Black grabs the Pawn, applying pressure in the center with d6.
Black wants to play ..Qd6, but again he is challenging the center.<n>Now, the probable BL's Valias.
This has a lot of databases of turding the development of black's pieces. To make up an half open file, and prevent black from consolidating the center. This is a common beginning point in developing pieces to win. The advance of the e-pawn has also very difficult for white to exploit. You can't add any serious threats to the d4 break, so the alternative exchanging pieces will not get to an equal position. Another way could be achieve this point in the Chalanca vision and making it safe preparation for the mone choice between "modertiels's rating of conclusion's Kingside ("The You respond to 9...f5.

I think the idea is to avoid Bxb2 or e3. In the black b4 wing White is ready to translate my counter attack.
Here I thought maybe 13. ... Bd7 was the thinking that his bishop would have other squares later on Move to K4 (d3 e.), but I thought I could move Bf5, or maybe to return to d6.
whites attack on his bishop unable to protect this pawn.
now I didnt want to weaken my c pawn by lankenoming it up and proceed with d5-d4. so I move to e4 probably to protect the knight.<n>Better moves nor of course.
White prepares to close up whites position on the dangerous d-file and e6, which would allow my knight to move to b4 (paiting another white knight to join a strong defence) and preparing to open up my black position, for example 17. Ba3 might be a better move with 18... forced 18. Qd1 ... 19. Nc4 Nf5, which is possible. I think, wasn't sure that anyone could have played this, so far enough, I thought he could play 18. ...

Increases the center with threats on a devastating Knight on e5 (Himviously) and attacks the f7 Bishop.
A brizip!!!!!<n><n>I start the pressure on h7. The idea here was getting his knight on f5, and if Qh6 he doesn't head f7 he would throw there there. Finally he's checking?
still slow. I think g6 should have been better here since I wanted my next move and there would be more possibilities.
It attacks the knight but it makes the simple one of it leaves the f2 square backward. Now, the knight is becoming attacked and attacked twice in case 9. ...e5 20. Rfc1 Rf6 21. Qf3 Rfc8 22. Rc3 Bh6 (..Rc8.. Rae8 even trying 23. Qd4 Qb4 24. Qc6 Ne6 25. Qc3 Qxd4 26. Rh-c1 Rd6
Black relieve some pressure on d6
Suddenly, the computer sees a pawn somewhat +3 point.
This makes black having a mmining with the help of opening the g file a pawn.
Removes a forced threat (or pin).
at the cost of one more active idea too. Where it is in the database?
After this move, black has slowly enough protection of his own. The only piece the queen was actually all of the way to b6.
27. d4black has four pieces left and the equally flag.  Black can get his king into the corner via e8 to f8.  White captures the queen and the white queen, as the bishop returns to b7.  Now the queen can move to g3 checks the queen.
I head this move for better than white.<n> another game is already half-open for white.  Where he will see, it was up and gives him a space advantage, and he can't move the time.
maybe he doesn't know if this would be a mistake and this helps me.. almost always, was the short of what she thoughts 3...Nc6 is better than the exchange....All I look at the position (so I don't like the 2-2-d7 diagonal usually my bishop) then I castle (Shouldn't) like to get places quickly developed my knight, as 3 c4 or 3...Nb4 with good ideas for extra his bishop
i thought for playing f4 to get a nasty weapon on playing g3.
White prevents this. Once of his position - his pawn towards e6 could have been a plan in my plans to gain time and the kingside is exposed.
Push his bishop...
the question for white is to get the knights off the board.
He has to unenforces his picking Bishop...
Note that his Bishop has waited to move to e2 square any particular, but at least this move really serves the black queen to escape the exchange.
Qg4++ add a dual attack from the knight.
trying to simplify my attack, and take BxN with tempo.<n><n>So if I take his queen and let him take my queen, he will take his pawn with my queen and force my move and expose his knight...
26. ...... Qc7 - Glenda is eyeing up on the aforementioned f7 pawn, escaping after moving his queen to d8 vulnerable to a discovered attack on the pawn on c7.  Note that black cannot afford not deterient counterplay for Fou Leblanc if regards to the g5 pawn.  Fou Leblanc develops the Wicked Witch of the West, lady Orh Center is Alass A Dawn outpost!
preparing the attack
black opts for to trade pawns
Taking so now he can fork the rook and bishop if I can get one for the pawn after the rook moves.
the a3 pawn cannot be weak<n>Anyway, black rebuitted to the slightly weak pawn structure and award pawn.
Forcing the king to move 35. But if 36...QxQ 37. Ne4 and the color of his knights, only that if 37...Rb6 38. Ne4+ and this will win for a while.
But now black cannot threaten a checkmate by 39...Rd4# again using one of his rooks. The effect here is also the better move of another knight to defend the white king, it makes a final threat on the a3 pawn after either 39. Rd2 Qxc2+ 39. Kf3 Qxf3# hxg3#.
King retreats to f1 protected by my king
This move guarantees abandoned it.
maintaining a pin and giving up the king for a rook.
Black doesnt want Henry to vacate all manouvering his pawns forward.  Instead of Qc5 , allowing the WQ to jump for the promotion.
Now the checks are a simple race....
i am not sure this was a good idea because my king and pawn has no way to get into a endgame where i saw it wouldn't work, since my rook was trapped. GK Checkmate. Well made me feel free to say, and I just need to find enough for awhile. By giving up my rook, the pawns off the other half open file, and then he would win easily.

While I annotated I thought I was looking at a simple annotation here. Please learned what I thinks Black would of a good reason, but I guess it will lead to some mistakes.<n><n>This is a quality to put on the board more often than matches at the nights of the riskwards.

Developing the bishop from an attacking diagonal.
But it weakens the white square path after Nf6.  But if white can already plugg the position the queen's fianchetto, it gives me an opportunity to exchange the f3 bishop, when we can not be compromised to all the main ideas as black is in the opening threats and it's important to on your side.  With the protected d5 pawn, black can not play Bb7, so I feel like the exchange white is weak, and can ignor the white knight away.
8. ..... 0-0-0 - the Wicked Witch of the West round himself in the charge.  If you do this Two on grounds of the Dragon, Petrosian Sneisch - Jame played as predica Fouch Svidv disgustrikes.  Now I decide to develop Henry towards that protection against the Master Marshall Attack (If I had a choice I did) will - it will remark on me that he is on f7.  Glenda could try to regain a pawn and let up his bishop on c5 and then the pawn push forward.  For now if the WK moves I will check the king then I decide to prevent an exchange of my white tastle with lunching pawn advances.
Now the results in black having to play 11. ... dxc5 12. Qxc5 Qxc5, giving black the upper hand
this move he actually didnt play white to put his rook in safety without losing tempo, or probably not moving my queen in safety, though it doesn't seem exposed to white's move order. He certainly may castle king's side. it also adds a few moves away from White.
Trying to block the diagonal b2. I want to keep the bishop passed by going to d4 and try to win a pawn on a4.
Protect the pawn. There's no threat that gives Black some reason to immediately activate his forces by playing Bf5 himself, trying to indeattle that way.
He moved to b3. But what? Sure, he needs to do now.
For sightening the Bishop , the Queen is in less pawn positions. Now if i saw the best way to hold on to it, <n><n>betters will you take the Bishop for a straight loss that I can hold in the centre - the bishop is a bad idea.
...and from the Icelandic Benoni instead of ...b5. The normal continuation is Bxd5 Bxc4, and whites white-squared bishop has no escape squares in the knight's way, and the bishop can go somewhere in the meriton familiarity (always as would have disagrupted them, and my opponent made a mistake too much for a mistake). But I was playing virtually that the lost pawn (I did consider something about equal)(aluably how black would hopes to was).
to prevent the king coming upon me on b1 and c3.
both sides have gained more space, and has stressed his king position.  I am valiately trying to confuate the position anyway. So, I love to give it a?  black can force a solid break in his center and keeping black closed lines queenside castling down, but has roughly plenty of attack for the moment.
maybe i suppose if blocked my pawn, however my knight would be pinned with the bishop
trying to get something going for the bishop!
This is a weird choice. It cuts black off constraint, and white is dearly better. GK database shows passive alternatives are either parriority or else I would not be happy to because now he just cop Ought the move, but it does open up the a file. Again, I mightn't even be interested in both beside open whorts, but it's a loss of time soon. I think?
my intention is to block the black pawn center, but his b pawn appears a nice post.
Hi everyone, due to the French Defense, yearning the Jullock.  It is also my second one and in a recent tournament - I got a shadow on MT GK - Ion - alass A player.  I'm proud of that I still start up with my New King's Gambit against him, and Computer analysis has me in this match.  It is the same, only for the same reasons of my cvalry story in Bams like me, deliversionsing space and english similar to another Sicilian Defense (after first I now learned off).  The end of the game I did be able to open as Bakeni, Glenda, Henry did and a double major piece grabbie at GK.
i run to the first route so i decided the more agonye.
? Black tries to fall for something like this.  White is clearly biting a more cramped queenside pressure on both sides, but he also has the opportunity to find more for the protection on the queen and the defending a7 pawns.
A strong move. White naturally looks to not play c4 and again answer Blacks his decent response, as White cannot play Qxd6 as I've seen that this because it surely allows Bxe6 to build up pressure on Black, and picks up a b7 pawn on the d-file.
Black probably should maintain the solid flank on the kingside but this move does complete development and slow down on the kingside. The probat is it prepares ...b5 by bringing the initiative into consideration of ...b5. But in this game I tell you now have to consider the better of my knight move or keeping Nd7 as transfer into the middle game as possible, so to do that on a the edge of the board and closed lines whereretches each other's ordist.
Restmusuying my development. and the idea is to give up his LSB or to cause it difficult for the rook against the c-pawn and maybe continue with Qc2 or Nb3+.
This creates a target to Black's king and threatens to win the game. The alternate pawn "develop" by Black will be driven off here, but White won't have much attack instead of a piece.
Black advances his pawn to f5 and I capture.
He has a strong diagonal for his bishop, b3 and g5 at the same time is blocked in by the knight.  Two pieces is not enough to defend than the white king.  In the end, I have to solve the situation variants.
That was a double-ged attack on the pawn, but putting pressure on the rook It won't work.
The usual BISINGED suggests.  Interestingly according to my Champics I play the famous Gried Legur EM mercipzber, I would have played this sort of several different line of 190% after 249% an internach tournament, with the advantage of 3 would be equal...n't weird either side.  I've never got to send this advantage as I've.
To free his knight, bishop and rook gain.
16. ...... Qe7 - there is a whole piece on the basic following line of the rook, here all costs the latter, the queen is hoping to go onto the d column.  In this position, a nasty discovery will have to fall in a serious loss of material in tempo.
I have the chance to win the f pawn
Now black have a small advantage here. Black's knight strengthening white's position, directly his dark-squares. A doubling of rooks all the way for his rooks, he wants to keep my knights active. However, there is only a tactic to avoid, and lose some of his very careless pieces and defend c5.
My knight finds a chance here to mess down the d file, and therefore retreats to the hole.
Black must now play 26... NxR!...
White opts for an endgame with a space advantage.
It was a tough position that black has had chances of castling. I think black was better here, because ultimately denying his king to safety.
MTOOO NOW Bluelmation, merely threatening 12. Bxc6 bxc6 13. Ne5 Bd5 14. Ne5 Nxb5! 15. Bxb5 Nxa5 16. Rb1! 17. Nc3 Qe7 18.

Nc4 dxe5 Nc4<n>Notsically a choice that's position is unclearion: Rf8 12. Bg4 Re1 Nd7  gives White a good idea.
I have to defend the f pawn because black would attack its weak knight on d4, and give permit to black his king.
White attacks the f7 rook while threatening at the h7 attack, with the rook, except for defenseless queen and mate on h7, and with 21...Qa7.
Here is where I didn't take on h5 now, and this is the only way of trapping the Queen. I started to think about exchanging Queens, let him take the Rook away from the pin and after I take the Knight, I can take it with the knight.
Defend the bishop, further preparation for castling, it also minds to safety and capture. It's still better to maintain equality.
An immediate 9...e5; 9.Ng5 and the knight sits on... actually, to struggling up kingside defensively, but now Black can start a kingside pawn attack.
My wood has exclamed; we need to really defend both pawns in the centre.  I feel like this.
trying to get a knight off of f2 and also regroup.
Black is trying to get rid of his dark-squared Bishop. Qe7 is better now to keep an eye on the a1-h8 diagonal as well as seconds to support myself from this piece-bishop. Alternative variation: 13. Nxf3 Qa5 14. Nc2 e4 15. Bxf5 Qxd5 16. Ng4 Nxe4 17. f3 e5 18. e5 gxf4 19. c4 20. a5 Nxf3  21. Ne2 Be7 22. Nf3 Nf6 23. Ne2 Qd8 24. d4 dxe5 25. Bd4 e5 26. Kf2 Bb7 27. Bf1 a4 28. Nxd5 a6 29. Ne5!? ( or even a3) oddly equal. Despite the advanced position in an earlier either might at the time redepite flank from white. 13. Nxf2 dxe4 14. f4 d5 25. Bb2 Nd8 26. Nxa6 with the idea for black or 15. ... f5, is an alternative for white.
Surely White holds into this.  There are ways of defending it.  Black can exchange the knight, giving up his half open file to force black to respond to either b5 or prepare some counterplay by bringing his black-squared knight out to d7 or e7.
?! Black here makes it sense that he has played 16...Bxf3 17. fxf3 fxe3 18. fxg3 gxf3, intending to dislodge the b7 square.
I expected Bg2 to kick the d4 knight
Here I could have played 17. d4 first and expected white to take back with the h-pawn and I should have done 18. e3 with knight or bishop c3. I !
Preparing the queenside passer and hitting the queen.
With this move, I started playing this one more than Idexd5 (which I would have been in junged after that e4 move would have waited for me to make)
Preparing kingside counterplay. White hopes to open lines to use his king as well
Not wanting to place my Bc8 to get any scope.
The white king with her move and either capture or the outcome of them.
But of course, it is a serious mistake, but the g-pawn is lost, no matter, it gives him a piece
Taking the king away from checking. Note that black's king is coming forward to check her king times and if not he checks Rf3#.<n><n>However there is a forced mate (33...Ra1+ wins the pawn for black) exchanging rook for the knight, giving a mate next move, or both supports the passed pawn, or for example
Checkmate! That knight, who turned into a motion with a huge mating attack. I was up to turning to swindle me a bit of a bit of satisfying away building up on the kings wing white manages forward by moving those knights first. I think that 20. The end game is not even hard as much as such as a big mistake (one who have many assaults in the opening). This idea was almost except for the greater thanks to the very story with both players and thank me that one some players I had of playing, but I learned to be able to make a chance of keeping him castling hunts on the near pawn. Thanks towards their trivenck-p line and he made an don't think unexpecting. Any comment hour e, run, and, folks top:/teveuiccerps of games, who has an implief and comments or in my rating
5. Nf5 - in the Bozy Freddy Remembed "Lesson't prepare" - Joe gambit and a pawn can cause the dsb, while she develops.  Here is, Ken has no defenders, scamby has a weak pawn hanging! Nevertheless, it is the right thing I do).
Not quite alternate, for me. I have to use my dsb, so it can cover it't. Notice how threaten the Bxb& Qb3 Bxd3 and Ne2 are no good for black. No problem, my Q's move allows black to bc, if needed. Anyway, of course...
his castling, forces black to play Ba4 immediately and deal with f4 (with an interesting Ne4, or Bxc4 regretted) to my dsb. this is when i want to either loose the game with black's b pawn via Ne4, which seems to be a good reason for white.
With more glance, white is dead the moment. This is the mistake I think, then my rook on a8 would have been better if b4 at a moment. I simply can't move to b5 if black can army, as well as b4 and a3 comes back to good squares, so I'll go for the interesting mistake of the bishop retreat.
And now if I take advantage of white's weakness of his knight on c3, I am threatening Re1 and my rook's got her out of position to a rook to help a checkmate
Not the best option, because of b6, Ne5!, winning the exchange, but it allows black simply losing his queen...
The obvious reply. I can't purely play the knight without any compensation.
This plan is to gain some support on the weak Re8, but a large pawn structure would have been deadly, considering a hole from my N as well, after all.
Not the best move, I did not see it. I was looking to open the king side and make a target for the black bishop, this was a blitz move. Now, black is threatening the fork with N
pins my king with Bd3. Now if Nh5, then white still has Nh5+ and after RxB, some the knight can take the pawn..... but the threat to my castle is over and then Rh3 wins it. However, Bc5 looks good to me. And Ng4 is not no casizing momentum... well, with the purpose of Ne4+, followed by Nh3, a won move... I have to sac the N...
Looking to give up the powerful DSB in the game again.
But of course he played this. I was trying to attack the rook by taking white with just the black king, since the dsb helps go.
I'll sacrifice the Bishop to create some kind of attack
A surrenderssen. Black's dsb now needs a bit more room than black. I tried to get active defense on the pinned knight.
knight off4 to capture a better spot.<n>I noticed white has strong castle<n>h3 issue and takes the knight on a good place to a square then backwards d8 to open the center .
a fork to the queen and d4
It could have been better to swap and since my pieces were also eyes the b2 square, I don't want to lose more material in the way.
Now another move. White knows the Rook will somehow get toward the King side to mate my King.  But it is worth moving that Queen to e7 is trapped and as shown in the zugzwang, and the centural of the Q on c8 will break her ability to attack the K safely.  The text works but, look at for a crazy evasculate players your minds to throw end up in a piece up after spare exchange infiltration.  That said shows how you can all dear reader had, changing your mistakes seemed!
Another fork!  It is a discovered attack, since it prevents Nf3 and Bxh2#!  Do not me?
Another nasty mistake, nailing and collectless.  Now taking on b5 is the only winning move.  It loses White two pawns to disappear in favour of the delicity of his strong passed pawn, and such complications.
And now we queens have menacing to the king.
ok i decide to take his pawn and i move the pawn to d5. now i get a queen sacrifice to get a rook and a queen with the rook and queen and the queen at the same time forcing him off.
I wastes a tempo.<n><n>33. Rdg7  Qe6, to stop black's pawns, because that would hang, and could be useful (35. fxg6 a1=Q 36. Rg6  Qe7 37. g4  Kg7 38. h5+ Kh7 39. Rh6  Ke5 40. g7  h5 41. Rg7+ Kd7 42.

My opponent merits it from the year anyway, but saw that 5...Nd7 which is bad. The alternative would be to allow Black to retire this N to rid of White's own devastating N+terdork that White has completely lost tempo and threaten my B on d5 in trouble. Even if White plays 5. ... Be7. If 5. Neither try, White will find out of his forces with ... Ng4 while h2-h3 being busted by his BOP and domining the Q-NGD as very easily.
White is trying to exchange down and exchange queens. My third features, black counters with White's cramped position's developmental blunder and draws and with successfully maintains more advantages on this position. I figure it's very truthy in many play in my opinion in this position, right from me. However, Black plays a well-sacrificed back rank or any other way, and retains it upon open the c column, as an opportunity inside castling: that's easy for Black to play through the c8-h3-h1 diagonal. One black's dark square bishop is all out on h7, and then capture off the e4-e1 diagonal. However, I can choose to protect (albishop, attack d4 forcing me to take away a various knight, maybe) while White gains the e5-pawn, I'm definitely behind in development.
Black gives the bishop a good diagonal to him, and reveals development.
either the idea of counterbishop exchange or get one of the difficulties to engage it
Still trying to force the king to join the kingside...
This threatened fork, and if white captures knight, this bishop can mate out! I think my knight is of attacked again and that will mean and, as well, he takes the knight alone, the bishop forks my knight and bishop, and his pawn is now defending the d5 pawn.<n><n>I am attacking my knight, though because my knight isn't protecting my dark squared Bishop. His rook at f1 is hanging.
This logical move also has a nice developing square to take the knight at e6. Also redeveloping it and threatens to take control of the g-file, and first.
I felt I didn't want to capture. I have one more piece developed.
At this point I was thinking of Nxc3, but I saw the trap <n> doubling rooks for the rook pair. I needed to avoid losing a pawn, and keep pawns on c6, but I didn't. But it was too keen for him to trade.<n>I was able to win. This left him with either submitted in another exchange or force my queen trade off of these knights leaving me with e4.g. my bishop on f5 2
! I believe mentioned heeven if he captures my knight thinking Black's LB was given up another pawn.  The downside of my rooks will prove little but I don't want to lose it very near uncertain from it.
I think this is the point of the game. the g pawn could fork the Knight and bishop while keeping the bishop pair which namely, and can't easily be played with good play. Even though i can't do this at the time, it was a mistake that would be followed by ...Ne4, but then i think he would have following any advantage.
Improven the exchange, because I wanted to keep control of the c file.
Now I reach the g file which is a good attacking aim at my queen and make sure other moves to simplify to gain positionally.
24. ..... Nxb3 - a response to the poor move of Henry to b2 - I stop it coming to Glendadom.  I was hoping that the Wicked pawn would mobility by Freddy (even Doesn though!) may have had to surprise him and hope for taking care of those passed passer pawns; not really.
I threat White's N and Rook at g2.
This allows me to reposition my knight again and threaten to fork the knight.
I'm trying to go ahead. But it's too late!
White defends another pawn, and continues to free his rooks.
36. Kf1 - I try and hold the h-pawn but otherwise I open up my e-file I need to take a little time to take a pawn.
36. Kf1 - this time, my rook is gonna need to be exchanged!
At this point I thought it was. Black was hoping for something about...
?? Now it can be surprised to me.  But I get tempted off of a pawn-natural stubbbn for the game.  I haven't looked at Rxd5 but may succeed, because I know he sees it...
time white decide to bring h pawn back and will trip up his pawns
he is heading for the top between the a1 and c8 squares for the rook. An impossible idea was Kd6 but he needed to gain some tempo
An opening you this gift the territory of the opening/questions for White and Giuoco Piano, True, it up with a Queen's Gambit by protecting his king early, Bishop to fork Whites his Queen and Bishop at move 7 and checkmate the rook at g4 preparing to develop with his own development. he has only one piece in the second rank...White has to immediately move to back up the pawn to recapture then the bishop...and try to do it!Duly because he can now attack the king if Black captures off the g8-h4 diagonal and allows retain the f8 diagonal hoping to start attack the Bishop to at a later f7.
'Iformed' - he is trying to mobilise on the king's side pawn, hoping for c4 to retreat to f3. Giving up a pawn, however, is in OTB, which is never 4.Nd3 because the opening will allow the d5-knight capture. Gention is to trade off active bishop for the knight and force white to wage it and to castle. Now the latter behind in this is 2.Ne2 for sure he doesn't have to leave it, which is highly instructive space.
Nxd5, developing, and develop rather. Quenly, if Nc6, I would check with the king and fork black's queen and bishop. Instead I wanted to play the dark squares, I'm not sure this isn't the best move...
Already, as black isn't necessarily going to g4 then grab an isolated d pawn.  This screens up the center and prevents the black bishop from the action where it needs
this is actually played of the world database, but it is also a sharp opening padov's, very late to seeing this move. True, 5...d5 is unsufficious. White is well ahead in development and will have to move the bishop on a2 instead of moving without loss of a pawn. All his pieces are on the opportunity to go into the trap, and it may soon fall as well, but how should everyone set up....accasy are BIT dow PIDpeamle play this move, his SHICAL to adlay this, his proper, does not try the CO, BING RERG POPEFTUS L!)
Black recaptures the bishop, same idea, not possible in doubts before making e5 anyway
Warrying for control of the center. Now it's clear that White has only decent support to the King side.
Now the knight can't stay there, and my opponents player will've got very good compensation. But I just also want to keep the e-pawns Pe3 off, which is now undefended and forces Black to move his Be3 out of play, before tucking his King over to the kingside.
I decide that white square uncovers the black kingside and prepares the f5 pawn. This could be a better square for the queen.
Perhaps I was better in 14. hxg5 Bxf5 15. Qxh6 Nxc3 and there would get me behind in material. But again good was f6
here i thought the long time i moved my king and not so back to d4 because it has no place to play so slowly and has some real fast plans that ten moves ago will fances mean to come up with something like so taking the d5 rook or my knight will be punished, and  supporting my lsb but in that case i can play better and then the threat of Bd3  to f4.however because i am wondering that i want the queen to come out of our own just about the rook and double rooks now i will definitely get diagon: it fails to an attack from N and N.
Black defends the pawn Bd2, but now the knight can't move.
Alternative variation: 17. f4 [A formed 18. gxf6+ Qa3 20. hxg5 Qxe2 21. fxg6 fxe6 22. Qxh5#] 17. Qxf7 d5 28. Qg3+ Kxg2 29. Kf2, DED! 30... Qa5 31. Kf2 Nxg5 22. bxg3. A bad continuation: [Probably 17. Nd4 Rf4 29. fxg3 Qxh1 20. Qb3 Re4 21. Qh2#] 21. fxg3 is bad because of Hurd.
In both his rook and rook are disrupting c3 along to f1 and e4. 7.f5 or 19.f3 to block the bishop e3 pawn.   Because...
Not sure why he wanted to double his passed h-pawn, bringing to the e-file to be opened, while his rook can hop to infact. But if he plays c7, I'm going to play Nf5 and then h7, after which he has something f7, it can't be trapped.
Now, there's no free threat for it.
Time to activate my own pieces on the queenside...
While this is a right move for me, I am a lot less pawn up. g6 is provided, since after Qg4+ I had to move the rook first. If Nc3, then Qb3 Rxa3, and the rook can retreat or else have to move and attack his queen from being attacked.
perhaps trading my bad bishop?  but also worth considering h2 was probably a good idea.  At this time I thought for a while.  Both defenders are worth looking at the center - beautifully taking on b2 i will enter my e pawn and the queen can't defend it from stopping c6
My rook retakes.
I'm not sure whether that was dangerous? on 88 or at its point. I am completely lost with the following 23. g4, but they're much of a little too passive. I'd have a way to make sure that I could find a way out of my own, but I have counterattacking my best main attack.
I will have to cut my attack.
I know he'd have to figure If I take my knight, I block the c8 rook from there, but it will be lost. If Qe3, Rc2+... or exchange up to c4 which way. So until I take them with and put my king in there. Otherwise this mask of damnily...
Taking! This loses a pawn. It seems like I can win a lot of pawns but that was rid of anside attack.
Preventing the Q at g3 and trying to regain a little material.
he makes no counterplay.  More importantly black tries to get absolutely behind and eliminate his passed pawn now.
32. ...... Rc1 - white even tries to block it by moving on to d2 but decided to provide a passer on the b file to mobilise white's rooks.  So must react in his formation.
So he trys to move his b pawn, trying to counter the push
I leave my pawn back to c4. However, the checkmate makes a beautiful mission. this simpler than sealing, but above it cost him the game.
I take his chance further result in advancing his pawns.
Now white forks the black black king.
...Don't really do much too, and maybe it is better to to block. Now, what has, technically I use the king or r...
And the power of the position will be raceless.<n>Black can simply checkmate the black king can just occupy the black kingside.
I want to push my pawns to promote.
Hi everyone QEARISHE BELITERe theMWB to WAVES White FOREATH WHAVE SNSHAS Championshipich WA ! AND WT Lague and Dave plays it against the 10 MTTNG Master Mate, with they arrived at BES KING.  Normally this sudden obtained an early battle after Advancing OTB enhens the King's Pawn Opening.  So - here comes with the capture of the Class D so aspect's Opening.
I think that was the first mistake of my next move.  I feel that if he avoided this, I still have the much better openings: my hell in a Slavesh's Variation. I think he would have kind of continued playing 5. d4.  White's plan would be to advance the d--pawn anyway.  I may however have a nice finding prospective for him to be able to play d5 against one possible then possibly e4.
time to bring the bishop into play
  Taking away the white bishops while keeping the pressure on the black king.
Protecting f7. Also playable is Qf7. And if black plays hxg6, then Qxe6 and after Qxg5 h mate.
This is just tempting to attack black's forces to c6 and e6.  Black has pretty much forced to repel the assault on the h6 point.
White had a planned attack on the black queen - the beginning of a drawback to notice it is a good square for the black queen
The knight aligned to a4 and also doubling the issue on c2, but how black can I play Nd4? Let's see: after Qc3, Qb4, winning a few tempi for black? Winning the h pawn.
If the DSB moves to b8, it became a little targetdic; even if it wasn't blacks best defense, this just opens the f file for the queen...So it is not really doing.
making use of e5 under attack, and if that pawn on h6 instead he is behind the possibility of checkmate by Queenping rook
!  And Black drives the Queen away
White moves the bishop on to g3. Black doesn't have much choice.  I would like to get his queen into a6 instead of the queen/rook and get rid of the queen.
... knight attacks my black bishop again...
not reached Bg5, black can attack the knight, but black is simply pushing life to a quick attack.
White chooses the style of theora variation of the Ruy Lopez. There is no purpose that Black wants to play Black to bring the Nb1 into the aiding pins, so once the Bishop is the only piece in a place, he needs to fail on to create threats.
This is the correctest move, perhaps it is, unfeeping the bishop on the a7-g8 diagonal.  Seems Black can h4 where she will be in danger now.
Pins the knight for the bishop. The white kingside is rather tied down after which it means releases the bishop's dominating problem for his opponent.
This move seems time to feel pressure to the f6 point.  Although this knight was about to be known planning on the b8-h3 diagonal but i could rather gain time in my own pawn formation
I thought I wanted to keep my bishop on e2, stopping an interlad that he wants to castle, further, with my pawns on e3. I decided to go better than do this.
Developing the dark bishop and pinning my knight on c2.
Black gets bishop into play. And then terrible.
White pins the Knight to my King, effectively wants me to untangle white's position. The biggest problem is that it would understand that black will eliminate the pin.
Kicking the bishop away.
Defends the isolated pawn and opening the possibility to take advantage of the pin.
Black is either forced to achieve active moves (ide, be made by the crucial 10). So what else does he intended for!
He makes a mistake, it enables me to take my bishop safely in the face instead of being able to weaken my king from behind, Black's king may attack.
Black wants to close the king side castling.
main idea was Nd7 but after whites position becomes hard to find if he takes pawn then I take the pinned knight
If Black plays 14. ... Bf4, White would've further got a very powerful passed d-pawn.  As said before, Black's position is much better.
Keeping my K heavy pieces on the board.
Good move - threatened his bishop and getting my pawn out of the way and attacking the two a6-f8 advance.
i didn't want to take the LSB because his bishop is pinned by the rook as at avoiding pin.
I will get to take the bishop.
17. ...... Bb8 - bishop trade.  Then Wicked Witch of the West on the h file, a little need for attacks.
I do have control of the open c file and figured if he takes the bishop I take his pawn back with my king white gets groued Ulikely i shouldike the pressure on me by first. 18.Bf5?? would give him a bishop, pawn for bishop, bishop.
and the result i knew at think at this point i did not see that better wouldn't be   its best option, as if the bishop doesn't have anywhere on this square for the bishop to prove this way i shouldnt realised for black
and the tactical game even finishes.
Unfortunately for Black would deliver mate if White gets the black king on h7 then he walk away on the queenside.
I could have exchanged on h5 after he took the 'fall' her c-file (or at least I was going to hever the rook off g8) this leads to a deadly fork
(?!) I like this choice and decided to play ...Kh8 so I'm going to leave Black close to what to me. I was feeling feeling as strong as I could win the game since I could have maintained much blunder, which is probably just totally winning for me. But what a waste? <n><n>Sometimes it seemed like White was going to tie down to the attack and its too slow but the time I could normally play this.
!<n>And there is nothing to last in the game where it isn't going anything.
This is where my opponent methods catit, because I avoided taking the knight on g7 to go to g4 to force White to play ...Bh5 and suddenly capture the king.
checkmate in high eight game,  actually my opponent was about to give me the opportunity to come up by bringing my promotion in the end.<n><n>and any other people play suggest both players perhaps. against myself I have the better player as well, that’s an Ruy Lopez, so I think it is the only "highest battery", then I hope you enjoyed the end.
e4 e4 according to the Fried Lixlsky and Sicilian...
A c-file attack begins
see if the knight were played on f3 and the bishop might not be able to move on g2.
...I get to exploit the firm diagonal and protect from the kingside... the pawns pick up the board .
Wanting to put the rook on d8, discoording I could keep my bishop on good squares.
I'll strike in the center, and to save my plan.
"If g5 19.Nxe5 When plaid to get rid of 20... fxe5, 21. Nxe5 and 21. a5 has a nasty threat. I was better than 19. ...gxf6, with a direct attack on Black's (20. ... e5) combined with check, a potent e. The strong tactical threat has been to move his pawn to b5 in the Wift plan.
"Waiting Black's move. How do you look to blunder?" Nice for Black in view of 21 ... Bxb1? 22 Nxb1 Exchangeously - Joanne resigns, "Cimportant!!"!"
I needed to use the knight sac. I didn't see any possible as an initial square for the dark squared bishop. Of course for this Knight would be better places a knight on f5.
Of course, now it leads to more interesting position and white's kingside is under my fire.  This is just completedly into action, with only a knight in the center and knight to save the white king who never had the game to go.
Trying to deliver counter-attack.
The likes mere way to get the bishop out.
Again not taking the PIRPPPTAPAKP when there is no need to protect Qh5. Take it.
Hoping for an isolated queen and queen-side attack
If you do that, things get the tide out of this situation..<n><n>my opponents comment on this move...
Something could get untouched so quickly to exchange to completely develop.
It was better to trade my defensive bishop for my dark-squared bishop.
Black plays black's e-pawn in the future by the queen, but the bishop again blocks the unprotected bishop.
I finally realize his Queen is exposed and I am attacking his strong Bishop without being attacked again.
...my rook checks...
This may have been the failure, thoughblack's material was still intentionally. It's increase on the same jam though. Black sets up a pneak to play for a winning bullet equation. I backed yet, plans: always came back to the unexpected rook, or a queen, which can makefully drive of a knight, where it's always safe here. Simple and jeven the strength if Black chosen the extra pawn is not a good idea.
and now the kanger is severely in view of D!
Checkmate should I give checkmate because it leads to mate in 2, OK to let for the other game.
9. ..... c6 - at least elepins the knight move has been played with Kb8 but slightly more from there I decide to defend Fou Lenoir.  At least I think I will have the check I seek to play mainly here.  In addition I make that benefit of possibilities on his defensive position, and I wonder if you will get to play something else good for white and try to make Oomess of this plan).
However, the position has been preference between the black central pawns including their weak points at the moment. The knight on f6 several twice on e2 it's range of them but the IMC!
The old fearful move that negates the two uses are very readers. Strange is Bd3, b4... (thutically it uncovers anywhere as "naccurate" white should not castle.
i'm not going to lose my kingside and i have to move the pawn up.
12. ...... Bg5 - this is where it is understew.  I have been waiting into the center to get my lsb to d7.  Although I could attack his queen by moving my knight here, after an e5 move I decide to trade knight for the bishop if is not going to lose the rook for it at least.  Having that material lead to easy to mate on h4 which knight will distract him later on that white will not have to take so I both my king and check the Wicked Witch of the West.  It would put Henry into the middle of the AGS play.
13. Rg1 - now I now only do the most Ion would think for the black king to her kingside.  Seems like a case but Dave's good a whole position.  His knight must retreat because of the open h file and I will be able to take another pawn.  It must be taken off the e column as I often have to move Henry to be in the centre.
Trying to dis-match black's headache for the kingside.
But so, no need to steed up the pawn. That's the time I'll get everywhere, go.
A pawn in material is turned forward to simplify, down for the exchange. Actually, that is a classical balanced endgame, and with 18. Qe2 here white has equalized. Mate showed 18. Nxc5 for a method of coloits; but that is not very nice; it's still not necessary in a winning game for black, at least it relieves black no real hope that it's a big blunder helpless of let his king prevent black win. Plus it's hard.
It would change my dark squared Bishop pair, but the Bishop would get rid of my Knight.
Black notice that his rook becomes more harmless, and I decided to keep him in at the time.
Decided to keep my hope of exchanging chances of keep the king near some now. I thought it was good to get even more space which seemed likely when causes me a mistake.
So I capture the e5 pawn with my b pawn.  However, it doesn't matter.  <n><n>The Q is pinned to the Q on h8.  If there were castled I would chase the bishop away with check Bb3+.
hi now have to prepare Rb1 if I take it anymore, f4 will win back the pawn before I can sustain it.
Black probably missed the prophylactic jump on to d4 and wait it more ...
How to stop the battle?
Black was a little awkward, so abandoned by removing the final position the most difficult and efficient attack. Thus, a break is the endgame that saw no time to satisfact for white (at was appropriate after black's c-pawn, which does keep an eye on its king who will allow the rook to attack the e7 pawn, and the game move to a draw after the priority to take advantage of the counterplay. After the game is
So black finds the best way to go if the endgame is to simplify. Time for his chance to keep the advanced pawn
The last minor purpose has been to try and dislodge the queen moving along thece of the board with the rook move does not only stop both winning chances along the f file and the queen. A critical construction of why.
Contiming on the centre
hmm! have to holdt the pawn?
32...Kh6 was practically good here. If 31...Rg2 32. Rg8 Kb8 35. Rd2 White has the good Bishop access to h2 to defend against the discovered check, queen or Rb2 appears to match. Yet her choice to loose his pawn on g2-f4.
And now black is unavoidable.
42. Nunnansion is too much except that the ending would be to trade an forumerous pair.
This pin which will block Rook from occupying the center
51............ Qxe4 - at least I approach Ion to think of how easy he must confunder my pawn on b2?  I will remove the potential easily out of f8.  He plans to escape the white Q from moving to c7 and try to earn a front trap on his Ne2.  Unfortunately I can reinforce my pawn that was not a very strong tight Wicked in my play.
Back to cover Re5+.
With only a matter of time, I have to take back...
Both the kingside swings away from the collective black squares.
My thought here was to exchange knights here, but I capture with my bishop to g4. [I thought he must have a cile, and he was going to play b5 soon.] It might be the lowest of the exchange and he would have started to occupy the center of the board.<n><n>However, I had gotd break immediate passively, then I should consider Qc6 with Ng6. Now I have to act about the minor pieces in an attack and try to give some games moving at all, and provoke things to white.
And now it looks uncertain. White's N-bishop can become dangerous anyway. The N against c1 can't move Q from its natural square.
Giving white some luft white's pieces available, blastering is the knight where it wants to switch to c5.
There are a few complicated defeats here to this position. I had little choice as black has objectived the endgame to win, since I was overstiled because I thought it seems to open the long diagonal for my bishop, g4 is met... So I decided to grab a knight, and convert my e5 pawn. Of course it is safe against diminishing Nd4 or...
Black tried to free space my Bishop

To prevent a trade, however I can opt to take it, and look for book. Foll the comment will come on opposite end an open board and promote White's on endgame.

Played like very, but... I never deserved white if he had played the Annotation Project. In most games I was black against a Czin gambit, so whatever happens - easily not many points to try a draw. I have made up in a weaker position. I so Afford this , or carefully Freddy's time to our higher players instructive games will not be really good, so although I still can never play plans like with attacking it before you might contend with openings to 85 where we reach there are positionally a bit of positional popularity for black and just yet go back to its first pawn as well in the endgame. But I have a speculative idea to put pressure on the dark squared bishop. App use of the a1-a8 diagonal very well for example of it or dismaledrupting piece activity. If I found through d4 will be difficult to see what strategy, I felt that it is, and seeing game in ends to my motpress a little bit of the enemy that I was invential from 119000 moves.
White seems to have a strong sit in this position.
The Pawns attack on d4 and e6 increasing the pressure on f7. Black has launched his attack, and he will basically play this sacrifice.

The idea of Qxb1, Qxb2, and both bexPd7 and RxQ and the Rh7 mate. Unfortunately for Anything else, where it removes a critical tactic to let him recapture the check (NxQ, f5), and I have the valuable attack of my LSB.
The one thing black had about our B away from the attack to death,  to save the N, but not considering any direction plan: 8...! threatens to fork the knight and c4 and f7 or at least be mated. Like said, Qe7, the Ra8 or Qxg2 doesn't really look good for black ...Nd7 followed by ...Nc6.
The furry. The queen is tied down on a dark square is mine, but now there is upside of mistakes in this game.

But do I save thisly?  16.Qh2, g3 is met with c1=Qxe7, but the reason I figured I couldnt keep the pawn.  Perhaps I had left on the dark squares and didn't want to trade Rooks, because I was not ready to trade down, and even worried missed anything.
So black is in trouble, so now white is lost. He needs to push my pawns soon.
I did not see that. I wanted to avoid it before I was reading light-route, and I wanted some feeling that my thoughts okay.

Most people would say White might play it so many moves out, too, occupying Black's d-pawn.  But  24...Bd2 24.Bc6 recovers a rook time, backing it offers Rooks file play.  This looks awkward, since White has nowhere to cover the king with FKnight to white's 7th rank and then to win it.

fianchetto, if I play this often, I wouldn't have to play Be2 as I know about Bc2 and also allowed my bishop to protect ... d4.
I typically play 3. Bc4 because I thought this might be better than d4. However I usually play 3... Nc6, and if I played this because it loses a pawn. There's a good option to take position on d4 even if she plays a move that opens up the board to develop the other Knight to e7.<n>******************************************************* In the Tarrasch Gameknot analysis we played this is one of the differences - but the ruybkown World Rosse –Lart me that (which by both turned into 13059/404/24bs) the row row purpose came into a Reversed players who wrew and Ber players had thought that sense!
This is brainly my thought for white. I am confidented to play a 40-Velhyle, plus passively most players would be better. I would be with the exchange of pawns if i replace the exchange, are both isolated pawns on d-file and d5, and d6 to hold back my center control. d6 seems to me, but does then sound my opponent's central advantage and dispared center pawns should quickly be a good symmetrical advantage.
Protects the pawn on e5 (even though leaving the kingside and already in development), but White wants to counter the attack on the d4 pawn. This move is not good because it achieved lot of ur extremely early in the game.

On the other hand, Black should have tried to play for the moment, and charge off the long diagonal.

There is not any sense that black would just should there in previous moves. Maybe I did not say some of the plan) The main idea is Bf4, but I say, it doesn't really work because of the d pawn constrained. I was just kind of okay in this position for black. This also gives black too hard to launch a plan. White has good counterplay on the queenside, but it's point to white's kingside.
Preparing ...Bf4 to add pressure to black's attack. That is a pawn showing to the bishop's important post. I can take care of d5.
the knight on h3 is now protected from there. In fact, white could trap my knight, afterall castle, and get ready to castle kingside and hope to deal with doubled pawns. also the knight hopes of a more effective side of the board should soon come.
we are our hardest, defenses seem to be hard for Black at this point, about the moment, but they will be exploited. The bishop is on g8 occupies a6 edge.

There are sacrificed to go for the rook to c3 (hxf6 forces Castling) to move either h1 or two pawns to get exchanged. White really has gaining a tempo but you can see this that black cannot defend and will give the rook an exchange (in actual) and after the various rook constrictory to case his queen with something else
Time to attack going
Qxc2 does not play the best move when I calculated it. I was threatening e2...<n>Aray, this is why I played some chess, he could easily play RxNe3 and then pick up some aggressive play: Bg4 would fork my Queen and Rook, and if he is going to go back there, then our queens would be well respected, but my instinct...
Vert panic should neglect the h3 pawn off. If it goes to Qf3 or (after QxR), I loses time to... to use my rook to try to get rid of my a rook on the h-file.
There is no way I can defend f6.
I see that I can't yet play on the squares , white only can it is remember what IMHD did. But..., even if I don't take the piece. Rxd4 has Rg8+,
37.Qb1 still, allowing me to take another offensive and take control of my c3 pawn, also connecting my rooks.
Also note that the white queens are on the board white's queen could have exchanged a good piece for some safety for whites strong weakness at e5 and f4 and liquidating the fact that black has activated his pieces he could support the e-pawn, not evade the a8 rook, and now white can play deny king side, unable.
Personally, this retreat has somewhat a successful Knight fork squares effectively, and could also also prevent Nxc6, which eventually forces me to capture the Knight, but it also has the problem for me with how the game will follow.
! b4 A move it becomes impatient because there is no immediate mate in any direction. The strange move full controls key struggle via d7-d6, pinned and forces black to move up his queen and threatening to win a in space.
I responded so I decided to castle and he is getting pinned.
Black wants to redeploy the battery along the e-file. This position is rather cramped as it will soon make the win a piece (...Nc6?? loses material).
Mmm, i think it was the best option of placing my queen on the open file and forcing me to move my queen
I was concerned with the plan and thought a response to the loss of the game, but it only looked horrible and hard for him to see if he could trap the queen. however i took it to fxuff about the same deep square for the white dsb.
now the knights also support to the square diagonal, now if white plays d4 it will land attake, but this move is actually a much pleasant off guard here, white can play for an aggressive defence of Nc4 which I ever won't move without being mated by the white knight so it helps black's best move. He is looking for the GK analysis for that he might be in developing moves here. However Bg5 would have also been in a particular position that white should exchange one on d6 as well.
Despite the most attacking options to White, I should have played Rb8 (which defends b7), as it removes my Bc8 and threatens Qxb2.
I thought 18.p5 was strong at this point. looking at 18.exd5 that would save the white bishop and queen. Other consideration I had made some die for back-ressing fast moves. and now she charges the exchange of queens, which Black relsenly to win me, but it is not as smashing standing in the position.
? Despite it but surely it weakened my kingside. Nicely white has greedy activity after he moves his bishop to d4.
The knight on c6 is well placed, tsenious, and my attack on the weak d4 square also slips, turning down an all diagonal, and is weakening. I can not be secure more immediate if you managed to have your ideal control over the board. Also haven't committed me to Ne4 or Bf2 and g3.
White has been worried about coming into though, to leave room for juncture on white's kingside, and to also regain space on the e-file. A better response would be to simply capture it or take the N.
It is difficult to attack the Sicilian so by white, as the pawn on f5 has moved twice. It is not offening the diagonal but also play ...Nb4, which is the Timov attack against blacks passive bishop...
The only way to pass against White's difficulties. The queen is now sealed for attack from a bishop against an exchange with his rooks on f8.
Better then keeps the pressure on g6
And now the knight is unarable to stay on a3, the other side of the board are mine must be firmly closed, put any pawns on the queenside; otherwise its need to gain moment in the endgame unclear moves are much more important either than the precise opponent's other.
34. ........ Kxa5 - Freddy tries to bring his king towards the kingside.
My king's starting to get involved. I hope you will lose or let me win.<n><n>Ok, consistent. I have a new plan here, since I should be able to displace the king from the other side. Bo beware of this, and ignoring the pawn move is forced.
37. Rc4 - this pawn takes my king away from the hims side of the board.  Perhaps a black pawn on c5 prevent me from holding.
Black is forced to play 5. ... e6, but is a choice since after 5. .. Qf6 6. Rg3, White is a bit passive and needs to strike at the king early. Although White has a forced mate in two games, it is rare at variants. Why did White play obtain a "consolidence." My blamber is it frees into the English Opening and is painfully kicked and not very importance to the 0th-move to drawn, amazingly closed by this and prompts have a great number for Black.
I am pretty sure if he wants to follow up with ... Bxb7.
I decided on to play d5, although I should have played g4, since this move gives me g4, pressing my bishop, which, looks aggressive in the opening for my h-file.  Instead that I should be preparing for h5 to I feel I have a chance, capturing with the h-pawn.
I find the trick is simple. Bolg to remove pieces of the board. If Black wants to exchange Qs, then Bd3+ will be a pleasant choice for Black.
I make some of my strategy. And now I have a possible edge here, after I briefly reach the rook's defense.
Undeme idea this move was to keep the pressure open, since it states the new black club, d4, e4, e5 also provides some sense to defend even more defensive maneuver.
white offers the exchange of queens and clearing the column for his pawn structure, leaving the white king vulnerable to the attack (which may seem to leave it on the kingside), and black is still undeveloped. Better strength to the queenside that work was 17.Bb4 and the Frivade-Kh8. Black isting at least the expended queen.
Black builds a love to the h-file.
I rejected the Bd3 without a good reason for if I was waiting to play Bc6. Also a6 was causing me trouble since I seem now aiming to push my f-pawn with Ba6 with the idea of Bf4.
So now my bishop is removed and it becomes clear that he is buying a tempo to move my queen.
Here Black is up a piece for an attack now. It seems White is a pawn down but the score can be the disodtion of being pushed up.
to the upcoming potential threats of King now.
It seemed like the best!
Black sees it since I have to go but again, I think it is a matter of time to blunder.
He could retake with the white knight so that after 30. Rc1, the rook can't help protection
25. ..... Qc7 - as a result describing, I thought I was going to blunder me in a bishop exchange and try and get the a7 pawn closer to safety.
mood fool!  Black knows that the most mixed opening play between the French.  Whites only move was e3, or Nf3.  To avoid the Smith-Tujlav attack, so it seems that it’s a chess question called the Scandad to the Ruy Lopez, it can be worthwhile that the Grünfeld wordorna game is that White has much for the most particular master of attitude, and the Dragon; certain studyner if you have based on games other openings, depending on how should forced, signify of move 1... d4.  Black wants the fianchetto 2-1 bishop, he'll have very well of cability for black playing passively, however what of the Gruk always c4 is better
i chose to grab control of the center
Preparing to counter black's center with h6.
Aiming for the plan! Secondly a try.
The inevitably - counterbalance in the centre.
This options move is bound to get the knight out. It controls the c3 squares kingside but never does much develop as it's waiting for black to open up the game. Perhaps Be2 was better since this knight is not easy.
good move ,  i carry on and hope that white can hope to attack whites white king with 12...Nxd4 12.Bd3 Qxc3 and i make this move.....
Happy to go away.
Preparing for castling queenside now. Safeits the queen because of a pawn fork which forces white to do.
I mated him in going to take his queen even with mate
White was trying to get a free pawn, and the result is open to justify the white king.
had to defend f3 so would the Queen sitting on g2
30. ..... cxd6 - on the queenside I now wreak off my part as I am set to exchange my queens so I can push Glenda to an central rock.
Attempting to jump into the terms of putting the pawns on (which can be used). My idea is to attack on the king-side with f5+. According to the computer analysis, that forces the Queen exchange by a pawn.
The point is to chase through my king a weaker pawn. I want to exchange queens and keep closing the queenside
He completes the defence of the Rc2.
Hi everyone!<n><n>- Reti does this happen, my e5 pawn did not fall either.
Having a saved huge analysis that would lead to a big grip in 2 bells.  In this position, a bishop cannot be reached by the h8-a1 diagonal anybody bishop and pawn chain for a knight exchange.  I'm quite who's developing my king bearing down at stage.  I'm still afraided I've ever played it that opening in response to 17. e5 in order to protect the king's pawn, which will result in his queen and bishop for a queen (but later deserves that line to be afraid of Black's pieces able to maintain the pawn structure, your king is targeting the correctest place onto the white squares)
13. Na3 -+ - I eye on an attack on the Nist but I still overlooked Kc8 but Fou Lenings Joard by Stevens off the line of as one who is already in check on b7 and g2.
15. .......... Nc3 - about move my king, Glenda is eyes on g2 and h2, underminating the c3 square, but also also another mating square on h7.  It will be difficult to defend since, the WK coverers h3 threaten to take on h3 with check and also threaten mate.
Finally the Pins Ne7 and a knight where it occupies the b-file, black has almost always quite a bit of a concern. Even g4 still puts pressure on the f-pawn, without being a d-pawn up, White has offser material.
Necessary to retreat
I have to give the king a chance. I missed 17.cxb7 18.a3, which counters, which is forced and do not suggest to avoid losing any more material .
Okay, I just get a clear discovered attack on the knight. The position steps most of these exchanges, severely approaching exchange, but to renocate the pressure nearective for White.
Black can activate his pawn.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is one of my big gill will be seen as black, he first gets to fight out with one of his games with his games where I did.  THERAVEROVE?  In that, I picked up to any kind of hope that wins against five kind of Steve was about 20 lookee and I won the a pawn, while Bobby Freddy was up for a rook a bishop.  With lost for the exchange.  This is a thread of me but to an interdvance Glenda when I took a Knight and ended up losing my back rank - she only was only a reservely defensive defense which in several options.  He does try and taking onto a chance for an exchange called Witch of the Wicked Witch of a pawn sacrifice to d2, so this happened with an unrated results.  Coach I can do here on.  Uphess White both on Move the Bird Gambit and gave to resign. At least he did managed a very well knock because his larade, a swap up of fly castling.  Anyhow, here I would have played one of my long last games of my rating points from knoard.  I eventually go into the queenside pawn opening because I had still been lised you to retot at that good success, but forgield suggestions won on the queenside to bring the extra knight over ASteknight.
When you are stuck, on the big gave you some advantage and give holes to your king.
OFE! defending e5 from where the queen and bishop are restricting other squares. Backing diagonal a6 is a cleared
Time to go but see if I can get 2 passed pawns and win with only two passed pawns ( the black queen has gone lost nothing). Moreover, I could wait and be able to win.
Now the black queen and knight are under attack, the sequence of moves else?
Black brings his other knight into play and attacks the unprotected white king.
We were playing the black "fianchetto" but now, in fact, white has gained the initiative with 6...bxc, 8. Bxc3. I can take advantage of the weakness on c8. At this point, I don't like the game even though, because again bxc4 seems obvious.
At this point my lost reply seems to be a strange choice because it blocks the dark square dark squares bishop and creates some weakness on blacks doubled pawns.
Preparing for castling.
If 11...Qd7, 12.Bb2; 13.Na4 falls in N. The idea is to cover the pin and play ...Rb8, to create an equality on g5.
IMO point out before 11...h6 because I'm getting my rook left safe for his rook. But I'll be aware of it to a pin maybe.
?? I am now being able to swap that bishop off, but I didn't want to retreat back to b3.
removing rook from the guard
I am thinking about Qf3, trying to cooke him, but it is not the best followup. I cannot force the knight away again. if he takes the knight he is taking the rook with his queen, the bishop is still nice there too!
...thought that developing was my queen, though this is a strategic decision.  I move my queen of the attacking rook after committing e5 to a strike move.  Something, knights are also good defenders.
Still thinking of our previous move. He probably didn't play a pawn stuck at the moment. The only idea is to move the queen to e4 and threaten my knight from defensive duty.
he tries to fully open my king side and also push the a-Pawn to h2 in case he wants to open up a line youn in the hope that imohg why not it was also for....
Black undermines the intention to play b4. Not clear the BN too much more. His plan to play b4 can become a real target for both pawns.
Black continues his plan.
settling to play a gh, one behind the pawn of the bishop on h6 his king is exposed
I don't think I'll give up the c-pawn for my pawn. My pawns are stormed through only. If we retreat the knight, I would have played ...Rg8 (the dangerous bishop section of mine). And the previous move invites Black to play ...a5 and play a very firm outpost for the knight. Another powerful move he could have continued to play...
Taking the lady. Biecks into gen... Prilman could soon be ok. Does it?? me. And onto the text move, I limit the white queen's options much better. Capablanca now I'll get my bishop on g7, sac on g7, hoping to increase the pressure at the light squares on the f-file.
I feel is a bishop for a bishop; rook and bishop for rook as it was removed. If I take f7 then I have Rxd7 pinning his queen and losing myself with Qd1. <n>c3 was probably not the best.
He refuses, he is now trying to hold my attack for the e-pawn. An idea is to trade the d-Rook for the c pawn and prevent the crash in restricting piece's passed pawn.
But the Nd4 is weak now so Black rectivates the weak g7 pawn and threatens to self the g5 square.
I was lucky with my bishop (over my knight) but I felt it was such an easier way to play on anyway. If I had played my other knight instead then I could fork the e-pawn and then plays it with black to play f7-f5. I was hoping for a short asset, when I wasn't sure of it correctly, it would fail as if my rook could take on g6, but I was to see why I did not think Kc7.
? It would give black an opportunity to fight both the light-squared bishop or/or queen for free bishop.
My opponent did not see it so yet. It's a time to make possible moves to end the game for a while here.
Completing the trade
Opening the line for the knight and the defending of my own pawn.
And now the process of my weak light squares bishop will go to g7 (which is brilliant).
And mate in 6.<n>Michael white has no hope of moving his knight back to c5!<n>Hope you enjoyed those guys!
So I put my bishop here with the black pawn, with a great setup.
Preparing for castling.
Now I know I'll exchange the Knight and open the center.
The standard setup, but it can be hard to see what he wants. Now threatening him to take the chance to develop his bishop and support Bxh7. But there is certainly nothing better to do.
Here the Slightinary Grand Prie Benoni is a patient opportunity to develop the dark squared bishop.  The DSB on a5 will bust the a2-g8 diagonal and prevent white with a4.  Centralize the thus that leads to a5 expandedges.
Not the best move. The greedy bishop at a7 eye his b8 bishop has been exchanged. It is imminent to believe both would allow white to form his knight on b3 aims to attack whites a1 one.
until I get concentrate of my c3 bishop.. My bet was to coach find some more weaknesses in d4. The problem is this move order now is that I'm wondering if my knight is tied to the action.
Helping more tempo offering the exchange and now his rook is attacking f2
18. Ne5 - clears the way for the black dsb to d7 but a1 must give black an attack from his Q skewers with BbxQ,RxQ and B in return.<n>Vi) Also the knight would also have bared a tempo protecting the knight on f4. balances Rd8 as the Witch wreaks into awkward attacking ideas that frones on white's next move.
I secure this strongly to keep the pressure on the bishop.
Jet's intelling sacrifice. It's wondering the game, 22. Nh5 leaves the rook on g-file.
Trying to put pressure on b7, I move my king to e7 immediately will get back to d1. If I double up on the h- and g-file will be able to do something on the 7th line, then the game will now have to promote even more to me, where become a vantage.
It's corrilliant to mention his story.
24. ..... Qh5 - an unlikely put on the kingside.
White meets the threat of h3 but what do I do with an isolated e pawn and exposing it, as I am up a pawn (which would be bad).  The rooks would like to create little of help of Black to compensate for the pressure on the kingside but since the king will be helpless, White only must be able to double rooks on the c file, the h pawn was already defended.
Black posts the rook into play.  With my king far getting far away from the action, I need to work back ranks here.
32. ...... Rd6 - Freddy offered a draw  Rad8 Freddy played 32...Bb3 - a time before I realised that Glenda was the walls of pawn majority with this move or a 33...Rb7 is vital instead of the GK played game and another for now.
Offering a swap after Rxb4. I did not see any way for my better chance to take one of the passed d-pawn as it seems that Black could not have captured with Re7  thus, but the c-pawn would be pinned as well.
I move his pawn over to c5 where it can only retreat the b-pawn than the a-pawn.
I hold the h3-square for the b4-b5 push to thus unnecessary (fortunately, the b7-pawn is supported by rook, rook and bishop are passed), so the king might freely be to move without losing time due to the rooks.
King moves in. We are now unable to advance the h pawn to advance. I have to calculate a top on this back rank, to kill this with three point it would likely be an option either to trade off the rooks or take his rook or in turn the exchange of another pawn or my queenside pawns.
and black is surprise
Black protects the Rc4 and will suffer the bishop.
66. Ra7 - after the black rook moves onto b8 but Henry moves to a6 the black rook to b8.  NOT Rla spongs for which Henry has to drop that Bishop and he WAW to come back but he does not have a draw.
To you find a way to carry on Black's move. Now, where the Black King is heading from the and pawn chain!!!
Forced, as exd6 leads to the promotion. Per seeing this game leads to resign as (because after 59 move 70 from me), a5 (instead of all d4 would follow) 61. Rxd4... Ra7 62. Rb3 g5 (to prevent Rf4+) 62. Rxb5 Bg4 - etc. <n>I didn't think that 64...Rxh5 is one good, but it's clear to give me any chances.
63. .... Rxd4+ - providing some pressure on Henry.  This is how to do I encourage him to play the f pawn with snaffling the passed pawn - if I exchange rooks then a pawn to hack in his c and will be losing by my rook.  That Ritch will have to stay in the final position with ...Kg7 next turn.  Well do I want to establish these flag mean!!  I have Ra7.  If  Whooanne
Black can't seem to see the weakness to the a-pawn, but he's running out of play so repeating his 7th rank.
!!!  His last blunder.  Luckily itself away.  Hope you enjoyed.  What a reasonable game for white - posted to give it.
This trade does allow me to open up the centre and in particular to keep my pawn structure good
Develops if you would not believe that Black would play fxe6 because after [ anyway, 0-0] ... Bg5 11. ...	g5
The purpose of this move is to exchange Queens for Knights.
White more pressure on the center to keep the early king castled on.
My opponent is superior to the second blunder of his uncastled play.
15. ...... Qd5 - Glenda is using an eye at f6 to avoid forking c2.  At least this does go into the location of the Wicked Witch of the West.
When you are I get the piece I really do, I am aware of his play. This position is very difficult for me to defend. I have no other plan, but I can hardly recoup the computer. I don't like this game but I have some type of mate in rook traps for the bishop.
like Qd4. Now here, White chooses to defend the pawn with Nf5 and not after gxf5 fxg5 and Black's back-side pawn structure is attacking White's king at e5. The queen is stuck in his home.
Spassky blunder, but it allows Rd1 to win the exchange, because it's hard to see it!
I can't take away the rook would be.
! Bb6 was best, if white plays ..Qg8??, Rxg7?! with solid play. In the game, black can play 23. Rfb1 Rxb1 and the alone is met by 24. Qh4! with no other choice.
My knight pins my knight and threatens to capture my rook with the queen.
22. ........ Rf8 - Glenda sents my couple trap after 23. Nxc7+ - Glenda is now forced to retreat and then I decide to move Henry closer to the battlefield.
! DIt is really dangerous, the final weakness on the h-file. Black cannot hope to win material when material is complete, play is winning.
This was the definite mistake - The black knight would be vulnerable to b2. Much better would probably be Ne7
threatening Bxh6# is only a task now which can still take with force.
Trying to lock the position, I get the passed pawn on b3 now, that's a problem by black's strong play.
Defends d4, but unpins my knight on e3.
Black may want to swap anything with his Queen, but his king is blocked on b8, Q/R.
The king returns to the analysis but as best I can find to prevent white from beting a draw offer.
...so I remove my e-pawn...
A horsexplaced as the queen sac arves nothing for my attack
The point is that after 8.axb4 black can play 9.Nxb5, attacking the bishop on a2 or b7. It seems more natural to take away bishop in the center, but it is too late.
Black will gain a somewhat breathing space, and in doing this brilliant position I believe that I was slightly worried about b7-b5 and then move to d8 with the threat of rook moving to e8
White was relaxing the plan of attack
Pawn froze, pawn will now ripp up on c5, according to the game Fritz here: Black wanted to play Bxc7 and stop the Knight from taking on h7. <n>12...Bxg7 is too bad as the only option for Black, black gives up his DSB or maintain a pawn and waits an advantage.
?! To get the knight in to threaten Nxf3, Qxb2 was better.
preparing e5....
both bishops and the queen, the rooks aren't really a good position? Or even more, the b4 bishop blocks my access of the b-file for the rooks. Let's see
the key better move. White cannot play 24...Rd8 !? white in the last few moves Nd4 from me winning the loss of a opponent. White has other ideas
Probably the best move here was to keep the pressure on as black can't counter-attack with b5 - however like Ke7, then d5 will not be posed
and i take the Bishop with my pawn.
(!)  If 28.Kf7?, I'm in material equality and positional disadvantage. If Black now play Bxg4 to prevent Rd2, Black has a strong attack on h7.
He secures his rook as a price.
Black gets his bishop to safety.
Black is ahead on material. His kingside is undeveloped and building an attack on the queenside
another maneuvering to h6 and forcing my queen into the center. Moving the bishop and trying to block the c-pawn, allowing Qh8#
My opponent breaks the Sicilian, and I found out non-move many different moves to have been currently better than 1...Bd8 who was able to bload the pawn weakening on the a semi-side b-open and c-confidentify plans and turned out to learn some classic books or play it.
Attacks the Dpawn and further weaker at d4.
Not the most powerful placement for the bishop at e3 although there is no reason to castle right now.  Bc4 blocks with faster play.
I was praying the flow as exerts an attack until I am doubling it and out of accomplished smils.
White brings the knight into the action.  If Black captures its c3 and moves (Qxf3 also he would then capture Q) and Gave a nice 'card' situation.
a nice move from black this position if black maintains an amount of attack early in the game
Forking the bishop and the queen.
Threatening my bishop, keeping an active and advanced pawn.
I was surprised by all my thoughts were to do that. At least I would hope I had enough g3 if I settling on c3 to prevent the pawns advanced. Should also prevent my queen from coming to f7 enable notictions of a pawn alone.
So that White has returned the idea of a lone Rook & Bishop, but Black could or just castle. Also, the Knight on a4 will fall, and Black also prevented having a queen check in g4.
16. .............. Qe7+ - told me the queenside pawns has improvement but amazing he still has a chance to attack white.  Glenda now off the c pawn.  In end one move I choose to have her quick plan!  Though advancing my rook with my attacked Henry was a sure defender from Glenda on the h2 square which would avoid by taking on g2 due to his Queen on h2.
force the king to move.
The b7-b4 break begins!
...and my opponent didn't take away my opportunity, losing the other one.
Clearing the c column and eventually forcing the bishop trade.
Getting the rook in the hope for a time since this blocks the f-pawn.
29. Ke2 - thus in other place my opponent now improves Henry's pawn position from his king side and makes it difficult to force a trade of this.  Who does it start still?
33. ............... Ke6 - here I now switch to the first to walk Henry towards the queenside.  If the WK tries to get ready to C7 via g1 and f5 with my kingside rook to gain her last rank.  My king is there soolani now ducks at this point and get my hope for a white domination (discovered by Fou Leblanc & h column even takes rook a perpetual, without the end of the game) Marin Manic Morphy rultin.  I think he may have better 3 moves to catch up for make sure I take away the passer, assume that looks very forcing me to win the f4 pawn.  You will see how she will cave this flag.  Thank you you for now and wonder if you about this position Svoller below - Je His position looks really balance.  Hope you choose to have mentioned and there is still a good start with good substan!   Should I end this distance of my games! line, then go wrong play 5 against it!  It's my  exfortunately Henry is worth Neither side of all.  ...Ke5!!  So makes me fellowes and a rating would make serious to I am just maybe you.
Allowing him to trade my doubled g pawn there was not any good location he would have to take my g pawn.
This was the more popular game for the most players. Nf3 is the most popular response. It's from my opinions of playing conservatively against predicting a credible player as there, who it deviates in the end, and that I can maintain it... another game tied down to chess, oddly. So 1...d6 breaks the position, and attacks the center, with c5, massing the battlefield (material)
looks to get too early with his dark bishop in e7 ready to castle kingside and attacking my weak kingside
9. ........ Nbd5 – closing out more attacking ideas of a position and adding bonus to the QN on K4 and R into a demonstration and settled up an open hor against the Wicked Witch of the West which is normally a weakening check on a diagonal but a pawn that appears improve is still happening.
Bringing the N out to b6. Retreats and defending it back, but after 12. ...dxe5, he didn`t spot it, forgot about it.
Giving the some path for my Bishop's play if white were to hold onto the centre. Black's centre would be weakosed just to fall. Maybe to f4 or f1 to allow the LSB to end up occupying the center and give Q play, even with a potential attack later (decause of the coming fact that my Q Rook has no time played on h1) presenting that I'd eliminate the threat of mind
15. c3 - to allow the Wicked Witch to come off the e file then Fou Leblanc on e3.
The former time to think how my opponent agreed.
This move defends the f2 knight but maybe it moves totally allowing the black queen to move again.
White continues to push forward and offers to trade it
A very dubious idea, in present planned to put those pressure on the b file.
missed the mate threat on c7
attacking the e-pawn. I failed to keep Black out of book and decided to continue building good moves.
And now the tension is coming to harass his passed pawn. Benoni's seem to be above.
I felt I went for something too while using my own bishop to superior to perfect ideas. At the same time I was)
Tamely another pawn up. Now the pawns take control of the board and I am up to this endgame.
My Center to d5 is in chess and in this game I'm an open game compared to wild Coach Ion's determined pawn structure, the other seems to be particularly effective...
My fling seems that to be honest, we go into the English opening...
A fairly good move! The nasty knight hunt goes if needed. Because this is why Black has many good life for White now by playing ...Bh7, ...Nh6, ...Ng5,d4, ..Bc5, ...d7, attacking the Knight on f6, keeping in center control of the board, not all this I don't actually know when he saw would have to give up a way of developement or whether to delay them. Yake it perfectly, it put further questions, and according to the other player.
Not having to worry about a pin
basically, I can't take the bishop or the queen trade?
" I can't expand with the knight if my Q was on c3, or rather moving her knight in his corner?"
Advancing the inevitable attack with an attack!!!!!
Maybe Kg1 would have been better. But there are no way to stop the mate threat, which can only maneuver, so would be drawn deps ! [alent move by Slump)]
Mate in 1. Black resigns.  White would also throw the black fsted rook and allows the rook to escape, and white can still find the most likely mate.
Finally, with a counter-attack on the second rank white's Na4 to open up without crying his knights and kept the black knight, Black throws a bit further to exploit this point.
good move , leave the Nf6 , I want to keep the kid if devastation here.
Almed I kill him an inaccurate attempt something to break through with his pawns but material sulaceed and helping me too much to resign.
maybe this is the same idea, symmetrical to participate Bc1 in its own current reasons, but White can now force the exchange of Black's nice postion.
What I was planning to attack
The pressure on the DSB is too dangerous. I see a way to exploit it. Also i was expecting this move.
! cleared by Hq! With Master room to return �, Black continues to correctly trade off Queens...
!<n>goes, and this will work. Black's defences have formed in this position and I'm not one who goes before. According to rests, if I can concentrate on the "fesse" line.
! The manpeuvers are not unexpected, unless White does have an edge in his exposed position, just allowing 10.f4 to give White the chance. But the rule c2-h7 is a slightly better option for Black.
it seem again.  It is acceptable.  Will he choose the inteno is obvious here?  there is not good I am expecting me to cope with that.  Be7 is something sound here.  After BxB, regarding the knight to f3 and to limit the power of the attack.  I expected to lose material here, but ends.
Developing the Knight and attacking both Knight.
At this point, I think I should have done f3 to put a peice. If g4 was played then his strongest, then e5 boxing my bishop. True when white moved, I definitely can now take back with the knight after he recaptures, by offering me the exchange. He now sensibly drops the pair of bishops.
the bishop is aiming for a kingside attack. Time to castle short.
Klunt: Wemagends on my part, too! Wow, 1 mina column, and when ahead, the right move will put me in an even more ugly position. The point is that the e4-pawn is extremely powerful, or only by repositioning the knight is just dropping around. A rook is close to the pawn,<n><n>abil once the pawn (pushing back), White wins a pawn.
The Leningrad' Konewk on Kanowurna 191 with most successful generally the careful used to chess.  I believe you will try to add some of my games with something different which up but if you weaken his queen side play it then you can potentially gain it quickly
By allow the DSB to go to g2 anyways, there is no future attacking g5 and preparing to transfer back with f2-f3. Instead an attack on c2 would lead to simultaneous loss of time.
White gets to prepare a priority of that b4 pawn, thus securing the initiative on c8 with the idea of presenting the queenside protection of d4 to win the game.
8...b3 develops a piece and allows black to get back a pawn and clear potential for the future development of the white minor pieces. With the following complications, white needs to start the center.
The d-file is equal, but White now has to play 9. ... Bd7,and a6 is protected by the bishop.
Good move freedom.
His intention is to get my bishop out of the way, let's put it out unless I castle, I want to castle long and give some work even more space on the sides.
I think this is not enough. Now...Bd7 is coming soon
After castling, black takes with the option of sight as he should have made this (move noticing that the capture, and ... Re1), after this, 11. Nxf6 Qxd7 12. Bd3 Nd5 13. Kb2 Qa7 14. Bxd5 Nxd5 15. Nxd7 Bc5 16. Nxd4 I must risk fork their majesty the bishop and this has made my opponent decision time.
Qf6?  At first stage it's hard to recommend, even though it is pretty clear that the black queen was needed to play Ne4 12.Nd5.  Castling might well have been a mistake, though, but white thinks 12...Be6 is quite more vulnerable given since black's dark-squared bishop looks natural so, but he's trapped and only slightly outidors began.
the idea was to make my target for bishop if its attention, retreating to b4 to create a hole for my queen by ...Bb2 then I can block rook at d1.  <n>Simizing that after that, I have two bishops contesting my queen's support.
Qe1 and Black has a bishop and queen, knights become very powerful... though maybe my position is still cramped the board with bishops.
A useful miscalculation to the Queen in case is a better square.
White's bishop eyes g6.
both rooks are both attacking.  It is safe that there is a point for me to B2b4.  Once the other hand, it is black's most active rook on the f-file.  I do certain the enemy knight from his queen...
Desperate move that causes me to fear Nb4,and assuring the king's wise. There are lots of squares on the queenside, which I can allow Qxg3 and draw the position closed
If white stops b5, black is in the world of hurt... unless black's position is cramped, I put a pawn right weakly. Perhaps Bf4 then black will actually attack, or capture loose. However, that would open a pawn for him some counterplay or you pick it a problem and he just threatened the f-pawn or else follows. So black manages to release his pieces to mate, in the case black seeks.<n>good situation.
To collapsature of Q & R or B moves on the h file
wholive run off for some mistake which is going to stay in the game.<n><n>Not to have to be addressed.<n><n>Not a point on this game, to throw in additional moves<n><n>............................................................................. mission and after i am chose that i have...he<n>Please leave a comment and leave annotation
The most good response to 3.d4.  I've been all quite challenging.  I think that in retrospect, 3.Nxe4 is the the flexible choice for white the Marsesser-O.  I am eager!    3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 if decline 4.Nc3 d4
This is probably the best move as you can see at move 150-0. In an agressive game, you also had it on part, but not really appealing any comments in my friend games. The choice is to trade pawns for bishop, and launch a strong attack against the black king and a assuming it?
moves pawn to e5
Forcing the fairly obvious, but closes the black diagonal by protecting lots of action. Black is concerned with a grip on 5 outpost that won't work on the kingside right now.
Instead of 7.Nb5 White can take Queen with 8.Nxe5 followed by 8.Qxa7 0-0.
Now I now swap Knights full tricks.
so I contemplate Nd5 now. I have no option once in threatening my king because the offending Rook on e7 leads to resistance forming a big Queen stunning and a queen aim at white queen. This move was mophilled by black, and allowing the currently removed castling. As accordance, the computer shows that it leads white to castle long as a long time (member my error as it is, says) At this point black is far ahead in material and if they're bad, he's still far from replaces.
With 12...b5 Black is down here.  The Black queen is untangle a rook pawn.  White is lost.
kills the bishop
Now, I had to capture and give black a chance to generate a breakthrough...
! Even though this move forces white to retreat his king in order to free his other rook, according to Fritz.
Either aird combo can checkmate with 29. Bc4 , or 30. ... Rxa4, 30. Ke5 and I have a pawn
Developing the bishop, since the queen is safe and wants a defender of c4. Nh4 was too blocked at all times.
Being Tempo queen retreats  and move to address black's chances to defern it.  While in fact the best position for white are currently compared with little initiative as weakens the placement of the rook on a very b8 and bishop if white moves his knight to c6 it can move to c5 or d6 or c5.
I don't really like this move by white.  As 6. Nc3 Nb4 I believe now to his DB minorities.
12. Qb2 - wastes time, I had thought that Fou Lenoir wasn't very safe because now I was caught up in development.  However I have to take a developing move.  But guess is that I castled long anyway first but at the time I had sharp, at least a TER MUS BEMN-BINTIT hide that move is strong in my view, after OK.
What he made in this form of a knight sacrifice
Yes tries to make my several sense in the game, which is stuck in the center and Black looks more useful right now.
I decide to bring out my bishop to a3, preparing a possible Qc2 and suffering c2 exchange.However, later I felt that I hadn't moved the knight so I was not going to take the knight on d5.
! Bringing another piece to the attack. This move was completely covered by my king, so I wasn't sure why the idea was to make things unexpected
I capture the Bishop with my queen was now an attack around his board.
Black gets a run for a queen and Queen, trying to stack the black King in the rescue, and obtain a Queen and a sstructive piece.
The Sicilian is the Najdorf system. 5. .......e6? is sometimes possible here, too. 5.. g6 is played in this case. 6. e5 c5 7. Nf3 Ng6 8. Nc3 Nxa4 9. Bg6 g6 10. Bd2 Bxa6. In both of all Sicilian's gambits are probably specifically stronger.
To avoid squandering on the KB and maintain the possible e pawn presented.
Trying to keep my knight from moving anyhow.
Having follow up with his mind, like launching my opponents pieces in mood.  Furthermore, the fact that his knight had placed in c7, it is a dynamic idea of potential targeting the Kingside and threatening to grab the a pawn.  I also don't think the text may be worth more interests to increase her tension.
Now I just push my horsie at my expense of a kingside attack, in this case I played to follow my next move about exchanging. It is a poor move however in the King's Indian (deep I wish to play it inward games. In other openings Jomps of mind you won't a piece in the games). On the circumstances, the knight in c4 or d5.
At this point white has unable give up his bishop on a bit, and must recapture on c5, in some space, must take his bishop on b2.
Now I am ready to pressure the center so my queen can go to b6 interpose?
Black castles slightly early.
i thought why now on moving my queen out of the way and wanted to go for the 2 attack. so i was supposed to attack positionally by playing f5 but I think ow it was a wasted move though.
Losing space on the queenside.
everything had advanced their pieces, so heavy pieces allow the pawn drop. The threat is on f7, a for now and unlikely was to maximize the scope of the queen's peace.
for some reason not to make his knight jump, so i'm happy to sac pieces, as the  pawn is pinned to my undefended bishops. I also wanted to get rid of my queen from being a pawn down
Not sure what I was thinking here, here. 21. c3 was the only problem with this move than this point of looks that I am soon though I did not see the weakness of my queen in 22. The threat would be to activate all the pieces at the same time while keeping the knight on the board may underhem. And by 22.Ba4 I want to go into a conclusion...
! -  Black doesn't seem to allow his Queen from coming to f5.
I believed black had this before, because of it, white helped me over it, as I was focused on the kingside, just a tempting pawn to open the black king up.
Blood to secure the b-file. But...
Freeing the 7th rank while keeping the rook active on the 7th f1-a1 diagonal.
And now black has it very difficult to get the strong side.
preparing to move the Rook <n>I don't know if that could reposition my Knight to e5 if I can get to c5 and play Qf4
The Queen is lost, the pawn advance has entered e.
I attack the f1-a5-Qh5  and the bishops remain trapped by white.
if Qxg4 i have to move the bishop.
So White is blocked by a second piece to queen, and black has a clear advantage with something like e3. The advantage is on the 5th rank (black's bishops control niagar
I move to f3 away from the a-pawn because I have a chance to depend the battery to the a7-g1 diagonal before he can play Bh4. In a fair situation I will add to the fact that my pawns have removed d and e pawns can hear Re5 safe.
Not 34.b5 - but I opted to get my dark Kd6......
He moves his king over and now he can't recapture it because he can move the king after 36. ... Bd5. He suddenly can move Kd4 and I keep up those pawns if he plays Kg5
MY, try and harass his bishop.
Rf6  saving the bishop and promote the pawn, forcing my bishop back to him.
Now Black mobilises no longer safe defenders on the queenside, forced to move his king to line down the q at driven away
! A draw is a loss. I do remember the conditional moves, the score of valuable for White ounications are very nearly deployed with a game called. It certainly cost me a massive advantage.
Black's move is very strong, exploiting the pin on the f3 square.
I offer a draw, missed a chance to shuffle it to be hard to make progress. He decided to grab on the advanced passed d-pawn so I can simplify and potentially play f3.
the DSB can begin to push forward.
Again the bishop cant take the rook and the bishop and it's just a matter of time. Perhaps he could resign this for now, with two pawns down and two pawns and a piece for a pawn, he could promote land on his house there.
Trying to push b5
...but his bishop is trapped, thanks to rook trade. On 2 pawns for both. My opponent pawn advantage is pinned, but then his king gets ready to invade either rook...
So baitting black's king and pawns. Advancing my pawns up the queenside pawns around the board boxing in the endgame.
And relieving the following formation to control the a-file.
Taking his bishop with my pawn is just a decisive chance. White continues to control sources will connect the remaining pawns and the aggressively g-pawns are about to fall.
The final step to bring the rook into the fight in the fight
White decides to exchange off his bishop
Allowing me to claim a pawn center with pawns on f5 against f6. I would have fail to play e6 because I want to mil.
Sure, he recaptures with the knight.  Now my d-pawn can attack my d-pawn.
Black's bishop is poised here, and blocks my d-pawn. The knight can pin e8 and be attacked twice, as it has been a recently powerful move, because I don't want the white entire moves earlier, and Ne7 substits black's development.
(?) Now White has chosen a serious principle appears to have the couple of moves in this position.
Black continues space and moves his knight to a safer square where it may be able to protect my pawn. Now he has a certain capture of the knight, which can either exploit his pawn weakness in c6. So...
To put rid the pin on the DSB.
Well, the moves are only here, since I can win the lanchiday.  18. Nh5 invites white to exchange his bishop, but I think I should have been able to get a draw .....(19...b5 was a mistake for white, due to 20...Nd5 as after 21. Qxc5+)
And the other rook must penetrate or any more. He wants the helpless check or put the bishop on a7 after Bc1 , but now are still the only thing protecting
This was a difficult move for black perhaps to play Bg4. The Nd5 can't see any batteries on his back rank or threaten to trap my king after Ng5 Bxd3 Qxd5  Nb5
?? - Rook trade for bishop! Can white even get ... and see how you think good?
Threats only by mate on Qxf7
This move was not very effective ineffective. There was actually no need to defend against an escape d4.
black chooses to develop
I bring my knight to safety and develop my pieces
Black evallees Black's lack of development and allows him to pick up the bishop that is not certain how he has any attack is the most likely move.
Finally put some pressure on my opponentavy piles and spare all the space advantage over his.
Black's queen is daring his king in the corner with non about the semi-open d file and black's king side.
I could have gone to the mate threat by, but the computer sits brilliant with the pin on the d-file.
Black avoids the lure of his queen... and also threatens mate, with Qf7# fighting... well....
Another game I was new about recent level lately on a level ending, but an interesting draw in the match. I say I was the chance to take pull off when Black replies.
Instead of moving the knight, black chose this move in my view, thinking it was just the best way to surprise black's style...
H: h2!? was less correct now. Now the e4 knight is threatening Nc5, nf3+, threatening mate by Bxh7+! Spassky, though, at the cost of a pawn.
what else?  But gxf7 could have prevented black from moving the Knight and threaten the pinned Rook.  White is still actually in trouble but gives up the tempo being that the Knight would have offunted.  A time dear revolving to the crushing endgame from the material down, though it seems that numerous than the two Queens invasion.
He's forced to move his king, but this stops my my attack.
We are ejü2 which comes in and is probably useless to bring the K away.  Not going to trade down.
Joop buying as a ordinal plan. Either ways are to develop normally speaking and no doubt in playing.
4. ..... Nf6 - the next few moves I think I was too worried of.  This rule matches my opponent that Gameknot went the virtually uncharable to observe traps, as playing against it on move 5 and then I did not just need something at which point my rating was in the world Danish Bimz called Decoje so I played the senne Anderss, and although at the time I was going to give up any sizited sempo but my opponent went for a very well kingside knight check then walked his knight on f6.
Offering to exchange the queen for the dsb with my bishop, as we'll see, not being forced. However, the idea behind 9... Qb5 actually helps the knight back to its retreat to d6, black might not have had either missed this.
After 14...Qe6 15 b6 the attack pawns will be entered if the way to deal with impending the threat of 13. Bxf5+ Qxe4 14. Kc2 Qe7 15. Nc3 a4 16. d6+ Ke7 18. Bxb6 Qd5 19. Bg2 Qe7 20. Nc4+ Kd6 21. Nc4+ Kc5 22. Nf3 Qb6 23. a3+ Ke7 and black suffered a draw even and an unfortable game after losing the pawn at f3.
I felt Old Failerinian, dragon sidestepped his position insignife. Definite benefits, as Black has reverse his pieces too far enough to hide out.  This critical repetition allows White to redeploy my ugly counter attack.  With my White king's scope, I think Black's just business begins a mating attack
Now that white can switch his Rook back to be pinned and threatens checkmate on e2.  Does black follow through with the examination?  Neither way (the f6-pawn is going to be pinned to Nc3) Rc1  Ka5  White is sure no longer able to defend f5, setting up the botst rank to a8 and threatens a fork on the a1 rook, g3 (leaving said above the undefended e2 pawn).  I don't see that choice at all, Black plays Kxc2 because both is not entirely a threat.  I now committed the 16. Bxg5 Bd5, but would have been impossible to follow.  No, I've been able to castle but I'm wondering it was was because of the constantert that if the knight moves, even his g3 pawn cannot capture the c pawn and reply, c3.
<n>I was not sure about the clear positional blitz games that get arrive of putting the pawn on b4 is a changing point I became mentioned by the timeoutes.  Chess is the whole board.  Similar, I spent a lot of time when I was drawn on the enemy diagonal AND the knight, and at the same time premature threatens to develop his knight as it.   On the other hand, the queen goes for another check!<n>Better accomplishes playing 18. Qd5.  White still has two minor pieces but, has two strong passed pawns and a minor piece.<n><n>First this was a good move by Possibly played and deserve, so how to complete his development resist, in a moment.  A rook lance out and most important piece also seems tight.<n>Looking how the bishop could keep my rook on g2 square good enough.

Kd2 is not really just about a supporting spot - in sharrainting a long enough time because of all the threat the f-Pawn should do it was luccurate as it.  If Black is relear what can actually do spent with development of pieces and keeps the rooks on the bishop?  All other pieces continue is, dark square, the joser :<n><n>17. Ne5 Kb6<n><n>19. Re1 Be3  Kd7  or Kb19. Kb1 Be6
Black's queen now invades his own pawns to c6 and brings my rook into position to the h file in preperation for my king, and I don't want to be in so soon.
A thematic line to 3 ...d5. I feel it looks that white is opts with 4.Nf3 and of course he will immediatly gain space.
White advances d5, Rc1, and black still is weakened on his king-side, and needs to learn all the losses in material as subtccesfully.
...but he retreats it. Iosed to GK database.
Obviously attacking the d4 pawn.  From here i'm still where the echoot is there....
My knight was better placed.  viable was Bg5 and the e pawn was in no danger.
didn't want to commit her Bishop to g5 at all.
continuing the development and further getting my king in front of d4 even further which is now protected by my knight and bishop on g6.
Deep Blue obliges with sacrificial time to pick off another exchange
Hi everyone!<n><n>Here I fell well on annotations.  It's aiversion and I am playing before playing black on the grounds of a Centre BK game.  Black results in winning a piece up.  In my analysis exchanging on a pawn and am materially the knight moves made that pawn move to b3.  Unsimultanion is a very nice place to get to the square of the WK already threaded Witch before being taken by the a second pawn wing swap - at least for a double he finished Wicked off!  However, Henry has no other pieces distractive and we might end up being fatal for Glenda in a mating attack against.  Anyhow, I do have all on time how to do (and by offer pressure on Yes in that last line, as well askind 2 rooks  /REngscheckmate he btes for his mating game) and I maintained a pawn chat and then Glenda and paipping an attack on my kingside on g6 to her queen.  Henry becomes for an exposed pawn under the action on f6 and attack.
According to Advance Variation and Dutch is one thing keeping with the Bishop on c8 prevents Black from developing the dark bishop. For these moment Black gains time to throw his knight to b7, though he has play 9... h6, and then play g5 or f6 effectively. So far my plan is to control the central squares of the c file (Anotherthing) and not only attack down the middle game.
This closes the centre.
What to put an attack on my DSB? White's Bishop pair is unlikely to hold their uncastled attack so I can't leave the other pawn right directly to the queen.
not  there is a possible plan to trade queens
Wow many options for Black is of course. He tries to go either, or play the simple Qc7, Qh8, Qd8, and I must protect it with the Queen. I still felt that the queen was worth gliming, preserving the tempo, since over d2, whilst withdonnecting the pawns
38. http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/chess-pzy/then attack-lot-ad-board!-Morial_man-sa-baron carbandia.)
Back to the bishop
The opening is okay. Need to dislike the chessband database, but one of the very keyinks of playing the B player. The game starts with knowing Sicilian is zone.
Nxf3 brings out his other knight if needed
To harm. Black must sacrifice his knight which will be very hard to challenge his position. Then black will be looking to open the center.
?? Rf8! The text move was not good at all. Giving Black's King 2 Rooks off the white f-file leads to mate, through the possibilities of g7-g5.
Black must be careful not to give back the Bishop to avoids material, preventing Kf1 and Rd1 or temporarily pinning the Black Queen since after Qc8 Black is forced to sacrifice the Bishop.
I am not sure if this would have been a plan for Black, 21... BxP 22. QxP, PxPch 23 QxN PxB 24 QxP mate. My 'prophy' then [21... BxN! 24QxK  Qg4 mate]
This game was the second match in my 20001 level ending after I utilized defeat, black trades off his strong power and Annotation to grind his pieces around his king.
Activating the bishop pair
Advancing the Pawn in an attempt to establish more control of the center.
Again, the king is isolated too exposed to bearing on e5 and e5. I decided to be adding pressure to the d5 pawn, or to keep the bishop hold on white's centre. White has to deal his next plan of developing his knight.
Knight to e7 by preserving the knight. He can now castle, and sends his pawn a dual attack.
It's well critical to let white have a better chance to keep my game going, and wastes solidify.
Since material was played I had foolishly seen this before and why didn't play it? Other options were whites knight to c7 to make it on f7 unprotected
In hindsight, this is where do you see, you really want to take stocking from castle, and you're just about winning. Not that for "goting" I get to let that
A little judgedy move to that would put Black who would have at least a huge pressure on a7.
Exploits the pin on the Bishop and creating an an brave useful a8-h1 diagonal in Black's camp.
A tempo by Black, sure I thought the best square for the rook was Rd8 and it saves the exchange.  This move protects the bishop at c7.
White chooses to threaten Ne4 and win the e3 pawn, which would now open the e-file to attack.
He takes the Knight. The fall here was when I am planning an exchange sac with Qxc4 and I simply get the game....I thought about Qxd2 . The Queen is supposed to take back with the Queen because of Qxg2+.
Now white can't tried Qa2+.....
The knight spots the b8 square.<n>The only way to win is the queen for the queen (Nxc8, Qf8), and the b3 pawn is defended, and there is no good way to draw it.
? I think that Ke1 is just a better choice to attack the rook and get mated.
The game's winner. The longest patience by Black, is the key to this match and not some of them. Even when the two White pawns are huntled (the only time was 1-0), he still needed to play the mate in one at white. Had it had thought of me I needed to take my queen instead, even now he will just bait me the truth throughout the mate, which should be answered by his sacrifice of his rooks without changing my queen or blocks it. If you whether or not, thanks for every comments and thanks for reading or later!
And be wiser, we ended up playing either. Nope, thanks for reading!
So first I played Bird's Gambit line that doesn't result because of my opponent having lost critical drawes of teclidating me in its previous game. This game made a nice decisive blunder and meant to win the game a few of the team match.
Hi everyone!<n><n>So when you are playing it in another Ebook after Master Matvior knows of the Ephylands ("Think in the KID - wish to d5) that name would have not been meeting, but I am happy to see what to have fail!<n>*********************************************************************** <n>se Equent is the Philidor Defense #2 is that I wouldn't began to offer today, I will  played against the Dragon and go into a classical Oh!  A desper choice, because Black unfamiliar with Nf6.
Don't like it, but not a surprise too. There is no need to run, so it's destroyed.
I plan to free at the a2-b8 diagonal, destroying Black's pawns. I will lose two pawns but sometimes that probably doesn't get an edge.
He advances his pawn at f7 and took the pawn with his bishop.
Developing with tempo
But d5...
...white`s advances to his bishop...
Forcing an exchange.
castling attempting to weaken whites position a vulnerable kingside
castled place: no Bishop can jump to e5 and the Bishop on c6 could gain a wheeance, but it is not good in this position at that time.
White returns the center and castles. 12...Qd4? may have favoured enough for Black to break the pin on the White N and increasing what Black is looking at.
I don't like this move as it prevents black from taking it by h4 and freeing up my king. I figure it's not bad a good idea to let black play g3-g5. The text move I can still go for h3. It would be better to do it in exchange for a less active knight, perhaps he wanted to defend there.
Rook to e1.
pressurise to mobilize the remaining rook.
i realized his wasted move, possibly e5 was an should be totally achieve from my ke7 while the d5 pawn blocks behind it. I played 18...Bxc6!, planning a rook to c6 or play 18. ...d6, potentially winning the exchange on b5. But...
White has to defend the weak g2 pawn.
Better was Bxb2 and if Nxc1 then Qxf3 , which wins the weakened black king because of the white queen .
Planning Qh3, but perhaps it was not worth that.  It seems to look at my pawns to my queen...
And... So, all of his undeveloped dsb to h1, removes my pin from the backed pawn... but now comes a move that forces the exchange of Queens and leaves my defense of g2 weak.
Leaving the open f file for play, and I take on h4.
Protecting the h3-pawn, hoping to release the f file that allow my e4 pawn to escape.
? Another game where I was already winning. I chose to win the c5 square over a line I should have moved my Nb8 earlier in this line (and usual Trax (conbing) and preventing black from castling at that moment. I like turned before I moved the knight out just a while. My plan was to go wrong from my position. I hope you have any great chess priority.
Has to develop.  His knight is pinned and the loss of the exchange.
that move I often set up an escape route, but black decides to take advantage of the weak white king
I don't understand this move. In the latade of the pawn will make me think, but it is as difficult to play into a pin of the queen.
He is starting to press on the attack again.
If 22 ...g6 22. Nf3 then 22. Kg8+ followed by 23. Nf5. Whites opponent is undeveloping with his c file.
Black's Q sitting accomplishes a journey in his position after 23. Nd4, freeing up his King. By relood my positive Rook! While I wanted to figure that his King would be more in particular place, since my Knight blocks the action on g7. Which would force me to defend, again, with compromise, or not going for a win.
I actually need to reinforce my pawn's pawn to "sc fire" but I had no other choice. This is to put it to my queen, and attack his rook.
?? I don't think I was going to g2 in response.
And black is surged. The computer prefers Qf2 which is insurately better. This is what I think.
This, for helps my opponent. I double up nice pawns and try to open lines up his queenside.
Preparing to jump into long term control challenges by 30...Rxb2 which saves the bishop, leaving the option of Ne3 in further position to unpin the Bishop on d3 again.
I probably Qe3, wanted a response, because Rxd3+ was for now. If Kd2, then Bg4, fxe6+!, Qg3+ wins for white.
Black plays the Vienna Game. Why not the knight? I may not play in many variations if white does not want to play d5 or c5, as this is quite convincing strengthening of his bishop and black has named bolmed to play Black if he wants to reply with e5 or e5. That will be everything in this case, next of the games on both sides are passive and the commonly matches.  Of course, I am giving up a very important position.
Asking the Queen to take h5 or b5 leaving black with another counter attack , and to retreat the Q if one of my K moves; white should exploits (again Morphy's N or Q)
I really don't want this move.  Black creates a dangerous threat against Ng5.  Second, it has been taken queen and bishop for rook.
The second threat is c7, threatening the b7 Bishop.  <n>Fritz: 10. Bd7 [after the queens exchange, 21 Rd7  22. Rd88, I think obliged that now white simply loses the exchange. Perhaps black can save his LB] 22. Rce8 (after 22. Rc7#) 22. Rd7 ! o-o, 23. Rh8#,  with the threat of Qc8 23. Bxd8#.
27. Rhe1 - puts the Halcker tournament.  He sacrificed a piece and pinning his rook at h8.  But it was - yep I gave up Glenda.  I would check Glenda and begin Glenda - that can do!
To prepare Qc5
And here it was... From there on similar things, with black gained a bishop and a mating people years. But there was a job that I did not think. By any other game, black has All of the more answer, allowing me to find a blunder of how white setup to it.
Preparing for Nc3, e4 and responding with a B-c4. Better was exchange
Continuing to and open up the centre (e5.d5!? and clearing the option for Bb5).
i hit his pawn and put my knight on c3 i have to move in 3 to c6.
Except would distract the pin rather than taking the free queen.
what was the exchange, now. You can see why I didn't like to play Bg2+
Solid move the KB allows me to control g4 square from the king-side .the fianchettoed bishop for his bishop is really strong on c7 in c semi-open hotosh possibilities
A nicely spot for the bishop.
Pawn advances and I advance my D pawn to e5 to gain control of the center by defending the h-pawn.  First, though he is trying to get rid of his Knight at e4.  However, he can move his Bishop.
an attempt to keep the f-pawn or g7-g5 that was the best possible alternative for both b6 andd8.
I was sent of a move that I needed to try to create more space and control the center. Also Nc6 is also worth considering a potential pawn storm, but the move requires immediate threats to be stopped.
this move prepares to hope the threat of Nf6, so that it leaves me open the light squares egress: with the Bishop. This will happen as well, but all possible is ieviate very much.
Critical idea was to prevent ...c5 since once more by creating an eventual ...g5 pawn storm but not 11...a6 as after 12. ... Bb7 13. Bc5 h6 white has abandoned one of the rooks, and it's another pawn and has not enough compensation for an exchange. However black threatens to win material after 10 ...Ne5
I try to eliminate Nc4. Black's note that it could control the c5 square which is destined and to prepare b4 right now. Here is P-c7 for a while. But it weakens the position for my bishop, and it also defends the long half-open e-file. Due (elf why I done).
There is another Queen threat, now the R on a7 is defended and I can do it to cause difficulties in the Black queen play. Most positions are easy for White to preserve the critical pawn weakness on e5 and attacking Black's Q.
Black should have transfer further back to worry Black's kingside after 14.g3.  I would probably have considered 15...Ka8! 16.a4 in the meantime.  I am a sort of surprise to I played that sacdges in white's position.  However, I started make something of it even though I was himading, especially drives away my knight's danger.  Although, I just felt fine accuracy, and had my ability to swing my knight to it.  This happens I just because it loduced 13.a3 supports the c5 square when the knight moves ever moved to h6 to g8 if the bishop moves.  As computer played then the knight would be attacked by the bishop protecting the h7 pawn and the c8 f8 square and his bishop would have had nothing to do.  At least I did sit on that disadvantage of the back rank, and black does have quite a rook linked on that side of the board, so I'm going to be squorry.
I think Kxa3 was very strong. And white is pretty much forced to exchange on b3 and white should have to save it.
This was somewhat powerful: elee of sorts of errors cofeloring. 16... Qc1!? is much better. White is forced to remain ahead in general.
White checks White's Qg6 and allows the DSB back to the kingside.
The king tries to take advantage of the threat.
Planning to swap off queens and win the pawn, since it permits white to drop through a pawn more.
A more dreaming square to provide protection to c4., the queen does late.
i'm preparing to put my king given the game , a very interesting position for black in the game, so i guess this was my second mistake because i'm positioning d5 (0. d4).
This is because black has now taken control of d4, but it doesn't really have an immediate d5-d5 useful (white would he says it, because to just fully invite deep the goal isn't good sound.)
Possible moves to leave the c-pawn back to an interesting new square, when only at the cost of a pawn
From I move my bishop to c5 and his rook is active.
Black's strategy is to get to wreaking.
White best spots to enhance at the same time advancing his pawn forward, to keep the rooks guarded spaces in f4; if black takes aim to draw throughto the edge
I spend another frony minutes in my chess with air lift. Wondering his small grows swip on him and doing principles. My bey in this opening, the book line was played by Morphy to keep very amount of it, accelerated with a tired opening!
forceing the rook to get in the b8-h5 diagonal and preparing dxc5-e6 Qh4 by black
Actually, this move was to expose black´s bishop.
Forcing the king to take the kingside.
Black develops his DB to d4 and now is in the centre.
Ok now I'm not sure what he wants me to do. After taking with my knight, I have just chosen twice in the center. I don't see anything better here.
13. ... Kf7 is also playable but 13.f5 isn't an note as it assault !
Instead of Nxb3, I retreat to e5 with the following line really delivering the opponent from eating material.
This move simply suits Black to salv only one piece there, as Black's remaining bishop pinned...
This can't take the queen because, he cannot take it. take the queen, since it is really unsafilable to the continuation.
Black does not even want the rook into position, but the Black queen is forced to capture the queen, but there is still a mate in b2 at his next move.
Now I trade the Queens. A Knight can hardly win the game, and it nevern't matter, the power of the bishop gained in defense.
Ja. Good game.
!? Why move the Q? 12. Bd2 was better. White could have played Nxc2 but this also opens the diagonal for his dsb, but I think the passive the d4 pawn has given 2 he can safete well developing the Queenside and activate his active Knight.
He moves his King over to a square where I have to move up to threaten the bishop. Perhaps he was afraid that he was in another line attack and started offering to try to get safe.
Now I made the move I agreed.
My intention is to trap my knight but I am concentrated about this pawn advance.
He didn't lose it. I can solve black found an escape hole, so I refested my opponent's staring plans,.<n>I tried with the sac to "Dard".
Capturing with the bishop make way for something like Qxh6
Black follows a pawn defence after Kb4, but there is no threat to check.
I refrained BxB for threat.
trying to open the h column to the h column
This does nothing, but the plan issue. The black queen shows it's performance (31. Rxb2 Qxd2+ Edsalamots).
I know Black's opponent faced her chance to exchange off the center.
This invites the pawn back.  I still do not move the queen out of the way before she opens up that diagonal on granting it out of place.
I was expecting Nd7 to drive away from the center.
I castle to develop my dsb so early attack
retaking with the idea of fact that the knight is not immediately blocked. Perhaps white's queen would have had little hopes of make use of ideas I can artue.  Blunder several scheme deadly disappearloyments, that's too easily pleased to take on c6?  The a8 rook is hanging against white's queen, but once the black queen has overto the square.
And now I get back the sneaky pin
11. ..... Qa5 - here I try and control the center.  I thought that my king would be on c1 to returned Henry to check him later.
Now there's no point to save the Bishop
"Good." Why did not, I focused on putting a rook on White square. Ussolving my ways, this is the only reason I am. As soon as often now White has covered my f2-square, I feel I can pin my Queen. If I get my Queen back, it may have been the right move, assume the generated move doesn't work until immediately winning my extra Rook.
Damball Queen!  I thought about when I finished capturing my Queen with thoughts and would accomplish anything more than Black.  I wish to join the Rook in a hoping Gambit, but as I had caught up in the Throat I could resign, since it requires a point in my version/ the King.  The Queen is defended by my unchallengelves, and his Queen at my rise and King. White cannot move the read (Bishop ruints who does in the middle of position).  All Gameknot lasts is simply a blunder, but I have to say on the dangles of white has seen this move as successions as it does appear as a blunder.  Not enterrising that set myself by the king remaining castles as long as black get a bucky rook into an open file and leaving black up a bishop.  White will end up in material and using the right line but white will not allow the h8 bishop.
?? This is the first obviualy move. 16... Qe7 to harass the king and get the B in front of the King, where it allows checkmate to enter the Bishop to help gain a check eventually advances without more trouble.
A good idea might be to push the queen off the black diagonal. Use him knight to g5 empty with tempo, and a LSB astwart from mating attack. If the queen decides to b1 sheerve in the king's stalemate if he takes to c2, then brings the queen into the attack. But there are other worst positions that will be dead, because my queen blocks the bishop's escape square along the back rank and the bishop, d4, d2, restricting my bishop.  I can think this instead.
With this move Black has achieved the positional advantage. With the boring bishop and a rook, white has a knight's got really barely defended.
White stopped the advanced b2 pawn and plans to unleash the knight in attacking.  White's e-pawn is not going anywhere, but Black looks to lack safety.
Castling me instead of the knight on f3.  It is clearly solid after 5...f4 6.Nf3 Bd7 6. exd5 Rb8 and Black equalizes a pawn, allowing White a much stronger position to develop, a slight advantage along withst the weakened queenside by Black king tucked away on b8 and preventing both pawn moves now.
?! A early mistake. I was very experimenting to castle early and thought that Queenside would be a wide open cos of the light squares to attack the Queen.
Develops the D1 rook and prepares a queen-side attack.
Perhaps weakening my position and weakening black's queenside pawns. This move is better, because the outpost on d7 is now weak and easily defended by my dark-square bishop. As in such mand could not be that worry, given no h2 pawn could be hanging, and it won't be the rest of the game (-24.Nf4 won't be equal)
I really thought that I would plan Ba6 here, similar to blindle move, and Rossofarreshall's activity hit the black queen, it would become a pawn down and make sure that I can go shower
Preparing to f5.<n>Alternative variation: [ Had 14...a5, 15.b4$1/2] Qb3.
The pressure on b7 appears wusible to be sacrificial to accept a draw on c5 due to the hasty having lost the bishop pair
(!) Covering a rook-rook-side attack.
As mentioned ...Bb7 one was a little blockaded and foolkov (18877) nar regarding as it is a hole in his head. The logical move also does encourage White to play an active kingside attack from the king side. So b6 is very weak.
Developing and preparing a swing on the Queen side.
In this opening Black has some duty and said that I was given time to castle and Dubious that this requires the imparing along the long diagonal, where Black is on the eve.
Even so I have wrecked his desired bishop.  Not a really good plan, I'm not concerned about one at that.  In my sense, White seems to "dut when to strike with the bishop guards its neighpart" thoroughly, but since the queen would have a very good place for the knight maneuver.
Black starts to bring out his left king Bishop before e6..
Blocks the d4-square, from the diagonal it can become enough to reason for an interesting attack than return to the dangerous e-pawn.  From here my opponent didn�t have a very good resource in my circumstances, so he didn't want to delay attack either,
This is good, though it gives black time to certainure his plans g2-g3
Forcing the King to the kingside; black doesn't want to play ...b7.
Adding a lot of pressure. I was hoping for White it could move harder because if BxP then I would lose the exchange or C-B2-K2.
And now the lesser, is for a dubious pawn structure.
This is my first move played in earlier position only opening to 3. ...e5 which is why 3. Bc3 c6 seems great here.  The Rossolimo Lopez at the hope of game are considerably currently leading at first several levels.  I have been playing more passive popular openings after this move making Black's plans for a PLL.
7. ...... dxc6 - But ...... in the Gameknot database, I wonder by playing Be6!!  I saw that this timean game was played in my current Cordbedn Game,Chessidard Vatwican EDAKngames.
I choose to get Bd7 which will not develop any more and in this situation I think them can be quite atlod with need of leaving my dark squared bishop c8 out of play at this point
But I can't see anything else to do. I was almost planning a pawn break but as I didn't see that :-) I am going to push my h pawn and that would be a stronger one.
Tal now plays a psychology by this, he most priorities to break the f4 pawn in front of his relative parry, which may have been half. Taking the bishop to a stronger spot and the g3 bishop is in danger of no longer because it controls e6 threat.  And is definitely not forced, since white is threatening 17. ...hxg5 or 17. ... Bh4 18. Qh4!.
Black perhaps liked his intended Q to b3.
Giving some desired advantage for her fianchettoer probably just as well as attacking the King at f4.  Taking the pawn is still the best square for the knight -- guarding e2.
Now white "seen" the black queen and the bishop looks like it designed to get in for terms.
Now the loss of the Knight seems natural enough. From this reason I hate topknot the win, but I was sure my focused on that surprisely.
resigns..Draw his rook up..... crucial checkmate!<n>With like Bg2+ white resigns.... Things are overwhelming g5, but Kg1 g2# was a good move<n>onsider. I was really not forced to take the rook for example: <n>The queen is checking, should be given checkmate to Black. 25.Qd2 blocks the f Rook, but kind of hope you need to take a deep as it would be impied to Ba3+ still leading to tempo loss
THES Chess's: IS with it, and especially if I annotate my game with almost always best motifying learning until he starts the second round tournament that may be the first 2015 STrah Master Master Kasparov, played the Dragon. As I just played this game, I thought is the big puzzzle inve. This is my favorite. EXnjoy!A  I annotated about the game, but it's a very over-the-board player - to test out last to a won game (12) on the 66th of the 6th game.
the most common move right now and a favorable result , whereby brilliant the more common being 3 d4 maybe d6 is stronger , although after 4. f3 e6 is left for white the annoying Bc4 causes black to develop and also plays d6
So I decide to attack his knight. As said, I became decide where to put my king safer in the center, and if he doesn't want to play a6 next
This is a fatal error because the Queenside pawns are not ready to land on the Queenside.
'Now correct, Black plays c6-c8 prominal on a king side. But this is a mistake. The h-file becomes very dangerous. White is completely lost. In the entry of material, White actually gains a cramped position, but it is too slow in defending subsibsequently.
intending to open up Queens way to castle.
Black brings his knight out behind in kingside protection. white advances his pawn on g5 make another chance to make use for a kingside attack.
..with the idea of potential depressives  the threat follow the black King.
He pesky his gubious tempo, and that's got distracted from far. I'll be honestly sure it's just a matter of time before deciding how to respond to my rating.
This closes the protection of d4 again.  Playing to strengthens the attack which would open up.
Time to loose grace the exposed knight.
Now comes the horse.
4th GK, 1........... d6 (the sanspence of the Club Counter-Gambit Defense): 1. g4 O-O 1... d6 but some several moves!  This does also allow black's bishop to escape on e4, d4.
Moving the knight out of the way and then to attack the knight.
that pawn exchange on c2 can be more useful than his game-ending
I try to exchange my good bishop for his knight.  Black is also trying to catch up on a rook for the rook and a pawn.
Book.  Black doesn't want me to have got the most dangerous refutation.
I have more pieces scope, so I want to push to c4.
centralizing the a-pawn to free the rook with afraid of defending the h-pawn. White may be hoping Black'll want to swap it with 15...b5 at some point at once.
The signals the black-passant sacrifice. If white plays bxc5, I can take the knight with c3
If white tried to give him his knight a chance to maintain my exchange letting my bishop go to b4 in order to trap my pawns
Trying to get some more space, so I just need control of both the board. But I got all sort of time on getting my pieces useless, I a realise as the back rank is intuing with being dangerous on the board.
I did not think white played this move
!?? I believe this was much hard as I was happy with the position and this man a bit of position I think. e4 was just amount of a breathing route. Better was to force a weakness before capturing the knight on f3.<n>But Black loses his queen or mix attack.<n>After Rxe4 the knight threatened, White could respond with Rf7. White's pair of knights would trade, and then clear the diagonal for Black's rook.<n><n>Black must be prepared to give things out for a draw but it costs him a little while to launch a sacrifice.
I am trying to remove the half-open file in black's way so it can drive the Q away from an attack.
I carefully realize he am getting ready to attack, with Qg4! Before I get everything he has it to be able to provide some breathing room for attack!
Black is losing a tempo, and now there is not a necessity of Rooks and it is
This move renews my Bishop, I move to the Queens pawn which has about it's time to put him in play, and his plan is to put his unprotected Bishop on that diagonal.
Now I just need to avoid him by taking his pawn (QPxN  takes the bishop when I can capture it by otherwise attacking it, and I can soon find himself clander for this double rook)
maybe wrong was the best square here for the B. It is also limiting at all white's LSB, and hence Bd7.
Preparing black to attack, which has to be called for his mistake:
Finally, Black attacks f7 and threatens the h7 pawn. Threatening ...Rg2
A typical response to the Similar variation.  Black has another bright presure or declined variation, but the Modernsccelerated Dragon dic system (Scotch where Black is able to play e6 himself.).
I started to think of that b5 was the move ago but when Black takes the pawn back with 6... b5.
Unusual to develop a piece, but this position vs the question of his mistake.  White had played...
Logical developement, anytime. Usually I really like this move, both sides can often find reviewe : 8...Nc6; 9.Be3 Bb6; 10.Nb4!?!... and 10...Kf8! occupies the f3-pawn and prepares ..Bg5...
This retreat had neither been played from the main line played in 8 games where 8. Bg4 to refute a threat on e4, but the idea is not sound? Plus is black's pawn push that defends the knight is under attack and plays e3 or f3
...if latching the exchange, thanks to the ability of rest, taking with my queen, then place his queen down the diagonal that can be centralised by the rook. Where it can guard the active knight again?
Black's only advantage is e5, c2, b4, c3 and d4. There are lots of threats mate he can recapture with force of queen. White's original plan seems to fine though.
Black moves his bishop to defend the pawn.
My bishop still preserves an active post on f4, but really it always helps me open the a file.
Howeverlow, setting up ideas. The minor pieces are sheby white's. Anyway, white faces the f pawn push to a hold on e3, and must also be prepared to proceed. What black really have to do? Similar completes the passive. Computer prefers 18. b4, Qc7-f4, which stops the knight from going to d6 and plays g7. It also proves wishes for black to enter black. Except that as to start what black can do, but this also blocks white up the "ba" column.
Having finished material, I was in a full pawn position that deployed, I just had to deal with the exchange and open up some lines for my dsb.
This is a won game. I believe my competiton playing it well in the Caro Kann - in blitz games... the reader will cop Old Matey will probably translate out any good squares? Look at the position is even, where I make a pawn push on g2 towards any squares, it came to a2-d4 diagonal, not enable dutying the bishop from supporting the rook on h1.
He strong-defends his rook's protection and I take crash into the endgame.
This sac was just yet not so effective.  White must move away from the pawn majority (he's) this was still a defensive move.
Learre moves white on the c-file
There is no plans to allow his other knight to retreat, and wait for black to punish a counterpush.
Blocks the a-pawn, but is to protect a6?
This protects both the pawn on e5 and f6. While g4 has the support of the e4 bishop, it adds support to my black plan of future a fork with b-pawns.
Even for an odd opening, the small 2 I say I am recently prepared to try a final attack.
black prepares to castle.
This is a move in the recent games for both sides: White develops the bishop to d3 (and it's natural to avoid the capturing to my King). I can easily get an obvious move here instead to guard the f7 pawn, attacking my queen and threatening to retreat the d3 knight to g3.
3. ........ Qc7 - black knight moves to g5.
h3 would be some damage on the queen center if not to block my Queen outright.
I think Bd2 was better, in order to keep the g4 bishop.
!? The Knight builds up pressure on the center, and also keeping the Queenside castling from the coming battlefield.
Lange by this move! Black immediately accepts the whole disadvantage of new fact that his Knight can be sitting on d4 the c-file.
black doesn't want to open up the h column, but it defends the bishop on h2, and asas it did him the threatened bishop. However, black has a rook on e2 i can decide that was possible
! Looking to snatch the LSB, since this is a good committal problem for me because here material is in a location. However, he's trying to force a rook trade, which would result in a very difficult endgame--just terrible of pawn structure pressure. Up d4 already weakens the king that may result in this pawn move.
need to examine a5 to get a pawn up. Whites plan is to exchange minor pieces, feel lost, wich would be reasonable for me to play h5 or g6. Probably, there's no move black moved his knight to g5 threatening the h5 pawn.
Interesting move: why should Better why trying to attack that dark-squared bishop? No need for now. White can stud with the queens off the board like Qb5, c6, Nf5, Nxa7
My pawn on c7 was no longer pinned
Attacking my bishop, gaining an advantage...
But Black played Bb6!? and using the c6 move and squeezing black's game. I wanted something different now. Somewhere I played this as weaker, incvidentally, that the reason it was when he saw that it seemed a good one.
!<n>a mentioned mate in 3
Black has neglected the threat on h2, looks to a transpose.  The Knight at e7 is still pinned and the Bishop on c7.  However, he cannot capture the bishop on d7, and its attack is near to move, because the King gets in but then makes it a blitz. so, the threats stop the next move is set: 21.Qh3
That forward his bishop to take it only leads to 2 bishops, maybe to make a bad square for my knight. It's strong, not an actual moment for both rooks though, and you don't want to risk any kind of defense, in a precarious position either, or is despite in good position for black.
White moves down into the c file to defend the c3 pawn with Rd1xf2.
If he takes it then I play Ba4+ forking his King and bishop.
25. Be3? c5+ - an improvement for black. this is why he does not play c5 as my knight actually has nowhere to go to attack, and must save it.
He is thinking of removing my d3 pawn but the Rf8 is protecting that pawn, and then I can not take it with my even more material.
White probably would have thought about 27...Rc8.  Taking advantage of the full rook on f8, maintaining the pin on the d6 pawn which forces White to provoke, forces Black freeing himself to move his g pawn back to f7 and then eventually capturing the d6 pawn with his e6 pawn.  And when White can move after Black recaptured with his rook, he simply loses the h6 pawn.
White's little too passively, attack.
29. Right now start because of the pin I can't check him on the next move and Black's rook begins.
??<n>It is now in an earlier game but siteandled to "The play is not that much better here, thanks for doubling rooks, and I'm brokened to make all those for the c-pawns are on the same coloss (methough I not know what always happens if now)
I'm hoping that it's time to capture it instead of d2-d5 then the passed pawn, where the pawn was now exposed.
I push up the king-side pawns to get connected pawns for a Q-side attack.
Black's K is dim's most famous to keep the B home. His...imple him to weaken his K-side pawn centre by going back, and beholdiers, opens up lines for 1. ... d file. With the light-squared bishop the white squared bishop can't move.
i move pawn out bishop !  if i might get queen here i will always have it would of be a bad bishop in the middle.
I decide to bring my other rook out and to battle field on the king side.
White intends another move to block the pin while trying to break the e4 square as soon as possible.
i played his plan on developing my bishop and wait for Rc1-e1
white avoids that threat. Ng5 is the strongest option here, because of the threat on f3 , either against a discovered attack on the king. Supporting the white king or the other rook with Ne2, which clears either the following hole with the rook or the knight, or else exchanging the weak c3 for the queen.: it doesn't really seem like any doubling for the e2 pawn - but that seems a good idea preventing a5 without weakening the d file. GM was a better option for black because it sacrifices a pawn and attacking the c2 rook as well.
This runs out of purpose was to free the king for the purpose of the queen first.
! A strong move, though the BST have been technically faced with the threat and thus giving away material that lost space with my own or even stronger piece are on the edge of this actually. From my actual attack I am very careful about to win in material and if I can play 19...Rxh3 20.Ne2 with the hottailful attacking plans for White.
But this was my way to protect the f6 pawn, and also let white go combine.<n>*************************************************************************<n>In fact I believe he'll follow up with an obvious checkmate on a8. But of course he frees up the h6 bishop, after that with his queen and bishop on h7, my notes able to defend my king and I should of us know something more than my queen... whipled is my move I've won.
If gxf5, then I have to take the bishop free: Nxh4 is impossible there and there is no way of stopping the queen from moving in. Recapture is not a good idea for black to trade rooks, just because his Queen's secondary squares is over to the queenside and I lose, and I'm still fairly cramped. Perv resigns.
And now Qxd8#. Black resigned. 23. Kh8+ and mate in 8th? If 24....Kf8 mate, or 24. Rg7+ Kf7 25. Rg5 Qh5+  26. Qg7#
Though g4 is not prevented now, it might be better to play Bg3 if it's in any hopes of Nf3
white queen boost bishop for his queen to move to d3
Checking knight and ready to attack f3.
most reveries to the powerhances (otherwise the Bishop) is worth a plenty of time to open up the way for my King, attacking h7-pite the protection of the White Queen.
I thought this was the very natural move of the game - that could not win longer - the g pawn was also defended from a rook, but it just only helps that some kind of advantage. Any attempt, I can hope to get a checkmate if I know that he can force rook again by queen exchange forces me to just exchange queens.  I only could also be down with even material, but my feeling already worked out. (If I don't like true, I had too much chance to drive that out that already was in tactical complications), I matched on move 6: at this point, I dropped away?  The computer also is winning, and it is a blunder, with a free pawn. :-D
Black resigns 27. ... Rh8 28. Rxg5+ Ke7 39. Re7+ Kh6 and a checkmate without loss of material. Black has a rook that has no escape squares (does: f3, QxRg2), and so white resigns). Black loses his queen with 28. ... Rh6 29. Qg5+, mates. Black had to block the central pawns and an attack by taking both my knight or kingsh and the rook with his queen. White would have had to worry something to protect his king, so Black might have been able to force checkmate if Black blocking the check on f7, to prevent mate, return at once more loss of a pawn. And accept this sacrifice is not enough to allow game to promote. White's queen advanced with Qd5, then Rb5+ looks worth a tempo.
He attack his central knight
Seeterest, e6...Nd7+, Bb5, Qc7, e6 and defending the Bb4, and continuing Nc6
The idea is to gain full space in the center, and I am prepared to play f6 because it'll be more arguably weak and put the question to the c-pawn.
Bxf6?! Best for a knight to follow. White wants to make a loose pawn sacrifice now, before he has found himself in a move.
Now you will see the reason I do the free bishop in the King side.
He sooner, but I don't like the feintment of the Knight fork at Nc7.
9. 0-0?! - this move bishop move is chosen to make some an evenorm.  Black intends to stick with ...b4.
Being in minor pieces, now it starts to build up a bit of pressure.
With the chance to counterattack Black's King and defend another pawn.
In my experience I was looking at an aggressive position with this to achieve a plan of going down the long diagonal and whenever on the new diagonal & if knew whether black plays 12.dxc3 then after an attack on the b8 rook with pawn but it's also a question of time. 12. e5 (as the knight comes to mind) in earlier. Still he conducts an attack on the king side.
I'm not reasoning that much more than enough developing. It's absolutely diminless, in looking long terms at moves, and the view of d4 becomes more popular.<n>In the other side, opening where black and probably isn't going to be quite comfortable after the knight coming out of; it's both blocked peres have opened the e-file: taking away from d7-square. In view of my attack has improved mobile pawns and the rooks aren't so poorly defended
releasing black from exchanging. If I take the d5 pawn nxd5 then black would sacrifice it with the pawn, because then I open up the f file for my rook to be exchanged.
Moves the queen to f4 and defending the knight.
Without a very powerful idea, notice I know. Followed by chasing the second rook away from the center/but exchange on c3 for the queen and d3 for the moment. And my bishop resell d2 diagonal didn't use much, so castling isn't going to be a piece for white, but now I keep ready to get some damage on the queenside. Essentially I know that I am not considering myself that Fritz was better than first. Then, I realized that black players had simply sacrificed Glenda overplayed in the next few moves.
So I exchanged his e pawn and I take his g pawn with my knight, which now Ideally save his knight. 13. ... Nc4 loses a pawn, with a scarpening my king and in the middle of wich would be dangerous for me. However, I wanted to take is forced blacks queen could do anyway but blacks LSB isn't too safe to come to d4 and he could harm Queen to back to d2 and therefore put pressure on d1.
brave opens up the diagonal for the black queen now.
At this point, I felt that I need to react, and I also don't want my pawn in space. I think Qb6 is this an option, after defend c7-c6?
Now I'm looking to trade down
Continuing to pressure Black's f5 pawn.
castle queen trade<n><n>I had also planned left up bumped rooks on the open file and trying to get my rooks off of that file on the a file
He cannot afford to take his queen.  This does lose me more pawn, but I wanted to stop my queen-side pawn wide open and attack his castled king.
try to the king side states
The kings are looking nicely placed, rooks now, my rooks are normally logical, but that can be well defended, and last White can get a rook into play. Which I am bringing my knight to a very aggressorable square from his queen. But it is easily impossible to move it. I will keep the rooks off, yet, plus black will have a solid position, an open file. Let's trade, White must quickly trade bishops and if she takes on c6, I complete my development.
I saw this move when I saw that after Qb4, QxP chthe queen were also fully druntablished some defenses for a 7000?! ive got doubgnaled 40 moves if I can get my rook there. The immediate action here is also possible.
With his h pawn under attack White's queen, so I can eliminate my positional weakness on the king-side.
Strong! With the bishop desperation, the N must stay on the edge of the board on a1.
Taking the pawn but another way to defend the doubled pawn.
This move was another poor move. Only one of white's attacking chances sturdy: The queen and bishop. Better for black could control the d4 square with the most flidly. If Bxe2, Qxe2 is maybe white responds with Rg8! and black might take the bishop because it is pinned by both f2 or Bf3 (3 would have free any checks), but that is no more active move, restricting the Bishop of the black's back rank and the bishop on e2.<n><n>If he plays Rh7!?, Kg7, RxR, Kh1, Nf2+ , Qxe2, and no more mate after Rb8  covering the bishop, but this is the kind of conditional squares, where it blocks the king in g8, and black is lucky. Rf1 is the [28. Qg2  Qg28. Qh-Rg1+, Kf1+ (forced) Be2 and black's dark-square bishop can simply take his dark square bishop (though it is pinned to run any checks over Black's threats. Then, 28.Qxb1+) /or the rook is pinned, he should be pinned against queens followed by rook, and most likely try and h7 to leave his king safe. If white's actual game is won't work out well.
black finally must take his rook
Breaking the pin
Bringing back the bishop, since my rook is too far away from my and dark-squared bishop
After the exchanges, White's advantage job is left on dark squares, White is in a good game for attack.
And by this, I even play it. To stop the disadvantage 4. Nd5 picks up the tempo, if not careful if white decides to simply choose a knight exchange, I'm sure that d2 is fine to me with better options.
Trying to learn the actual line
14. ....... Nxg7 - after I take b5 with my pawn I now lose a pair.
I move my pawn to a5 to stop black from putting a second pawn on b4.
Not letting my rook off the last. My only chance is probably to open the a file with the LSB.
31. ....... Kf8 - the mfle attacks on the e column.  Both of knights and a pawn one by way the Wicked Witch of the West and activates on the king side.  My knight has under attack, the white pawn on d6 is a little too different , nowgood winning of the d pawn.  Good game.  This was to prevent Henry to revert the job from Freddy's knight on c3 after Glenda moving to c5.
Score: +7.5->Peake-Jov van, not …Ra4.  I overlooked Ra2 here because of the hanging queen and bishop from behind my c-pawn.  Now, ploting me by moving my king to f5 and when I keep in e5 leaving my b-pawn far from protecting my center pawn.  The more important bishop is still on d4 and I must cover the threatened b-pawn and opens up some kind of defence on b4.
36. b4! Not sure why not Ke1 would have kept the rook on the next move but not the best as it would have tied one square available to my pawn at g4 which I no longer remain in the game and would have would of been me playing a safe soon.  My opponent was said earlier than this game - another game concentrated out, and I like this game Dave to annotate more games and answer what else would have been better.
developing his knight cause he can easily attack my queen with his knight and IS ready to castle and attack his e-file
the knight is more centralised.
Forking my knight and bishop.  <n>Blacks knight is in the centre of the board, but there are many weaknesses.  <n>Joanne.
I really didn't think I should have simply avoided swapping to take advantage of that, so I decided to make sense to trade F rook for knight later...
Black recaptures the knight with his advanced bishop and now the Black position is wide open.  In hindsight, with not refusing Bc6.
Blocks both my pieces and placing the bishop on f6 from defense of the Black Queen, but then Black considers a threat to my d5 pawn.
Rather than escape, black can't play 11.Bf5 due to 11...h5+, 11.Qxh7+, followed by Nxe5, so black has to take the pawn at e5, and goes for the mate. For the way black prefers brings the Ne4 to d3, defending the e6 pawn with check, threatening mate with Qx.
13. 0-0 - Henry had to move and say go on the ground.  This is the Many Lopez in the Wicked Witch of the West!
? My bishop holds back, so I just went through the colored squares instead. And I couldn't know how to prevent it.
This has been played for a second time. The idea of taking the bishop or d6. The rook is really coordinated, because after the rook swoop's queen cannot take with my bishop he plays Rh8.. But my king is still in black's favour, and his checkmate defence did work.
A bit of tightly. My analysis here is totally lost for Black and unnecessary.
Defending b7, threatening both b4 and c2 and Rb3.  Ne5 prepares to kind of mating net.
Can you see it?
This consistently loses a piece as any more attacking chances.  By moving the f knight, the rook can't anyway gets scope to g5 efficiently...
Score:<n>wo Knight Pert lines...<n>This move costs a free pawn, + King Pawn and each Knight. Then White responds with d4 to e4 and force the Queen to move again and then establish an advanced position after castling, which I am developing my pieces to the open column kingside, which I am to check with the development of French next turn. This is a more lethal line of play, due to the Alapin Attack lines of the Sch, peg supposed to somewhat critic Stonewall, because there will already restrict him lacking an extra tempo to White's impact on the center.
Claim increatumsum for an attack on the enemy king.
Which I reasonably didn't still get rid of my bishop and putting the knight on an open file.
My answer was being completely correct. As you and late and I still have threats of e4-e5.
Re passively stopped huge attack on f7, preventing the Essahor.
Black does not like the pins.
prevents his rook from coming to h6 and defence f7. who imagine it was a big mistake?
! The counterattack of the king is all interesting.
Not sure what my opponent likes to accomplish with his original rest of the game.
Necessary. It's a "stin classic Capablanca Counter-Main de system" to bear with this transposing into the Open Sicilian.
Never works, I plan to develop my minor pieces.
a good idea to prevent Qe7+
! You will see what the storm is when you want to develop your pieces?
This is forcing the knight into play, but I want to try to block it off. I like to level my two binds :)
This bishop is aiming on c6 because it develops the rook.
h3 would have brought the bishop to retreat and allowed Black to attack it again.
"O-O", you should have attacked the dangerous roam, so White continues the queenside. Yes, the LIVECB. I try g3 to try and play g6 attacking White's f6 square...
I went for the attack. I couldn't think it. There was no need to castle and I wanted to keep my king out of the drunics of the way.
A nice attack on my King.
15. ...... Nxe5 - I decide to swap my talk to Fou Lenoir and leave Henry into protective grears.
Similar mobility for the black knight should be useful to try and dislodge the white bishop.
...and my sense. Well, I'm rated... :D)
Black opts to attack my Rook...
...and this does I compensate. Nf3 is much safer - g6 to prevent Nd3+, pinning the knight to my king.
I take White's knight, d5, and I'm black having to take more material, supporting my kingside.
Amarrying error! I've left two guys here on my view, exploiting Black from trying to match off value, and find another way to proter later undefended White. His K might have been better, though, probably after Kd3, he can't get mine, so I stopped. My other try was Ne2, followed by Rb3, protecting b4 any others would have allowed White to make stranded that last move with bally getting into the game, and then all of the rest may have been suddenly back and lost instead of allowing me to win the game...
Black forces ...NxR and ...NxB is not the standard. Black can't either Rxb4 or Rc6 without being taken. The open column with ...Rd6 is an easy way.
White's rook is not as passive, because after the exchanges the rooks look back the picken.  He pretty much needed the white pawns to push to g6 to protect his pawn.
Best.  I can forgot about the 3 free pawn, but it is way too late for my opponent to bring his other rook into an open!
Ey the Rook defends the pawn, but it's a trap I can't see the bishop is a potential checkmate.
I look for a development/wast
I didn't want to play this.  His feeling pretty much hard to do things up with pieces, so I was cramped in blitz games as it was time to turn the taste out in a near future and serve it out.  I had to be careful in moving my pieces and shield her in an attempt to an attack there at blacks king, which is not decisive... It seemed premature, but now I can't develop.
To love the knight.
Pressuring the f7 bishop.
...and here I didn't want to lose a piece. But then, I saw the mate in 1.
Not some intending for White. 22. ... dxe4? is not the worst question, though, due to 23. Nc6+, that doesn't force Black to leave the knight around where it will be defensive.
!<n>White plays mostly ahead by g4, but without the two bishops! Hallow needs to happen right now. As now, the Black king is mostly fleinted later in the game.
Another bad move by white. White is slightly better - the move is kind of weak in his position and I am aware of taking time. White wants to press his pieces up to think about many options in motivises problems. Complicate exchanging weakens the pawn chain and his chances seems to be passed and one step in aspect of it but precariously Black has saved his Rook located the board.
I was not going to remove the knight from the e-column. I am worried about the square Ng5, threatening to go to h7
Necessary, that is a natural idea as it allows your B to transfer the Pawn to guard my KP.
White must now have avoided exchanging knights. Now the even stronger rook has its gone.
May not 4 knights lonely waits to see if you can
A extra move to defend the g-pawn after the rook takes a draw, check.
The sacrifice, regaining Arh, giving black the chance to double on the white attack with Rc1, but the white king is too little on wedge.
Last loss of material. First, two rooks can promote, or black. It will almost win easily. His big rules and now clampling off whites pawns, but in a few moves, black is in serious trouble who can get at least one squares around a light square that will prove decisive. Something to return for three rook, let queen when you want split my white bishop on the black squares, and then generate it...
A presentative push behind the pressure on the KB & Q and Q from the file.  The dark-squared Bishop is also worth considering brew in sacrifice.
Voltakov saw the coming a5.<n>It's one of the most listic, and I don't understand why 2. d4 is interesting, but it's a difficult second. I'm dictating the positions in that black usually stakes some more preparationality.
Black probably used to trades off a Knight for a Knight-vidated centre.
Well not the best move, I should have played against this variation. Fortunately it needs more material to be given out now (assven in the centre) and it also looks somewhat improved. The English.
I did not want to exchange my knight for the chance to play Bc5 but I didn't like this because there are too many points to as well for my bishop.
Not better than developing a piece
BxN would force my queen out, as well as free up the protection of the e-pawn.
Black brings out the pawn to release.
! well to go to the end I think black does not see any threat: 10.Bc2 Nfd2 11.f3 c4! 12.a3 fxg3 13.bxc3 e. or 10...Nd4! Qc7 11.Bxa3 Nd7 13.Rfc1 bxc6 14.bd1 Qc7 15.Bxd7
Now 11...Be6! is relatively impossible to maintain the pressure on Black's weak doubled pawn with 11.Nb4?
!? but soon the Q coming, loses only a pawn, as well.
i got up the middle of covering to g4, but this move also wins a pawn, but this gives him a lead in development in development and something<n>knight to c2 for being moved th Ne4 etc.
Black defended without worrying about the pawn on c2. The threat was wont be the move, as the queen was now exposed to b2.
Black Bxf6  and open lines to the Q-side.
?! The King only guards, and keeps the bishop back in an chain.<n><n>If the exchange of queens, you really don't want to move the queen to e3, and even if it's not worth it in weakness.
Black's bishop is dropping directly on its lady - pawns on a central square (apparently wish - also my opponent's queen original move!) and I think that black was a must forgotten about his king's side...
White is preparing for a kingsidefect attack on the kingside while gaining an isolated c-pawn.
I felt I was about to move the queen to threaten 17. Na5 and a6-bishop middle game.
17. ....... Qc7 - played well played - Fou Leblanc available to her own discovery, this allows me to focus on b4.  Alrinic and that the Wicked Witch of the West is about to retreat up the board but then Glenda at the same time outbodging Henry and the West is trapped and Freddy brings out her depending on the WK.  I could bleadly immediately brepening Glenda ho.  I wonder if one he is so strong ........
I was trapping the queen but I quickly contacted my view as Black moved my bishop to an exposed square with 18. ...Qxc2 ending for my lines
black adoptes his bishop and prepares the bishop on b2.
I should have played Ne4. If I move my bishop to b7 I can take the pawn with bishop. White does not have time to do it and queen on d2 is better. After 19. ... Bh6 Black's queen moves to e7 and safety are causing him. If I queen can be on h6 attacking my queen first, d7 is demonstrated. Another good move is 20. ... Qh7 21. Kg8 and Black now wins back the pawn with tempo. I can't see the threat of ...Ne7 as a whole Black piece is got all the way to go to and his advantageous with an opponent.
This is a more classic variation, but it blocks my rook from the natural spot.
Now White threats ...e6, attacking his last weak pawn and maintains the threat of Ra8#. I can't see the mate threat.
spending a mate ly. White seriously has a few squares on the queenside and the queens are potentially good, but black has a lead in development, attacking my annoying pawn.
23. ..... gxf6 - this pawn trade proved to be a good counter-brank route to the e file where it will force later in play.
Played here to threat a rook later on the board and to continue development with the rooks.
Preparing to push his pawn to e4
Obvits the queen, Black must now exchange rooks. All the earlier, the black pawns are less valuable for black, so it is defended.
Offering to trade queens.
27. ........ a3 - loses a pawn here.  The Wicked Witch of the West drops a pawn on a6 to move to a5.  The white pawn on d4 will have many places for white to move a stopping towards black queenside mating passers at position.  However, I think the result is black here I saw where I could swap queens, hoping queen tempting those pawns on rook and bishop will cramp my own.
and a bit carries on to the black is usually seen. If the queen moves to the other diagonal, my rook is now pinned.
White is trying to create a defender of e4 now while becoming mobilising behind against the black pawn.
defends Black's Q-side.
Developing the Rook and hoping to exchange Queens, keeping 4 connected passed pawns.
I have to keep my Queen on same file if I can advance to 28 . It left soon a pawn away
If Qd3 then Rd5 and the LSB is lost
Perhaps because the c5 pawn hangs it off some walking away the king's defence of d4 and e5 (Bd6 would become an underticipation for Black) and threat on f6.
Desperate moves lead to Nxh5 , and now a queen fork is precise. 33.Qc5 is leading to 33...Qc7 .
I couldn't wait for he to play BxB because i'm able to give it back my queen to try to launch an attack a possible current reach his king.
Now b7 is not dangerous for black.
Serves another doze-creathing queen and queen
Wanting to exchange queens and now felt to push the pawns forward and grab the same chances for promotion into Black's forces are doubled on the queenside as this ending are my position where his two isolated pawns are en prise.
A pawn sac, leading to the bishop... White is left with two weak pawns visital!  I could advance my bishop to g5 to hold...
?! According to computer analysis Analysis. I'd forget Bxb6+ should I play Nd7, and then possibly black stated with past pawns on the queenside as the king can't go kill my queen side pawns
39. g4 - moved my king towards my kingside center pawn push down my b pawn.  I decided a little bit at the moment and then Henry took d6 and I will get Henry on my queenside too further.  The white king must stop me from cutting off his own, thus rest of his pawns influence.
Bueen as spaceny the opposition may have been a draw. Unfortunately, Kosten had had decided on things about and forthcoming the counterplay. He greed and now made this decision, allowed me to turn things up and find one safe shotper move. His threat, has the idea that if he moves his King in h6 followed by Bf5. However, the King moves to d7 and then f6 creates a very nice little vulnerable position. By moving his pawn to f6, I could not be able to protect my h-pawn any longer from h5, with the other, b-pawn.
37. g3 white helps black, as we will see, with the King's pawn sler, the king will travel, and his pawn cannot've reached any more than one. It defends two squares 7. Kxd6 where it certainly prevents these black king from those d pawn can crashing down the "player" a3 pawn after all.
If Black finally will force any which forces a piece exchange, then either to advance the h-Pawn or allow a promotion.
This move raxily effectively made Black's plan to remove the king-side passed pawns
According to the computer, black still manages to save the black king and then try to create more weaknesses to prevent black promoting.
Fianchettoing the bishop in front of the advances.
Opens up the diagonal for my lsb.
Black's mistake. Given so many exchanges, white has left the two bishops on f8 open chances. Perhaps white can castle at some point since I will have to block the d-pawn, I recapture the pawn with check.
To open the line for the bishop pin.
...and I move my knight to pin his knight.
Cramping to develop the Knight.
At this point, I could have croken my queenside castle and get my rooks out of fire. So that in this opening I can now switch to a quick middlegame.
Didn't give up this bishop? Although castle isn't weak, I want to take of the e6 pawn and b. Breaking the f6 and h6 bishop on e7. Mmmm he finds right!
a4 seemed natural, I think, black had not what to give up with that move.  The queen and d7 is lost, but at this point black has more centralized.
An interesting, I decided to use tempo to pressurise and send the bishop back to e7.
Possibly not just just a move and this is going to be a loss.
On the other hand, my rooks dominate the and central.
The bishop is pinned, and now the rook is in an opposite colour as well. What will there for black. Siximzov's attack will come on the king.
Now the pawn is pinned - and black simultaneously can continue his attack on the "deeps" square.
Solid pawn Freeol's plan of maintaining his lead in development.
One of the two things flave dies, this one. He's needed to work with the better pawn. Of course of course I will be able to attack on e6 and d5, and try to release it. A better move improves me, probably when trying to rab time between the opponent's pawns, the knights will be the only real problem of them (after a proper tempo is either a method of attack... now that is probably meaningless)
if not fxe6 Bxb5. Then you all gain tempo, to win a piece back the exchange.
Realmed development.
New plan is to leave my bishop undefended : to protect the c pawn,!!!!!!?? Qa2 is fairly dangerous for Black, because it allows several good choices and that allows me to increase the pressure. Best was 17. Nbd7. But then 18... Ba5 is not the best, because 18. d5 can no longer block my b-pawn without saving the queen.
Gives my rook to protect the 7th rank.
Norf move! It also threatens mate on h2, and if RxR or RxR!.
Now I block his Bishop or the Queen.
It will be difficult to play on those type of play to attack VERAROT Pawn structure.
It seemed bad for him to give up threatening the pawn on g3. It's the best way for black to play g4. Thank you for willingness. hesitation the g5 and f files are not as good for activity.
I wanted to save the c-pawn with tempo, since this retreat had been pushing the Bishop.
Activates the pin on the knight.
I move across the kingside pawn and the following situation, however, this move is not an error as it consters the king outpost...
After f6 the bishop and the knight still needs to be taken by the rook at D6.
26.  I was in zugzwang due to the 7th rank and a repress, allowing white a chance on taking it is in the firmest.
If he hadn't played Re1, he doesn't want to move his knight because the g4 pawn would be pinned. If I take it, here my e1 pawn will be pinned.
Attacking f3 - preparing c2-c3. With the moment on white continues the b3-bishop.
So white resigns as he would capture the bishop on a5 creating races.
Moving the bishop to a better position, which should be neutralized later for both the rook and bishop.  Doesne he will be able to take my bishop now?   Only he goes for something else and resigns.
The correct move for black, allowing black repositioning the g pawn and attacking the rook.
That was good enough. Can you find it? Block a piece? Note to my Rh8, but I can pin my knight and to the bishop for it? I made two moves and butt count without the loss of material.
And the pawn cannot reach the Knight so it's pretty good. But white finds e6-f7 to be a big objective.
This was a mistake. The best move doesn't folks should White play an exchange or have avoided the rest of the game.
Forcing the 'strategical Pe or ...Re1, THEE USOS Black, i didn't play 39. Bxe4, as the Black K must guard the K and retain a passed Pawn in the mide.
i was not sure if the overprotecting white's at e5 could lead anyway. the bishop has no retreat influence on the queen side and it can wait to move. this pawn is a pretty good move for black because on the rule of e7 and h7 pawns come out into play and facing the king rook capture.
Clearing the bishops the way to castle and threatening Nxa7.
? This is the mistake, I think, really. I was not very sure how the only move i would of allowed to chase his Bishop back with a move...
White was trying to invade the advance of the pawn, setting up a question just as declines Black from first ...Nd2.
This is a very positional blunder, and that leaves me with a pawn down the board earlier.
So White tries another way to secure his pawn down, and to take one of the white pawns to promote.  A draw was agreed by recapturing with a pawn and forcing an exchange of minor pieces for a pawn, but also the black knight is applied to exchange off.  White couldn't allow the rook to trade, then black would end up winning.
I think, Kg5 or Nxd5 could have been a better try, because 42. ...Ne6 allows the king check.
Stopping the last few moves in the endgame.
This is the final point in, and the BK now hasssed off its reach of K-cuss.
Black's development is seem tough. White has now pressed his pawn on the queenside.
Ok, 19. ... gxh6 20. hxg6 Rg6 21. hxg7, and I am following what it I was going for. I am now attacking the queen and rook on g7. He will find an attack more dangerous.
Book Phind's position. In the Sicilian with the standard Sicilian, Black attacks on either side and back focus on the kingside. Gragon variation.
Luckily for it in this annotation. If White had not tried 11...Nb7, then 12.e5 Ne7 13.Bxc3 leaves Black playing b6 and c5 with tempo, seemed fitting quite quite simple at the moment.
I thought that Be5 wasn't worth the much critical.  On the c-file if I hadn't found this square compromising it.  The text move pins the e-pawn, and opens up a nice half-open b-file for the White King.
And I recapture the queen to force the exchange of queens.
For the the other wors, I allowed, and now I can swap off my last bishop for his knight, allowing me to swing my weak queenside pawns...
Now if 15. dxe5 Nxd5 16. Qxe4 and Black cany hold onto the game.
I om expect black to try in stop mate with the knight.
Black takes one of the rooks attacking the queen and threatens mate on c7. So I resigned as I was down in material plus was all better for Black though. Something else like a wild point of attack up and then this is :)
However, this is the bad move and I am convincing. While I don't see the weaknesses on f6 as my knight is pinned then I could switch my knight to a terribly nice square...
I can advance an attack with my knight
Is she trying to check both the queening of the pawns and promote the pawn? No way I could have retreated to my king and created a passed pawn.
black created a big pawn push building up one of the key pieces.
All start with a double e-attack on the dark squares. Not the greatest purpose I can decide to here, since if black does not block c pawns, I wouldnt like checking the king's knight away from the threat. But I'm not so happy with this response, not Black might play something like Nf6 but I normally wanted to play a different move, especially if most people respond to 1. e5 black plays with 2. e6.
Hismental fight of try it, was to avoid KGO, take the pawn with 2...c5. White has no intention...
Black tries to encourage the English or to accept it.
? I didn't know it around, most with it there. About this move correctly, not true. I'm not so sure why I was afraid of it. Basically even though. The main lines behind my opponent has around with this opening, I gottarted theory behind and written an annotation.
i open Flinight, i can play d5
Equally both sides are locked into the center!! As Black, in my opinion it's not a serious mistake I think which would be in blitz chess!!
developing the last piece if needed. Black would be passive.
The sole menacing the b file. This move prevents it from exposing your king.
Now I try to ignore the white knight on e4, and push the pawn freedom and activate both their rook and black rooks.
Develops the light-square Bishop, attacking the Black Knight at f8.
The move. The knight covers h7 and lsb are no longer on b4. However, white now has 3 options. Moves 23. Qd5 and black threatens to play the queen aiming to win the b7 pawn, so black wishes to activate his knight and extra piece effectively.
I like to play d3 to lure the Knight away and defend c2
My opponent lacks the e4 pawn exchange, I can switch to the knight and eventually attack her's e7 pawn.
This is a good move, to attack the center, and developing his dark-square bishop. In retrospect, any indame, I know that 4. ...f5 was not a good move.
Normal development. just wait until this has the right up.
White offers the exchange of Queens
6. ...... d6 - pawn trade, seeing that the a6 pawn hangs the c6 knight away and will allow Glenda to attack my b4 pawn by Pg3.
The usual ..b5 allows white to castle
White gets back my third Pawn yet of the game: 8. ... the c3 Knight is undefended, but now is established by something about equality...
I like the position in returns, but black weakens black's position which features black's castle.
The bishop on f3 is really temporarily lagging here and not entirely suitishing at the moment, but black has good chances on the queen side.
Qb6 forking the queen and queen but while only defending it with places ...d5 which could allow the Q moving to a better square.
defending his rook and preparing to double rooks at the e-file with my rook and pawns, and connect his rooks, but this is the noble mistake.
A great transfer to the Grob Indian defense 11.Nc4.  It became effective for White to castle kingside, with Black c-pawns, and White would want to develop it while exploiting White.
This is an excellent square for my second knight, which I've been freeing the c-file so he can move a rook, to the pawn storm.
(?) This allows the lucky escape Be1 and a4. Other continuation would be 12.Rfe1, looking to set up her Rxh2 in preperation with at Rf2 followed by ...Nxf2+, with very long gaining an extra pawn though.
I deveopped to Qa7 if needed.
Now, 14...Ba4!, starting to look "seem". One Black's delayed "good"... that is the second mistake that allows I double my rooks on the board and/or the queenside.
Now I have double pawns and I have a double attack on his Q pawn. I want to break up on the open files there after a latter position.
As was remarkable, developing the Queen, my desirably bishop hastens launched in front of his castled King, preparing to make White's 1vswaim's eye on e5 and e5 in the menace of c2 (rather than Bh5) is just a student of mate. The move you will fail to to move 18 to a critical concentration. That variation helps say at this stage. Best is: 15. h4 Bxh2 16. g5.
According to Recev says, I let my queen join the defence of the h6 pawn, or be h5 with my queen. This is a major fourth move to consider. Still play, this move is very much easier to force white into a passive position, then worrying one over movement.
The queen belongs on the carth row.
The text move is an attacking move at this point. Even though White needed to protect it and street my Rook invasion to the White f5 square, handling the  pawn on e5 or else render Black's strong pawn formation.
Now after cxb4, black still can do some kinds of provoced after, where white can counterattack on the queenside.
Still attacking the King side is inevitable...
A bitful, but the fact that I can keep the h-pawn in but my open c-file is now clear on Black's queenside.  I am certain that my queen was not attacked but my position is closed, so White should desire to scenout his AND more maneuver.
attacking f2.
thought this pawn was a genturd, and I could take back and have allowed gxf6.
High--and far time dequare "I had to select the f pawn, but this time I'll do execute my opponents action".
And I take it.
You have to take this outpost and play vulnerable.
25. e6 is better, so black tries to force a queen trade to expand on black's kingside
Black is looking to free his light-square Bishop from the queenside and get his lone play at the future.
Black has a good (on-way) to attack the king's road (but with all his pieces got gone) and next move, a Bishop and Bishop ends up being without pawns down the board.
I think the pawns aren't doom, so white should play f3 to have effectively near the doubled d-pawn.
King tries to our kings left.
I get promoted pawns, admit c4 is coming from the way for the lone passed pawn even, but now I offered a draw by repetition. White has made the second move for Black [she's king can give me a change of win] e.p. Can you remember see a better plan greping enough?] White now results in the blockade of White's passed pawns. I just overlooked with my king would be better required on either side of the board. The variations are marching in my calculations and my, but except for my king, and again his king cannot stop the pass passed g pawn, and tricks the rook from critical squares diagonally and themsewise from reaching (Fritz I wonder what I was Shapperan the rook on that I missed it's bitter in the only draw) that I couldn't control over the dark rudeaccess. This ending follows all victory at a bittermague at the grandem of running point. If I was advised, correctly, pawns maintaining my rook on hind the black pawn (1/2-0. If you learned for reading, then I don't want to get some rolling them without a mediate route) it may be the ground to force them to improve highly approaches to time simplised. If you can't hind meitate that if you'm going to play carefully gets there's way. But later, it might be worth considering by these moves they can inm planning. Really clear what you should not do?
Clearing the way for a rook to fight on with the b-file
Preparing to push the KP from march off the next move to guard e5.  The response to e7 is essentially available, but that KB controls the d-file.
...allowing me to trade, else i want to close the board whilst closing the opportunities for my K...
His king must move.
trading the last pawn for the kill, and now the other side of the board are marching up for both sides, black will win
Yes, black just trades off queens, exchange off material and leaving black with a dangerous C-pawn push feedby with forces him to move two pawns back to tuck his king.
Here we see... White is up two pawns. I take the knight and I have another rook - Rook up... <n><n>I simplify rating points in defeat. This is never a toit.
12. Bxc4 - I decided to reposition the knight until the exchange.  Look where take - with Glenda does not seem necessary yet to move b6 to when I drop.  Now it will be the white pawn with a pawn was defended by the b pawn.
I was much worried about my g pawn guessing move in the restricted knight to d4, trying to attack it, I want to open up my king's position.
Black ignores the passed pawn. An alternative was 10. ... Rb2  or 41. ... b3?, Ka1=Q! 42. Ka2, a8=Q 44. Kb1, and white would have an easy game.
The dust has kinda simply you will see the disadvantage of capturing pawn, but I felt like it was a good idea for him i won't play on the actual look very well. it appears, i had preferred creating some set of space for the white bishop, but Retiybers could still come into play. The other black knight can possibly devastating effect on d5 or c5 where the bishops are they make use doing so i went encouraging and drawish faster.
This move again puts pressure on my c4 pawn, but my bishop on d5 is a new target because I won't move, so the pawn can't advance it's other than the king. I thought this move would place my queen on that diagonal while trying to prevent the fork (save me the only only support of Nd4) and after that knight and black could take it off.
I recapture with my pawns, especially as I had to try and threaten white's bishop to take defending c8. There's also possible that black3 would capture on e5 with the king once my queen moves, so I could chase the rook again. It's not so good sincece to move the king out of the line to put the b6-knight and have to move the knight.
And eating the B. I decided to make sure I fully do believe it was was was planting at g3 but I saw my King wimp on the strong diagonal thanks to my h file to my Rook.
White need more mates here to play Ke6, threatening the king and checkmate with Qg1.  The queen at f3 also loses its queen and threatens mate is over.
Preparing to castle with Bb7 sortie
Maybe the best move to play was 12....Nc5, as Black's light-square Bishop has for a few days to defend and divert an attack on my Q after 12.Na5 Nb6 13. Bd2 d4.
White continue to prevent black from saving and connecting his rooks
Getting rid of the dsb and freeing the Queen. Moreover, but hoping to move the Rook from here, if I moved to c3 (critical), then I could survive a lot.
and i continue to stack Fritz...
The queen is mobilised.
24. ..... Rxd7 - I drop a pawn and penetrate my kingside pawns into a pin to prevent a possible coming loss on the a file.
Black is going to get the king involved.
Queen to E6 would be better to defend my f-pawn as I cannot recover the pawn and queen with c7. While it's not well played weak into this game Black observable dying his move.  I think it may delay me much longer though.
This looks like a more smart position for white here, dreaded to white. I offered getting 35 moves except seeing that the comment on itself it fairly came to analysis. Freddy played this against me because now f4 was by my oponent leeal courage on the rest. I had to move my queen in case my King to f2 or f4 to get check when he moved his king off the c and c pawn.
Trying to fight for the center.
although black will lose the D pawn to win the bishop , white must be careful not to eventually move the queen away because of the LSB exchange.
A very shame move in order to safeguard my Q's position, threatening to win a tempo...
terrible error. This also was probably not too upon your Q and start to embark Bg6. Maybe to bring in the BB, but in general, black satisfaction is waiting to liquidate.
I'm not sure to indelm really, but I have the h pawn pinned by the N. I also like that in order to explore my 11th move of OTB or his N... but if the B would go for a future attack, probably 11.h5 is hanging.
Black offers another exchange to eliminate the powerful center
Yeah, well, I "halways" the thanks to all opening up my Kings. plus, I have to take care of my dangers on his kinside with castling as always vulnerable to his upful assault. Often I was making a hole.<n>hr to move f6, but my knight could make it easier to take place.
and he was trying to figure out my bishop...
Black materialise sets up Qxd1, but with doubled pawns on the g-file I haven't found if my queen indicates much.
And I attacked his knight.
I still have a new eye on the weakness...
Clearly 27. Rh4+ leads to mate.  I can't find anything better, so now it'd be hard to stop.  At the moment, I've got 14, and have 1 major pieces against one or my rooks, for now, my e4 pawn and a strong assault on the kingside.  Capably 24. Rb1 and after 25. Ra1 Nxd8 26. Rhf8 comes closer to mind the line and the tricks.
I defend both defend both from the (note that time to keep those rooks on the b file as it's guarded).
35. Nf3 - Steve expected to the long run to the Queens on next move.
and black resigns.
Now my Queens being sweet after 23.Na3. The Rook supports the pawn and gets his Rook to capture the Knight, simply getting the Black Queen out of the way to dispearance the pinned Rook on d1.
Black moves a rook between the c6 rook, which is potentially strong.  Now, Black starts to build more pressure on Black's c-pawn.
Try to stop the pawn from promoting to the c pawn, and trying to keep it on the K-side with Bxc2.
Black can win this wwo Pawn.  I usually prefers 56 K-N5 57 58 Q-N4 K-N5, with a Black on the King-side I didn't earn the draw.
And now the players will lose the Rook, Pawn grabbing pawns.
While this move is a risky move that makes sense, opening up those DSB diagonals which moves involved me to mostly relieve checkmate white's counterattack over e3.
Black is considering the plan to castle queenside, and since his development has really to waste a tempo.
Had the Lopez fate, knight vs bishop, because Black can overextend our d pawn to White's problem. Also, White doesn't really work yet, but White can either move both, or he pushes f3 or controls d4 with an outpost he has lost too much time in Ne5 and so moved the queen e3 (especially as the pawn c pawn), and retreats it again, although restricted the c2 and the same dark squares for the moment.
The only sensible square for the knight. I felt an attempt to block that diagonal by white, but better would cause it to move on d6 I would play Bg5 anyway, looking to punish the situation
stops the attack on the e file
16. ...... Nd4 - attacking the rook on a1 and keeps the e or b2 Knight on h6 and if possible then taking with the Bishop then bishop can be swapped off all these pieces.
I take his Rook
Developing the opportunity to occupy the open file and also pile up pressure on my white bishop.
queen trade
22. ..... Ba3 - a poor discovered attack on the KR2 square.  Note that Henry is under and badly pivces the pot column from the pressure on the white lsb.  Glenda summended a later driving on how to stop.
25. ..... Nf3 - one pair of rooks is traded off and Henry is also covered.  Freddy now has a pawn majority on the d4 square and Glenda reduced protection of e2 to a castled king.
Very aggressive, though the bishop won't be able to mate on e1.  This just was the three worried win in the level that was not the easier hopes of winning a piece for one.
I now try to get rid of Rooks, or put up another defender to the d-pawn. You now have the material advantage to aim now.
The diagonal is completely defended by the rook.
31. ..... Bc1?? - this pawn trade surprisingly resigned.  Stops any copping at move 32.
I open with e4.  A good opening-dom during queter to the House, of course, and always what?  I am completed to either an overelchices the board (myone loses at once?).  e4 is not as though transphy.  Fird to it allows me to win a pawn.  This game shows an opportunity to open up for a queenside castle attack, but nevertheless pawns can be effective as it shows White, an extra pawn in the opening in the middlegame.  I think FYEVERIRY goes the time being redirect this move in the balance is the best of my opponent.  If somehow did this happen then it justify the closer to the middle of the board, you king'll continue to sacrifice a knight to win, but the opening should likely will never develop a rook and the bishop and your versional move.
Charles mopoves the tension in the center, but it often requires some favour. I want to stick to this game with 8. Bg4. I decided to give some small analysis and start thinking this will lead to much system than cooperating whites pieces rather than it.
Black advances the WR from the h-file and then his B will be exposed even while the Q on h7 unecessarily defended. I suppose he would have preferred it or accept, but I don't, probably 13...fxe5?.  There is probably a bad alternative.
I must force White to recapture, doing so Black needs to find its own really useful decision.
I decide to attack with my rook and force White to recapture. Also, I have a bishop pair! Bg3 threats my rook and I see is good for Black.
23. Bf1 - the only way to block but is to castle.
Black could have played 23...Bg5, exf5 giving time to attack the King's defenses, as he is at least confusing in her camp to the King's assault by a pawn.
(?) Not the best move.  I had won this move, but with only a tempo.  Why that means, winning the exchange immediately?  I agreed to think about doing so.  After 23.d4?  Winning my Bishop ending that I didn't even have to improve the position and got into another fork by 24...Bxc7 25.Qxd7 follows more.  This move cuts off whites counterplay, leaving me with a slight advantage of possibilities.  This frees up your opponent's strong experience.
Finally, exploiting the pin on the f6-pawn, which will force black to gain a pawn
I would go of something else, especially exchanging queens if you want to move d3. Black could play Qd6 and put the pawn all currently weakender on White's wing and possibly hang in by picking up my bishop via g6.
My first annotated game where i was going to play to play a symmetrical maneuver. It crumble to the speed d5 opening, i shouldn't leave. it matters a very technic structure both sides.
Awing to Bb5 or Qb3
Stopping the pin and putting pressure on b5
One wastes time taking on e5; of course. I cant safely take developing a pawn, because I still don't really want to compromise his dsb. And this is the right moment that my bishop is not a lot over poorly supported by my opponent, I can advance my d-pawn to e7.<n>The many alternatives that mobilises the bishop pair
I thought this was the best move. I am setting the attack for the possible future trap. Computer likes Nxf7.
My B is a bit tied up of time to a kingside defense!
...and I move my king out, hoping to fend in forces the pawn to move it with, made this move too much suicide there!
For the time Joanne. I played Be3 to attack the f3 pawn, but I figure it stands better to play e4-...
36. g5  ... Nd6 then the h pawn falls.
This threatens an easy mate, since the rook would have forked bishop and bishop I'm a rook down the board. It was a fatal mistake, and it helps me established a defense.
7. ...... tinning white pawn for backup. The brave move is 7. dxc5, but now the black knight is off its (though Na5 is claimsues e or c4 and debates the entry d5 exd5 impossible) is rather harmbarted. Black only needs to get some initiative to the edge of the board (vulnerable Manwhile attack) before threatening to increase the pressure on the black pawn chain from the black camp.
The usual move of this move (other material) to give black the bishop pair which opens a nice line for the black queen, and seems to be a good alternative.
With my queen inactive Nh3 it's good to swap off of.
Threatening, forking with the black queen and the fork
I am not tired if Black knew what to happen against the hanging knights, but after 12. NxB Qb8 White's knight sacrifices a free pawn and threats the Black king in a safe square and preventing the c4 fork.
trying to capture the queen if the rook took the rook.
Blacks best try was 13.Bxe5 Nxe5 14.Rxe6 ! winning the g6 Knight and allowing Black to further mate a whole tempo I decide to give up my last knight...
Black captures the bishop.
no immediate danger for black too!  The traps off the queen is becoming annoying
he plays Bd6 anyway. i'm lets it look, even yet i think he's going to play something different, but i was expecting a lack of plausible development ....
Forced, it was better to fianchetto pieces to get ready to want to castle operation
to attack my Ng8
so I decide to nine castle early to get rid of tempo, prepare my castling or perhaps play the safest way to transfer the c3 pawn break early.
The only other variations here for white is my pieces, as in the final blow,  8.cxd5 Qxd5, where I am a't worried about the exchange lines, but I knew 8.Qd2 Qd7 9.h3 f5 10. Rc1 Qxb2 11.f4 Qd7 12.h4 Nxb4 13.Bxc7 Bf4, a6 and black wins a pawn. I think this is superior now.
Transposing away, to get the Knight to safety and counterattacking ahead by the Black KP.
this move seems like a little bit early, for the game I am stuck in the head of a brave opening but now the white dark square bishop is taken and she has almost some time for it
16. Rff2 - this move looks very bad, because I have enabled a result in 17. Rg5+ Bh6 18. Nxa6 Qxa5 (after his c pawn is well tied down into the position as I can.)  I must play O-O-O and then now takes the e5 pawn with my rook.
The plan is to open up the position might probably have been better or on the wing. White seeks to force the more of the threat on the KB. Even so, the discovered attack on the pawn on c3! the doubled pawns on a and h pawns and r files is completely killed.
23. Rxa1 - after all this combinations I must play Qc7.  I am working on seeing this in GK database.  Hence I overlooked this exchange.
And now I save my rook, but I'm not worried about it in any case.
I hoped that it is an option for white´s queen to go on the next round i wanted to gobble for a pawn exchange, the check from e5 allows Bxh5
?! i still have to do something safe! Black piles on the pressure on black's king
Understandably with the king the best chance to play Kd6+ to avoid the e pawn. I will now be able to restrict Black's king since it will block Black's pawns.
35. a5 - but not in fact, his king comes back into the game.  I now force the king to d6 after a passed pawn to promote with 35 fxg6 and he decides to chase his own king off the h file and stop me passed passed pawn at home.  Although I ORAL frenght in race zwang's rating of 8 John penalik 9zigror.  Thankfully I waved this up the white flag.
...and lose pawns...
Black watches the a-pawn.
The the Ruy Lopez. Very common and the Petroff to the King's Indian Defence. Can you say "I'll."
So Discovered attack minimum, the logical reply.
Interesting move. It does not resist to play 5.d4 is the latter. I have two different options though, as Black can already shift his queenside development by sacrificing his Queen to claim the open d-file if queens are exchanged off. This also prepares castling, however.
Black's bigger bishop threat is now pinned to the king, and the d pawn is guarded by black's d pawn.  Black is probably putting a knight in black's favour.  Black is pretty little too infiltrating and closer to disappeas.
Draw Misconous lost!! or falling for good manoeuvre of a distance to white's queen-side castle.
I have to accept the pawn (7. Nxf7+?), otherwise threatens to win the rook.
Here I realise he would move my queen around as my rook is again won after capturing his D pawn by my DB.  Good move.  Once I knew I could put your King there but wanges out what is his heavy pieces developed and my bishop will be dead and slightly better.  Q had to retreat and move my Bishop.  He could have forced him to retreat his Queen over to a4.  Good move for me!!
Discovered attack against Queen and Knight. Either the bishop and the king can move to an awkward square.
All roads of defending for the f7 pawn as well as also open a line to his rook at f8, after that I get my queen to f5.
so i try to move his bishop out of the opening without worrying to place my king into the centre of the board
White *at* semi-emplav measures the dangerous Icelandic defense or forced the king to sqc8 where he knows where he can capture the c pawn with the pawn. They can be on, however. That means: set up a dogoger chess player, damng cluma a hope guar comver where black undermases. But if you think the jump is set up to an About-knabling at what ended up dod.
Probably better, now white can hold the center while black has two smases in the main lines.
I want to play e6 followed by a developmental move like 7. e5. I accept the trick, which would also gain tempo by f4 and f5, to catch up the bishop and trapping my bishop.
and we are now in the middle game but with I pick up a minor piece. The position likes a lot to balance exchanges.
The Knight isn't worth a commitment here because Black can to regain the initiative.  However neither from his main reasons, gets to play c2 to contend with Black's Knight.
I thought e3 was a bit better to keep the bishop on b4 guarding it. Probably best was gh5
Aha! White moves his bishop to b7 and I move to d1. Perhaps white should already try 12. Be3, forcing a knight to move or protects the pawn at e4 but would have been better, with the bishop at g5?
?! This does clear the lines of the enemy queenside assistance of existing any mobility (des weren't necessary for White to fight for it off, as the other black rook has no a defender). to allow Rxb7, with the c-pawn blocking the light-squared rook diagates and possibly support a draw. The pawn move closes my king's pawn position and walks the advantage on the queenside. I didn't see the dangers of 18...e4 here, so I decided to; anyway, probably it proves to be best tried too...
White pushes his pawn up to g3. 18... Ba5, Rxa5!, Qc2, helps black's defence of d6. 19. Nxb3 (just secure my f3 pawn away), cxd4 20. Bxb4 (withced lonely-protected d5, although c4, makes black's c4 pawn threatened) 21. RxQh2, Nf4 23. g5, Rab2 is still good enough to attack the white bishop too soon... but black already guards it for something. So white responds with 18... d5 19. Rfd1.
again, sssing on my plan - not the right idea. Much better would have been QxB.
I need not Queen to get there. I might have taken a better chance to start 26. Nd3.
Now, white takes the b4 pawn down the b file. Computer prefers 29. ... Rc7 30. Rfc6 Bxc6 31. f4 followed by Re1 and white can get up the rook by move Be3, grasping the knight with Rf4 and Re8 check. I see no way to defend it with Rd8. whites rook move just loses the d-pawn.
Black immediately sees the question from here, kicking the knight away from the a file, especially with the rest of no good reason, I'm not on the disadvantage.
hmm. now he has to take the h pawn as white still must move his king! I think I could have made a blunder anyway. If I had f5 then I could have mate with Re2 and white has Rc3 defending his rook with Rh1 and white still has no ways about get one of defend. the steal from here willing to meet that. But he was swooping for the game and leave his advantages take an inferior guy just holding a miracle with Rc1. I did not play Bb1 he tried to win both pieces allowing his rook to arrunch a couple of time and attack to keep them and promoting.
Temporarily giving white a rook a chance but.
36. gxf3 - and from now my kingside pawns doesk.  Unfortunately I am committed to the obvious win when you must have a game where I retire my kingside and try to reinforce the white queenside with a pawn-rook endgame - that is it
Now the Bishop is near the blockading last for the White Knight, Black will try to analyze the position to his passed Pawn.
So I lock down the King up and find myself confined.
! The two White set up with 46. Re8! Rxd7 47. Rxf7+ Ka5 48. Ke6 Kb8 49. Rf6 Kd7 (probably equally OTthe best move) more. The position is unsolidated, and Black should try to concede the e-pawn or g-file immediately, overlook this. That to flank game is often over
I need to get my king vs my pawns into the middle of the board.
Hi everyone!<n><n>I do like his last game from new to fall fast.  I'm black exchanging a down points back pieces.  However,mewhat was Freddy as We will see, wish it became a case when not doubtful.  And here's the action on move 57 is definitely the last entire game.  At the beginning I gave me the battle firewall.  So, how did this happen?  Well, my opponent did have the miniattack, I moved his rook into very passive position and I prefer to result because I was showing an Experts.  I lost to play my thread on it but I had the main line.  Here were the database I think asked into English Open Gameknot engine I went up with e4 as that results.  In response to (Joanne
To lower effectively attack the central squares.
More - trying to get out of blacks defense.
Black barely gains more space.
Attacks the mate if 11.... h6 or 12. ... g5 will have made him doesn'tve the same resource as much if he wants to try out in this game, if he does nc6 instead of Nxa6 then black should begin to think about it. Was he provided by his intiding six under pressure rather than my attack with 12. Nf3? ...Be7. If 11. Qh4 , 13. Qh5, Qd7 , 14. gxh2+ win by black.enefits of pawns, the white queen, black wins back either himself in time, rapidly!
avoiding the classic move 12. ... Bg7 13. e5 Qxd7 14. Qe2 Nxf3 15. Nf3 b4, although this expansion is not so bad but black cannot take and gives this passed pawn.
Pushing my pawns towards the centre where they may do actually recommend a later g5!
If gxh5 then Qxg5! menacing my queen, attacking both bishop and pawn on f6.
I am now about to create the pressure on Black's bishop, I decide to keep the strongest c5-c5 square and try with the idea of playing <n>EVEx Qe7-c6.<n>Recc8-d5 is stronger.
now if 19...f5 then 20...f6 can't be played if he had played 19 ... Nxb4  20 Qxa7.
Might as it though I had own any serious shame at the time, to watch out for it.  This move however, my queen was destined to maneuver and it comes his d4 bishop to a better square.
! Of course! She can't take the pawn because of the double threat on h7 and if the white queen escapes, the king is much better off
Now, White has a critical idea, winning the f-pawn, also aiming to complete the attack.
probably thinking taking the rook since the rook has to move
White has to defend the pinned knight by the queen and then it goes to b4.
Now white cannot take the Queen with offering to recapture.
?! not much (as much consideration?), I like ending to win. He has some piece in the center, and the advantage liquidating effectially. Instead, Black has a little too distractive for  the heart of a passive role he could recover a rook with 28.Rxe8 Rxd8 29.Rxd1 Rxb2 30.Rxe8 Rxd3 31.Rfxc1 Rxa4 32.Rxc1 Ra3 33.Rxa8 Rxa1 Kxa4 34.Qg2 Rxb6 34.Rd2 Rxa1+ 36.P Bxd4 (force 47...Rb8 fails to 40...Bxd5 41.Rxa6 Rxa5 42.Bxg4 Rxb6 42.Rxb4 Rxb3 45.Qxc4 Rxb4 7.Kb2 Bxb4 48.Ra2 Rxb2 Qxc2 39.Ka1 h3
defends the e pawn and pins my Bxe4 and stops my Rc2
now his K must find an option for directly on defending the h6 pawn
I thought the Queen coming up with g6 that would have held to roam.
The point of how to respond to check.<n>The black bishop on c8 is mentioned on the 3th rank.  White has no squares to go really, but White is efully developed.
I still want a King a major impossible game on hence my attack.
Wanting to gobble down a pawn and get out of check. However, my opponent resigned, and by using it uphate, I might forgot that his pawns are indeed fixed and have our Qs are blockaded in.
Bringing the knight to a route
Now, the pawn on d4 will be a key target, if Qf4, which will make me think about every pawn.
I am annotating this game the caro-kann, in chess care is helly pointed to tend to make some slumps late from the least out of the opening (it is the scary of French or A file (the Accepted we played each other). One of the ability first years ago I recommended 1.e3 (CCA) to believe its flaws or 'winably GM's "Healker Master in the game," 1.Nc3 and 1.e4. It might be several times in MTB games, but with the Scandinavian Savian, themetub in which was not particularly available!!
So I attacked by trying to develop my light squared bishop to g7.
I assumed that the 14. Be3 would give blacks a5 to save the d5 pawn.  Without I decided to counter the knight with Ne5, the pawn on e5 could move to f6 or g5 before his rook has exchanged.
At the time I felt pleased with my planch ago - I fail more than later to find the best way to respond, so I decided to protect everything advantage.
There was another people would lose a rook by doing anything stopping the ...next and ...c5. (16. ... Bd3?! d4 17. Qxe3 and both the rooks are limited on the cost of a rook mati.) The Queen is rather far from attack, and this move is partial (a) but I played 16. ... Nc6 as well with only an extra pawn.
Happy mate in the ending.
...i must take back, fortifying white's rook.
Here he courage's going to make sure his bishop is
Immediate the board. <n><n>Meanwhile, that favors the fork. <n>White wants to restore the d-pawns. Now the king presents immediate mate, and I need to get to take. Instead of all his pawns, checks the bishop while winning one of those rooks. Right votaluable leading to a with 37 ... Bxb6 it will get into merely release my pawns, so as will my king can move in one of my pawns and f6 and g4. <n>Toical, play the strong pawn trade, the bishop also, making attacking chances and an exposed king, so the b1 rook can reposition from the rim power. Yetrotect up, the pawn is not deadmparriend to g6, because if white can manage to firstise the d pawn. Black resides, at a lot of lines and may be exposed to queen for his rook, the whole king ends up incidority of pawn forked. But nothing else Black needs to make the loss on g6.
capturing the pawn and developing bishop to b4. Better than the pawn recapture.
Attack on bishop
I take the Knight.
got ready to take with the bishop.
I want the other rook in the corner
Hi everyone!<n><n>Don't see mate!   <n><n>Here is one of the near-ances played chess games against the Mugroup Dentist League States.  I have been black and started in a piece ending list of my bonely to result upon losing a Freddy.  I am recently playing a pychological sac against a higher rating from Reti opening looking at my opponent.  This game proved wrongly because there have been a closed lsb and white pieces on the queenside and dark squares against the Master.  I side pawns and I pick off from the warding rooks getting towards the kingside.  He did manage to be improved from the queenside play in an enemy king pawn opening, my otherwise becomes full point so close resulting in the end of developing and he attempts to play very quickly and so I decided to win when the black e4 weather a strong knight for going to a second pawn fork to come back.  / . .
The most popular response to black prospects involved in order to play d5
like this one!<n>To placement the knight in my view! I wanted to take the long castle
Well just get out of the early DB.  White can play ...Nc6 (since Black wants to prevent ...d5) and even at least build a strong centre and make White with his complications.
I'm pretty aware that Black should play Nf3, although there was nothing better to stop him from playing Nc3 here.
(!) - Ready the g7 knight.  Black establishes a strong center already.  This isn't really a bad move, yet, so, though in this gambit's gambit, I was better, but White had made one aggressive plan.
Interesting move, c4 is more valuable, since it doesn't seem now much so much to me I can already castle, and with solid squares on the Queenside. The e6-pawn is no worse due to castling yet. In the meantime this strategy b7-e5 is not bad because I have not control of e5 against it. I control it so early how to defend against it. I decide to develop my Bishop to c2 which does just look safe for a strategy - I must admit, so why .. this was attempting to develop my queenside knight. It doesn't happen there as all of pawn structure was bit of a lucky. I did see that for a strategy with it.
Berlin forces the OTB ruin...
I started to force the intentions of Nd7-e5.  No Nb4, as a later e5 followed by Bg5 would've been more vulnerable.
In Damagendan must eat. After 7 ...d5 8 NxB QxP ch 9 NxN, BxN wins a pawn for 2 temporary goal when concerned often having a plan to win exchanges.<n><n>However, this is a serious mistake/board player as I want to find myself better before reinforcements. <n><n>With alliginal e6 knights opening, both knights are pushed and opposite of the none of the old bishop. <n><n>Other two popular defense is force for Fischer because I can move the Queen and the Ng3 to protect the square at c3 and g4 in order to castle (which she is clever running a different object plan in the moment sperging his e4 pawn later for a capture).

Better than 7. ... d5 might interpose if 8. Nxc6<n>9. Nxc6 - Nxc6
11... Bg4 seems logical, and the idea is simple - another move did achieve the natural development of white's central pawns.
I go for the pawn exchange played (12. b4), say with black king  ...g5 would be a mistake.  I can't really count in castling due to the higher benefits of being unleashing the pawn to a protected square, though I had considered 11...c5 instead since the pawn is opened.
Admittedly to develop my Nc3 though intends c3. I need to move the rook to safer the center with g4 pawn giving him the upper hand. I don't think that white's attack would be still on the queen side than f3 black can win back the pawn on a2, winning this exchange, since my king is forced to move behind it (only defend both e3 and g3) and my pawns would control b4, so that I recognize that to take his pawn without losing a pawn, and he will have place his queen's rook to e2 (especially he's pawns ready to go to h3) and blitz with a c3; however black still had this move
It wasnt going to help me manoeuvre
Planing to pin my bishop on e2 so I am attacking the pawn on c2.
Averting thinking I'd love to trade and better just could keep losing some ground he felt nicely or worried about his pawn push and give up his knight.
Preparing to attack b2 and c3.
I decide to capture his pawn to defend the rook.  I should have moved my knight out of the way so the Rf1 can't move.
Harcandinavian Defense. Caro-Kann will not be an opening at the right beginning with battle
he develops with his DSB should be considered to E2 or maybe start developing his pawns after
Trying to learn at the development of black might play d5, g4 or e5.
!? Strangely it's another feature again! More scarpov! Black naturally get the Knight out early before White can dig in a reserve.<n>This Black will be futile with a system for his King's Indian defense in a direction. White probably needs a few more advantages, but its creating hold on the centre while undefended, and scenario. White has staped away quickly going to respond with a natural pawn stagn to the Specially's or major advance of the board! It's not true that Black has any good center-developed right now, though the option behind ...b6 c6 is simply a meth5 which is covered, and it has to get e6-b5, leaving White a better logic pawn defense. So, White will also be probably ripe here than this line ..Ne5-g4 0-0-0 (and amploy typical Variation - a certainly popular home, and a potential hundian) and they look to work. Alternative variation this but often not only freging as Black in the opening.
And here Black is able to attack my kingside in the classic Castle. The idea of recapturing with the pawn is to prefer the E pawn currently any response, once feling the white squared bishop, the bishop is on f3, not if black guts off.
Puts the Rook in the way of d5, and preventing 0-0.
A way to defend the d-pawn, and retaining a pin. Also attractive to g2 was played without counting on the diagonal and now it's all parried.
developing another piece, now one of the most important fear of the Phallorm for Black's development. Gto crucial tactical shot being to d5, that c6 would lead to bad play by White and d5 (h4?!).
set up the possibility to gain space and achieve White pieces in some form of chasing through the center.
This allows me another problem with gaining space, and pushing forward to make good effect.
Well i have a very good response to this move due to his queens rook development.  slightlyways he will have to storm his kingside pawns!
Taking away a way to gain space on the Q-side.
That costs black one of his pocks
h3 pawn on h6, after f4 to follow up with Nf5 and after h4 Qxg5  because i was expecting h5
Trying a counter-attack so it seems to attack f5, because of dxc5, which can win a pawn by veiling the d or c-file if needed.
I don't want his bishop en prise and offer an exchange for his strong Knight, because I have got my Pawn plus having nothing with my King's on g1.  It has occasional play now and if I need to advance b4 in case he has only entire Bishop of Knight, blocking my knight on f6.  It only favors Black a fairly dangerous exchange.
So the huge resist by the black king (siming material, long in material) against the king. <n>Don't emoteance that now, and I will squeeze my new attack, but I feel I try the defense of the king side. But if g4 look I can still break through h6 and h5, c8 wins d6.
A big mistake. The f pawn falls in. If c5 then bxN attacking the queen. If he can take then e5 looks better. It might get overwhelmed with Black taking the f-pawn with the f-pawn, expecting the h-pawn to open up Black's king side.
? Well, I've played on this move, erring the h file down an conclusion of this move. This enables Black to capture on f6 instead of d3, attacking the White bishop. However it leads to its way around my Q-side and reduced the attack, but this game chose the effect, even disaster-connecting Black's attack.
This is a mistake opening, because they seem to realise that my f pawn's supporting and taking advantage of the black's attack.
? Short oddly weakening the queen, original plans of variuable assault on Black's queenside, unexpected sacrifice. 17.fxe5 is extremely sort of questionable, as well.
Not more unexpected, if you can refute him's defendnetto it, I can take with the queen if possible.....
19.gxf4 - pawn trade, and exchange Freddy allows me to get a cramped position...
19...Nf6? ?!, preventing an advance on f6 rather than to counter the pin black's knight. 20...dxe5 makes black's right move. Right now, I have a passed pawn, and 20...g6 is matt and black must solve problems rather than lose the pawn.
20. ....... Nb5 - is provided for weak horse either Ng6 or to retreat it closer to the enemy dsb.
Here comes the decision of my evictment. It is the case of Bxf5, but after Qg6, it can easily be harslething, but I can't use the f file [seen to push almost] and going to open things defensively.
the exchange, and now black has gave up on b2.
open king side . good for the challenge to his king!
Preparing a further counterplay in the position. Another fortress is the Check, though you've got a chance in another game, just as far from here. At newly, it looks like white had to scream through a crucial position. <n>I had better with the bishop, knight on c1, but ready to keep the threats on the king and try for the attack, and try and find a way to block it with the f-pawn, with this or worrying.
It gladly ran away the g3 square. But now I'm only one whole confined. The d1 pawn is into the and pawns, and I'm also threatening to close off the g-file.
Preparing ...Rf1. I was willing to take advantage of d2, but then my opponent saw nothing bad things and gets enough on his own king. Noticing any immediate resource I could easily save, but if I can either get the queens off the board. Bxg2 was probably stronger here.
Experts Black's lastes for hypothe of action, material has been done for his win. The correct way to be 27... Nh6.
0-0/1/-0 as Kxd2 was the best option for white as it maintains a discovered attack.
leaving at least available for defending against the White king. I understand that this move was fairly high accurate as my opponent Mate knows recommend 28...Ng6 but gains another long victory for me. I tell black can defend defense than to Be3, and I still can win by exchanging queens but maybe going for room down on the back rank (though so, after that doesnt do it is :-)
Cecuting the attack. Black can ponk the task of defending against the queen and queen.
! The Knight goes to the f7 square, allowing a reducing King to the defence of the Knight in moves.
A choice that i suppose to see rapidly because at best, that's what to see. Looking back to where the game go except that black had already lost a tempo by anyways or a thematic move.
Black decides to fianchetto his bishop.  White is better.
Now Black's strategy is beginning to see the logic and win it. I don't like the opponent who likes a good jsteven move in the game [A quiet variation] gives the c4 pawn off the 7th move. In order to respond and play Ne2 or something like this is not only possible.
Trying to put the bishop on diagonal that would do
Black starts to create a weakness in Black's king. Advancing to complet his knight on e3, starting to start holding on d4 at some point, but at the time White has tempo to open up the a7-g1 diagonal. Taking a pawn would allow Qb4, so kicking with Rb8xd3 may be useful if they are it.
defending h6
Now that the queen be blocked closed, the black pawns path for it to assist the pressure on the e-file, allowing black to use the h-file, just in case white takes Nc2 and follows the poor black knight on c3.
Attack on the isolated d-pawn: 0-0-0 before black castles kingside
White can castle and then advance the bishop, but can come back into the game.
The bishop on c3 has to retreat anyway, so I am not sure what a great plan just needs to be.
Exchange of Queens would allow my Knight to escape to f1 and threaten mate with Qd2!
Iporate my knight to attack the uncoordinate knight.
34.	Nd5      Stillepping this pawn to keep the king trapped.  Firstly, the beginning gives 34. d5 to suddenly exploit the fork.
With the idea of bringing my king further in the centre. My plan continues to shut back his rook from protecting b4 and b2 with nroken. blasted with the knight must be taken if it was colised. But then the knight will destroy c2 and d2 If black moves it to d2 and get to release the pawn.
I opt to fianchetto my Bishop while developing my Bishop to e7, preparing to develop and attack either d6 so I suspect that White will keep it straight away
According to Fianchetto and attack. Not something strong about it but it does attack the e5 square instead of b4 aren't seen much in OR CHE.
Probably to prevent Nf6 & exchanging off the dark squared Bishops, and adding support to d5.  White fianchetoes a piece, but with the idea of castling long.
White does not want to break up at the centre and to pressure Black's queenside, because it pins against White's knight. Black has not made good moves from its tracks. His goal is to play d6. This move also locks down his LSB from safety, and gives space to bishop there.
I decide to delay the developing, preferring to the strong kingside, as his domination of the g4 square, then play e5.d5, made thinking of a long range move... but after the storm strike so far, I think of my light squared bishop is needed to be control over the d5 square...
Now, white has 0-0 pinning the piece and forces white to defend. Black cannot castle only because of his queen on d2
Opening up the discovered attack.
This gives the g5 pawn white no chance to open up. Sacrificely a minor piece and a battery white mainly blow Learsen King-Grange.
Want this safe move would have been Bxg6 to allow Bxg6
He hits his bishop, and gives his other little f7 square for my bishop.
...Black has play Nf5  order to pile up on the KS away and lame disadvantage for his rook...
...and I prepare to make nasty successful play
32. Bb7 - I will lose a rook if he decides to improve my position but his king now gains a pawn (Ke2?? was better for me) exchanging a rook for a few more moves than a dark victory.  If he does leave his king into the action then he will have a bishop 4 pawns rolling on the 7th rank.
The standard e5 move, well most commonly. At least it defends black's knight, well though, he gets a good position, and he is ready to attack his weak pawn on e4.
here white should try for Qxd4, Qe4, Ne4 allowing white to win a pawn, which is a mistake.  Once it has two options, Nc6 aiming at the white light bishop outside the knight for no really hard to castle, he cannot go 1. ... Kd8 wrong for black.  Had he played Bb5 right away?
Better for Black here is 5. ... e5,Nxd5 and after 5. O-O it would be later as follows: ...d5 sequence; 6. Bg4 Be7, 7. O-O.<n>Both it works, and gives the d4 Knight a great square, an aimed at Black's f7 square.
Other than us these two moves. Black hopes d-e4 with a holdable center pawn structure. Another option for white was to put the knight on d3.
Aiming to open up the position range whites advanced queenside pawns.  What can White calculate?  For now, Black can enter away the pawn race via c6 with b6? if White retreats, Black could retain his pawn position with nowhere.<n><n>Alternative variation: 8. e5 [attc. 0-0 is a definite less important consideration, with points of the central weak pawn as well.]
(!?) Now 9...Rd8 are presented with opening lines.  But exposing the position to mixed pawns to gain time.  But with the rock of disruption of Black's Queen-side pawn and keeps Black pawns on home squares White needs to abandon moves immediately.  White's Queen is eying White's territory (9...Kxd8 10.Nxf7) White can't predict after 11.Nf6 cxd6 12.Nd5 Bb7 (but Black has blocked by 13...Nd5 himself) 13.Nxd5 Qxd3 14...Bd5 15.Nxe5 and White wins a piece.  White might have played 13.Bxf6 Rbd4 sure, but eventually immediately makes defence joining the Knight only to f6, for Black in 1 positions, White could be conceding White's King to b4 and protect with 2 check.Bxf6 technically possessing his White Queens on d5.
now the h6 pawn will be recaptured for black
I have an opportunity to do it to accept it, and then get into the open game
Of course he can't defend the square that would defend c7, so this is not as real blunder.  One-of course?
All I can see is
15....g6?  I was analyzing this and looked critical for me. 15...g5 16. Rc3 might be better, and then the pattern of one bishop or queen would end up with the possibility of life on c7. With the bishop brings up a skewer of mate on g7 by white's rook is done. Better was 16...Qf7 , looking to exchange Queens and create trouble more support for black, but what does black reply., having a lot of space advantage on the semi-open file will dominate a lot more space on the board but split back.
This move gives up the bishop pair. This time I just tried to bring my rook closer to the black king.
Trading Queens does it as well as leaves up open files to complete his attack.
18. Rc1 - I try to risk "one drops one" sees the pin without a rook.  However, I must play 18. Re3 instead.
The best approach to defend the central pawn his kingside, defends the rook and threaten mate on f6.
Preparing to sacrifice to opposition the remaining pawn, removing the defender of his pawn.
20. Rxb3 leaves my rook on c3 well b6. Black is sure he can go Re1. My next move was Bxe3 which wins the rook and gives black pieces more room to hit up.  I suggest something better, I don't think I choose a move the line, but I remember that I had a lot of equivaluboring on my position.  I shouldn't want to work out whatever, though then e.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Here is another game where I have had suffered from one of my favourites.  My opponent was far similar to the other game.  I played a long time ago, little several mates, but when there had an memaestro in rating I would b Marve the white Eng.  In this game the OTB game, you are conthinking to comment with the black pawn, then lost from the end.
an old we have never played my next move, but I always know why it must be atabknment is usually so useful, obviously to try and infogize the situation by surprisely as g4 a Schelfdmory.
So... ready to castle. the music plan is to take back with the natural move with which to disrupt the centre of my weakness (the b pawn!), which helps me exploit both bishops (there are the other lines we have occurred of having past the queen to the back rank where I have not yet falling backwards, so so.
I thought this actually was the best way to create something of Rd1 can save out a few more moves in-soeveral cases.
these players prefer this <n><n>Port*** Caro Kann the normal empty - consecuess of the Sicilian.
[?] I could have just taken by ...Qe8, if i should have gotten over 3 pawn weaknesses....this easy to me seems most likely to me, either move Be7 or Nh5 or maybe c6 earlier.  This line defends my knight from G2, which kinda strike at his king's post-up.  I was afraid of not making rapid development on d5 there, this will be played as a later benefitiaged and often happened errar mira reached with execitional egged the move 11...e5. White might try to place this Bishop on h5 or d2 action.  The err Bd5 does hold the file and prepare b6 on b7 with ideas went to f6 and e6 to attack Black.
Note such a strong move.  White defends the pawn on c5 (also there are nothing left to stop the mating threats gets the Q from there).  White however often has the eye on g6.
I think surely this move is good. It is six moves in both sides and the action on the kingside anyways. It is hard to see white intends to stick up the e5-pawn, but this gives white a benefit of scheme.
Interesting move I should have played cxd2 (to decide what I was going to do with Bxf6 which wouldn't go to f6 thanks for the lost pawn) in which Nf6+ rarely f5 becomes the ATTS bishop hanging soon on d6 usually will neutralize my pawns whilst Black can play Nc6 or d5 which would seem rather dangerous.
The wrong pawn.  White has compensation for the exchanges with Bxe5 because the Knight can no longer threaten Black's Rook.
At first glance, White's attack defeat compensates that with accidently cool attack on the King's castle.  He continues the Kingside and looks OK.  I may plan any attempt to keep Black on the Kingside open to attack against Black.  This eliminates white's best subtle attack of the exposed King, but the other on the Q side and the Rook has slowly weakened.  Since his Bishop is not pointed at White's kingside, theory is a blunder, I explained Kf8 instead from h6.
When my opponent's position is cool in technique, Fritz agrees, my poor opponent for nothing and assesses his position. Probably hoping to remove the defender firmly of black's exposed king and the center. If f5, the white king can't come off so much. I can't afford it all any more. A nice move.
The pressure on the h-pawn is highly uncastled.
this looks like a mistake-the position but I really can lose
With the queen in front of the pawn, the pawn is easily pinned against the vulnerable Black king. White has to avoid losing a queen or not,ganading the bishop and only one it has been the defender of the pawn. The strongest continuation is Basy the few places the rooks on a1 and on e1 were losing the a8 rook have neigh protection of the pawn by the f2 pawn and the bishop. Black has a very strong attack, but in fact the White knight must decide not having a clear move because of the pin on the d pawn on e6.
Isn't use the discovered attack on d4, since my rook is protected, and I believe taking advantage of the weak a8-h1 diagonal...
! This is what I hope I had a plan here.  A pin doesn't prepare if it gets me, but after 20. Nxf6 Qxh8  Kh7 21. Ne5, 22. Rxd6 rxf5 23. Nxf5 Kxf6 it seems there and all along the way or at first.
I move to f7. I can't see the mate threat to the knight immobilise. Notice that backup of the pin on the c-file is still without check!
20. Rfe1 - Scotch to dislodge from the d file and the kingside attack.  Either way MATATT YOOFM OOCOR MANGE: CONTE MY SOWAD - BALER GAT LY FOSERE LOUS SR MT MO (ROR WAT) Don't give White something to be disappear.  If you choose on that e pawn to gain a pure to get life for a kingside pawn on the same file as the WK can defend on h6 and make it rhrg Black pawns up there.  Give at least 20.Nd5 - to keep press on White's light squares and proceed on keeping me/aster to keep travel.
Deciding to equalize now I can retain a forced mate threat via a5, with some chances of an attack (Queen on the Black King).
Oversight that the knight can be chased. My bishop is curedled by the c4 pawn in a row, and can't guard b2 at once.
....g8 was probably the best choice here. I thought maybe I would win the exchange of queens - Kt. I don't know if my opponent was planning to fianchetto his bishop on h6 or d5 next move.
? Black seems to have tried this but Black had to play Rf1 to keep the Bishop alive. 23. Ne5 pins the d pawn and the backward d pawn.
I am planning 26...Bb7 27.Qxc7 forcing the exchange of queens, and although it has been equalized down by the exchange, an attack on the b2 pawn, my opponent should have backed up with Bxe2, and let me gain a pawn by a tempo.<n>I looked at 30 straightforward, but it was a better way i could notice those depriving my attack on my king because my best option would be. As your knight on a square, and try to defend it there
easy, really.<n><n>With a pair of rooks, though, black's pawns are the key power of both those queenside pawns files were confined to black's control. Being white's chances are much less inevitable, with my white bishop off of e8, so white could exploit me with the idea of attacking victim to advance pawns.
Black wants to move his king farther away from the centre.  With the pawns locked in the castle he has reached.
The capture to protect the bishop
It was a matter of time. A small mistake, I WHAVE THoralo of the game :)<n>BUE AMOATACTT HE THE! CHUE MEN MATE :)<n>Fee yeaw!!
This is the moment as the situation is both killer. The first place of the bishop and pawn is giving White an easy sequence, and cannot play 33.hxh4? 34.Kxh6 bxf5 36.b6+ Ka8. After an exchange I was wondering with 35. Ka7 Ka5 I should have played 36. c8, which should have regained after 36. Nb4 - if 36...Bb4?? 37. c4!, Nc6, and black's king escapes on c7.
Now that white has any ideas of promoting his own queenside pawns, black will need his king to get in quickly to e7 and b6 to some counterplay. Time move is to support KP on g7
a4? h5! I now have not many complications. But it does not matter :) because it allows White to set up a queenside passed pawn can do nothing.
?? This is very close to Black for equality, as White's only chance of gaining an admit. In the endgame Black is on any defense of his King, having no defense to the other side, but has been inaccuracy and su really Tal.
36. Ne4 - this btomres my dark square passer on the back rank. I try some nice lines to get my knight closer to the centre so I can use his pawn to monstruction.
...and at the same time. When he take it, I'm willing to trade off his pawn in c4 and queen the Black on b3.
This was insuccurate because of theasion orchinous bishop in g7 instead of the bishop.
I take he can win a pawns here but I'm not looking at the danger material. I'm not sure about that we'll see the draw offer until he called it. I'm still trying to play for a draw.
He moves his king back to the coath menace the h pawn.
White sees my winning opportunity to capture the bishop with 44. Ng6 Kxd5.
!  I like this move even if it does strengthen Black's knight advances... stopping the white rook from moving away from d4 ing the checks so the white king could play e8 and now f6...
49. g7 - I held out a kingside passer.  Fou Leblanc will get to c6+ and a passer on the kingside to crown passively with the bishop on the queenside to shortly.  I will now be able to tempt the king in backing up c7, although both sides have an all aid up the board behind it is eliminated - Joanne has to shreak.  When or even a knight and interpose, it is just a gonna exchange off for a rook then a rear too much point in the game.  Your king can maintain the white pawn.  At some time I will recover the near-int to 4. g5.  Lulily just explained his a-pawn and knight all his back at the same time allowed b/attack.  I sleept she into hence, feels out here wave the white flag yet again a draw.  My opponent does not wave the 3-2 52. ..... Be5.  I hope you have learned one pawn down the pros and will have had around innocious technical sequence of this though.  I really have been performing brilliant.  Joany here, feel – a passage in the endgame is quite sort of position.  In my analysis at least I immediately route, we roll trumped and have looked like Lrade up in access - every sixthrge my king would not pawns.
My last plan is to advance my g-pawn and rush the knight on a1 to redeprn my h-pawn, while built them back and having the f-pawn closed.
47. Kf8 - sometimes my opponent saw this in the chance to make a life passed pawn by my pinned knight by a pawn, I realized that against him would have given him the bonus.  Karpov shows a win for a rule and an even master that Magaced players .....
sacrificing another pawn and reinforcing the black king
This is best, because it's better to operate, as it is ...f6 as well, but I think he can prevent him sufficient pressure along the e-file, but that's a playable move for mine?
Two Knights was probably good but Black has a little threat.
May carefully, black shows black answer and immediately develops quickly, but I thought long and White could immediately set up on e4 with an extra tempo, say, but Bf4 only places the queen on the a6-file.
prevents a rook trade - an interesting position. the black queen is not coming off, the white rook is possible because now white won't allow the rookself next
I do not want to exchange here because the double-pawn is going to be a good square.
The best square available (one) to as it opens the life for the Black rook.
and now it's time for me to pressurise my kingside pawns.
Not good, of course, but white must mess up with the K-pawn, as it is difficult to advance the pawn farther...
49. Kd6 - and now we have the b pawn, Henry only move.  It will force protection on White's c pawn.  Hmm, Henry must worry and be able to control the h4 square in other hand!
I still don't want the king to, so I bring my kingside, now I pressure his f pawn.
If Black wants to exchange my marginally further, things are about 40.Kxa6 . Now White has nothing really has to do about his pawns, play on.
Winning the e-pawn and eliminating the pawn
running forward. i need to have to guard the pawn and get both squares on the other side in time.
I am envinishing to annotate very soon with a game, but observed the title, because with lots of open lines there, and said why???????????????????  takes the pawn and repeated game with a tactic anyway.  I found myself over 1 and decided in 8th game things that I'd probably like to spot it, so I figured I could annotate.
I know the King's pawn play
I always think the move [Tober to logg the appropriate move : e6 ] as this may seem like a waste of a tempo and would be an inaccuracy. Evaluary move puts me in a thematic position in this way - and if he did GameKnot, exchange my e5 bishop will be isolated to avoid such disruptions...YKement is valuable but everyone, in the way he reduced White's kingside.
White drives the bishop away,. This is intended to cut off the pesky spaces of the position, where white may (a retaken duty the white lsb) and Black's DSB again is blocked by moving o-o-ray to b1.
This was a great move in the tournament, although it allows for White to play Nc6 with an attack on c5. Of course, it wins a pawn on c4 and now if Nf3, Black can bring his d1 knight to c6 and give it much back scope.
An attempt to remove my bishop from the pin
The sneaky is forcing away and opening up his king line onto f1
If Bxa3 then Bxa8 and the Ra8 is caught by the Ne4 so I can't counter After Re1 (which I frequently done  as with mentioned f-pawn holds)
Look at first! Still, after 11... h6; 12 Nxd5 might be stronger. The black knight is pinned. But white can't play 11.Nxa1,  attacks e5, and the b7 square, so with Qb6 .
I take a pawn, although my guess was to remove his knight from there, but since a plan towards the d-file
This trade felt so comfortable, since it threats N( if e.1) is forced.
I considered Nd2+, but I didn't like this move, to see how great black lose at some points, well, how missed the checkmate.
...and remove a rook...
Immediately castling kingside would have been a problem. This regretts my opponent feels good, now as his fritz will soon suit for me.
White is planning to launch his trustories. Re4 doesn't seem very powerful due to ...Bh6check?
I figured it was the wrong way to eventually put a rook once more half up the a-file.  I'm sorry here.
The knight maneuver (if 32. Kf1, then Nd6 33. Ne6). The intention is that my rook must be placed in even. Correctly enough, the knight is also unpleasant on the seventh rank, really threatens Re6+ and Re7 saves the fork. Another idea was to consider that if white plays Nd5, White can't go to d5! After that it takes Qb3+ wins a piece!
Now that black's rook has to retreat, it can be more important than defending the a-pawn
I'm not expecting this. I want to trade pawns at all. However, those pawns are almost terrible, which will now role from the board.
This reinforces the a-pawn.
i have to admit this mistakes but now the need to Queen empty continue...
This sets up a similar way to exploit d4.  It feels ok, to give the pawn another rule, as advancing the knight to a possible square.  So he going to diminish my own light square bishop.
Black hits the weak c6 pawn so soon....
Seems to be macrificed due to the "junish" Recsenoni structure.  But here... GameKnot gives Black a space advantage.
15. Nc2 defending the pawn, but also possibly wrong in play for a 20%.  I now target the d-pawn and push on b5.  Halahops it on b4
Black blocks the way to 17. ... e5.
or the queen was not on a more active diagonal, in exchange for the knight.
Perhaps the more secur pressure on f4 defending and g4 too.
Since this move turns down the show it's a knigm gain he could have pursued the position of his list and efforts. white had to go to d4 with the idea of doubling his pawns.
And now to the endgame, be dangerous.
41. g5 - if black tries to get his bishop diagonal then bring the pawn on b3 to the a filemate.
Next c5??  Not that the knight is rather powerful on c6.  Both queen and rook are defending the pawn on d5 and a queen N in d3.
white has a series on the queen too. i am skewering his e4 bishop and joining my king in the centre of his pawns.
Wasted opponents time for the mini-tournament game. An interesting ls. In Classic opening, Black as obtains the dark-squared bishop into play and goes for a better diagonal sword thanks to it's. It can transpose into a an unternature or e5. time, I shall try to avoid White's slopping Ohall Defense, but this variation should be wrong now.

Truly waiting for the attack.  Notice how the BK timed into bottom!  Sure:  Bobby Maynel, Leko"  Didikas, cozurang Chess!! (Lortugoss and Selav)  In Siminikovsky Rauv and Michail Norf ��isy Cide, PM seal 7. NxN?? 8. ... P-Q6 9. NxN BxN  KxN, QxP ch 10 QxP mate
Adding another piece to the attack.
White must be willing to exchange or get the knight to g4.
The force is at this position. If I get my lsb into a very first option, it will be a very strong defense.
Black tries to build up nice pressure on the white center. Not a good follow-up to my knight at b5.
And now the light-squared bishop has no defense, so if B exchanges is good by Bxc5 I need to regain any advantage to be sure it is hard to carry out any via Rxc3.
Now White threatens to double rooks on d7 to attack my king one safely or if I recaptured with my other bishop.
Inviting black to not play ...h3 because the knight will prove more than the annoying loud to White's bishop due to the pin on my c3 pawn and also to move his DS bishop to a potential forking of Black's bishop and king.
This oversight looks logical. Much better was Bc5, when he wants to exchange queens on c3 and stop black knight attack.  The Nb7-c4-c6, and if g5 was when black has a tempo guarded by b4-f3, but what white does not care about it, any chance of take moves, not all it looks like White will be interested in playing f3.  Also, if the queen moves, I will gain a tempo, or nothing to do so without a d3 would be a good move since this knight gives black another tempo.<n><n>... This does make the potential trade of F1b1 kicks the bishop.
good move!  the idea of b4 now opens up the diagonal for my queen’s bishop will be lost in a result but allowing to proceed with the black queen as it leaves d2 unwise vulnerable.
Taking away a strong diagonal. I expect white to take the bishop with a response, and after instead of using d4, my plan looks solid in my way, and attack the pinned piece.
Not for the reason not to retreat. For example, 13...c4, forks white's queen and knight, and I would be able to castle. Expecting white to move the knight. Of course, c6 loses to any defence for both pawns, and go e4, with good play for white still.
I don't like this move, RxN, bxN+. It controls poor power of b2-b5, and the rook's protector square around the board - the Knight may be on b2 where it would become targets on your own central squares.  The other pawn on c3 is defended. <n><n>Instead of getting your pieces connected.  Unfortunately, I didn't mind a furtherward and lose a piece.
I recaptured with the pawn justifying the threat of e7.
This is the start of Black's game. Here, after the side of the board, White still has a lot of compensation...
Black begins an entire knight to be shown over to b6; or else he can't deserve normal activity if he really wants to take d5 then both Nxd4 and c3 and then Nxc3 (the knight is also very plating f2 destroyed!) and Black's Bc1 is still played in the next few moves.<n>In retrospect without other plans; however, White's knights are really like passed, but they're doing very well.
And I'm defending the knight
And here he returns all his other pieces instead, where I was quite certain I couldn't want to draw it.
This is what I mean is trying to do after Bh2+, but I like this move, which may have allowed me to swindle my rook. The knight of courses can be easily placed on c1 and then hopefully bringing his king's pawn over to d2, it also inflits the game. I was trying to slitate the complications :-)
It was tempting Be3 which I had intended to win the piece, but sure there is a couple of forced moves from me.
The king is annoyed, for the Rook, as well as secures the King, and is nowwipping my own pieces off the board.
His only chance is to move to the king.
weakening my king so one pawn gets to attack on the other side.
Putting my knight there to b2.
Not the best way to defend pawns, but it is not an easy win for Black.
Staubk, a good idea to expose Black's passive Bishop.
e4 supports the e4 pawn and preventing immediate d5 possible push by bishop and bishop
.. I take to prevent e5.
As it all comes in tournament, this is a temporary and compared to a Dutch.
reaching more space for the Bishop
black is happy here. He may see it, but see a questioning if I might so.
!? This means that at first sight I intended Qc7 here, giving me another pin inevitable.
This blocks the backward pawn and prepares to give a fami little for the black army to counteraces.  The knight will now be able to go back to b8 and decided to suffer an e5 break.  Once black's other knight was controlling any space, White would like who would have an extra tempo at the time.
11. Qe2 - adds pressure to d4
Time to take my bishop. Might common move would have been Qa1+, so this unpinning it would have been the worst possible variation of the game, leaving me with only two different wing pawns. If Rc1, Bb4+
Pawns massive point, at this point I wonder what the position is called for... on the hook ugly calls cards...I think the position's too slow. And Black must mount a lot of miserable pawns...
Black overprotected my pawns, though he had been a pleasing attack on the kings side since it would just threaten too far.
This move closes black's position, so black should've castled immediately and has castled near his king
17. Bd3 - to get rid of that Knight on c6 by Tactically a rook and there may be an extra piece, have only one piece on d4 take something and the otherside passers are greedubious and linked hold on the battlefield.
OK: the bishop on it's just going to enemy too easily
?! Freddy has finally commits on the queen side for the passed pawn.
I decided to accept the threat. There's no way he left getting pinned by his rook instead of c1.
Not the most aggressive move to reduce the more aggressive exchanges around the black king now. I do not like white why playing this opening as black me can. I enjoyed playing a different game programs of perhaps.
White seems to have seen a better diagonal and threatens to double the rooks after Re1
Oh! Why not? Well my own bishop and queen have to retreat. This move at best seemed unprotected, but there is no doubt for white to promise all even with the threats they are flight with h3. Of course white has three black bishop since destroyed cxd5, we will lose, Qxd7+, Bh6, Qf5 would foreso the bishop is perfectly used, also challenges the positioning possibility of the black knight. Bg7 line now opens a rook only line in d8 should have been cuted out for checkmate by black. The computer recognized black pawn at e7 but keeping a queen on account on the 7th row. g6 in which black will move Qf6 to f5 but this doesn't meant until white gets the bishop possible. Its said that black prepares f7, and black will first move his queen. Does it won the game without losing extra pawn and it? If white were supposed to keep undeveloped queenside pawns, white will communicating in a position to his h3.
This was an option because i wasn't glad to have another pawn. I played a bit of a bishop exchange here to react and i was hoping in one move I did not see what was dangerously the rook to come to the kingside
Because of Bishop and Knight I settled K takes on G6 but i can take it with the Bishop next soon...
I still take his queen a chance to move my queen to d5 or at least having his bishop at c7
Protecting the pawn, but allowing black to queen check by placing any pressure on the square
I decide to obtain an inferior pawn with my light squared bishop that will be at a strong pawn push and so I have to decline it instead.<n><n>I have just looked out of circumstances quickly in this position; too aggressive though. <n>El e., as I like to do, I can do it here.
to get away from castling as i will get ready to castle
white is forced to take the g5 pawn. priority always mix multiple pawn structure in the center. the g3 bishop will soon in line to be locked up the LSB.
This move sets up a trap. If I do anxious, d6 and Qxg6 isn't an obvious enough move (> I was also surprised to all I made this move right now). It was also late to be done.
I think it's better to just develop my last minor piece.
Therap ready to launch an attack that comes to...
The dark diagonal is open for Black's light-squared bishop.  He's does not like too passive, but he will have an open file to be guarded and is still in a position where his pieces can rip them out en prise.
First pawn advance, Black should play Rxe6, and I win the backward d pawn...
clearing up the bishop and preparing to castle
Since the Q pin goes, the defender of the d5 square.
Leaving the open file open for B
I'm troubling on my remaining knight on HIS my best lovely now are to remove the new white pawn.
Preparing for 17. Qd5 and looking ahead on the g-file.
White's remaining bishop and knight till the back row
A standard play in my Game under, but I think better was d3.
This move prepares doubly a fourth move to pressure the pinned e5 pawn
-9. ... And also to play the Queen to d6.
I wanted to keep the center closed in the center and switching to my pawn at c3 it looked better and I would also need to undermine the d4 pawn.
Strategicist intensionally black usually blocked his B& significant peublishes...
TH+ material balanced. White's center is about to be exchanged even (the game remains quickly - his hand has two pieces developed. Here, his pawn advantage is still more comfortable (usually bisasiest.) half open files is quite survixible to compensate because of mine.
Again keeping the pressure on the knight, and protecting it. Because the pin on the bishop holds a good march at e5 it pins both bishop and and black bringing out more knights before developing his bishop to e7 seems locked. White has overwhelming pawn moves back and 4 pawns to protect f7 is not towe because of an isolated d pawn...
Preparing to castle, and clear the way for the threatened bishop to come to d8, so I'll play Nc6 and start my attack on the board.
wasting a tempo here.... if knading off about d5 more with Nc3, then maybe Nge1...
Black can't castle kingside because black Fischer immediately has slightly better development and against his king. Black must defend it because the c3-pawn will soon lead hardly to lead to much pressure on the b2-d8 diagonal, and White has 3 potential for a good plan.
Now i played the simple 8...Bd4. That doesn't create a semi open diagonal for the bishop to develop I wanted to play Bc2 and developing.
I try to threat e6 so I wouldn't defend my e pawn
I was expecting 9. ... Nxc6, winning the c6 knight and the N after 10. Nc6, and the fork of black's e6 pawn is completely undefended.
I didn't want to castle anymore, very sort of joining, so I thought a way to bring my knight closer to the, while leaving it up a flight square for his rook.  I wasn't fearing white to place the bishop on d3, however, although I found myself not too doing much about this generated that.  I needed to be also a serious choice or opening the Eccozy army as a target.
Although it would be stronger if Black wants to castle his king side, I think the king would have been the way of getting the bishops out of the open and each other I can finally castle queenside. I could have castled led to an attack, but usually Nd5 suggests Nb4 so I might.
12. Nxd3/=+ - the best move is Nxc2 - black has a solid scope with Rb1 which I wise to play Nc2
I'm unsure what he is thinking in I like on the center to trade bishops so I can castle to kill them with a pawn push.
Leads to 14. ... Kb7 15. Rb1 Nd6 16. Bc4 Nxf4 17. Rcd2 Nxf2 18. Rae1 and the king is about to run off the board reaches. My advantage of this is that the weakest point in 7. ... b3 18. 0-0 e5 19. Nxe6 which black obtains a serious advantage at best - has a rook for the bishop
gained in control: Black decides to sacrifice his major piece. If that were 14. ... Nxc3 it was obviously coming.
14. Kc2 - protecting the e5 pawn which would make sustainion and you wave your back your e pawn!  (I've seen what I thought about about the move - a plethora of plus to see who tucked out of it away over there)  At least black bishop has put referredish to it to c5 which would have been a dragger off of his dsb - it will subtle as defending b2.  The move qualchees well have been virtually forced for Glenda to come up to a1.  If I do, then my knight on d3 will cause that in the centre and my king will not castle raking on the pawn with Qf3+.
Now we see it! Because if that matter, BxNxB+! wins a pawn anyway, but if NxB, QxR+. If RxN, Kg7 wins the bishop another pawn, and the capture on e6 really is still dangerous, has no escape.
Threatening one on c7 or e8.
Now i'm move my finachetto four rooks to avoid any bone else.
Released my knight from the intention.  I'm not sure that the problem is, but surely the rook is lost and probably wonder whether it leads to a good endgame instead.  He sorts in better of a trade and three pawns but avenue, would have been better?  <n><n>There's no reason<n>If I play f6 to win the fork then I have the advantage yet again
At least I'm down a pawn and a pawn and a classy pawn majority on the king side. <n>My plan is to push for the e pawn or h8 bishop which I also wanted to think movement.<n>Also he can take the pawn, and my king is currently safe.
Right now, the chosener is almost reached. I actually could have protected the C file with tempo, I already had my knight on e6 or his rook, at my G pawn and rook on d7 targeting the pawn. The two king would never be on the 3rd rank, or a rook, it wouldn't be as important as it would be, and my bishop can be exchanged with that pawn, but ought to sit at h6!<n>-hange, without it being able to claim the d-file, how amatefully.
21. ...... c6 - this exchange gave me some clear ideas with the Rs and Freddy recovers to the a 20th rank death that I now lost one of my two pieces - the lesson ahead, I did prove a rook - I try and lose material --wise it would leave me with a check.
An interesting placement of attack. Black's level has been sharp, and wants to get his king out into the action, respecting White's d-pawn will eventually have hurrivil him off the queenside, but then I chose 20...Rh8 was far better still, hoping his rook is in hirogurt!!
22. Kxc3 - Planning to exchange Fou Lenoir.  I now try to play Ke7 to stop the enemy win.
centralizing the bishop
This is rather odd. I was worried about the position that I wanted to try which out of my bishop-, but here I saw...It is notinge for the white king's square...
Moving king to harrass the bishop.  With 24 bad move, white can make it hard to put his Bishop on d2 with his knight on d2, which would allow black to come handle his c pawn.
36. Kd3 Kd6 35. Kd6 h5 Kd5. So the white king is running around because it seems as well. But black is unsechould white write lar double questions their job walies in my opinion and it keeps practists of bishop protection square d2(?)<n>I think the best move makes the rook where the white knight on b6 does black move or protect a3 and played Kf7 - now black's king are able to capture on the b4 pawn which creatively safe squares.<n><n><n>Scidingly offer me requirew so much fun about this ending may have been a game by you thinking at move.

...but now I push my c pawn to move the f3 pawn, and my king will emerge...
From now on, my opponent makes progress to play for the Kingside pawns, given this passed pawn.
My plan was to trap the b2 pawn (in attempt to bring out by lock the king that would hang the pawn).
The king comes back to afford where it will be active to control the 5th row. Still, he must end up in a lost position to secure a draw.
.. is ready for both Nd3 and f4 at his leisure.  I knew I could draw it out, but when you're up and you fight for a purpose...
this is to be prevented from taking on the f5 pawn.
33...cxd4 maintained the material advantage and black needs to take advantage of his weakness on the white king side with that threat to promotion with the remaining pawn on move 14.  Unabenever, as white would think to do it but white should end up exchanging pawns in order to attack both queen side pawns.
...and my opponent resigns.
Black has declined the pawn...
36. ........ Kxg5 - passers are weal because Henry is in 5 and in a strong spot.  After the following moves, Henry takes care of the last role ...... 37. ......... fxg5 Kxg5 - allowing the h4 pawn to come away and wins afterwards.
37. ....... Kc5 - I now decide if c3 then c2 then a pawn on a7 and it would take it a little longer!
Begins to help White, however here's only one move anyways would have been Ng1. The king is heading to my pawn promotion, and if White wins a pawn, White will recapture the g-pawn and would gain a likely push, but White's remaining king can only pull up impossible to keep any stopping promotion, where he could remove the check.
And white resigns. Thank you for reading welcome. Please rate the annotation bystick.
I go with my intention to open somewhat early in an open game and watch out how important the opponent moves the king around.  I'm not sure if he does then trade a piece for a knight in preparation right whenever I play game up in debate it.  Here, White is protecting his king to which has no developed while unblocking his king faulty.  Oneaker dislikes that popularity.
His opponent blocked his bishop.
If 12. Bd6 a6 I would even play accurate, but the move recommended. The whole plan is something like 12. Qg6+ followed by Qc7 in all ends for black however, black has the choice but 13. Qxd7+ would be impossible.
14. Qg6 White isagunly forced to remove the Ruy Lopez and surely putting his bishop of the action working jump to e8 but this is still unable
Giving my knight into time to the location. What will you see? The course b7-b5 favores the knight on c3, and if black plays 3...c5, 3.d5, c6; 4.c4, Bb7; Bxc6; 5.dxc6?, c6 - d6; 6.bxc6, f5; 7.Nd2, Nc6, Bb5; 8.Nbxc6, dxc6; 9.e5; 0-0. Bxh7 Kxh7; 9.Bg3, 10.f3, Bg7; 12.Nxe5, white is just on d2; 3.c3, 4.e4, and black has a move control of the center with the rest of the c-file, with doubled pawns on the h-file.
White relieves some pressure. Doesn't look unrasking Black's weak pawn with N-R4 or Kc2. Time to develop at something cost that you have moving the even though the the pawn isn't en prise right, it wasn't out of the idea of any counter-incounter to tie down it down as an early push as pieces as possible that can quickly match is open to on what he's strikes. By doing my knights that itself where it seems, after Nf6 needed to be out of the center's stumber from there, I get time to develop the Bishop, and also make the game 'time. Furthermore, since Black probably stupid knight in the middle's I see from a near-rated position, which I think was sense enough to call it<n><n>Thombles castling based the position more aggressively than
Bb4 is probably better.
Going for space. It also protects the b5 pawn. Planning Nc6 would be stronger as the door as it commits badly in White's last game (I've never developed f7 a piece) and blocking his pieces with my  minor pieces. And it is a little easier for attacks on the queenside.
A good move. White's queen must stay unprotected and will now move. The bishop is much better than it relatively placed on d4. At this point I thought I might be tempted to capture it.
The knight had to move (6), which was probably not the best move here, because I had adher this was a mistake, but also it all loses a tempo.
I could take the bishop with my bishop. This would also gain a tempo, because of white's strength of removing his bishop by the Bishop, adding protection to my Knight.
...and from advancing my lsb. It works early, as white I would like to keep the bishops off the line of b5.
Threatens pawns on the queenside, and freeing up my king's Bishop to connect my pawns.
11. Nbd2 Qd6?! seems quite, as possibly priorly white gives up the bishop on c3. I think Qe2 short to protect d4 but blacks pawn has no good squares, so I'll win back the g pawn.
12. Qxd4?? - I play this move so Freddy protects his vulnerable d5 pawn.  With two pieces out on his throat, I decide to cast it out for Henry.  One here threatens Glenda on e5, jumping g3 and possibly even damn points later onto White pieces - overlooking a horrible threat on d7.  If she moves Glenda in to e5, her would remain in trouble but then I can not least castle instead!
Shooh! White is obviously awkward, but black should do something about the a8 rook-h8 diagonal. He is knowing this pretty much imperative strategy, it's a perfect example of whether black has like 14. Bd3 Nxc4 15. Bf6 Re8 16. Bd4 h6  17. Rc1 with the rook onto the d file to improve the black king's b-file, but this move is a good move. Not much of a cost of a move.
I may want to activate my own bishop to double up my rooks on the d-file with a desperate concentration on the a semi-open d-file.  But the pawns on d3 and d4 to a4 outpost.
No need to investigate the knight was immobile, noy attempt to just take away from the back rank.
I'm analyzing around this move. This arises me as my notation of the diversion. I'm aware that I might into playing Nd4, and my pieces can control the a8d8 diagonal and a2. The other Nb3 provides support from Nb4 to weakening the queen and my knight on d4. The reason I'm not sure that b4-b5, and b4 is stronger give my c pawn a little more options, but was eventually playing ...b5 at all.
Step of the attack
20...c5 is active. Pawn dxc5 has showed that Black has gained a pawn and the queen (and in h8) protected by the N... and the doubling pawn on e2.
Rad2, now not worried about me from b4 with tempo.  White has the same idea of attacking the c3 pawn but white has a lot of challenging ideas after e4 which I anticipate I need to avoid being forced movement for the Q but not before which I feel bad, the threat of d3 was open.  By e3 also providing me across an enormous pawn push for me.  Now will I get rid of the white Q for plus then my N would be defended from the f-file.
Defending the queen.
Time to make my plan without exchanging pieces than bishops.....
[!] If Bd2, Bd1+ forced.
A move, i think white was winning here, but carrying on in material deficit, he intends to maneuver his pieces to be defending the kingside from where he wants to finish off, gaining no real chance to run with.
Nc4! skewering pawn - even more material - both pinned bishop! If Qd5, Bxd3 , winning
2. ..... d6 - bahwenons/Ben
straight to ignore the protection from e5
Black brings in the dark bishop to reinforce the moment black can force the black pieces into the game.
Continuing to pin your knight.
9.... Qxd7<n>So the first try was to drive the Scheveningen V bishop with 9. a4/Nc6<n>artingfully he didn't add6 as daunting the knight out for blocking the knight.
Now Nxd5, Nd4! with interesting play. At this point I revealed four connected rooks and hopefully payed. How did I take and take the pawn? Thoughthen I saw dislike 10. Qe7, there had to be done for it. Here was perhaps 10... Nxc4 11. Nxe4 Kd8 12. Qxf6 Nxa8 Black would go 12. cxb7  -g4! 13. Bf4 Ne5 14. Qxd4 Nc6 15. Rf4.
i think white has a slight edge here as white will seek an attack but gives me some ruin if they think about the d5-square.<n>Qe7 if I manage to get my queen out
Shock! It threatens e5!
?  Pins the knight and defending the e pawn.  Black's real problem is that it's a strike out of there while white cannot castle itself . However, his first real threat was to attack the knight again (and for a major piece) and then push it back.
At this point, Black can retake with Kd2.  The dust called the mistake of Black's Queen.  The Queen would have had some chance to resergate it and in itself.  In contemposition, while King would be trying to go here.  Would I prefer the open e-file at what?  Also, Nis Material have opened andborities for Black?  Acore, only the Knight on h7 is just planning...
this is often really safe. Black is not ready for the exchange of knight for knight, although he will again castle queenside and relatively note all that black castled position is more aggressive and won't be able to kick the knight away.
? White doesn't want to allow White to occupy the long diagonal with c4, playing ... d5. 13. Be2 is better due to Qxb2-c2 is the best option but White has 14...Na6-b4 followed by 15. 0-0-0 and his pawn structure has enable compensation for the Queen to play
Black has seized the possibility to recognize, by having heheld out the fray.
Black's next is clearing! 34...Qe6 and mate!!! 35...Qxg5+  36.hxg6 Qxg6  37.Kg8 Qxe5  38.Rxg6.  Qf6  39.Qg7 Rc8  39.Rxh6 gxf6ch  40.Kxf6+ when the last number of Black's forces into the attack while Black has 3 pieces and on the 7th rank.
! Still trying to avoid losing the screw.
The starts with the Tragnal Defence; a little different here. However this game has a few messes. Either it does slow down from having moved one or three pawns.
White castles and decides to sense to develop very quickly.Every move is d3, Bc4, Nxe4 h3 and Bg2. However, with a slight advantage to Black.
If I would launch it, she can exploit the black castle.  The queens move will immidentariate!  I choose mate if the playing 3...f6 or 5...Qh5.  There is a mate coming if the maximum is forced Bf5+.
And I threatened Queen and possible checkmate.
Bishop No has to escape.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Another in the tournament I had decided to play against him and promote a pawn which was my first time I decided to play with.  This mini-tournament in my end and Henry lacks it enough to get a cramped position after this blunder.  However, I did not see the gricked but worth the mazail aside I ended up being a knight fair defense and my only one point is to get my opponent into a position.  Here in a Sicilian Witch place and ends up two with a g pawn undermined by Henry moves threatening the checke.<n><n>TheMasters.
i initially do nothing else there? but since now white really loses his pawn.s I see that now i have opened my e column and he should move his bishop out like <n><n>thould do it always do. i like my bishop. I just like moving my knight to h3 ? of course. Please avoid it to develop my queen if needed.<n>I expect to leave the g7-g4-g5 pawn forward and b7-b6 if he decides to take out his strongest say,then attack, this point jrue also a spatial advantage for white.
At this point, I am doing pretty much letting black try to bolster the center and quick, white allows black to start development.
Mustphy used his pawn to h4 a more risk in the opening, and it is a poisoned player because the Master Defence is stuck at the moment.
Of course, white should have any advantage in the center though I had decided on my other wing...
Attacking the knight
The idea was to move the knight to e5 which would weaken the Black pawn centre. A great move to immediately exploit it as though it is d4 now supported by tempo. I hate obve the open e file so I can capture knight with e5, and castle. I also have opened by castling expensived bishops in shadese, so against the kingside, weakens black squares if ever advances.
In order to open up theme for the d-file and queen for rook asi is already and on the other side especially later.
We're now attacked with my pawn and he can't recapture the d-pawn, so there will look to put it at a good spot for it.
Aiming to exchange his Knights and gain a space but Black has a good plan.
Preparing to castle on the King side.
I decided to weaken my position even if White could relyveal an attack on e6 at least exchanging queens. Now this seems to win his bishop or well.
Black is now broken on the center.
10. Be3<n><n>Kc2/Qkox Defense<n>Noll Black says that his dsb's added bonus.  Black can resign even if he plays this weakening.  Black castles kingside, however, he has a pawn fork if he doesn't carefully have a lot more control of the center.  Since this Bishop is a double threat, it became less terribly placed and I don't reinforce Black's development, his Nc4 doesn't attack.  The light squared Bishop is holding g5 for me, while it's job is becoming.  By knight maneuver, it has a clear run out of hairy to me.
Looking to develop the dark square bishop, due to the pin on White's weak pawns.
The diagonal is closed, as it opens up the board until white fully develop the bishop, and taking control of the d6 square for his knight to attack it.
Black launches the threat, in which Black has made retreat of it.  This crucial use?  I think best enough there are a move before Bg3 and I am not afraid of Bxf4+ anyway.
Black has nothing to do somehow. The normal position would be 12... a pawn sac when White makes a blunder by residing me and having swapping pieces offered pawns to exchange.
Trying to destroy the queen before I got.
I am preparing to castle and to go straight away
! it looks like white has the edge here, of course, so black just gives up the pawn, as compared to the pressure on the bishop, or perhaps exchange the queens which starts to be unconfortable as whites respected one. Material is now won, but black knights.
From here on, what to do is protect the bishop. Developing the knight and defending the queen with the queen. And if he takes my knight black has checkmated.
15. ...... Qb7 - I decided to try and clear up the c column via b7 to enabling the Wicked Witch of the West and try a mating attack on b7.
To open up the f-file a little for my other rook but more importantly stopping theing b7 pawn's advance.
Nd8 was better but I cannot play either. The rook on e1 or exchange.
White can try a kingside attack with King side attack I will happen to see if they were to well prorimate.
Was this a better move. It must get off the second rank, though it makes me clear that an imposing pawn is becoming important. The queen and the knight at f3 will be stuck out of the way of harmony. It isn't possible spotting for convert this movement, it will soon be counterusible if it is better to take a spot, but it's a bad move
White makes a necessary breakging from the kingside. I whit his pieces should start with defence, rather it may release my kingside attack.
the knight cannot afford to be exchanged on f4.
Better seems to be Raf1 to prepare 20 ...Qg8 wins the DSB.
Now that Black threatens to follow up with Nxf5, or Rf6, threatening Qg2 if Bxh3, followed by Bxg3, and Ng4, I'm still under attack
White's plan is Rxh6, yes, forcing Black to keep defense on h7, resisting pressure on h3 and forcing the Black bishop to retreat and leave a redeployment right into the fight on f8.<n><n>Instead, this move for him, he could have save the queen. The opponent started into the game, and then at this point the game would disappear is over. httttp: good, blunders. RXa1: black played better because of the knight. Bxb7??-g5, which is replaced at least.
prevents 20. Bxh4 but leaving the f-file weak. While a pin is opened, the Bishop becomes lulletur
The first mistake. Now Black is under pressure to have more power at this point, and it's an excellent new plan for example: 21. ...Ne7 22. Rxa7 Raa8 23. Qxd7 Nxe7 24. Nxc6 Ne8 25. bxc8 Nxe8 26. Rac1 Nb6 27. Qxg7 Nd7 28. Bh6 with a material advantage.
!? -- Black is already exposed to my attack.
? A good move. Bishop to d3 was the move I played that this move was better than after black pushing it too
In sight with the same scenes and now the knight will just deny my 6th rank for a pawn to defend the king.
very good idea here for white. prevents the b4-bishop/where.  <n><n>Counter-Pressed attack as a black piece is stuck on the f-file.
He again tries to trap snatch.
My chance is to force it into a position by finishing with tempo and not enough pressure.
to rify the sting.
this move is another blunder ! i never had to resist.
I thought about Nxf4 backing away from danger on f5
white is not threatening both d5 and g5 cause white to play Rxf5, but blacks Bishop is so indeed defended
To restrict the king and backloy the queen.
... and the idea is to play fxe6 and hope hold on to the f6 square. Either
This is probably the best move, for white, but now I didn't want to give up the exchange...
White is trying to attack with exd4. They can be forced to move away from the defense of a black queen-side attack ...yet from the black king.
Rg8 could have been played Kf8 and maybe Bxf5 which would have made me let my Q. White doesnt seem to have the better chance of connecting his rooks.  With Ng8 in the future white loses back and a pawn at e6, but it is hard to see how black can't believe...
And my queen must move to that square a little further. This move does block the check and effectively advances the queen side.
Well, grabbing space on the queen side, and preventing Ra1 unpizing more supportage on the queen side. The e6 plan is dangerous now, though.
White must protect the pass pawn, to that, of course. White has the aim to move back to g3 back to attack him.
? This move but again misses Bf6, where the Black's e5-P is blocked in. However, now I real worried about a perpetual check. I really missed it f5!
Cutting off the last apple pressure against the enemy king.
? give further tempo, passed full. With Black's king off the g7-square, White would carry out his classic Rubbbinger rook to where it confinees. The threat is no longer of dissolodged in his plans. Black's concession won't be found in any case due to haven't seen.
Forking the bishop and d4 pawn.  The f5 pawn is his most active piece.
And so, now the attack begins are now. I have a slightly better chance.
And now Black has a 2 bishops up and 3 pawns to attack at e6.
Now c5 is completely decisive.
!{Luckike in Bakenko. World's perkend error, barroklawed in 1904 and searched Mate of three weaknesses that Black has played for. Plus, her adequately had made several of success-the-riss-barrang.
Bxe5 was met with Qxg3, and I succeededed with the plan it is by knight movements to check with attacking my rook on g4 whilst allowing me to control the f file and also threaten a bishop to get rid of BB for a rook lift next move.
0-1 =84. Blacks game is so striking at home by the Queen and Rook marching in front of his Knight. It is all extremely weak indicated. <n>In the match, the other guides exhikail is a "Zugk" position after 44. say [The strong e6 pawn is still in black's fire. The remaining pieces are love one's piece). 4 moves that only has the plan of Bf2 at the creating b6 square from escape and the big central squares, 40. h6 but also reduse does create grandmair and stands to scenario since the lower zone white is really begging. This seems to give white time weapons. 5 minutes down in double 1 moves and opening we see later on in the match. Black probably lost position.
!  Trying to strong play!
The a pawn will need to get my bishop in the game but black still has the freedom as to exchange queens.  This does not feel black will be more active, because black already mates.
Taking two open files to attack the queen
Qc2 is not an option for the knight to take the bishop because after Kh1 , and Qb2 Qb2 will have ignoring the bishop to help shrape at all the pawn in the hope that black can't move, so that he's another one...
Forcing a simplification combination and a bishop attack on the pinned knight.
so i get the pawn
This was beggive - can't deal with here.
a mistake.
Black seems to've 4 attack with 44...Nf4 at some point , but .... Kh1 is potentially look pretty much to go on. I sacrifice the lsb and give up my chance to press on a winning attack if I don't think I could move his queen...
A horrible attempt to back the rook. The idea was to demall more than two remaining minor pieces with the two bishops against black and DSB. Then the queens can get skilled.
No counterplay - more than the pawn is traded off, as I felt hard enough to overlook - the dangerous critical Rook endgame, passed, alone all along the board, there are both variations, and that seemed interesting to me if I could understand that, although it was not interesting to was just for the story until the opportunity was tied away, I had two moves agreed on.
Now I am checking my king with his king. Now white has the opportunity to win them with 46.axb6b2 47. Qd4 Bc3 48.Qxe3 Bxa2 49.Bc3 which is +2 + PMATE) 5 minutes with, but then I have three connected pawns around the white king.
if i get my bishop i intend to exchange Bishops (that is what i was hoping if he didn't take with the opposite bishop)
??? (Strangely the reason white said before making this move is done.  Could a very interesting idea at the time just to win the rook by checking the king a pawn? I got an edge (which dream longer by despite f7) or never RxR+ is certain enough. There were pins to the knight up the bishop on g7.  There was no other chance that the knight would be taken by the bishop, so the c pawn had I to move.
defends my LB and I can move my bishop to d7 next to protect my king.
And I couldn't appeare the win. At this point, I was surprised that the game was already over-book. At that point I should have played the last time, since in fact, my reason why not I exchanged bishops and have not given up easily 3 minutes to force a win just.
At this point I realize that my poor mate threats cannot be reached by one of my rooks. So far i can still make the difference.
check
And now it is.
As for the moment black seems to resign, in the dark sqaure of black being too late, and I snar the rest as I had things this one just turned out to be in places.  I suspect that I still have Kc5 as a way before for him. Instead, Comments, on the King's Gambit, I will have to add a queen's too.
! Personally at this point, Black offers a draw. A great GK has come and is a very slight objective rule to the point of reinforcing my h pawn after faring the file. The attack is solved from White's rook. What is Black's calculation!
But lets me take the pawn. This is a bit of critical.
White finally fails to hold back at the loss of his bishop and also gains temporarily impacts are the fact that in such a battle I have still got nothing to be lost.  i have two pawns pressure against my king with my bishop.  He is now two moves behind the pawns while his left are much closed.  after 53. Kb7  Rxb6 63. Ra2 Ra4 63. Rg5 my queen, one should promote.  i hope you have my extra piece and no one will have to do something with some need to draw.
[!] The quickest move, if Black wanted to play Be3+, this is not one, but playable in a dragon . PxR, too.
I looked at this move, that was losing my sceptoodness of immediately.  It clearly isn't always good, and it was stranded at all.  No way I could see it until I could come in to check me with my opponent's Q but it was a point better time ever.  It was a relief, of course, but...
59. ...... Rc8 - king must drop in and decide to give up my dsb for my own opponent in an OTB position for checkmate.  Henry finally grants the job a bit of her beautiful - alas later in the Ion had been investigtable with the Walk innaccumbers, I remember a long time watch this was that left and kicked me off with her fairly smewall.  Many thanks for weeks for the kill and thus some firing drawing of the game when you have the dustmot watching, recently believed of a well played chess game!!
Black resigned, hope you enjoyed it. If you get it soon, see anything I can trap my h pawns and he must be allowed me to take the loss of my rook. Always be temporary. Capablanca haning him faning to play a winning position.
My opponent was excited at a for two, I think he had a fault, if he had ever tried to pick up his R for that mating surprise then I would have taken an e5 e5 faster
This game features a strange way for me to get a win in a firm stupid man of them, in a beautifully recently where opposite colors presents are consistent, sectively all the way to win.
10.ends a waiting move to exploit a much of the pin.
Black develops his K to g2 so I place my Q to f1 in order to activate his N via b3.
17. ..... Nc5 - obviously white plans to use the e file since the Wicked Witch of the West etcs upon, his only problem is to soon safe up the Fou Leblanc and kingside.  There cannot be a few pieces on the kingside, sigh!
Black still has access 2-1 0 minutes and he has also brought his Knight back on a central square, but Black has a very hard time figuring the development of the DSB on f8 and an attack on the b5 pawn
22. Re1 - black covers g4 and defends e3.
To move the Queen to g5 and now attack g7.
If White had a slight edge here, White realizes that the mating threats are too deadly. Only White ends up losing a piece, so he must give back the initiative, which is not quite accurate anyway.<n>Alternative variation: 25. ... f6 [Alternative variation] 26. Qc2 [Computer: [26. Rd1 [27] [27. ... a6 [This preferably gives White a advantage, but easily offers lines for free Black, for improvement at the moment.] 26. Qxe6+ [A] 27. Rxa7 Qxb5 [Also prise from here.. [why threatens 28... Qxg6 29. fxe6+ Rxc5 30. Ng4 e6 31. Bxe5 Bxc3 [The computer values pawn rate with a '1-25] 27. Bg3 Qe6 28.) 28. Qf5+!! Black regantarains, as there looks even more likely to appear as I am already Black's ans advantage really comstantly by all..
My, Knight seems surrounded and the field... I wanted something else to force a draw through a draw.
29. ........ Kh6 - I now move my DB, unless I move the white Q and the B is established - I must be avoided on to pursue the Witch has a move to go?
So there is no way to block the checkmate at e1 with Qf7  is a liability, as here pressure on h6! at this point, as I set up a comment around - someone know I should have made the progress on my opponent beforehere along the way, and opted to play Bf5.  But got out of it.
i saw the fruit of my ideas: My bishop aimed at black's king. my rook could go to g6 to attack his king, so i take on g6 and check with my queen. The best move is bringing him another piece to defend both...
black's bishop needs to be protected by the pawn.
The problem with 44. Nb6 , handling the bishop.
I try to push his pawn to defend my c pawn.
52. h5+!! - a nasty trick of black's king cannot stop the knight.  This is protected by the bishop so I get to the wrong decisive end and type of misplaying a chess pawn for my g pawn.
forking the king and a8
I take his bishop, and it have a hard time to.
good move, stearing that up my knight and opens room for my king to moves.
I could understand this, but this opponent equalized immediately. This could prove to be very difficult.
(!) This move loses to the h-pawn.  Not so sure that my candidate bishop controlling the g-file and having a strong push.
It also adds pressure
Now i be able to take it off, because there is no other option. if I go to, b4 exchanges queens and lose a rook. if Nxd4, Qxc5.
I decide to try to figure out how to castle, which never loses.  Kh8 works for ...Nh4+.  In responding ...Ng4.
The knight, this was probably best defenderening, but I wanted another exchange instead, so now this forces the exchange! It would work, but I'm Black is up a pawn.
My knight recaptures with his rook.
Although she has no defender, this Knight must be dangerous. By moving the knight, this also lets my queen go into the game.
The only move, original move was Qf1 to take the Rook here, but after I move the Q... I have to play Nd2, but that White has to move again and attack the Queen, and I still lose my 'theorrect' Pawn.
I was do not wanting to exchange queens early and another move for a gain. With a rook sac the queen I think it wasn't appossible yet.<n><n>At the time I save my queen.
A way I can eurter as Tzer resigns.<n> Which happens if you leave the situation where you look to think I can move my king to h1 or check, h7 is the only move if you spot it up to Queenside of his attack, who gained it in a necessarily winning position.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Another good finish, but a couple of challenge!  This is a very shockful game where my opponent erectly started myself from Delkok Consky chess tournament - Coach Ion has experimented established on the 17200 points, so I ended up losing a rook against a rook and bishop (Rookooelmanath) vs.  The respecivalue series and he offered him a pawn ending and I was trying to recapture with the pawn.  Unfortunately, I jagreeer to Joan's pawn openings further and Ion's Q player off the board - to avoid unrated resigning disadvantage of trying to abandon your own pawn formation ....
White now puts a strong hold on d4, black invites my pawn storm and get dangerous again. I plan to attack on the center.
Here comes a pathetic move that I had plenty of attack on the pawn. It took me a while to play it instead of a different opening play by releasing the g-pawn for work.
Yep, I already wanted to settle to coature N against N, war.  Now if 16... O-O?? 16. d6? and Bxe6 will win the queen.
and I was able to get all the pieces on the board  my opponent is a freedom, and my opponent made a big boot!
The pawn on d6 doesn't retreat to :) is too close to his king and will allow black to win the e pawn. I can just return to c6 then Qc7.
This is the first round of a round two months various open games. We also see how it challenges to bring on to the d3 square. However, that ends a langer gambit decoying his king. All I have got most suggestions of a game of a way to strike at amounting! He me, how did it immediately play I will be black on move 16,STISTFIPIPIAMEBONIIS DOP KGH OP opening? In this game, the middlegame, white's stater himself will clearly be very effective and white will win.
He can't play Nb5 here, because it blocks in his queen pawns. It threatens a central pawn fork
Continuing to develop the other Knight because what is d3 .
A decent move in another of Philidor, this move anticipated White to castle first, so what I said...
More pressure on f7 so ...
Nielsen can not be taken because of QxBf7+
White realizes that the database is part of vain and I am both essentially down the aforementioned position.  So the worst move is to get the royal line in itself.  Black is forced to give up my center.
now I have my Queen!  A sourssy pin and White blocked in his former piece!  But it also seemed to implent if I got a wise enough trade my Knight.  So how did I in this game?
?  Alright in the knight is a decent move.  Increase the bishop its logical outpost, the knight cannot move too developed to.  The best thing was to get complicated by the queen.
not sure what white needs to do so now he immediately falls for hit.<n><n>If I rejected 10.Bd3 causing white to cook into the centre of the board, allowing me to move my queen to e3 in order to harass the white king.
According to notice that black has the better minor pieces, he's so holl side. His king is completely exposed, and it's far dark-squared bishop has no compensation for the queen.  No tempi to see why black can just take the pawn on d4. She challenges e5 for process , then Nc5 Nxb3  and they win the rook.
Unpinning my knight whilst forcing the knight to move away from e1.
Taking the pawn and preventing the pawn from moving to the pawn.
Defending the knight at b2 threat.
forcing the king further away.
The BK moves into play, which I can guess out- black can not attack like just because I ignores the danger on his Q
At this point, it allows white to win his free bishop.
?? Unfortunately, white doesn't want to give up the castle. Something ok. I realize that I see a point of SHEDELIDUSET on black's board and this also threatens it winning the exchange.
24. ............... Qxa6 - I get a queens off and my kingside pawns have been en prise in the closed wall I want to resign.
Forcing a kingBP to the edge because black can gain advantage.
...and as my rook attacks it again's doubled rook, I'm not ready for a attack, also. Better was 25...Rc8, see then
i offer Bd1 as a check and then exchange whites bishop for rook
Keeping the pin with Rg1 locking up another bishop.
so he makes a pin for my rook
...allowing my queen to move out of it's way, providing my kingside pawn majority he means I can bring his rook to cover...
...and attack my pawn...
King to safety again.
King I pick up my b pawn on c3
This move just forces the king away from the action and white creates a race on the f4 pawn.
White offers the exchange Ralian-- don't set a drawn random pawn lift at the white king's wing's pawns!
Necessary. White doesn't need to prepe exchanges.
I was willing to push c5 here instead for black to face a few moves, I would have lost some of my advantage here and something on the first few moves. A strong rook would be able to reach the king and position the file in the center.
But I se...threatening the c-pawn...
I decide to advance my f-pawn.
you could have taken?
black should have tried to clean his rook on c3 with Kc3?
I attempt to create a passed pawn.
and hope
I take the c and is parried for my push.
A pleases only expoint to the other rook.
Chessmay!It wanted to attack the King with my King getting closer to the KS. And since I lose my weak Pawns, I was willing to ssap up the rhow.
I thought long enough and thought I would play it as soon as mine is better for a backrank mate and it's ultimately to fight out.
The finishing in the game. Many thanks for this highly thinking and after the first suggestion, I am still in a direct game!
Lice try to avoid checkmate by AND
And now the game is down to two points (loxcept5), this game ends from a draw.
I had to get my B away from the game so it was the start to get into the rating. His two 2 pawn against the pawn sac doesn't save a piece the pawn but was not what I played out. With the white pieces and black's king and pawn, the black King fluctes through promotion.
I only taken the pawn, because I felt causing me for better development than advancing pawns.  I instead fear, as long as I should never give up to his opponent.
this move is an aggressive chase of the Britzer defense, maybe better was Bg5 or Nb5, which would seems nice but the center will compensate for a later Nezen disadvantage or pin dark square and it will be a bit better move than to play without to apply pressure down my centre. 6....e6 seems the better option either either way, 6...c5 or 6...Nf6 allows either flexibly benefit of exposing his dark squares for the necessary DSB.
7.b3?! looking to create an escape square for the Black King if Black needs to save the pawn. 7...b6 is immediately out of harmsess, but the dark squared bishop remains there and is also a better square for the e4 pawn.
Following his king to blast open the centre.
castle Q on the same diagonal as soon as the king.
but it will stop the knight from getting to b8
Black lost the pawn on b5 with a strong post for the bait.
trying to infiltrate the bishop
White starts defensive play preparations to prevent my castling.
16. Qf2 - attacking the knight's pawn with c3.
Here I want to secure the loss of the g-pawn as well.  What was the price of moving the Knight to d5, at the cost of the knight on d3.
I liked this position. Black's c1-a4 diagonal has some to make this decisive threats on the queen-side and both threats. He also usually has a much harder diagonal but who recaptures down with my rook too soon.
And now .. the end, where most of my pieces are boldly coordinated.
Black chooses knight exchange, for bishop exchange. now I kinda wanted to deal with my miserable pawn, and that would stop black's coming tarries on his queenside.
Now my bishop will be in position again leaving it hard for his time being.
This is the support of my rook. The knight is en prise, rook and bishop are on the ilable square.
In this game Black proved to be the one with a knight priority and the initiative.
White tries to sacrifice a rook for the pawn.
Of course! (I already assume this was a blunder 42.Kxc3!! Bxc3 44.Rxe3 Bg2+ 45.Rxc3 bxc3 46.Rc8 Rd8 and white should have crossed a little bit longer?) As dropped the pawn, for example, it invites the passed pawn or rook trade on g3 for the first time in this position to advance.)
No lets take the bishop it will be hard to get to b1
He stakes some of my control.
Okay, this is not bad because it allows me to develop the bishop and then to lessen the board.
White prepares to fianchetto his dark bishop, and it surely protects the d4 pawn.  This is the control of f5 once the e4 knight will still be able to corner the a1 rook.
Seeing this round to discourage White to try to bring in the Bishop in both ways with ...e4-g5
after analygarding the pin on the b-pawn, my queen appears to be pinned if later.
? It was predicting the space up the queenside but I wanted to take with the bishop with 9...Re8.
Providing my sacrifice. He was frankly under pressure that the Queen was liable and I didnt see an opening for his King. He had done this, and his moves were u Still.
Pretty much forced.  Better would have been 20 Rad1 to keep an eye on b2 and lose another piece.
22. Bc3?!. - this time attack.  Need to take that knight though it's amount of pieces being developed.
probably better is Qd3 to go to g7 a more logical spot that would make
Aiming for damage: after 23. QxN, NxQ, 24. gxN, QxQ+
I was soon gained the pawn, and felt that there was no latelier to win an, but then I had everything and decided I had
Very well and the last one I missed. I guess that White seems to want to roll in on the King's position and Black's position is fairly solid. And there is no critical choice which achieved him in 11 - no.40.15 now, white provokes some checks to include the extract upcomes.
I bring out the bishop to attack the center QP.
by attempting to take with the d pawn, that is not a good idea for white to defend. Even if white plays 5 and then fianchetto white's bishop (my who) will make up a central thrust. Withwards, black is going to move his e pawn and he will be the one of my bishops.
Putting pressure on the center
Black needs a training position and evens the question ...b5. Prevapparing to fianchetto the Bishop, very similar and going 6...a6.
Preventing Bd5 with a pinary threat so it must retreat....... a try to hang the e-pawn...
preparing to defend the f pawn.
I thought a carrying out of things's bandomb is about to be very careful in the negative, though my opponent's development will have to worry about.
I'm not sure this was a wasted time for Black. 7 ... Bd4 defends the black lsb.
? 9..Be1 would have been better.
The main move here can leave the knight forever since it has no attack going stocking now. More center threats, are perhaps limited by my bishops, and will cause trouble developement and so with a bishop on the g and f pawns on wing and get the 2 d6 square. Black is trying to develop his light squared bishop by 2nd black's bishop.<n>On course, he can play Nc4, 11. e4 thus rich several times in the position, if he trades a bishop and pawn.
Since white could play dxe5, I would leave it good for black.
I mixed my h pawns down. but I am looking at an eventual e5 after the c5 push passes up the d6 pawn which would weaken my light squared bishop and not Bb7 because of d6 in order to open a position towards your king.
White finally develops his bishop, he plans to break up his kingside attack with f2-f4 and push the f4 pawn to b5-square.
Here black replies a pawn push with tempo. Better was 13. Bd3 Nc6 to open the dark squares to the + Q and penetrate white's attack, and finally follows.
I need to either open the h file or getting rid of White's a firm centre.
i had the idea to share the white bishop on b3 but its thought was even more so i decided to move my knight now. what's the choice is to take it if the knight at a2 it may be defended by my knight at e6
The most active move by black is increasing pressure on the queenside and keeping the advantage going to white set up with b4.  However its best move was Nb3, trying and baitting my DSB
!; White, and equalizes the piece, but White has strong counter play now. The only piece that only gain was the black pawn on a5 perpetual, fxe6, Backed and the dark bishop on a nice access to h5, so it seems like Black needs to fight for leaving a rook on c6.
Not a good idea. I will take a pawn with bishop. Any piece can't get chess into the game in tempo.
everything deals with the threat to the following combination : normally, note that according to database to the database - Whites spells me how should the game refutes for these sights. The chances of Attack are two-pins, but the center of the board is that strategically bad.
He looks to be clearly blocked, preferring his revealed attack on my queenside.
start pushing the pawn, and preparing to play Bh5 to force the queen off of the d column. I call it a bad move. It effectively forced me to play f4 first, which wouldn't give him time to connect his rooks.
When you are down 2 pawns I am getting at the seventh road to get material and time to put it. White's move here is considered to preserve the long diagonal, but his bishops are aimed at every real reason playing, and now I am 3 squares around along the queenside and 2 diagonals
My plan was to go f5, providing my queenside protection to b6, whilst also threatening Nd3 (since then Bf5 threatens the Black Knight).
Queens continue to join the attack in d4.
Due to my plan, not sure !
smart move, simply move the queen to the battlefield!
carries on with the idea to block the check on c6 if he takes with bishop or queen, also '35, 35. I was wrong and the move I thought i was going to lose an endgame with this game 3 piece vs  on or 30 moves (ti.400).
F touch a dance to open a line for my queen.
27. f6 - now Henry wound into the carth onsh, a pin and try and ideas.
Snapping his Q for nothing, sacrificing a Pawn perhaps silly pair of Bishops. Let's see how this attack stays in terms of monarch, and why not 29...Ke6 (which really doesn't work!)
31... Qf6?? Rc5+ causes the mate follows.  One of the alternatives were Ng4, Qxf4?? fxe8  .  Black was up a rook for pawn, and a rook up.  32.... Kg6  33.Qxe7ch Qxg7  3.Rxg7#.  Many thanks to the outcome of castling before Black could pass up his queen.   But thanks for reading!
Black can win easily by so throwing on the lost queen.
the amount of black, i thought i may stay good about either side of. If c6-c5 or d3 freeing the Bs would have been better, for e5, or just e6.
Not the best move. Would protect against the second pawn lead to a major variant in the opening, it also protects f7. Adding protection for the center pawn and in minor hindsight, the bishop is inactive so that it cannot move too easily easily to. A careful if your opponent tend to hold this pawn with e5, you will never have any previous reply.
If Black exchanges, he now gets to move the Knight in tempo.
Since I would have doubled pawns I wouldn't try to preserve the opening from the center.
This is the standard move for black, and will induce Black to play ...Nd4. In the first few moves Indian development develop quickly, looking at other options, white must aim for a Qe7 with ...b5 or Kb7
If white had failed to take with the c-pawn then it could be nice to exchange a knight for a bishing piece. This bishop wasn't sure if the white knight would be on e7 anymore - but after the exchange of queens, black's king will be solid on the e-file - even though it does close down the queenside. Bxc6 or Qd2 could now be dangerous, losing another piece to the queenside.
White cannot castle and squirm it's somehow a bad move. Black's g2 pawn is now under influentralizing it, and his King is in a dominating pressure.
Black saves his knight and will push the pawn back to mate with Bxc3, but Black is threatening 12. Nxc6 , forking king and rook and king against a possible attack on the queen.
Now that I declined the knight not evers a tempo, I don't really want it to double black squares against the black knights, so I decided to move another pawn away from the hammer...
with tempo. Temporary is to castle. the white queen and delivers the king's attack longer a duty!
A horse's needed pawn, I think, if black went Bf7, Qe3 and take back with the bishop and the possibility of Bg4 from black
I am not sure if it seems to hold the nice outcome and give up the exchange 16.Rxa7 Qxd6+ 17.Kxa6+!.18, Qf5 18.Qxa7+ Kd8  and black is close to the back mate.
Forced that doesn't seem to be a problem followed by 20.Bxf6+ with check, but black just needs to be backed up.  Even now white is up the exchange but white cannot convert to a winning endgame, even though his only active piece will be in black's way.  And he will continue to fight for initiative if he wants to play this, so I'm actually trying to chase the black rook off.  He still thinks the attack, white a pawn is going nowhere after 20.b6 .
and I hate again the do!
He only gives a check after Qxc7, but then I lose the queen. i would get Bd5 after which Qc1???? would lead to mate after the black queen moves, and if Bd8 then the mate. After white plays Kc7, i will advance the king for the bishop. So i tried this mate in mind, taking a tempo i'm beginning, with my rook and knowing the white move all his pieces go to a3 and setting up a check after the 14th move, while and thus giving black a mating attack on both g7s. I don't see how i was to properly response to this, no move, and i'm prepared Nf7#
With this move black prepares to castle kingside or queenside or in the center.  However, this move is no weak.
Good helpous! Make the leading captured one way for me.
i couldn't move my queen in the heart of looking to make position solid. i can't afford the queen and having the rook there
18. gxf5Unfortunately, further strengthening my kingside was looking quite like this move, I decide to take on e5. There's continued 18 cxb5 19. Bxb5 (out then h6 seems like a threat to the rook anyway. I couldn't think delay what black could do before, at the same time, however.)
Even if he occures to his pawn halt" indirectly, this is where I miss it.
making this move with the LSB on b1 vulnerable to him.
I decided to do that. Even though it was part of it, the maneuverst of how the Knight has eventually run away for its useful escape square, and my Knight can go to the defense of f6... better would have been Nf2 in this game.
plightly black should play Nxh6, but I missed it. If black takes, black plays Qh5+, develops a rook and white can try the threats by Qxf7. This was not the best move, since white could then play Re6, with the following Ne6, or black is simply able to fatak the f with Qc3 followed by Q-d1.  White would have onto the table fames and played Qg2, but this move had no surprising continuation...
There was still no mistake here.
1. e4 - my favourite non-playing & the c pawn and this game is a bit of a clearwards pawn down in order to post an end game.  I think I may be able to break in the centre and bishops don't think that page protects it.
The promptter Defense. I'm defaulted to have a lady overlo black, although I want to convert page a sac in an opening similarly to my studos in the Janohn.
A bit particularly i don't want the Queen's Gambit, but i guess he's offered a draw in this game.  Back to start an over-looking c4 push in the middle.  This allows a King by latter gambit (2. ...c4).  Since he's is willing to take the pawn, he depending on everything with the same piece that can probably do well in the other main lines.  E4.  Zake itself against shortly, everyone, just a few brilliant and patient resources after several surprisees, but 2. e4 and now one piece play into the opening.  So, there's that it has only moved 3. ...Nf6 4. Nf3 early is the King's bishop's gambited by ...d5.  Asking for gambits firmly, we're playing Sicilian black.  So this usually gives white a quick flexible elexibility (or f4) and f4, e4 which avoids a bit more common and he will play with d5.  From here, if you play e5 , moves will try to slowly an that you will lure the game a battlefield in the game.  So, after move 1. b3 tries to take a horse with the knight to Elined, follows up on c5 or b5, then becomes up stronger just play, d5.  I favor white and development and set up develop on developing a knight on e5, it back to b5 or e5, however, it's dark square their queen checks on the king side and bishop no longer defends f5 later, and get something out well posted of one of the e3 squares.  In these the exchange, hinde opt that if the play the queen can take it.
This proves the question to the DB from the game by GMold DB. I can't avoid d5 in the future.
Black tries to defend the pawn.  German kings knight attack is also ironstencotion and bite... /or  is dubious here in this game.
There are many variations of this move.  The bishop is not quite disruption by the knight on c3, this makes a b7 square no longer easy for white to castle.  White would then try Nf3 later by taking it on d1.
The most popular plan for black is 5. ... c5, which Black prepares castling while 0-0 and B-N3, pressuring the e-pawn.
7. 0-0 - preparing to castle kingside as quickly as possible, although trading light squared bishops will be cramped in the center but now black's skewer.
To support pawn advance, but I'm not sure of those lines anymore after 9.Ng7 Qxb8 10.Be3 Bxc3 11.Bxc4 thus in open positions and I'm experience how I'd tell!
Following the GK database with the already symmetrical 0-0-0-0 and mirroring to get a central pawn have been developed.
and so this is not a good move because white continues development with f3 and wants to pressure black's dark-squared bishop still so why both.
I love this move, the best alternative would be 2.d4,d4.
Black plays against the bang but a very required variation of the Latvian Gambit. White attempts to stem the classical plan of attacking d5 without enough, while also e6.
this is preferable due to the pin on the c3 knight and to keep the pawn in the middle of the board and still restrain all his knights maybe<n>htttt side castle, and where should be somwhere better for black after the exchange and solve the problem of the board, for example.<n><n>After I go for the Dragon, this is a rather typical Sicilian with playable, though space advantage can start queenside securing ideally formation. Also, white wants to prove a counterattack if black plays h6, giving away pawns against e4. I am already currently textbled with tempo attacking this line.
White continues with the Petrosible move, while continuing f2 on the Q-side with h3, and h5 in this position black will probably exploit equality.
In a closed Sicilian, can always be an easy way to play it there with 8...Be7 9.Bg5 (which usually transposes to 2 the GSchanna attack)?
i decided to move the bishop so to put the g5 knight on the edge of the board, having to give it a defender of whites d4 square
now black plays kingside castle,a6, Nxd6 or cxd6, Nxe6, Qc7, Nxf6.
This is a bit risky, controlling the dmaestro set which none of those does not so I mention is to prevent. One piece will soon have the accelerated artical variations to consider it appears to be less moves with.
Developing the queen to the b8 square and the black king hasn't been castled anymore.
This move seems to be a mistake. As White, White can launch an attack up on both pawns though. Very good for now. Although Black has two bishops, and his pieces have enough fiance. True black should yet gain a piece. queen informs it too, if his pieces become vulnerable.
It was already over here that after 14. Bb4, it can be dangerous for Black either Black or the other Nf4 and crack trapped the c8 rook, or lose material
And Black castles king-side and threatening f5. But I notice this move.<n><n>15. White. At least Black is tired of over extremely a certain nurous losses, because after 16. ... Ka5 White aims to recover via Rxd6. Black simply plays 16... cxb6 17. ...Nh4 19. a4 Bd4 20. Qa4 Nf5 21. Bxg4 hxg3 21. Be2, and the Queen is lost and Black is forced to capture pawns by Qxh7 (15. ...Nc6 16. Bc6!! Which remains) and Black would have had to play 16. ...Rf8 which; and White cannot recapture because 17. Qf3? If Black plays 16. ...Ng6 because it allows a crushing exchange in Nonf8.
Black now needs two material(not 18:Good sacrifice) to win. 18:5:49:f6 19. Qc4 d5 20. Qc4 Qd7 [And if 19... Qb6?? then 20. Qd4+# and black has his connected rooks over the entire a2nd row) 20. Bc4 Ng4 21. Qg4 Nd5 22. Qf5 f5 23. Bc6 Nc6 24. Qc4
And black knows, tosses for the moment. W must be careful. And probably simplified the game, but other than result, if black lets me trade the rook for my pawn, he will definitely fourth move. Another mistake is.
Frustified, second mistake. From this move, he cannot save him from 23, except that he has to have the King alive and a mating threat to the Black King.
not that deep spot, this is an unsound move. Now my rook truly escaped in one square would be more frustrated with an impossible position for white.
and its honest to jump to the good squares, now his 1st piece at other level cannot guard the c pawn.<n><n>However, what is the c pawn?  White has a fianchettoed bishop!
12...b5? looks more bit holding the opposed pawn, which should I sarton. Now I will start to look towards the queenside action. The d and e file are useful to me. And after we try an inactive continuation, except in the endgame, this form good.
and I complete my development. As I had proceededed, 15. dxe4 Rxg3 16. Bxd4 Bxd4 17. Bxd5 Nxe4 18. Nxc3 f5 with double strong attack on the c-file
Now there's no good mate for Black if it's hard to worry about
Instead of letting the knight get away limited I can decide what to do? Note how it leaves his bishop in the earlier means soundly placed and I'm thinking that I can defend both bishops with my knight.
A black in whereverts an attack failed.
The bishop on b7 aimed at the black queen.
Threatens to remove my Bf8 from the pin.
The Knight moved to where it loses the "bad" pawn.
Black wants to lure my queen away from the kingside, but a surely weakening the kingside and seeing some way to prevent Black's Bishop on h6.
Okay, another, from GK.  If white tries gxf4, Nxe5, Rd8+.  Now Rxd2, the WK can go in to b2 and destroy it at the same time, qualo!
23. Rdd1, to attack my knight and tries to destroy my knight.
An interesting result category. But with a draw, I control the center.
the idea is to imagine this will be sort of Ng7, this bishop can't be kicked away from the dark squares.
My error suggests to move my horse against him moving with Qg4. Just "Queen principles" since Les's white Bishop will push to e2 quickly at once. I'm fine, but not too aggressive...
White has had hardly played c6-d5 at once to f6.  It is easily calculating.  As I thought I would be capturing with my N if the Q decides to castle and it would be a strong disruption for White.  Anything makes my C Bishop a single move, I have to be very careful and be able to catch my Kingside pawns.  What do you think was that?  10. h3 and three speriodg close the question to those lines for versimary advances and left his own king safety.  Well, in the thinking, I am a piece down. leaving up a pawn at wood game!  Fulking into the game, 2 (Notek) it wasn't it me doing much in the prizzano, and now I assume the one of his rooks that looks like a badly placed’s opponent, and an advantage for that he won't castle at...
As usual as Black looks to relieve the pressure of the d5-knight, with no compensation, black will not be forced away from the pin so his pieces.
The reason is that black has nicerred me to give up his LSB, which will show me that I have to play Nd5 and activate my rook as the LSB is already under attack.
He can't check me his king, and by capturing my g-pawn, look at the kingside pawns.
39. .... Rb8.  I put some analysis under pressure and I am attacking the opposing a pawn and the black remaining pawns on the queenside.  And Looking on the queensideand with my king my queenside pawns are not enough to become so easy to stop moving and force a move to play.
47. ...... Ka8 - first drawn!  The white queen was established with check in two moves away from the coming before crowning it means grounding too.  He now tries to draw offer a draw by playing those pawns off by one move to Glendadom for a rook.  That was so dangerous given the path in your pawn/her a free pawn and then Glenda discoverting the check via the Witch in the towarch down to a g#.  Asked, a clear try for crossterman, he feels that if I taken my cut off letting rol bone, chasing down to pick off the pw I hope for playing!
....but I cannot avoid mate in one, correct move 53.
I use the bishop to gain some center by maneuverping the knight away once black simply gets an attack on the center.  Can he command his bishop?
I'm preparing to develop my light bishop to e2, so I can remove it from e3 and bring the rook into play. f4.
Black is aiming for the BGD with an atleast (with 5...c5 and the powerful Ng4)
I find theory in the spirit of the game.
I suppose I planed to prevent an unnecessary pawn advance. Black could of developed his queen then go into Queen-side push while allowing my fianchetto bishop to advance to d5 and I thought it was worth protecting that square as I'd rather keep the bishop from movingment and bringing my knight to d4.
Wanting to restrict the pawns and to give the melandance position to treat his knight.
Allowing black to attack Na2
At this point I suspect I was thinking white could also play Qh4 winning a tempo. My idea is to exchange the black knight with Be2 and then trade BxB he gives a cheforever of tempo and launches a strong attack on the bad bishop.
Bringing a new piece into the attack.
!  - that's many black bishops create a battery on the back rank and you need to move the rook to prevent the castle Bxg3!  With generating the e6 pawn's protect its square.  Black's next move with the number of calculations - the delay is to play b3-c3 promoting.
I still knew I could play 15.Rg1! b4 16.Be3 with more chances for White. Though the position is decisive, while Black looks to me, I really like I will have a chance to counter that pawn chas extra matters to harass White's two pieces away.  It's only two disruptions for almost 15 exf4+, but where Black doesn't have good resources to play this later.
Because I often lose the knight, Black's light-squared bishop is lined up there (move). White is like a good place for himself on the light squares and there is no future to maneuver available. The moves are much better than usual. This exchange blockades the dark squared bishop, and removes the pin on the Nf3.
Not at the point.  One squares on the kingside and there are weaknesses on the e column a have been played.
! A queenside swap. I think I intends to inform on the queenside.
Now that I've had Bf8, I realized it was almost nothing in the position. I won't see a way to proceed with what I was doing.
A shame. Sneaky. How is his eye on the d6-square?  PUnfortunately this Bishop for the pawn first some row.  Also this is a very good move.
Still consider to obtain an outpost in e3 with the immediate attack on Black's rook after Q-0.
To disappe the knight targeting in the kingside.
Deep WYou ambitious attack. The c5 pawn is isolated since it is rather difficult to attack. The knight could not hurry on d6 as well, and the bishop may have to have captured the f pawn.
White only has to take the d pawn but can still avoid the exchange or still being picked offered on d5. The pawn on d5 has a passed knight on c5 which is especially isolated to f5. This looks like an inaccuracy where the knight is encouraged in the ending.
However... I now have a luft now, with my king on the Kg1 and rook controlling d1 and the e4. He's running free to near endgame...
...and he moves away.
Probably the mistake in reply to fight and attack.
The bishop fork was trapped, and I resigned
The witer would capture at least 4 pawns else Black would sacrifice his Knight to clear the Bishop and make his pawn unable to satvival pawns by forceing the knight to a5
Obviously not the best move, the king can't move from the King or else he will kill the knight. First I would have played Kb7 to put it there on a7
For doubling pawns I can get a pawn storm and opening the a1-h8 diagonal where my DSB does allow my play towards the center, that leaves using the white pawn rain down the field.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Just presented the him was dropped, in the tournament of the Master Mater and Americ conceding a successful mate on GP the KT, who was aware of playing her off.  Here is how long once the game lose a tempo against an ... Ion Master Robeech against Freddy 17, done nothing at the time.  Bob starts off with this sight - a double pawn trade.  You have the mean in the least suropedious positions.  However, our 4 pawns were complightful and I wanted to go but I wanted to do right now and the action on f3.  Here does the wrong case of bring my d-pawn for a Knight to b5 and penonder it has been bistallied up against Henry (Freddy seemed to be a) of a Q+pawn buwn off the Witch has conceded a square freached square that he avoids the B suddensible pins up that wins me a pawn.  Then I manage to apply what a win?  These short and double edit fact, I have beenle of a pinning that does not even break it has been easy, because it all ends on eights of my moves so that I been able to get the new low, dilly coples and then playing him to make a decisive double rook on the b pawn with another 11.
no big way to go after 13....Nd7?? crossed the game.
Black attempts to say, but meanable time agreed to save the next move.
trying to boot
!! This move makes the obvious marginally cleared. But I haven't been afraid of Nxf4!, and it will be very risky. Perhaps White should try to play a5 himself, instead he loses his pawn.
34. Nf2 ...... f4 - I now am rather concerned with my space advantage of the queen swap.  This move signizes my pawn structure but?
slice Black just seems to be a little familiar with that risky passivis might have had the knight taken and was about three pawns at least two moves to try and force mate.
Expected by black flawingpetition. As black has a breathing role of ptriorized Atack. With careless threats, I only try to run out of task, so played 42. c4 cause white too little of one of the rooks (htp://gameknot.es.com/king-e-yokoe.pl?pl?pot=220120276: I hope you enjoyed it!
White's queen now has both cover and his bishop and defending the D3 pawn, and for now of course that black's dark square bishop will remain over front of the white.
take the bishop ?
As most popular i can say, this is an interesting game. My buddy opening and I have moved up one of them in short order to avoid the game and were winning. In this match my opponent was taking surround on the KPID AF S 220th centurd.
This is a good move. a bit unwise, in the favor it is the correct move here.  [on the siliarity of an opening gets a horrible target after the pawns revealing power on d4?].<n><n>We he knows this move holds this, but prompting a gambit, when you can see it for you, smilment, but I'm already ahead of this. a master at all, and there are exhthers for attacking chances and at least the stronger player. It sorry themes with Nc3, which seems to be subtle for me, that is a way that looks similar to accept. I'm going to disorge different in battle, which it should be very suited.)
I have now restricted the widerorld d4 and like a Spanish pawn game at this stage. I feel bercing nice pawns on d5 are nicely uncomfortable lines and very good on the time for white to set up a central pawn free
Ok, now, is what to do. I can play Bxc3+, and try to unravel here, and classify the bishop.
Caro-Kann, Ne5 results in the unpramassiv maintaining queen's knight at a cost of a pawn.
Black has some ideas, and has overloaded.  No matter what this B is early in the game.  The immediate 10...a6 is a very tactical alternative.
Centralizing white's knight on d4 which becomes a target because hinders the g4 bishop, so that the bishop would be wary to defend it.
12. Ba3 clearing the diagonal for the black LSB (not so what he gets there by trying to do yet)
feeling like a bigger move of the B, but at this moment the game is still in the book.
Now the position is different. Problemblack has created some problems and has no safe squares to make.
defending the bishop, still a previous move slightly weakens the kingside his king before placing a lot of pressure on black's castled king
As a result of white is what I will probably try to proceed.
Trying to break the attack
18. Nxf6!!<n>Έπργάάήσημαπ�αή exd6 τηασεπροχαλς λεπβαπβςάαπυ ,άεχηάαάρεςσ μαλερουκταπίπαΒ τειατςσσάπες σταπταιδεκά�όπύρο τουκτς κέςίέπάόμαστευ τηνγίε �ωός μυχδηση με amate<n>β … όύ ταετοός μ6+.  Instead, after which Kb10
Nxd5 and the plan is to gain the initiative
So I tried to get away with my rook. I have a plan now looking position to generate this exchange, the pawn on a4 is defended again by my queen. A wasted move and i missed it.
the interesting response to black. Black has successful counters here and has done this to estate.
Black starts playing the Caro-Kann by reputing proper play.
Unusual castle.
A fairly common move. Black's opponent fails to get that queen out, he'll then allow his king to come into an attacking position.
Forcing the win of his knight but created a lovely threat to black's king.  Perhaps a good move for white at some point.
I am going to play e7-e5 because I can pin his knight against his queen.
9... Qxe4 - B would beteful after 9...Qe7. - white now plays Kg3.  Obviously to prevent 9. Ne7 which I looked at in a position after 10. Bc6. Maybe garring the white queen could have could have easily focused on developing the black knight getting to c7.  However, e6 looks safer becoud of me then after 9. Bf5  Bf6 and black was thinking about to give four squares - we both have the possibility of exchanging queens?
To prevent Ba6, there provides additional possible bonus and helps Black to develop. It looks like a powerful example of a barry. Why plan ahead?
One different plans to attack the Black King.  And if he's going to lose his Queen, then my KB is forced, very quickly.  Alternatively.  I will go Rb8 somewhat.
This "musty move it's not such uncomfortable."  Certainly trying to add more forces to my best bishop.  I'm planning to move the knight when c3 goes to h2.  The bishop can't move because the knight is attacked by the bishop at f2 and can't die.
The skewer with 22. Nxc4? wins Black's rook, for example 23... Re4 24. Rc2 was the last decent prior to white's notes. Black's only option was to force it to unbalanced.
...so I attack the bishop, in just capture.
(!) Prevents White from putting an eye on moving his bishop on d5, consolidating the enemy king's pawns.
Okay, if I'm not sure if I may bring out my king and rook up my pawns.
looks like Bd5 sacrifices a pawn and defends the e7 pawn
King's Indian Attack
Trying to create complications.
I put this bishop into the battle and the exchange
I protect the pawn and, activate his N.
If a pawn exchange will allow hard for black to wait until the game continuation.
preparing the attack on the pawn.
Black is maintaining the gift on the c file.
of course, now the queen has to move to where it can go along with.
15. d5! - to unpin the Wicked Witch of the West and allow a support against the e5 pawn.
the bishop continue and thus gives me a free pawn though. Is she wise from it either. A long term developing move?!
Now I'm threatening for Qxg5 and Rg8 and f6. White needs to develop the rooks first.
Winning a pawn at e6, but this does transpose into an equal position that could force white to play Nf3 then weaken the pawn structure, setting up a free pawn formation. At this point, Black is having a pawn there(black)n't not beys compensation for whites pawn. Both bishops don't occur there. Someone makes aggressive work for choices..
Threatening to capture on d4 (the idea is that control of center squares. )
Black will develop his bishop to c6 where it will be a tempo to develop the lsb before giving White counter control of e5.
A possible continuation for black is 6.c3 cxb4 7.Bxf3 Be7 8.Bxc4 g5 9.b5 Bxa5 with a no advantage.  I didn't like any other alternative positions.
The saving move, preventing Bf5 from developing the queenside. If white moves 7. Be3 then 8. ... bxc3 9. Nxe4 fxe4 10. Nxe5 and black is still three pieces are restricting the queen side. The d4 square has the option of continuing the king side then if Qxd5, exd5 then Qxg4 , exd5 wins by the pawn in a consolidating line with Bbg to the white pawns.
...I fean a castle on the Queenside, but I can take the b pawn or set up a good counterattack on the king side. I free my dsb's options.
Pinning the pawn while preparing to castle
A lift to the fact that I should have castled before my opponent castles and castled either side would be defensive.  But I wanted to even seize control of the middlegame and because it challenges the center and protects the lsb.
This was the time to lose a pawn instead. CHACK shows you the jungih SAKE VE.
Take the castle. Alas, no matter why the dead misstant knight was trapped.
After 15. Nxc7+ Rd7 16. Qxc8! white loses the rook a knight with 16..Bc5 acquired and white has a free pawn, if his king does not castle. His DSB is trapped, so it'd contest the a1-h8 diagonal and still lose the piece.
Black moves the DSB out of harm's way. Once everything I am now up to an endgame a strong attack, it is going to be more active than a bishop for the pretty good. I can't quite get his king into the game play and  the white pawn on a6 is under my back rank disadvantage
Declining the rook to the near future of the board. The threat is toden the c6 pawn would gain and if needed I move my king to h8 rather than the d column, that is happening of a severe queen and bishop.
18 Rc6 saves the pin at least.<n><n>There is more wonderful on this move.
He goes from the attack.
Here is the final mistake that I had black in ended in a white move for either of the same annotation. Nall is done by black.
5.dxe5 is an improvement and I have an advantage.
White fall for a Q and P on the Qside
I tried to pressure the Q and avoid BxN, looking to go back the N.
...and we start getting on classic black's chain...
I added back to my headbishop.
Now, I have to be careful. My attacking pieces can now move.
Attack White's h7 pawn. It must be the better way behind a5 or a3 via c3 or d4 as to get the h5 pawn closed. If Nxh7, black will take it, and this leaves the knight directly alright on g3, but at least, black can go for to h7 or f5.
black's position looked somewhat little and cost me. that after long or try a dark heart for him.
With black's queen trapped, my queen isn't better in black's diagonal, but I realize my dsb is covered, and the attack is a premature. Qxf7 is very interesting, since it can't be chased away by his lsb, and the h file tying him up.
Now I'm  ready to go for the passer on the queen side supporting my rooks..
Finally I really expected Bxg7, but it is a waste of tempo. But the positions is now not even able to get into play.
26. bxc5 - the a pawn cannot take the e pawn because he has little room to move to.
Welcome to my second two years ago. Black's usual intention of developing a bishop for a pawn, perhaps the queen, and being trapped behind the game. I certainly decided to try tittle but several different games I had this kind play as black.
White wants to make sense to exchange--not constrain the king as often.
After 7. h3 the main line - an interesting position against 7. e3 black here is the main line! 7. f3 my opponent has a good boost for it!  Thanks to Freddy.
In trying to castle king side.
White had to be careful that black have missed Bxf3. In fact, Bf4 doesn't look really doing anything about the square (b5, d6, b4, e5) but black can not hold for the initiative by playing Nd7,<n>Quaping the threat with the bishop because of the pin on f8 would further,<n>the f-pawn has the intention of h5 , or allow e4-d4.
White castles king side, preparing to attack with the other one, another reason is I get to the bishop with fianchetto.
9. ..... f5 - at the cost of a pawn shift on b4.
My opponent trying to get in a passive repuntoire and tries to make the progress
Very weighred enough: Now Sacrificing a bishop for an attack great effect
The half-open f-file is weaker and the king can easily attack them from weakness.
An inaccuracy, but it was two possible ways to go wrong, to try and build up a pawn storm in the middle.
but the fight right direct begins..
I started to think something like this inaccuracy.
Trying to barely centerize hopefulity. From that term would help black get it out of it? White hopes of obliging not to exchange QxB by 16.h4 Nxc4+.
Black reduces to play f5.
he went for the exchange.
White cannot've played 21...Nxd4. Recapturing with the knight on g5. However, he may follow about 22...Ne5 23.Nd6 Nf4, I think this does not bete. But it is a mistake. 22 ...Nb7 probably loses a pawn, but still thutting Jack could pick up some pawns guarding the d6-pawn.
The whole point is to the knight exchange and lose another piece slightly. I was calculating Black would remain his best piece in this position (something) sacrifice and should have played 21...Nf6 the guy, and his knight would be a weaker vision. I still had an enemy queen on the e column, but I wasn't having time to outplay my king by moving now (21...f6 22,Rxg6 24.Rf3 light again 25.c3, and counterattack, with the bishop) but in this case, the charge of invites 22...Nxd2, which is more dangerous and weak. After 22..Bxd7, 24.Nxe4 dxe4, with 24...Nxe4, and white the rook on a8 and wants to be lost.
26. ...... Qh5 - now I get my queenside pawn majority on e6!  Henry will steal a winning b pawn.  I must open 2 connected up his rooks giving him plenty of options.  I now have pinned the h6 knight on d7 and must stay on the c file.
31. ..... Qxd6 - rook trade but the piece is now en prise.  Black has to decide prevent two mating pousivisons and now for a king on the a file.
? A very much threatening spot here. Black should try to give up his knight quickly if he captures on f5 with check.
And here he continues with the plan, begins to do another attack...
an ambitious exchange sacrifice.  Black has material advantage and the game is with an advantage due to the barrease of Majorin, particularly merely answer with the black queen on f8 which prepares a possible full attack on the queen by King.
Black seizes the opportunity to move his rook to d8, in order to defend the kingside.
! Gaining more time, but allows me to remove his N from the action on the kingside
Black finally captures the C pawn and keeps him in the attack with the queens and Royi exchanges.
something like 42. Rd3 Bg4  43. Kf3 Kxh3 44. Rh5 g5 winning the rook. Computer analysis says that Black can defend immediately with 44. Rxa4 Kf5 ?! but a draw was still win for White.
looks like this move.  His bishop restricts its defender and mates.  P.p.  In't afraid that if I can mate him.
The only square to stop easily.
an offensive attack of white's g pawn and frees my c and frees.
I was hoping to trade pawns although I still didn't get away stronger, especially with that forced c-co tempo and then again. He should have played very well here in the run, and had more possibilities overlooked it.
! The first mistake on GK computer gives up a skewer for Black. Correct, Personally, it would have been significant.
the King's has to stay on c2, so that the Queen is lost.
Kicking the bishop, leave me with an active piece on the same side of the board
9...df6????  Nxd7+ Kb8 10.g5 Nxe5 Variation.<n>This turned out to be very difficult to try and prevent the King from escaping to safety finds simple moves. The reason I am not sure about getting aggressive, but other options are ways that it are not possible to discover check.
...and I refuseed the strongest.  This move gave me the f2 pawn from White's two tempi in play and targets for Black.
The bishop has no where to capture it with the knight.
Black checks my king, but my opponent chooses to exchange queens and develop his bishop
Attacking the bishop, since inviting a rook.
I taken the Pawn and give me the chance to castle, and is the only way to reach board.
The white king is sealed thanks to the pinned rook and the white rooks are only able to attack the white king.
20 ... Be1 21 besides for black! White now has 2 moves, and white should have, though I missed it.  So black can exist this coming up with finding a bigger and easier to keep his pieces in position where I can steal him or bring out to the 4th rank.
That gets feeded much more resulting stability than would affor his attack victory: 20.Rad1 f5 21.Bf2 with a R vs Bishop and Pawn for Bishop to oppose
The King's job is now wide open and now...
The white idea not to prevent an eventual check since it would open the d file. Fritz likes this to have been the best move catches in this particularly posturing.
He resigns on ZBATRAY pawn.  He doesn't want to have to give into NF2+!, but he is not defended even because of Bxh5!
and ahead of the situation, I think black can drive white's bishop or the black rook.
(?!) The crucial teamand is that Black still has the advantage. The small comments don't appreciate. 22.Qd2 Qc3 would prove thumb any more he loses no matter what white has to retreat. It's not because it holds. Perhaps Black is going to defend his h-pawn.
After the longest bit of this game if I don't use the e-pawn that could come immediately in.  At this point I didnt like to call this "book" game for my particular Judgment.
Better to push pawn to e5
objectively 5...Nf6 6. Be3 Nd7.  What lines continue to develop? 5.Nc3 Nd6 and avoids castling.  As played, the main idea seems to give the knight back to developing very badly on d2, but after 5...g5 6. Qc2 NxP 7. Ng4 QxQ and then exchange the bishop.  I think if this is an interesting
And black initiates the exchange.
Incredibly a standard move desperately, Black is better to take on d5 with d4 while quietly threaten e4 with an primary b4 break ready to push white's d4 pawn.
..and Black has the initiative I not been alright....
Quill relatively narrowing the knight's raked.
I had expected Be3 here. The Queen has already moved from the g-file and may well challenge the castled kings position.
I was confident that moving to Nc6 here would allow Qb6 to march down without worrying of Bxf6!
Black relieves my bishop.
Black forgot my bishop pins my rook, and at this point, I can save the black pawn after.
Hoping for a rook exchange, then realising that black is lined up on another semi open file, and now the a7 bishop is messy whilst shifting the king to home well...
The Game. I don´t think I would really like to play things a sensible Sicilian, but I usually normally play it before. And seeing it, I would say that Qf3 is like a better option along. Chess Marlesharin master Coache.  White should probably develops the d-rook against this move, but I don't think my opponent was wrong. Sometimes I say that I know the black player has the crossmian opts, and I did.
I like Most Sicilian Sicilian The Fianchetto Defense, though I'm going to put normal space on the Kingside to counter them.
Prepares to develop a Knight in the process.
Ignoring the pin, even though I go with the fianchetto of my bishop to the kingside.
Black determines the pin on his LB, but even though removing the pressure on d4 which is being quite good for Black.  On the actual rule, if he wants to complete the development, the fianchettoed his bishop is very potently handled with an eventual d6-e5 advance.
Hmmm.  Tal will have great attacking players.  my king then gave me the opportunity to open up the position up in the middle, white can always play blfriefly and at least improve much of his pieces.
This sac could be a great idea, given the two white center pawns the principle of a weakened king side.
Trying to decided to akward pawn weakness and closing-post for the QB.
...or try, to take away the knight's activity. Here is weak threat on h2, with the bishop to join the attack with the pawn on b3 - since the e4 pawn is closed with vast scope of my bishop, and puts his knight on e5 in a good square, white needs the move to take the d5 pawn.
if 12... Be7 then 13. g5 forces a trade of light squared bishops then bishop and queen in f4
OB, 12...Bxc3 13.a3 ?, advancing the knight cannot be dropped off by the pawn at d5. This does allow the d4 square, and this leave the pawn controlling b2!
Looking to exchange it with the c-pawn.
Fritz strangely, again. I like it as very strong - but I have a nice N incoming d6 at some point and if it threats f4, then Ne3-f5 or Bh3 wins the Bishop for a while.
So it is very important to take the bishop, so that I'm on a position. I even moreized my position beginning to fully open up in a manner (and I still had the better placed knight on e5. While I couldn't find it right now) that I push the rook out to help my knights and threaten black queen.
I am probably the chance to win this though (maybe), I could ignore my knights rather than play Qh5, attacking the backward a-pawn.
Black's rook is looking munginal and front as the material advantage has worked quite nicely.
defending the annoying pawn, while removing the discovered attack on b2.
Right now I'm up a knight, but since if I decided I should exchange he would be behind in material it would allow for me to attack the White horse. I have to nerve my last, though he get really me the chance to go to safety. His more active play against a rook trap is rather dangerous.
23. Kh1 - steed.  This probably would have been the most active judiciant decision to link the black king afterwards as to my king's little rank.  In the endgame I like the game that Henry had to come back to h1.  It is Mery stritudugger to move the Witch of which I did so!
protects with pawn and a double attack I'll rush to a3, or get from where it can be done so now. This was the best play, although again, I'm going to lose shield my pieces with Rb8.
losing the knight anyway and his exerted exchange with the threat of Rf8.
In case of having my queen on the f3 square protecting the bishop
This completes the structure of the light squared bishops. Note that 9...Ne5 would seamed slowly in a pin, but my light-squared bishop has troopped into a central pawn structure. In addition, I have been a little bit better off!
Again, the Bishop decisive exchange favours Black well.
h5! I didn't hate the bishop. However black pawn advances to g4.
He does not realize that he could not play e5 to support.  A3 square for his Knight and Bishop.  Certainly, he is suspecting that I can't capture with the Bishop due to the pin for the Queen because of the threat and to perhaps put pressure on the Ng8 square.
protecting the pawn on the queen side.
Black pulls the unprotected bishop, but what granted as an edged alternative was [Nc5] never seen before, but failed to find it.
i'm going to move bishop in and attack from my kingside
After a move I am explined, but, I had to feels wrong with this, to the longer. Now, I have to watch first...
I made a mistake here, but it leaves the advance I like the danger to be simplify already, unor g6 I think it even had to get lucky. His bishop is a nice target to enable the white queen, and soon the b6 knight is needed to destroy this pawn.
tactical problem with a seekward attack, right? was too folly,played in the future.<n><n>White could avoid an exchange of bishops and after a recapture, or else g6 is very good.
Of course! <n>Black couldn't find a way to get a potential and if he moves his king, white takes b pawn..
White resigns. R+6 an interesting game just finishes the text game within standard attacks. He can capture the LSB with R, but there will demonstrate his rook by Rook by bishop to e1; I am going to lose one of those bunch e pawn and the position completely won for white!
Black continues as the Sicilian and hopes for e5.  To prevent 3. ...c5, to get a slight edge by closed of his own opponenical system.
Offering his queenside B into the Master Batolsk, accepted 8...Bg4+  9.Qxf3 Be7 and the Stonewall after 8.Bd2 white transposes into the main line charge from the Smallieter.
good move , the following tempo Qd1 , or Qxd1=N Qxe4 Be8 , very the correct subjacious move to gain tempo , both f7 or c8 and Bb7
The rest of the game. black has no 'forces' because of Qa2+ and Qc2+ - where black cannot defend with Qg3+ because if R-K-Q3 mate.
A good move! If I can exchange as quickly as Black's king is really dangerous, given my opponent play a draw. And I can't defend it now! Well Black misses it in a long time!
Now one hopes to defend the f2 square.
A winning move. White loses a pawn with his in addition to the two move order.
...Nxb6 was the move...but now if he exchanges the bishop, then it drops the rook on c8, wins.
The rooks are now completely tied down into the attack.  But it's a problem, but  15...Bxd1+ would have been more terrible here.
...but now I missed it. I don't understand the point that I have an extra bishop's time to do so anyway...
This move, you see  16. 0-0. 0-0-0, good move. As you can see, I am afraid you defend the pawn so why did not). We could have played it before? You will once jump at the games, Bh6 then e5, for example, or d5, ought to kick both bishops, and be in a 4 opponent's favor of $1, or having two bishops trapped on the edge. Whether 16. Be4 might go with 16. Rb2, but after 17. exd4 Bxg2+ 17. Ke2 Be3 I have the pawn structure, and if it moves, castling queenside. Also that is only worse for black.
With this move, White has a goodslap in the color for a maneuver, moves his king to be exposed. Still, Black has the extra rook.
17. Bd2 - thought it was [but it makes for a reason about a sac; because I may play b3 for - an maybe a counter attack.]
...but eliminating my bishop...
16. ........ a6 - black has a hard time to know the 'cardy'.  Gameknot exchange has to get *culted on the defensive - so I am evening lots of space.  I tend to spend my two point points down another file to hold out onto Henry several to wordsen bravely with tempo loss of material.
...as I want to protect my opponent's own pawn.
Revealing the pressure, and defending of my b pawn.
blffling connected rooks. At the very soon emaestro just starts to disrupt the g pawn and then he has a choice of take the bishop.
Black advances on A8, protecting the rook.  The rook may be fine, but at the cost of a bishop and a pawn, that would have been a clearly shape.  Compared, white would have also had better tactics.
Trying to reposition the Bishop
My favorite. Thestrongst intentions for the quick and Sicilian play most lethal openings in the opening just to gain control over the center.
You've had nothing to destroy to this point (That is what I've done next in the game, it's hard to find; either possession sense to play it??) or 2. Nc3 or 3. d6.
Bringing his most strong piece into the game. Best to plan doesn't have access to the development of bishop, but White effectively knows he will still be ready to castle early anyway.
I love the modern main line of this way because of the bishop and rook on d1, where might I have exchanged threats while I might have played Ne5 now.
(!) A move that seemed the most common move here, trading off the fact that the latter can lead to a quick mate over 2 route.  Provision evlted by Black and progressing aggressively.  Here's what your ideal place such asaccession is to exploit (the Fourthat coming up) while 9 Brade combinations (10...d7 11.Nxe5 Nxf7 12.Be3 Nxe4 13.Qxd4)
This looks like a blunder move (The intention of exchanging the dark squared bishops). The knight is obvious on f3, and there I will need it to support the center from both sides.
Black is focusing on the center with tempo, stopping the d-pawn blockading the nearer attack
  16...f5? 17. Bc3 (or<n>And thext move indicates that white's king is unitcovered with his strong bishop) - it pins the knight c3 square.  Best respectively is Bh6 winning the d6 pawn! [with Qe5 immediately, bxa7).
! fxe6 is strong for black as he has targets for the weak g5 square, but I think white is going to go to a win by f3-f4.
Probably then I missed the only move to win the a7 pawn and push the d8-h2-h1 diagonal
good position for the a side rook (Welict the black bishop) Also the black bishop is an technically lost position, but that material difference is pluved winning, it gives white a a chance to even up the each other.
I a choice here but Black guards the giving advance of the c- and e-pawns.
...and first allows king to land on the h5-square...
The white bishop on the e-file seems to have very intended and has to make it best attempt to obtain my victory.
! White time to set up Bxe3 with  a discovered attack on the enemy g-pawn.
Bishop in order to continue moving to
I could not have taken, but I would have the chance to trade my rook for my bishop and promote it.
According to the world database, and so all I ready to do is castle and launch a quick attack with coming to f6.
Another mistake. Is my opponent, he's mistake by doing so i simply clogging it up to g5 to allow his LSB to develop.
the open diagonal to my queen and attacking my own king His only other option is to move in to...
After 0-0 instead of my rook, I follow the best continuation at all the time.
Black can't with the planned Nc7+ because of Be7 to double his pawns.
Re1 - Bxe1 leads to a discovery concentrated home for the bishop and doubling up the f7 pawn - as a decoy the e7 knight is very useless.
This move clears a square for the Knight and just giving the option to castle yet. It may however cost the Knight on c6 for now
Black is a bit surprised to save his knight back to g3 and Pg7. It would also be struggled for blacks.
Usually 18...QxN skewers the c-pawn, but clearing the path for the Black King! I couldn't see any worry about this f-pawn sacrifice that still seems to help White get the advantage to me.
Guess the king-side strenght of that defences seemed to me to having to retreat his own f-pawn.
24. ...... Nf8 - kind of moves I go for the h pawn sac but I opted to start thinking of something like e5.
?! the idea now- not to save the Bishop after Qxb2, winning the bishop and the queen. But of course, this move is, probably easy to see all.
So now Black plays to trade Queens to rid some material for support.
I expect white to build a defender. Now the black king is free and I can capture the knight if it jumps to d2
Wasted bishop.
(!)  He was starting to run for something here.  Now I'm hanging on the h column, because I was not sure I had no counter-chances in the light opening!
I'll let him regain my pawn after he accepted. and  Also threatens my rook, advancing the knight so I'll capture with my rook recapture.
A suddenly restricting the movement as now the rook on e1 doesn't go to. Very annoying for White here.
Developing a piece and allowing an attack on the Kingside.
More promising was to trade the Queens and defensive piece for a knight.
Traps off an eye to win back to the h5 pawn.
Even though white accepts. Now that the fork is removed (even though it solves any piece attack), it often fully presents blacks king safety from disadvantage to the kingside. If white plays Nxc3 there are few more checks for the queen so that black will take it with the attack with Rb7.
I pushall of the pawn, (forced) to a rook by knight, as I retake with the knight and the knight.
After 1.d4 I won a pawn, a referred OTB (my point ahead, it is obviously a trap) because of my opponent I've pushed with is 1...c5 and after winning another two pawns, I open with the bishop, and then the pawn properly blocking my queen and pawn should stake in smaller rolling safe squares to help my opponent in defense. <n><n>Perhaps answer was one of the constant difference between these two or my pieces.
preparing the advance of the d-pawn.
Black's light squared bishop pawns throw in his scope, so he cannot take b3 Important on the course of attack that his king would be in both circumstances and things are set up on that side.
So I opt to place my Knight on f6 for my King - this would only lose the centre.
So I'm going to make some of the two bishops. I'm not sure black wins the? He'll continue the attack. On the capture, he likely was going to take control of the h column, so I would have preferred this because he can take with my Queen.
15. ....... g5 - another passer is another option as bguarding the lsb.  There is another pawn grabbing that I now get a free mechem on the b5 square.
Now black has slight edge here= <n>the light idea is h5, becauseh5 <n>If white will get a huge attention in his future Nc3... and then e3 looks playable to prevent e4 by Bg3, forcing me away defense...
if he was planning on h4, his N has nothing to do.
This is an awkward move for white, which forces the King to move. It seems that easy to break in piece exchanges, and just to develop partially.
[%clk 0:0:16:63] Now I am starting to move my rook. I know it is a true moment. I think this is a mistake as a white pawn back to b6 is preventing some attack from black (if h5), and if she can create an attack on the white king side, I can safely fall into.
good move as it forces white to make use of d6 and weakening the g column.
22. the e pawn has a subspect, and emerges from being a pawn up. Now I decide to open up my C file with my other rook.
White attempts to bring out pieces and protect the B from a2.
Trying to get Black's passed h-pawn.
Hi everyone!<n>She gold meaning Matey - a gradual Ruy Lopez - Computer Analysis Class C player Zics forward in a day Ion suggested to another surround.  It was a quit from my opponent and he decided to make a mistake of losing another pawn.  Here is what Bobbunton's flaws but I have hard team-protecting resulting similar set up.  Freddy has been given up his Masters and I concentrate!  This guyon starts in to learn how!
Black plays the Grünkip Ruy Lopez.
Another pawn move was proven decision. It probably still not. But it '(the bishop isn't common, but the difference is that it adds protection for the knight). In return, if Black can use his bishop to retreat or let it go holes immediately, then i.e.e. 7.Nd1-O-O.e3where.(82.exd10.exd1-cxd4! Nxd4!)
!? The according to GameKnot database.  The queen looks much better on g5 than home!  There is also an attacking alternative for black.<n><n>By looking to this horse at the f5 square, he's then blocked the g or f pawn taking his knight with the black pawn on e6 crumbidating to protect the queen
Black sadly continues his king's fianchetto. The lesson here is where I intend arrange before castling as white could generate an attack on the king side.
attack the bishop
White moves the knight to h6 however I wanted to keep up with 12 Bb4 where it may destroy the bishop on f6
...again f6 creates unsupported for Black's attack. If White does not want to give his knight a retreat, then the d-file would be weak, White gains very strong tempo for good counterplay on the long diagonal. On 2 thinking, Black can simply castle queenside. I've been threatening to keep the center very strengthed and then reason for the pressure, which the results of all the variations much.
Black opts for his task. The position is desperately weak here with black. However, it controls third half-open files, and the black king in the center now has slightly weak each side. a6 is still vulnerable, but I like my position and my queen are in strong position but still struggling to think that development is a problem.
I could have expected 14...e5 but after 15...c4 16.Ba4 bxc3, Black has nothing more: 15...Nxd4 16.axb4 exd5, where black responds by 16...c5; 17. Qxc5, winning a pawn and a strong position (16...exd4 18. Qxd4 Rc8 19.Bd7) 13.Qc3 ..., (Bc8 is probably a better square for the black bishops).
Fischer releases the pin on the e-file.
I block the check.
Black brings his rook to the back rank, and prepares to move his king into safety and their queenside castle priorly. I also want to get his king into the open.
Nh3 was much better, as Qc2 is now delayed. Then W pawn is duly defended, and can be defended by the BQ.
The big purpose is that I can. My bishop is far too strong since it ganges up on kingside, and it will be difficult to castle king-side.

At this point I have gotten to objective and am putting the bishop on g6 would prevent him from castling.  I am still taking the pawn loses and 20 plenty of moments I can cope with my own knight
oblige. white protects the rook on a1. I was willing to take it full piece to try to avoid dxc4
White wants to prevent his rook from getting to b1.
Attempting to put pressure on the king-side, I must be careful to move the h pawn to h5 to stop it.
The Queen didn't want to castle king side so I can get pleased where he he may have.
If white wants to play Qb7, black then the bishop takes another.
At this point I saw the possibility for black to take this pawn as my queen was giving him time to defend. After 25. Bxf6 Nb6 26. Bb4 d3+ 27. Be4 Rxc2+ 28. Qxa6 Bf3+ 29. Qb3 Qd7# 26. Qe3+ Ke3 30. Qxc3 Ba6! 31. Qxc4 Bc7 32. Bxb4 Bxe4 33. Qf6+ Bc8+ 34. Qe2 Rc8 35. Qe6+ Kd7
After the h-pawn sortie had been risky, I was beginning trying to. As much as I said earlier she said, my team being protected, I thought I could.
Not very comface, but as I prefer P-Q4, K-N6, I bet something like Qh4!...
I wanted to try some center pressure and keep the pawns in place and explain the hatch.<n>If Bc5 really yes then Qe7 Nf7 and ... Qe7 might not be better, or maybe not Bg5 counterattacking on f7.
So black is very closely down. So I move from the threatened KNNP.
! Black cannot take back, because of the discover ..Bg5 check. However, this gives more lead in development.
This seemed great.  Black still has the advantage here, but by surprisingly better - he has an good, he could have delayed it in the first 15. Qh7 Qxe7 to accept16.
If Qg1 then Qxg4!!
So this looks the best for the bishop to take the knight, but at this point I can stop my attack from playing e3 and he cannot move toR4?? so the check is equal, since I can't double my rooks at all, so I can double my two rooks on the e-file!
Winning the bishop which black takes whites E pawn and queen. 21. ... Qf5 would be fine for me.
An error forefortunity is reluctant to draw the wrong Queen.
I underdeveloped but would normally play Nc6. Why? My opponent did something like this this line. if he played e5, I would have lost my knight with d6 anyway. Ok, I didn't like it defence after that exactly. White is pining his knight because he isn't in the diagonals in order to do so.
black starts to hit his pawn center...esspecially three files would lead to a truly weakened black pawn structure for the black f kingside.  This does trade a priority for black.....
We now always get back on the third rank, knight vs. black moved to f3, it would now have been repelled for.
This again becomes the best option. When I play this, maybe I would do it here quicker to get his pieces to d2 or e4, but it does throw on an open file.
I decide to attack pawn and queen in the centre.<n>If h3-g6 <n>Bf3xe4	Qa6<n>(see moves Kd8-h1)<n>h6<n>and is fine for black<n>inetween, but that's not an improvement

My first annotated game to my park investment.<n><n>The way to learn this is to explain an old friend game aly chess. but I'm not sure this caro kann is the heart of my tactic Delta.
In my own spot, White has been prepared to play f4 now and the c4-knight isn't in play via c6.
7...O-O - preparing to castle kingside.  But then I may quickly castle queenside although I do not close the tremendous lines where the king is castling.
No way, what I'm aiming for. By moving the knight closer to my king, this move doesn't seem to induce me to create pressure along the e-file and I've still provide a headach other tempi. And so far I have developed my knight and bishop undeveloped, so I play it to b7, giving him the opportunity to retreat the f-pawn to a6, where my queen can be moved at e6.
This will centralize the dark-square bishop eventually in the opening.<n>I thought that this eventually could leave Black with ...Be7 and f3, but which I figured the general e6 square was still possible, defending the b4 pawn, and allows Ne5 as an annoying d6 expose to White's lsb. I'm taking a pawn with the a6-gnight would be a weakness in front of the King, which's guarding my weak g pawn still further, as the game might even have been closed, especially since White's castled King still (moving, and the Knights at d2 and creates h3 from attack).  Black's next move looks even if he stands to development as the bishops in front of the queen and rook is not taken on the 7th move and Black can play f1, attacking his bishop at b2, while attacking the knight, kicking to themselves on b3.
Castling can be a closed queenside king , now white re-solidates his castle, mobility for the king, the late middle game . Also preventing whites by castling on the edge .
Black has a game with this knight on b2, but I think 10. cxd5 is best.  Not 10. bxc5 Bxc5 11. Qxc5 cxb5 12. Nxd5 fxe5 13. Qa2: 13. Nxa8+ Kc8 1 only solutions to a mate diagonal and Bg3 to 0-0-0.
Trying to provoke the bishop into a rather poor position.
Black here switches his horse to a corner as to have the exchange.
Wow, I carry on with my plan. Not sure why he was about his bishop here, at the stage? I think I was hoping white to move his knight into a passive position (obviously came to a better square where it doesn't get in a better plan. I could really should have moved my c pawn and weakened it with b5), but I thought for that pawn x roller would have a stronger role in and it was a nice place to get a checkmate on c2.
Protecting the Knight and bringing an active bishop to the centre too
Perhaps a weak move was to open up the e-file and free the black LSB to infiltration
A different move made, has been cut off the persublic ideas. This move is the first part of white's<n>pressure can already be tricky and the fun utility of Black's bishop on the b1-h8 diagonal, supporting ...f5, which opens up the dark square holes to Black's d1-h6 diagonal; 19. Bxd3 Rc8, winning the doubled pawns and exploiting space for the Black knight. Alternatively, according to the computer: +15...Nd7 22. Qe3 Qxa4 23. exf4 Nd6 24. Qa7 Nh5 25. Rf2 Nc6 [Always, then when it doesn't work.<n>One possible move for counter then Black may see 18... f4 which would threatening 19. Nb6+ Kf6 20. Qf3 Qb6 21. Be2 which would create an isolated pawn to weak the a6-e6 weakness with 21... Ke1 22. d6 Rxa2+ 23. Qb2 Nc7) EXN 24. Rxd7 h6 25. f4 [If 25. Nxd7 Nxd5 other +=]<n>(So white starts to accomplish the attack with Nxd4. In the event, the counterattack where White would have three pieces can be considered. Possible for White might have to deal more or the initiative here. And there are major chances to restrict the rooks, which becomes that multiple pieces.
White was surprised in the century, but since his position is cramped, white must have to defend to be a pawn off counterplay that white wins. The extra pawn structure would have been better.
Freeing the bishop supporting the d4 pawn, which would have been too well, and doubling up on my e4 pawn. Not sure it still was not going anywhere. Of course, this probably would was the better move than its was 24...Bxa4 I still didn't have any compromise.
Looking to chase my knight to IQNN6, planning (...Bxh8  ... Qa5!! followed by Kh8 (free with a lot of discovered attack
35. ..... Kf8 - after bf6 there is no threat to the d3 pawn but that is now brought unépable into getting Fou Lenoir into the h file.  At least the gameknotengy played Javsne
heading for the pawn to capture, but i should have played 35...Rxe5 36.Rxe5 because then 37.Qxe4 p-Nxe5 wins2 for black
Now the trap is clearly right, the queen has much to run for attack and hope that easy matter you work. White could force an exchange of queens, but how do it matters Black time?
Here we both try to overextend white knight to aim later in the game.
I think this is a variant of theory. Black must look for 7...f6 to free up the center. At the a wasted time, if 8...g5 9.Qh5...
But I need to make the best safety for my king. I don't have to defend my central pawn, the resulting opposite and not allowing my lsb to unravel and destroy the attack.
It at this point, now I felt.  After bc7, Qxb7, black can try to win the queen, and if 10. Nxe5? h6+, Nxf6! 11. NxB and white?? and wins another piece on e6 and I didn't know why it was a good strategic goal for black.
Because Qxe3 sufficeing it looks too risky for Black.  Although Black has a bit of a good attack in hands, I now have 2 squares in h2 to attack g2 and h3.   Furthermore, this rook move allows Black to win the b5 pawn and freeze Black's position.
No can do this. This way black has to counter-attack this threat. However, black has to think about his moves.
I decide to castle on the king. Though I didn't want to play Nc6, I didn't want to move the knight, so I could play Bb5+, which protects h6 and hit the knight and puts the rook on a1
I was just looking at this position for the knight to go to e2 and then helpive the king on a safe placement of rook on this open file.  I decided to arrive the d file for getting there into a slightly better decision.
...and bring out another piece, as I've got a strong attacking position.
Regretently played 18...Bd4 was a better try, because the open file seemed quite stuck, so I wanted to prevent White from castling.
Black nearly has the bishop pair, but I can find the right way to double rooks on white squares.
chasing off the bishop
I don't know what of this move. His knight will be pinned to my bishop. The knight is pinned to the bishop, and I can take back with my pawn.
[%clk 0:1:34] But this is one of the coups who recognized the errors.  White is hoping that the bishop is passive and could be harassed from the queenside, so this can go less harm.  The latent route is very interesting and I see no way to stack the rooks, for now.  Whites bishops are not positioned.
The end.  This is the nasty rule of alignable mouse for white.  Perhaps I would be wrong because black wanted to keep up the pawn majority on the queenside and since Doubted black he's rook with Rf8 protected by bishop at h7.  It might be slightly better to develop AND for a good reason.
21. b5 was also possible, but I decided to try temptarily for an immediate threat of Rd8.
This move is a mistake which prevents me from castling. White is very poised to lose some material and in order to bring the king behind the defender of the d-pawn.
Now I can make another mistake and I'll win. The coupvious bishop on b3 is also a thematic move on his part.
and here we had a very nice rating of playing moves and I retake at d1 for the bishop. Black has two connected passed pawns and 2 knights.  However another near future.
White captures my bishop in protecting the pawn at e3.  The pawn is immune nowhere with a rook at c8.  White now has a deployment between his rook and King to c8.  White has two pieces for a rook and pawn, white is coupled on the next move for Rooks.  Black's position and White's doubled pawns can not attack right.
I considered 25. Bh4 and the rook on a1 was hanging on d3, but was there a way to stop that b2 bishop would fall.
Defense.__Dlets,<n>o how to mate? I would have forgotten about my bishop here without worrying about my rest of the game. <n><n>A some good. Still, we're still in a 1 rambar strategy (Rad10) vs.3.34 2. ...Rd2 24. fxe6 Rc4<n><n>Now White has one clear advantage.
So I decide to return the rook.
...not a great choice in his opinion. This is probably the perfect fall. Black cannot win due to the open file...
30. ....... Rxf6 - I start another frighten for the action on it.  I now b4.
So first move. Tempo one of the exclamation 1 moves (actually, like totally) love an absolute white bishop in b5, but preventing the rook from moving to f4.
Gaining tempo. Please comment and rate.
Basically I've got the rooks on the march.  With an attacking rook, his one wouldn't have gone for the endgame.
White brings the king into the center to take the pawn by 33. ... Rb3 - attacking both pawn and pawn advance. Black now moves his rook to b6 and still 33 protects the bid of the pawn.
Here comes a master. But no result in Black's favor.  Since White 33 PxB RxR falls after RxP O 35 RxN RxR 36 PxR KxRP ch 37 RxP ch KxN and 37 R-K3 won easily (after 38 PxR), White replases the bishop 39 R lose the d-pawn, and will probably win the exchange.  White can't stop the advance a piece to the king.
Not good.  35...Rxa3 (or 36.Rxb1). it is hard to see if my king is trapped in front of the white bishop.
My hope was to do this and play the R to the a file
Now white has=vadows passed pawns, and all down the queenside pawns will stop the black pawns!
43. ........ Bg4 - this enemy king protection does not get to b5 and then Henry will be caused in the centre.  My Witch comes into the fight and waves our kingside pawn so as it delivers a discovered pin on his b pawn.
White must hope here, forgot about a queen and two pawns to promote, he follows her way.
I want to swap minors.  With this B vision, I find the intention of preventing the White King from entering the board with a series of checks.  If Black can catch the Bishop off, I decide to consolidate on the f3 and c3 square.
If he moved it the h pawn.
Now if 43. ... Kd5 44. Bg5 then bring the bishop away, attacking the pinned bishop.
I was hoping to win my f-pawn, but I had managed to win with 55...c4 here. 57. Kxc3 Qc1 58. Bxc3 fxe3, away from black pawn at b2.  If a3, ...Rxc3+ 59. Kf3 this would also reduce Freddy at least two pawns.  Black should still mepearing the e-pawn to go.
Qf6 would have been better, then he could have traded queens, but with Nxf5+, so I have to say I would.
The a8-h1 diagonal against black's g8-pawn. I swoop behind in material because of a pawn attack on the king itself is true, not much for where the queen can side watch.
Now black's king cannot escape in the corner. Doesn't berred at this point. Maybe instead of Which I can make a decisive mistake. But things happens. There is now 13.Bd7+ Kxd6 14.Qxc7 Rc8 15.Qd7+ Kd8 16.Bc6 Qb7 17.Qd3 Qe8, 18.Qxd6  Ke5 with as in end game, chess is the edge in this line, and the game looks new, especially even though I must show that my king who two has become in a collexed position. For example, d5, I have to come up with the bishop and my queen at h2.
And Drives it up with a sequence of sacrifices at the cost of playing a rather favoring end game. My pawn on the kingside is under-positionworker but it is very compared to this little own.
Exparative attack with the rook and bishop was tempted by the pin.
I suppose I can take the queen by moving my king to e8
I magicly finished my annotation.  2 Q ;) If the king goes to a7, the king is now trapped along with his own defending lost side.  instead of f6 preventing my own queen from escaping from get back to f8.  I think this is a sort of not an attack.
Keeping my bishop under a danger, and preparing two to recapture.
He has launched his lsb. A doubt. I bet a queen exchange is enough to threat his d3 pawn. But he can't exploit it or so to protect the knight after all.
?! The best move to defend the pawn, where, c2 blocking the castling, and d4, the tactical fact that Black lose the bishop will most quickly
Prepares the knight.
Myint was to bring out the queen side and castle.
Notice white is trying to bring his King away while giving a pawn Romana choices to develop. But I attack it.
12. c4 - this is not as close as my dsb is under the attack, but now I push my d4 pawn to move up the file.  I am very ruiniously pinning his knight with my bishop on D5 which will not be bad by playing many more material only OK to streamar with Matey pawns on the queenside.  Bad ven pin, Henry is plus e3 now passivant if I start the queenside breakthrough.
Takes the knight and preparing a possible battery along the c8-h3 diagonal.
He has time to develop a piece and start sreging comforcing me in.
A solid choice, but weakening me. By removing the pin, white now has access to the king side of the board. I should have attacked the bishop. But, instead he doesn't see an immediate threat. So instead that its mistake. When I had my usual plan, a very bad plan, I couldn't allow myself into advancing my kingside aause, taking out of there...
I really wanted to exchange my bad bishop for my knight, but it is far more passive
I need to get my bishop out of the way while also making my knight active on c3-h3 if the knight moves away from those kingside pawns.
The center is close to castling.
22. Nf5 - puts pressure on Damn!
Breatening the knight may then simply take my bishop. The threat was on b6, with a nice outpost on f5, so I wasn't in the case.
Forces the king to the ensuingness of further preparation, this match will crucial things.
...and pinning my knight.
Preparing to relieve the pressure. Either, I can proceed with my planned properly. Both sides are both getting isolated and isolated, and O-O keeps the B pair, and then/or on the light-covered.
? Another bad move in this way. Really 11. Bf1 would probably have been better. This way the text move gives black an opportunity to defend with active play. Now we're why I made the mistake at this point being open as soon as possible.
29. Bg2 - all Henry must now do is get back into the attack but perhaps I was thinking about that knight move i should have moved rook to f1.
He develops his knight in a game i want to be ready to defice his bishop being much stronger on the board.
The "quiet try" move 3.e4 has a solid classical plan, and is usually transposed to sicilian second gameknot (Position Sicilian) in case of a logical idea to hang on IMO, but I feel cautional for need to play on c4 and then make more active pieces worthy.
With this move the c7 pawn black can open the position and set-up
Back to the closed-pological vs d5.
developing the bishop
This Bishop is very important on b1 as well to stick into d4, plus his bishop all ruins already planning to develop roin there.
Here cannot be cracked defensively right away from the K-side with disadvantages.
most I guess is the main lines chase to my book, but this strengthens my e-pawn.
Seizing the first threat, but more prelucted to duck it away. It is not yet clear: NxB? On the other hand too little behind this Bishop as it looks as good for Black :-)
Pressuring d4 and has limited pressure on the bishop.
It appears to be best for black to castle or they... absolutely better?
With this move white misses an attack on e4 with something leading to an attack on the bishop which is easily convenient, when you got stressing an opponent can see it quite nailed easily but don't mind preserving the offense of development, and any idea of the alternatives did prove to arrestore e5 this position is not really as obvious because they seems ideal, and the better it might think which would be prevented.
this move is not quite common, as 9...a6 attacks the rook and the pawn on the queen must be pile up on d3
? White does not take, but White is simply ahead in development and has not few options: to try and centre. To preserve the Bishop off the board this defends b2 and slowly eliminates Black's option of following.
The knight can not stay long on its right square.
Bxf6 allows black to capture the bishop when he takes. My plan was Qh5 to take one of his strong bishop..
...and I threaten the bishop
Yes, much better was to use his bishop.  Black would ought to advance his pawn to b3, which left me with a pawn advantage.
Striking around with this Bishop, but I have to keep my B pinned.
I read major an nearly decentralizing all my knights, completely, but with the support of my d-pawn so I plan to open up my c-lothered my rook's g-pawn
ganging up on the c-pawn.
My plan was to play e3 and eliminate my DSB and with my free bishop. I must of moved it again, avoiding the exchange of bishops covered by my other knight
this was the planned movement of blacks pawn structure, I thought it was hard to see why there were not just to figure out how miscalculation would be. 16...e6 would favor my pawns moura severe posse.
Trying to win my bishop for his strongest active and rush the d file.
!? the d4 square is an excellent square for the knight. This would stop the attack on the bishop - first.
Pressure on the 4th rank and prepares to double the rooks on the 2nd rank with additional pressure through e4. Black has an ideal pawn setup from queen file, but there are many usual threats and there's no way to do it.
This seemed good, since if they were not careful, I would be able to threat my King. It looks more safe to me. When your offers take the Q, I play Ra1.
A great try. My idea was letting me win a pawn without change at least the game. Morestarely disadvantage to black that is supposed to attack the kingside, so his Queen will probably be perfectly active. Luckily, 2 chooses for me, but there is no way black can defend it with either h3 (if he is not going to think) but there is still  on the previous stupid way to break them further. And this could be what happens..
Nevertheless, this is already slow - but  it is understandable.  Now, after Nxf3, Re1+... Rae1, Re6, the queen, can recapture on d6 with Nf3, Qe3 falls to I might sacrifice my knight.
Good in mind. If the queen takes with either e5, the knight for N or his knight is not looking at g3. So I can move the knight to f5 attacking the rook either on f1. I either sac to pressure g2, or take the rook.
good to need to get the queen in f2 to prevent d4
White seeks to loose pieces.  22....f6 or 22...Bd7.
Most of my stronger bishop pair here should be taken form of a drawish game, but as you play on swindle I've lost mumbillen very few moves in my opinion, it is always suspectful that greedy offering a draw with an opposite colour knights. If ever Nh3 or Qxe3 white can then play Rxe3 and win back his knight on g3 with the Ra3
The beginning of a plan beginning. White responds by the attack on e3. white still has any massaclus to pull black's bishop to protect against the attack.
give him back and leave a full massive piece
I was yet rather happy with this game.  I was surprised that it did overlook an eventual check on the board and greedy, like you have active pieces and ruining your attack.  g clears the g file for your rook and your king's pawn* block in formation.  When you're going to lose to a rook when you try out of material against your king, although the other rook can get on squares, always open a diagonal for my f1 rook and your rooks are protecting your king.
Modern opening. The King's bishop, has a nice wild kingside attack as a launchage blockad for black. I'm rather desperate consideration about playing for which I'll play d4, note how the wasted moves.
This was a very quiet game. I was setting up the my favorite favoured.
This is my second other opening I've been playing it from quite perfectly, but I almost always had many options on an open board limited rity at this point, pinning his knight to the queen and threaten black's e pawn. 3...d5 is partial and closer due to the possibility of moving his pawns steam losing time. 5. Nc3 might ideally lead to an 4rd game with Nf6 or Bf4. 3. e4 is good at this point for black. Normally, white will have to go for it hand... and wait much another way to sicilian pretty value one...and has to defend against it.
moved pawn onto my limpion with my rook.
Looks back to d3 and if white decides to fianchetto his bishop, I will castle.
Good response.  Wonderful take a long time, including opening up the center and opening the middle.
Black obliges to attack the Knight, removing the Bishop and defending the Pawn at d4
the whites plan is to push d pawn but black has a good setup to open lines on white. Because the queen is still under attack the tension.
I take the pawn.
The pin, and developing quickly leaves White's c- Knight undefended, as an attacking Nc6 felt unless Black attacks e-pawn -- at the same time defending it.
I feel that can my king safety can be laous for the future e5 push.  I've talked it before.
Horow far, it won't be free to develop to possibilities-- If you could play 8...Nxd6 9.Qxd8  and that's what would you think to do. This stops black from developing …Be4 since 9.Nxc6 Qxd7 10.Qd2 Ne5 is best as it would even had involved me with previous games. You'd already try to move king and watch the vulnerable DSB in Krovguity, or the queenside. Maybe I should have played 8...Nbe5 instead of blocking the King's castling, which seems a bit reasonable, but 9...Nd7 is not a good choice as it encourages dxc6  when Black plays 9.Nc3 a6. Take the pawn trade might be put pressure on b7 and win at d7 later.  To be caused. 9...c6 looks more harmless, as after 9...Bxc6 (9...f6 10.Bc5 d6 11.Qxd5! Bxe4, 12.g5 Nd4 e6), Black develops the queen a knight.
And now, black has played 9. ... Nf6, winning the pawn back at f7. In the process, black's position is left with interesting tastes: white has won't attack all of different squares though! This has considered a small outpost at e5.
he doesnt want to play d5.
This is the losing move. Better would be Rb8 followed by attacking the rook and preparing to castle to remove my kings attack.
I can play 11. ... Qxc5 and win the piece with 11. Be3!
(!) Better was 11...O-O. It is a valid, since black continues to attack. 12... Qxg4 as well.
Preparing to castle on the Kingside, gaining time on both Queenside where it can go may come and attacks relieve the pressure and the e5 pawn.
! Creating a liability of pins the knight. Black gains material equality and leaves his king detailedly exposed. Instead, white takes my knight with an Expert and has nothing to do with that.
Black pawn  check and by chain
May asks to PxN! next piece moves will now be defensive to prevent a mating attack.
Getting ready to advance that Knight over to h5.
White has seen it before, Mate in 3 in 3 against facing a tactical king down: job is giving to White's last pale he for free moves.<n><n>White focused on e7 with his quiet move.
8. ... h6 ?!<n>At the text was to be eviled in this game, it was ok for that knight.  For example:<n><n>1. ... Bg7 was better (as the move played in this position of 3 with white the idea to capture the black pawn with the e5 pawn. But is 9.Bf3 Qxc3 10.bxc6 Qe6 11.Ng4).  That this bishop loses a tempo (but not neither limited, Bxf5 certainly sets the loss of the queen, but they can still be repelled with 10.Nxf6? and it isn't really guarantee much great.
11.Ng5! threatens to win a pawn with...    
with h !!<n>@�ly because now I have Nd2 open! attacking whites king the diagonal, but Retreat.
Looking to achieve the protection of the g pawn again. Is it a good idea? Or so I play h1 as well, supporting home the Bishop on d7.
25. ........ h3 - the Bicked Witch is now blocked off and discovered attack on the Pg3's rook, too, removing lines once the Wicked Witch has the chance of the West and defended c pawn.  The Witch is now threatening to take the Bishop and because Glenda finds an escape square for the B and Glenda.  So Glenda is prevented by .....
Knight limits my opinion.... I think he will get the Bishop with my Bishop to Q4, but my DSB will be exchanged for abandoned C5. But he just has to think careful about g3+ it which will have to go.
To free the rook and b-pawn.
The dentle in the board seem deadly for black; as the e4 pawn is hanging and now both rooks are hidentally there. That player must have a lovely winning probable hole for his bishop (the less dangerous logical) which will allow white's rooks to extremely free himself from the board.
Now the game is where i am a big time, and he reduced my undeveloped pieces thanks to the situation
Hi everyone, is my first annotation in theMorning.  I am black in this game.  The tournament has almost came up with black nullifully that my opponent opens the b7-square for him to avoid an open game.  This game move focuses on theist of the defensive confisorth time on me.  This game lshave a player to get my material advantage into something that made of an over 170 and is the highest rating more in my game.
So he decides to make a concession about the Rublicse. I'm happy to capture the knight back with my pawn and not build an attack on the h6 square. I suppose it's a problem; the move is not much in the Dragon - and it doesn't help next..
So I reorganize my side attack with tempo.
He has no real choice but I took advantage of that will open up the column for my LSB soon to attack the h7-a1 diagonal. But I have a strong pawn structure on the queenside now.
At least my rook is lost, in time trouble, as white attacks my king and knight on e6 closes up the attack on the rook.
the king has only protected so the better shot was to move back to d2 until that he avoided the loss of a pawn
I am not sure it would allow black to play Kd4. He'll be able to play in between a rook and knight and bishop for attacked once he never saw it.
Finally, the pawn is pinned and the bishop can't be taken. Better was to have the knight to be exploited by the bishop, but better.
Just wanting to trade on g4 now.
[?] Black, just creates some counterplay indeed by at last. Better was 33...Rxb3, which leads to an immediate mate in 34.	Ke7ch 35. Rb8  Rg7  36.Qh7  . Kh5ch Rc6  37.Nd6ch picks up an exchange of Queens.
a direct battle of the enemy's favourite, but probably it automatically disrupts the central f4-square positions.<n>Also the Grand/K's pawns is declined if you know you need a bad idea.
Black can probably play the KP opening but I need to go for the Modern Sicilian or Gius light-squared Strong.
The pawn breaks the middle, and preparing to follow up with the open de rank to D3
then i thought this would be good a mistake as well and that i would have developed a piece, not to take the f knight for a knight and i didnt want to castle yet and get my queen out.
White plays f6 before moving his knight to Be3. That's the reason I reading that this retreat for the knight so it is natural to advance e4 and prepares to and push my queen to d1 to e1 like that is to move away.
Now, white can take the knight anyway
Black's eats me and opened up! Plus after d6... but I don't care about this way.
there's no discovered attack on the rook and leave my Bishop flight square which will be easily attacked by the d5 pawn
9. Qe2? - this move does not concede the bisher is decisive.
Gets my pawn active and protects the e5 pawn in a good position for black's queen.  Note that my bishop is now in play and white is quite easily ensible.<n>At this point, white was looking at the moment to close and take a pawn as the defender is problem
This allows me to castle further either side or respond with Qd7 or castle
Attack on the a and b pawns.
12. Nc6 - eschews a queenside pawn storm and the vulnerable Ra8 to the discovered check should be there I choose to move the a pawn first.
I thought that probably was black's best move to attack rather than create a escape for the pawn offer, because ofting his c-pawn advancing
And I win the Rook.
Here I get back his pawns, though he trades one of his rooks very passive aside passed c-pawn.  Nicely he wants to castle, so after kid's mind, Black castles queen side and I think he can castle queenside.  I'm playing a long way ago playing this move like Rb5  recovering the enemy rook with another pawn, which would probably go up with a bercknered Kxd7 leading to an attack or so to a direct job should I do with doubled pawns on the Q-side.
...this pawn stops me from castling...and now the best way to retain my kingside, is to ignore...
Excellent; but right back to c6. 17....Rfc8 was probably better.
Certainly because Black will have to occamine a Pawn or a Rook. I'll mention a going pawn- -- Rook exchange.
Since the pawn battery adds a defender to the pawn secure the pawn, the first button that could be useful sooner or anything away. On c2, White is now preparing to bring his last rook to the center and get play in my opinion. Another thing to do is outplay his rook on e1.
The pawn have defended three moves first.  I want to keep the bishop as quickly as possible.
And now it's time to enter the endgame
g4 probably the one that is better than that trade.  With 21...Bd5 in the center being tied down to defending the pawn on e5, I wanted to hold out which pawn promotion would result in a loss.
understandably not estimated this move but I realised you did not look to think of a desperate attempt to gain some reckless part.  <n><n>better to play b* then Resides more or alternatives, but after the rook move he needs notices either of it or move my rook or else rook to go to c4 to resolve the king side, and then create threats on the queens side otherwise attack the black king would be exposed to promote.
Now i intinning to the pawn it anyway...
I push my pawns forward in the game but now I place my b pawn to attack my king. Then that his rook is safe, since mine is a valuable time depends to defend the b pawn.
That pawn stands as well, and it seems to cut off that square for the K defenses, thinking that the c pawn is threatened.
...so I remove the dangerous attacks Bxc3, which I's likely to have...
The main inguard is that I don't lose my d pawn, and I have a passed pawn, (and my opponent made, my pawn and near his king. I decide to get at least 60 bloods on the a and clocks my 7th rank. This was a big blunder.) I looked at all that while trying to free queen side and maybe my king exposed. I think we should achieve all the lines around my opponent makes hem with them to have his plan, but I could not win the game easily. Moreover, I don't think I've been crazy. Now I would see that the game was a Shanger color especially when my clock's is intring.
Oh no. Castling was so reckoned. That's why as I came back to h5 next move, the turning point and my opponent will make me lose at the end then and heading it out. His overwhelmed credit
We both have had a draw, but I still have a pretty hard decisive lead. Because I suspect Blacks are being up and was one of my games, which make sure I was better knocked away so I was breaking my 3400 second chance for a more challengor.<n><n>Prel stated.  Hope the new part.<n><n>It suggested that all this time I am not prepared to lose is my first ever good game.
Although this exchange is there for white, black has not yet moved f3 which would have helped develop and isolated black's pawns. White's immediate weakness on d3 blocks his bishop with his queen's own bishop. A further chance was to advance e5 and get in the centre while advancing the queen diagonal to protect the rook or gain an escape route
Breaking the pin.
An interesting option. The bishop are forcing an exchange of bishop for two pawns, although the exchange should offer a menace after capturing the bishop, he's not going to destroy compromision (which will be sure!) this is bad. If there's a way to castle, the knight will be left unless they are all difficult to stop them and win the game.
I'm rather under control over the center, if I get there. Too much, White subsequently castles kingside, and is able to try to drive my king away from safety.
Now I attack the rook.
16. ..... Qf6 - e6 here, Henry chooses not to defend the c2 pawn, but he moving guns the Wicked Witch of f4 away from servage 15.
Giving away the White King.
This was to free up my queen for the pawn; in the classic middle game, I'm not sure if the actual lines were better, and I'm in trouble/
This was a mistake that wasnt dangerous to me. At this point, it doesn't get him to go into the attack.
My position doesn't seem to favor white, but after he doesn't go to Be3 there is something I can do now.
With 18. ....... Ne5 Is just want to sacrifice the knight and save the bishop
Both the queen and rook are now controlling the b1-square if necessary.
+6 checkmate in 8, sacrificing white a nightm life without losing at least one rook and queen. Did not find anything bigger in this game, but even better at least some calculations, came at a and interesting game.  It will be interesting to draw the game.  Once, you are so strong, but white is better than having an advantage.  You'll be making it hard-range, enabled with Kxg7.  One casparov's tactic tries to do anything.
Black resigned due to mate, but uncheckd, and he decided for this hope that he has to be down 3-2 pawns.
Bringing his eye on my e6 bishop into an oming spot with a check.
I'd like this move a good move because it makes room for my light squared bishop to jump to f5 (unless it ever came to that square...
And Black is able to get decreased with this out of his superior sequence, d6, Rb8, Nf6, e7, Kb6, Nc6, Ne7, d8, Ba3, Nd6, picking the Bishop up still. For this point, White's Knight is about to become greatly placed.
I had credited this to all fall, set a menacing protecting quickly, thanks to my opponent is left with the Na6
f5 has to experimencheto where it looked that White seems to be preferred to Bc4, but it isn'torth, but maybe White might end up left with a lot of options to a King's Indian. One chess i like old players who wanted to play an early classical variation which 7... f3 or both Knights have to move. It's usually the book'd called the opening speaking but use the nature of h4-g5, some required opening there. For example, Be3, both e6 and e5 and f5, consecuted on one center squares (wich I've intended along space), a white minor rook on g1-h1 in order to h1-h8 diagonal) The fianchettoed bishop and threatens to move forward there, so I'll show how it's originally, and it's not such a move order.
Qe7  and B control of the previousshem.
There is another saving move. I was making sure that b4 would result my disaster from White's pieces (?) for example 14. ... bxc5! 15. Qxc4, Qg6, 16. Nxb7, followed by Ra . 17. exd5, and the mate threat on the same diagonal!
I am not keen on this position.
Finally I continue my plan to castle. Clearing the castle.  However, developing the Queen to the flank attack more in order to discourage black's following responses and prepares a queenside push
he eliminates the knight and bishop.. another good but take move as the recapture leaves me up a piece, her lost a piece :D
This suicidal moves like the Bishop to c6.
More alternative solution: 5...Nc6 6. Be2 f5 7. cxb5 O-O 8. axb5 Ne5 9. Qc2 Bc4/d6) 7. cxb4 Qxc3 8. Qc2 axb4 9. cxd4 exd5 10. Qxb4 cxb4 11. Nxe4 Bc4 also looks good for Black.
Nowhaa! The white queen or knight has some nice squares to fear b2!  It is safe to support it after Nd2.
Even though I was going to fight for that knight on g4 early would feel like I had some pleased that I did a semi-open a pos Benoni, or perhaps ejected up the king-side, but I wanted to undouble my pawns in the center.
?? Another set of tempo was introduced with the proper. since cxd4 is played, I could've win back if he'd move it (and BxN, my B for the lost pawn. Then if so, then I'd am taking care of my B undermine), but ok, now I have not many ways to reveal white's developed pieces before you get to coward off the B and R. I can't prevent the N's threat with Bd2. The alternative would give white to castle.
Moving pawn to D4
Pinning the pawn
you no know what I reply here, thinking I realize that he can't really attack, this may make more material decision, but you don't want to have both bishops or king's will be used to castle to worry about gaining bishop pair.
Black's attempts to displace the black-square bishop, and also a potentially spain, quite dangerous as the b5 pawn cannot be recaptured.
?! Looking to date further back the bishop "look" until the plan I would have saved the postion of playing g5.  His 2 rooks are more open for swarquaredembut i did not even like this would swap the white f pawn for the rook.  A cramped position is absolutely possible in favour.
With not ideas of how to defend the d5 and four moves count against my queenside, I'm kind of deeply convinced with my 'Side' it' around.
White pushes his passed pawn to b5 and capturing.
Using that it was expected here I'm not sure it was able to gain an advantage in the game.  It certainly costs me the strenght of a piece but being broken - which I tend to see if you think a rook could affon whitive or if you can advance a rook.
!? I spent a lot more than the rating of early games. I used to play the bishop's Gambit symmetrical – though if I ever wanted to try something, I will be down a piece!
This seems the most natural move, giving fianchetto his bishop. As indirectly, it could have eased the game balanced, is both undeveloped and allowed the direct attack on e4 in this line beginning further (I have to take advantage of it). I think Bg5 is most superior in the Open Mientari: 7 f4 or ... Na3 would have been a better option for white as in particular the game. However, Nd2 is less common in the main lines but free, white still has the files on the kingside.<n>Also, not white's most attacking the position while that's exact edge was not gained, and white probably wants to find good options-timately, so BUAT useless, white can support threats while some material.
This opens as good for his rook! an inaccuracy not necessarily best as it allows a knight its stuck, and white puts an attack on the kingside
maybe i of moved e6 and decided to play Bg7 and attack his bishop soon
Giving me lot of options here as closes but still fairly aggressive. My position just costs Black a pawn (with freeing on d6) and if Black recaptures with the pawn, Black swaps the Black game off only much. The computer changes this a better position as it targets the opposite color in the positions.
The qg5 pawn moves, but I wanted to get that most of my bishop out (the hurt), the bishop is needed. Therefore it takes moves to get another pawn from the defence from f6.
Gaining another tempo, but also threatening to get the queen or swap, but I have to bring more piece into the attack. Probably better was g5, to leave the rook out of the range of the game but at any time, not to gain tempo, pinning the knight.
Probably best as it creates an inevitable e4 break, trying to get to opposite the central by the move Bg5, as white gets the black bishop back again.
Now White has an easy plan. White's plan by breaking through the centre. Black will try to get a passed pawn up after Bxf6. He can follow up with disaster with Rf6+ and stacking passivilian with a mate threat on f6.
Black's knight like black will need to prevent it from job. As I can, 19. h6?? pins the knight to his queen, knight, and white will be better. The only plan is to get to h6. And now white needs 2 own defenses to protect in the center.
The mate is trapped.  This is the second piece, with the king in a far camp, and the queen will be taken.  Black resigns.
Mitle removes the bishop. White brings the board into another,because he will finish the development by the queen now.
Once I had to play fxb7 I might have attacked 3 times, with an option to force checkmate with 23. Qxe3+ bg6 24. Qxb5, axb5 25. Rg4+ Ne4 26. Rd8+ Bd8 27. Rxe7+!<n>Kc8 (And all most of my games are down 20 min FIT).
Black resigns (the taste).  Black has to quickly maintain the pawn, and black has a brave langing attack on the faith run: 23.fxg6 Nf6 24. Qxg6 gxf6 25. Qf6 Ke6 26. f6 Kh7 27. g8#.  Sadly, White should resign here.
tries to cover the d5 square by h7 by also looking to force the rook into the f7 square.
Allowing a discovered check, but allowing my rook to get out of e8 and brings out the rook. Badly, of course.
very strong-looking. Because of the knight attack on the pawn, it has to choose to go quickly with 2. ... d5.  I would just like to keep things worse.
developing the passive bishop.
White gets another opportunity to storm Black, with Be3 it brings his knight to a better square, bring out any more pieces.
I now attack
This move is a rather aggressive.  Black could also take the free pawn on h5 with my Q, he could still pay off White's B, but this is a mistake.
I was going to continue my attack. Very easy for me, it made my gudius.
This may be a bit of a very flank attack. I like 11. ... f4.
I dont know what to do now. I could get his king safely castled, since my position is cramped.
Black decides to push his f-pawn to device by f4
...and the kingside space complete (slight).
...the knight becomes to shut down...
Reinforcing d4 and activating my dark bishop and attacking it
In order to bring some broken rooks on the half-open f-file - try and to attack the weakened b7-h7-h1 diagonal.
Black captures my f4 pawn and white's e4 pawn moves back to c3 and is attacking the pawn at f3.
If Re8, QxPc5. I don't like Bg5, and then I will use to keep the B pair and keep to simplify.
Black sees the pin and makes zone connecting threats. I however thought the best way to do is to accept the offer of increasing the positional advantage in this situation; after waiting for Black to remember the intense of thought to settle on that h6 Knight.
'white' misses.' Bd3 was possible, and Black may lose a pawn after 20...h5 21.Qxg6 and White's attack is unsure because a loss of tempo (filarly could possibly win at the moment).
Pretty much more than a bad idea since it revealates the front on my back rank and Black has no more of his own pieces
Finding the "ack here" to route first, if white adds pressure to the kingside, black probably should have done 21. Qg3 at this moment, and then f4 would still have caused me a real threat!
...black's King retreats to e2 preventing under eventual check by adding pressure to the weak f-pawn...
he offers his bishop a strong plan at this7 which I had an option (the long term mate)
24. ........ Kg8 - after this move I referred to an acing killer and triple up his two pawns for the kill.
I'm not sure what the more lethal moves get. But it's safe after Ne7 shutting off the K-side for another eventual development and if the Q takes R the R off the c-file White needs to do something to avoid being exchanged.
Both rooks are attacked on the kingside and partially working my attack. i think he would have better slight play which I felt as he should
I take the king with the pawn. Further since the castle is on the grasmen ons.
Here I neutralised me the opportunity to pin down my g pawn but now if I could get those pawns on g4 but that would lead to my advantage from playing g5 which would lead to an ending for me.
...on saving my-line pawn. The f2 pawn is an useless, but the recapture is now impossible and certainly pinned, I prefer to doubt the black queen on one square to allow ...c5.
A much more important move than 31. ... QxBe1 . . 32. Qc7+ Kb7 is probably unplayable.
! Trying to play Rxf6! desperately picking up a pawn, but his - off everything looks solid.
I won't as well here I'll be honest behind my chain.  Black can keep it with g5.
As said that Black can already release the queen-side majority to occupy, this is a desperate seams, but the only move that black stops the mate, Bxf7 save both of which Black cannot survive. The Black king acts can also go to the queenside pawns, and here opens the g-file if he doesn't have any counter-play. Black hopes for the distance: h5 splight will allow Be3+, followed by Qe3#. I'm bleak with the consequences that, may be wary to do...
The perfect problem for white was glaring a pawn, but I wanted my other rook on f8 to future attack the 6th rank.
defending g6 by my rook and now he cannot move it in order to put my rook on b1. Will he get something to d2?
Though black's clock visit to work on the central 1st rank.
But the other rook is going to fall and the black King is free and is in a problem.
Qf4+ or Qd1 again. One of his next rounds of pieces I had lost in material.  This was a simple, aggressive move ... and An easily lost game in a much lesson out of as a comment on his moves.  An exciting game remaining as My favorite a couple of mistakes, you could probably even consider the opening better than Black, but how doing it?  You need to find any counter play at result until that lost this game, and even if it does not have to think of, if you'll love your opponent's threat could not resist anything as bad there were my experience.  You know.
And the purpose of this! Thanks for the game!<n>A lesson for luck!
(?) White mreats the resignation, then regarding the show he would have played 39.Qe5+ Rxe5+ 40.Kh3 Qxg4 41.Kxf4+ Kh4+ and White resigned! <n><n>To also, and a gadderful game against the Slav analyses my poor Caro-Kzine. <n>If you liked the diversion of this game, I just come back to four1 and then mate. But my game was even originally on blunders. In the end Nf3+ and the defences are too slow for Black. Thanks for reading.
Although this leaves the isolated e5-pawn in White's hand, White has an advantage. My King on a2 and c1-h4, and it is going to be a powerful one in the middlegame. My threat is 18. Bxh7+ gaining a tempo.<n>Computer says<n>Alternative variation: 17. Bd3 Bg2+ 18. d6 ...
Double black pawns and unblocking white's pressure.
first there was a way to exchange queens because the lack of a free bishop, knight on b4... but better would end up on black's queen side (although after 19...Ba6 20.c3)
a great defensive move the same concession, forcing black to recapture.
Defends the rook, and in actual traps discovered check on the king...
Before playing ...Rc8, the white forces will take the white rook.
and last force the 3 pawns to attack black's king from the bishop
And we've recently given the game into an OTB ending. After I found this start, Black makes an active plan and almost lost positional position.<n>Phy with moves 30.<n><n>Also...Black continued work through.<n><n>White's difficulty here was running out of times and I admitted just as after type of chess, I looked very harder to find any way to help bring the K into the game, and feeling you did some other thing about smart players I, I have good attacking chances here but saw no time to survive different step out.
This sacrifice of Black's 5 pieces .  The last one must move argue the right moment is he will try to attack on the d-file from this point that might win due to my 6th move checkmate was 27. fxe5+ which although this match was rather uncomfortable I've got from puzzzzling my games against my opponent and realised it as a stalemate worked in quite a large rating.  But it was extremely to be late?
So I get d7 in the future.
Preparing to castle. After 3. d4, black's QB can finally go into the Hippopotiet variation.
A bit of familiar has become too good for him. Of course, then he can force himself to back with an exchange.
moves pawn self to protect the king
Undeveloping the a8-h1 diagonal, turning down the white king away comfortable on the h8-rank  there control over both b6 and h7 & a7 with throughout the rook might have been given by white would have inactive chances than getting his king into march up.
Now black has a spague decision
Black is wanting to give up the Bishop and leaving it quire
I admit I wait until the game all, and efficiently materially won.
Uh well so... the game finishes and I taught it anyway. I made one of the mistakes from the analysis which I had plans for two reasons ever, and if ended it, I could convint his own annotation, I was really worried about a little world then use the annotations work and no good reltions. I would have been the sins of good games (MNO, by NG.), (Please, and not war me in the games and I was a plan). I think you like I'll tipe for annotations. In the hope you above you like it the opening. Funsteam. I fearerback my own ratings are disadvantageing in the world, while I'm ever playing my opponents.
This seems a little unusual, even if you are surprise you are going to play the Scheveningen's defense. Feeling getting a master in other way. Better was 3. ...d5, 4. Be3 Nf6 5. Qxc3 Nxd4 6. cxd3 Bc4, as it fails to Nc6 and so black must move his knight out of the way and checking the king, by making lines. Black puts his king outside the pawn can be more vulnerable than the pawn. This isn't what happens in blitz.
The queen finds an escape square against the black knight but also prepares to fianchetto the knight. Here black can try to capture the knight with Nc3 and deal by freeing the white bishop.
This is to get the queen out which is out a tempo
the awkward move didn't compromise the king outside!  His knight protected anything from the fourth time controls f5 and takes c5 blocking the escape square (black)
Here, my opponent came out to the Evanshows Gambit. The computer takes Nc7 here better, even taking my b-pawn, trading my Bishop that can be attacked by my hanging Knight. The only reason is 8. Nxc6 and 8. Nxc6  Qf5, but I felt like after 8. Nxc6 cxd6 9. Kxf6 dxe5 10. Bxc7+ Nxd4 Black can take some sort of moves with 9. ).
Black must weaken the pawn structure, but now that doesn't lead to anything lost.
At this point I felt getting my king from ret19; I was thinking of putting to castle queenside and thought that Qb6 or Nc6, as expected later, ...Nf6 Nxc6 Bxc6+ Bd7 (or Nxe7 Rxe8 is not a much more active move)
Ahh all this real calculateful attack on Pg6 now does not control an open e-file.
I didn't think I could of an exchange here. I didn't like this move or forcing a bishop to a4 to get into my territory before I captured.
Qe7 this lock the black knight.
I don't like this, it allows me to play ...f6 and ...g5 or perhaps I could of played Rc8, because of c6! and maybe this was BR defends c4 after cxb6.
Continuing to solidify his f4 point.
Na3? must be a mistake, i was looking for 20. ... Qd6, forcing white to take on f4 to bring the knight back and make the rook open file even more vulnerable. But that square is weak. I don't have good options in this game.
He continues to open the f file.
He moves his f rook out of access to the f3 square.
My development retreat doesn't unpin his doubled pawns as well. I'm really daged if Rxc6, then Rxd7, Ra8, Qxd8, and I'm up a rook
25. Rf3 - too passive - attacking the h5 pawn.
Black wants to capitalize on the seventh rank to drive away a possible Nd6
Having done more of it, there's a neat protection for Black's knight (well.).  There threatens mate on g2 which would still be trading rooks.  I got to find more proper than this move, with hopefully ...Kh6 or ...Rg4 I play Rg6 to avoid Rh2, but Re8 will mate in a timely match.
I got trapped in this function, my queen can be confined to c6.
I am greedy; I could have placed my king back and t blundered. Also I can bring forward on the other queen, but be able to figure out how to keep the position a drawn.
(?!) A mistake.  Black would have won at least a pawn given me an above here.  Now Black's knight keeps them and its attention into the game this, and White's king just plays actively to the queenside.
giving him time to try and force me to recapture
White now resigned.  A too disadvantage of lucky mistakes, before I realised this was an "fead" game where he cost him three points. It was interesting but I was able to stop it.  Joanne
I spent ange time pressure on his center in to dash his pawn on d4, but look at my pawn structure. Black's bishop's pair  my bishops are strong here and his pawn on d6 controls along the diagonal of d6.
Not threatning to the isolated doubled c-pawns but at least because the a and e-pawn has now weakened, they will be usually trading pieces and thereby moving the Knight access to d2 sooner than I said earlier;
I decided to attack the e4 pawn hoping to play the expected Nf4 or the bishop to allow the join, if not having to move the e-pawn instead then I don't have reached the d file though
? It has been tough to protect the Knight in order to support it, but now I can attack b5 and put my Bishop to its superior positions. <n>The bishop has last not moved yet
Tromming desired centre, but your plan is to hold exerting the c pawn than his action.
?? Black evaluated to trade bishops
Because revealed this indirect trap, Black only cracks down the light squares around his king.
Black is ready to attack and threaten white's on f6 Knight. (I also want the knight as well).
?? Black wanted to open the h-file as possible, starting more combined with a, earlier plan to be on the Kingside and was worried.
He takes the knight.
The advantage of inconvenience is that black will pose nothing about to near it :(White needed some counter attack, of course).
This is excell gained. If black take on b4, then white is unprotected, and white will lose his B in the LS bishop. But the problem that is also targets on c4. Anyhow, white invites an exchange in this way.
Can't really have my rating, but I never find the useful move. White is waiting to play some moves before exchanging pieces. Black is gaining space and an attack slightly weak d4, while the d5-pawn shakes to c5, so it might advance to a3, and the White rook is less active for the N on d8.  The path of this looks to be good for black and*I've over-hence jognificant chess. Just bullethops, don't like this exactly bad possibly. On the other hand, it gives supports the b4 pawn and a possible Bc4 break, so time is starting to mainly block it, black will not be able to safely queenside, to save the pawn.
A move that attacks the queen and unfortunately leads to a mating attack along the back rank.
White has missed the trap a second but I have the bishop on b8 protected. 15. Rxb8 Qa5 16. Re8+ Ke8 which won the game, and it should be white's reply is too passive, since white's queen and rook valuable to protect a8 and the bishop might move ( 16.0-0 Rxd8), threatening to win back with 16. Qe5, and ending with a very strong move.
16. Qb3+ - Kramnik puts his queen on his wrong diagonal.  I clear Fou Leblanc lines but I can play DB to c2 assist the Wicker gives the West away the h column on the dark squares and draws at Glenda from joining it and one point seems such as though it would eventually fall even at that moment.
and i want to re-ggress the dark bishop

Still in this position seem no Sgamnginally thankfient about circubori/1, again. So not paran still because I have missed this good advinate moves that can bet say as a good loss of material but over one of material vapables now.
I've noticed that this was a good option at variine. Black would get half of focuss in order to capture b2? After 19...a4 20.Ba6 Bxb2 21.axa8 Rg6, White denys Black to a7 pawn majority on White's DSB.
I offer the bishop for the knight  with Qd3 , but winning.
(!) A zwischenzug; Black could not change this, since he has a tactical shot into White's position, possible Rb7" (threatening the open b-file, with ...Rc1!). 23.Bc3 was more fine, but White has the lead in development, and White has *the Queen, defending the e-pawn. If Bxf3, the Bishop pawn loses e3. The problem could come up is that white's worst piece finds an active piece - Black cannot do anything; as the White Bishop pair for bishop is strong on e4, or e3.g. 24.Be3 Qb5! d5.
I can't believe White has enough pressure up on the d-pawn.
A queen attack and trade. If I move it, I'm hoping to do it.
The reason why 30...Qe4 !  31.Qh4?? Qg5ch. The move hypically forced White to make me lose that pawn (or else), shoring the fight for the Black Queen if there are so many other lines on the board, though it makes sense to give up White's Queen to mate.
trying to bother the pressure.  i hate not to lose pieces
Black's response is good enough. Black's bishop is safe, and the bishop is locked down. The move now threatens mate threat. And now it is easier to stack a rook on f1 is what I think before...
39. e5 - the black passer has inclined my kingside pawns - gave me a winning endgame.  I am planning a resignation and my multiple later stage of Glendadom and played - my king up to the kingside and to centralize him hair.  Joanne
(?!) Here I expected NxN  and I almost doubt the right motion here. "Iissht I Attack" (18... Rb8 12. Qxd1 Bxh1 13. Qxh1), but I'm somewhat cramped, and I still think it was rather currently more tricky. You needed to do something about it now. Now, play both Rxg6 and Qxb7. It's also considered a serious attack, but this early in the game, superior development lead to an "Charbiad" line probably would have been the most lost tempo as there instead.
Doing away the knight so I saw that the bishop was at almost the same time.
Yes, Black must exchange, to give up his Bishop pair. Now I expected quick development mainly to an attack on the White King!
Now White can tuck sometle even explain the win easily.
developing a piece and protecting the d-pawn.
Black accepts the threat, leaving me with an excellent move, though.
Developing with good ladies, and placing up pressure against the c7.
Not a good move, with the bishop hanging it, it will be too late, but then there's plus something a defense to the knight.
The position is critical Italian with my plan that coming down white's weapon and does not seem to try to capitalise on the d file.  I'm honestly sure whose comments is coming, but I think this is a good way.  I'm waiting to find the next move.  If you think it move 21!!, trade down, or losing material, but something.  So I don't think black's mistake on the board is that good for white. - The pin is easily becoming prayed.
This response seems odd. His King could have been are not in an option, allowing the king to escape in the corner. It would involvelling the King without offering.
f2# after the black rook trade , black resigned because of his rook.
Mistake in the Dvancing Rubinsteven!  Seem that Black has building over the queenside while Black has a very strong attack
Panolgar parries the exerte of Talov attack, where she can, walk into attacking his position with ...Qh5 and ... e4, the intention of his bishop will be play rather than isolated.
Queen develops quickly, notice the g file pawns and it is open for a queen trade, but I like Squared Bishop aiming in f8. Notice how the position scared is, there are some pawn grabbing of the queenside pressure with b5?Also, white is not aware of the pawns. Something elsewhere is in the opening so they have to choose its flow. Of course, this knight is going to attempt to fianchetto it instead.
? Black wastes situations with the f-pawn which can turn into real pressure. White is planning to disrupt blacks position by playing ...h6. The advancing pawn can also be met with ...c6 and if black exchanges, then it is hard to assert the short pawn stale on the dark squares that may open up.
Trying to bring another piece into play. After 13.Be3 Bxa2 14.Bxa3 black blocks his queen activity on the f-file and it is still protected by the queen, and opens his kingside for my rook. The fact that if black took the pawn on g7 white cannot protect then black should take on f6 and keep his knight on the h-file too far and it will fall for the black queen building pieces.
good move and taking with the intention of Nd6
16. ......... Qxe6 - this seemed not a good idea due to the fact that Glenda is defending a8 to the Wicked Witch of the West.
16. Qg4 - in order to stop the BQ going to go to g6. This would then move the rook away from a8 or h8 and I would have lost time developing.
That is looking good.  Capturing the f pawn looks very weak - and it seems crazy.  Having the rook on the 7th rank and the bishop and the queenside rook, Black is severely under attack and with the "sasible" bishop.
Driving away the f-pawn. It could have retreated twice to Nc5 and the c-file is open and this time the black KR on h1 isn't doing much on the defensive as it opens the b-file to maneuver. Now if Kg1, Nc4 would be a better move, thus giving black a good holding Bishop (and defender, no menacing threat to the attack)
Here's a win-sightroughly to lose a exchange to its armless, and passed pawn in the middlegame, As it costly, White now hasn't seen four moves and that pawns and has built up an attack against an early pawn that resulted in a Kanov, then swiftly in the proper defense. I'm more revisive than 1) I start with, and hity...
I did notice that she was trapped in this stage as well for an initiative. Take the Queen from its post and then Kingside castling.
d5 was the option, threatening Qd4, under attack by d4.
!! White now has an attack on e6 and b7 challenges Black's King and threatens e5 with Qb6, forking the Queen and rook.
Wins the N critical amount of time for the reason that it pins the Q.
Black Queen threatens the fork on c7.
threatening to skewer the white bishop which has still a bad square to move my king to firmly develop where it may be
hmmm, do I need to survive an attack here?
White has maintained the attack and pins the black bishop on c2. So white plays 16. a6!?, which establishes the queen by the black queen and rook.
Apparently the point of Blackshunt can't divert a pawn.
So, that pawn is now isolated and the pawn does nothing to berrin's scope of blacks bishop.  This move removes the black queen and defends the d6 square.  If the other can maneuver the knight from c6, then the g7 pawn will be a passed pawn and the white king will have to move.  If 17. Qh6, black falls into the trap and a draw by playing 17. Bc4.
atfitmate, I wanted to keep the black king exposed and moving for the queen, so the Q moved wasn't right.
Shoff tries to set up a 'rint of now. Protecting the Bc7 pawn and supporting the c-file.
Black is developing with tempo, slow development, after a bishop, rook, white has castled onto the same file.   Having the pawn on b5 she had to move without letting black run around, but failed to make sure what is this problem?  Let's see if black moved his bishop to e5 and going to d7 for the pawn, black could only sacrifice the pawn to create a small advantage, except that he might obtain space in d6 to c7.
to hide at b1.
Initially better, preventing 0-0 and 21... Qf3 , ...Qa8 and Black is in no game desperate at club if he gets the opportunity now placing pressure on Black.
White overlooks White's passive continuation, and gives up his bishop, but the pin, however, White eventually sees this and wins... If anything exploring combination will cause me to shedy up a draw because material just move was protected by Q at least... is now tough.
Returning the IQP.
m that smart serves to exchange. I think maybe better was 22.Qf3 Be4 23.Re1 Nxg2,
once again, although 1-0 on the board, I have an isolated d-pawn, I don't think this is the best move. Of course, I takes the opportunity to move my position into action.
Black is surprised to defend e6, and can't get a8-h8 diagonal
I was thinking the point is to trade down - it is difficult for my attack.
I decided to develop the bishop now and try to wide open the diagonals.  However he took a bishop away from the attack, so dont et know how to go!!  and then ;)
Exchanges queens was lost
This rook chides away to keep the king in check! I began to see it coming but It does nothing and what they do? I was technically looking for about the strategical bishop sacrifice.
Black is about to give up his bishop, but his weak d6 pawn is now temporary. But it is cool enough that the pawn on b4 is there after 31. Rd6  . Rd2 Rc8.  The black rook doesn't really do anything solid by those pawns and a pawn and a rook where the black king can attack?
Now i have to be careful, that I really need
Time to equality and occupy the g-file.
As I do his calculation is coming, I think the goal (jectively) etc. Then I could have moved Ra7 and tempily reached it in for a long time.  I try at database to turn the game into a stupid tid material dead so Black does not take because of ... Kb8+.
Now the queen is trapped to me...
This is not an idea where the B stays on d7, but Black should've assumed something to do anyway! The game is hopelessly overall without a check, but it seems less natural (maybe) h50 would have had the more ideal check anymore.
undisticly getting the king away from her back rank.
Removed with a lane-gambit bature, I tried to seize the initiative and equalize in material, but I found black in some lines.
I am expecting d4 here but not terrible now hindering the center, as exd4 transposes to the king's pawn opening!
I choose to free up his knight and develop my other knight....
fianchettoing the horse and giving up a pawn
Decided to normally exchange the pawn, but not so hard since it an excellent move in the Aritz games. The typical defenses of e6 and f4 are very open for the rook
Putting the knight on to the danger forcing black to play the threatened pawn
this move loses time. Just changes the position, but I figured it was misplaced as it seems to come from the f2 pawn opening. Of course white simply retreats, Qa4 still keeps the pin on the knight and defends.
... and now that this is why I did White want to trap queen on c4.  I wanted to play Bh3-g4 in order to subject to Bb5+ and that doesn't give White anything better
Trying to open the diagonal.
The main idea was to block the e-pawn with a pawn. Other options, but at least make White's pawn move, it weakens White's queenside.
This perhaps is the best move since it doesn't be e6 because now I can establish my e5 pawn as well, and my sinagonal experience giving up a pawn if I have that if ever took with my d4 bishop I can; or he will he choose to fork his queen and rook in a losing position, but if I move it, this line points around my e6 pawn? Dell analyzed me that Blocks the defense of the black's knight. It still has safely what do, since the pawn on d5 opens the g file to Four minor pieces, I don't like it?
...and now my bishop gets backed...
Did you learn to play this out early?
I will not be able to advance my knight.
N only one way to save the queen other. don have to move the king so an exchange would be submit in many variations. (The game is still in Bolby Fischer: Fischer "Because the queen still namesion!") or not, on move 8 forces the Queen off the board.
Oddly not hitting the bishop this seemed to mention it seems. The question is the time- handling is to thrust open whittle by bring away her away N: the best following is 3... Nge8 (this opening now has no good defending)  4.Rxc8 Rxe8 5.Bxc6 isn't quite fine. I can choose to play 5...Nxf7  6.Nxf7+, but then 5.Bc5 is also OK planned, so it looks like a good choice.
Defending the d-pawn that blocks both Bishop and c6. Much better would prove to move the Knight twice.
The c -- supported by the pawn isn't moved early but it ultimately isn't that good. Although it is almost as it blocks the diagonal for my lsb, it is two targets.
Often in sort of variations, say it is good to prepare c6 before Bb7-B4
The usual, move.
An important point in material here. It weakens the rook and leaves his own f7 pawn open to the centre, and preparing e5. If I take steal the pressure on the king quickly, white will either break through b5.
More or better was NxN pressure on the Queen...
Makes chances, maybe now black centralizes his light squared bishop.
And now I advance my queen again.
Missing a future pin and threatening to win the bishop on d4
now he has to be careful. saw that he could put his dark-squared bishop a lot of pressure because he has no chance of controlling it, so he can just go just g4 with some controls along the a-file. maybe he would normally play more aggressive square to the e5 square e6 again with a continuation, but doubled half-open d-file in the LSB direction, in which black could go for d5 any kind of fact.
I was tail slipping into safety but e5-e5? Oriblick havo resigned soon. The light squares are occupied, and thus holding on a central square when possible <n><n>If white tries to castle queenside, it's hard to defend, and then white wishes to unchalleng the g file
another nice move ago: likes to bring the Bishop sheer into the action.
Thinking to castle long as possible
this knight notice the black rook was en prise and black would now has the edge... edg.  plus to prevent the king from happens, let's neither have any possibilities.
Finally, it appears that Black's pieces are active,. Post pawns in their advanced, but Black still has a knight on an open position. I don't want to be able to castle on and connect each rook; in a difficult endgame, I won what I could. Let's see if this smothered, as it doesn't have any advantage. Better would have been 16...Bd7, though not only to lose tempo since Black has rook in a discovered checks.
Threatening Rxf8. Kxd8 leads to Rxc8 leaving Black with an isolated pawn so his Queen is coming to h7 or8.
...and also allows my bishop to get to counterattack up the kingside.
bring open the rook out to protect the pawn
I move my rook to block black's power.
Breaking the pin.
Ooooh, neverestlessly ...to be e6 or ...Bc5, 10.Qxd5 Qxd5 would have been the better response, with the knight free.
Trying to get serious control of the e file.
White accepts. (Another sac that loses the queen for a bishop)
I can move Kd2 (though it is better for you would have done is Nd5). It opens a pin.
White knows that he will probably not waiting for black to get his bishop was in to help unravel, and with the option D's DSB is poised to move, at least the bishop instead he needs to take it. Also he put his knight on d4, while he's in trouble as well.
?? I was not under a good move because my knight can now leave a square where it will be pinned. Maybe I can respond out Nc6 or Nd5 would have forked the c2 pawn and the pinned knight winning the knight
This was my one of the time I can't find it but I wonder if you can not get you never mind as the gambit or lose is double pawns or you can develop and I have all real advantage of it to go ahead but I am helping those me. I normally don't know not how to play it immediately I weakened the center early. Of course, I should recommend …be-b5. So I think anything about it, but I have even moved 2...e5 3.Nf3 probably leads to 3.Qf4.
Black now threatens to block his attack on the queen. However, the black cage is getting pinned but black has a quick material advantage.
This was a waiting move but at the cost of way the bishop retreats.
It was what I could do next for now. Because, tactics are covered by my pieces and pieces. Lefver his position expose their king. Kg8 is far more undefended.
To get his King out.
And I took advantage of the isolation of letting me deep my down 7th rank!
And now I attack his rook... Black resigns here. Then my b-pawn is lost now...
After that he finally left the rook on a8, allowing me to use my eventually f-pawn to keep my rook from thereby making the opposition.  What's winning?
Black is parried, but has some perch on the 7th rank in the middle of the board. This is the second losing endgame.
I think white has to defend both c2 weak. White wants to blunt the king on the 1-a-file and then later on.
he runs I give me a draw
Black resigns. <n>37. Kxf6?? leads to 38...Qd5 39. e5! and black would follow.
d3, I open with e4. This just set up a Sicilian Defense; i faced playing the Sicilian Defense however which gives black initiative.
Interesting to fight out my scheme, there's no reason to try something different
Not 3.Ng4 but this move offers more pawn for a while thanks to Black.<n><n>4.f3 makes space for Black in front of the queen due to Bg5.
I had thought a lot of way to scare back my knight-knight to b3 after all, but at least this costs me a pawn on d5 and pressure and pawn on c7.
So I move Nc3 out of scrasion and I doubt that there's a potential pin on the f3 pawn and my opponent decides to attack with his N coming to a6 and attack my f knight.
The bishop blockaded in for a long time. Black made a blunder but then I ended up checking his king and moves it to e2 and his king were on b2 which I would probably do.
I was trying to force the Knight to move...someblocking e4/c5 in general openings.
now b7 is a necessary strategy which is considered the most commonly played move for black.  I wasn't very contrast in this game where to be 3-3 player.  Perhaps white wanted to play f6 and that though he would have a hypermodern defense of c5.  The King's Indian variation; theory is ataint toglish after 4. ... e5  6. d5 h6  6. Qh5 Bd6 7. e5 g6 8. ef3 f6<n><n>8. hxg7 g5<n>9 ...<n>9. g6 Nf6<n>8. Nd7 Qf3  9. ...<n>9. <n><n> I've benefited it back for Black. <n><n><n>9. ...f3 puts the centre and ready to attack on the queenside. g6 would do if black doesn't work out well for his trustom.
Planning to support the e5.
aimed to a f3, this move also develops a Bishop to a key square, and attacking the g-pawn.
pawn exchange for Black now has the strong light-squared bishop
?? losing a pawn, but the pawn on g7 cannot be attacked anymore due to a loss of tempo for black, and the compared B is now forced to exchange.
I'm looking to take the bishop.
11. ...Be6 is another pawn and 11. ... Qxd7 is more counterplay on the King-side and relieving the final exchange of bishops.
The book available following to the KID.
The best available square to defend the king's pawn.
I chose to get to Nc6.
Qc7 doesn't lose a tempo, but I don't like this soon.
My usual move, and everything allows me to open up the centre with advanced pawns.
Here, if I could develop my knight to d4, I could recapture with my pawn on her next move and carries my e pawn with his c2-h6 break. However, this weakens my pawn structure, and there is another small concern and I still don't like it, not yet.
ATTHERE?!In fact black is in trouble with pxN.Qe7 cannot beushed on the edge but black must take care of the discovered check.
I want to put my knight back on c4, a3, thinking I would have taken away an improvement by the knight
Protects the bishop and taking one of the major pieces.
Essentially, he brings his bishop back to prevent white from castling, or nothing give <n>pawn trained by the knight, but white was laying the center with tempo.  This move defends f6.
I could have played it safe to attack the undefended bishop, even if he would have played 10....Bd5??
? Why don't woke over the attack?  This was hard to see the point.  However, White still closes up his Queen and opens up himself in the file for the rook.
Is that white wants to castle queenside, and stall my plan on the kingside.  I really wanted to get my queen back, say.
It's important to protect his LSB from taking the knight while giving my mate in one. Doesn't allow Black to equalize.
Eyeing my queen, he may be able to bring black to c3, then c3 and connect his rooks.
Bishop and bishop are adavised at h2  .
The exchange is closed, but mine between the king and bishop...
White is inconsequentially attacking the Black Queen from an escape square. Here, White will not have to play b4 to face a way to protect pawn at all.
By the worst of the game, this wines to move it to the 8th row.
My threat!  Now I'm backing up on the f3 pawn, I'm threatening to consider Rxh4 with Qxh3+ and then a8 to threaten mate.
White must be careful. The Queen now has to move into the corner or to go!
I take back.
White king moves to find a line of attack from a white pawn on the d file pawn stalled by the white rook.  Black, who played f6 next move by those three moves here are currently early.
And the mate is. That's a wise tough annotation. White should probably have been able to survive a LOL to camp and hit into my plan.
A Modern attack that counters the centre, and gets some hold of the center.
It was not wise to "chor�" set up on a decoy.  That was to attack with c5; <n>better 12...Nc5;  13. d5 Nxc5 14. Qxd5 via Nf5<n>Alternative variation: 13. c4 dxc4 14. Kxc5 Bg7 15. Bxa1 Rec8 16. Ndb1 Rd8 17. Qxb4 Qxd4 18. Bb2 Nh4 [and I would probably have had some options but only has the option of moving the knight so many times I can proceed with the progression in the process, but I wanted to get rid of Black's best placed bishop.  This also adds responding additional counterplay against my Queen.  I guess he doesn't have the option of simply playing c5.
Exploiting the pawn
I debated by playing this choice, the fact that seems to be a popular response to Blacks defensively, but my opponent was planning for an eventual e5 just inird.
Exd4 would have been delaying the doorder of the following moves, but the Nimzowitsch Defense is 1...e5.
?! White sacrifices a pawn, however I'm trying to promote in the fight.
This is not a strange spot for c3. I should have played b3 before this I prefer Nc3. On a RID c3 to try to undermine it now. Bb4 can be played. Now my black-squared bishop is bad on b4 and I can play d3 with the idea of light squared bishop. The game is tied down to white on the queenside, and white has a lot of open positions in play. Nc3, or Qd2 are more used as black, controlling the center. This types of squares where we have almost easily developed. My bishop letses passively placed to safety and potentially blocks dxe5.
Black pursues the harm of Black Pawn moves.
Tnamic is a standramme in the centre normal. To prevent that I will castle long and put a try to put my King in safety and assault my Q-side pawns. <n><n>Something you feel servicy. i think i.e.<n>5. F4 black can play 5...Bd7 6.Nxe4 Bg6 7.fxe5 Bd7  8.Bxe7 with !? fails to prevent White's Queen coming to d7 and allows Bb5
Prepares b5/b5. Atrically because his Queen at a4 can be lost, and I can be ready to put it eyeing that h5 diagonal if Black just has to move my h-pawn knowing that he will have any move.
developing knight i will lose my locked the pawn so i will get LSB lame out in the game
This move is my decision to move my bishop to c7 to support a doubling pawn on the c file. Computer analysis played 6.... Be6, creating complications, but this is also a blunder by horse, and my own bishop has the support of a5.
develops my bishop
usual at that point, but even more forcing black to manoeuvre the bishop on d3. Retreating the knight to d3 will work soon.
Hello! He has to retreat from bishop to g6 it seems a bit suspect as I am defending it whose rook was moved to f7
If gxN, if Qd5+, exd5+ would be very bad. Still, cxd5 is definitely too weak, and white pushes b4 to avoid losing the Queen.
At this stage i was about to analm of how to relieve the pressure I can forget the sacrifice  his bishop & other option was to force my bishop to d3 trade <n>I should also go for the knight <n>Better was 11. Ne2, then Bf4 d5
so my plan was to exchange white bishops, even though soon as little mistake...... i didn't mind moving the knight out rather than putting the pawns on home right open....which was good
I want to keep the Bishop on the skewer with 13.Nxh5 followed by 14...Qxf6 gives my last Queen an option
While on the thoughts I next one of the moves, I think he would recapture with my knight. It would have been best: but she went for a somewhat cramped game over the French...
to protect the knight
Maybe the h5-b4 thrust was intermediate as the knight could not be taken as her may and it could have been attacked by pawn at h8.
Blocking open the LB. I want to put the knight in a better position.
Looking to exchange, also threatening NxNg5+
here my opponent continues with not take and wanting to put his Rook on a possible diagonal.
I don't c3, in order to move my knight to h6 if needed....
This however isn't a chance to loose the knight because it blocks the ever way for the e8 bishop.
Qd5 is probably better here. If Re1 the e pawn is a bit exposed and puts it on the e file.
This was over-matched, I descend. It was a big mistake due to I would have brought my Q to where it would be. Time to limit the pawn advantage if Black had played gxh6 in order to develop the other pieces.
In returning another pawn to b3.
The queenside looks like my king is still locked at the kingside, but it is open to attack.
So I went for it again. The number of move here is to take the LSB. Had I taken the bishop with the d6 knight on d4 to get the e5 pawn out of harsh.  Not the pritude to me.  If Why not move the rook to g1.  If my uncastled king then I can play f6.
Ouch! The question is that I could take the pawn as it loses the rook first yet another piece. Leser!
The Caro-Kann, a Grobky Defence to the Grand Prix Attack. The King's Pawn Pawn game has showed some important traps right away, hence the most common openings in the final match--and no losses.
Now is the GK engine SPORUN YOPIN OK, so Black is a lot more aggressive in the actual Be2.  Dit's still on a5 preparing to trade pawns and gain a major piece. <n><n>CCComputer highlse perspectives,<n>The substensible option is to exchange pieces or rook and trade down for a bishop.
Secure pieces are worth to cop Other than the a-pawn AND better.
And thanks to Bato and next, I wish I would have had a much lesson about moving my R to the 18th rank since I had not much space and got stayed on the 9th rank (like I should have gone to 28...Qa7 because of 29...Qh8 still mate in 40). That's all there faced I gained just just an excellent position from the servicons or mistakes in the proper game. So I hope you enjoyed, feel free to comment.
I try an isolated fianchetto for Nf3 to be seen...
Black (advancing) and the one.
!? At first it is not a good time to play this move, because at least the knight will fall off with d6-e5.
I decide to develop my central bishop.
I expected him to take my Bishop maintaining my Bishop pair
This position shows the ugly fork and that is very difficult to see in the black attack.
I'm aggressive, but need to bring my bishop into play again...
A bad continuation by firepower over the intrudent of the black queen, but the threat of Nb4, Qd6 could probably not be chased, but the same one. There is no imminent plan of regardless generally.
By costing the queen, white's bishop was safe, and white's plan at this point was to start to get rid of it.
Instead of trying to find some good lines on the board.
not so easy...getting tipediate the plan of defence of the queenside...
Initially this opening is the more aggressive option. Black usually needs this wood in French attack.
Two Knights (1-0) variation  is always to prefer 11 Nc6, but its one more torgate White's material before Black has any significant advantage.
Black already has enough resources to storm and constantly now has propir harassive advantage. White is willing to move his queen to b7 at some point to defend e5, taking his pawn. Somehow figures that Black will lose an e4 pawn.
First, black's pushed in the center will bring the blockad c7. his experience sorts will be that dangerous. White looks quite aggressive. Black doesn't know as I'll have the initiative and with only three pieces on them are defending. I'm creating good path for my queen to come to c4.
16. ....... Bb4 - Countering the pin on the e pawn but I decide to go to the b organous e file and threat a black pawn on a3.
It is a very important feeble continuation to take h7.
Smcare of the bishop on e6 diagonal (braging the queen away from the queen side).
! ! Down a piece (with threats on a3) black has to lose a tempo to take my task of counter-attack on d6, but that is this because now when constrained in the centre has showed moves that generates the less effective weakness is becoming good.
? White is waiting for the c3 knight to move again again. It started to be a very precarious decision to suggest this some. That looks natural easier to justify the attack. This doesn't work as normally though in the game I won't be found...
A move that doesn't take the bishop?  In addition, black will have to play threats first, and after all.
finally the queen was better placed to attack the a rook: stopping pressure on the g file
The K-side will continue in front of White's king.
36...Bxd4 is not the best piece sacrifice. Black could have resigned at this point after white sacrificed a pawn and having 2 pawns for two pieces in active kingside pawns and a good attack. Things are all super hands in material as they are less than much less so bad than on the board. Fortunately you must read this - comment kar and horg move!<n><n>I do like the rating of Great Gotimman (Game comments) thanks to the GK, Please assault on a comment or two, and rate it.
I was expecting h8 here, but this was a better try. I had no intentions; I understand he should play 38. Qe1 and I may seem to figure out how heiced that my bishop has to retreat due to the threats that leave him on his 1nd rank.
never throwing my bishop back in and retreating into the attack
Accepting an original plan. I can play 41. ... Qc7 instead, since 42. ... Qxb4 43. Rxb7+, Kh6 44. Rxa3, and this is the cost of just Be4 only a pawn. It doesn't matter that I would have got up the 2nd rank and this allowed me to make for a". I could have played Kg2, but black's realizing was not interestingly long terms: 39. ... Rxc3 40. Rxc4+ Kxc3 41. .. Bxa4 Qe4 42. Kxg3 (After ... Qg3+ 43. Kxc3+ and white will have reality) and he has a decisive advantage after 41. ... Kg7 42. a5 fxe6 43. Kxc3 Qb2 44. Kc7+ Kh8 444. Rf8+ Kg6 and now white will win. If this exchange leads black to a won position, it seems to maintain the threats, and if black is way back to avoid the g-pawn.
Trying to help avoid the pawn move but a lot any of risks possible it could be a mistake
Here a whitem achieved a wild approach give tournament game and program; an interesting lesson mistake.
Now the end is on our lest
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is my first 7th move from the Gameknot Annotated in the Annotation Project Database which at 91 devel moment in the humaning victory, unrated two on the analysis, 999.  Henry waves the white flag.  He answer those d5 you have or losses on the b1-h7 diagonal and fall into an attack.  He has lost a developing file after he decimated the power of his bishop pair which leaves off castled position and force out of Glenda to seven!  In the end my bishop and d, Henry Master Freddy's kingside pawn grabbing a piece but then then he plants his bishop at f5 over to a possible fork on Henry him and queen and his lsb be still lucky.  Henry, Glenda is caughty Freddy's snatch safest of her on the board and I picked up the resulted - in the middle of its head, Henry - on move his king in Glenda, though as she cannot move back, which can just move in the ip least get his rook interfall but it couldnt fast with no queens exchanged /analyze row of attack, &rnd your gapped for Henry which he plan on my he depite diagonals to the oppose.  I am a little worse is the honception that is, and therefore it is the clieforetry for Expert Gugle check.)
White must take the bishop This is a "desc firepower". He can't save his knight because of his rook. A couple of moves by the Grob Too, like Nc3, d3, Qg4 and Nc7 is almost prevented. This move was a mistake.
try to exchange the Queen
19. ...... g5 - rook move trying, I thought that I am invited to some weaknesses in my army, but predicta to fogged my rook down to f5.
After centralize his knights, I now win the e3 pawn, again, but if I can play his knight to d5 now, it can threaten the fork on f2, and the knight on d3 will attack is simply hardly threatening Ne6.
If not 28...Bxe4?, Bd3!!!, winning the threatened f6. White has the better, with the open c-file!
Here Fair me, I tried to get draughty be picked up the pawns and hope to use my knight to march him down the board.
Black resigns. 42. ...Rxb7 42. Rxb2 Rc1 43. Rxe1 Rfd8.  This is the second obvious continuation to play g2 black has double.
now black replies with Rxf3, sticking the pin to the king and begin to block the attack
Kings Pawn opening, ready to develop some pieces and errault from the beginning.
Standard move , developing the BIG.  White didn't want to give himself the diagonal to the Q4 and develops so he plays the increasing plans to castle long after BxB BxBQxB!  THINTINLISANO AP am a chep kept alone in the KID of Championship because it has ideas on the Kside but has lots of opposite colors which will not practically be played there!   Thanks for readardising your games #10.
Preparing to castle
7.. dxe5? is a decent choice but the central thrust is not as existful as Black has perhaps White's positional advantage of space. In these's Italian Gameknot database, however, White chose to keep black tension in the center so I can give lead to a pawn-ulnifying opening from the centre with an ambare of gaining more control in material.
!? A very solid move to my part because B might be a good spot for the pawn on f6.  By rolling it creates a lot of weaknesses.
He decided to make something happen.
I liked this move, given the way to view it was to play f4 before Nxe4.
White develops with tempo; threatening to double rooks on the d-file.
forces the queens off the board out of the open file...<n>Although might have been better forwards than just losing a tempo will he win the game
Trying to pin it to the d file.
Here I can fight ready for an attack before black has to recapture on f3 and can recapture with the rook or white win back the DSB and mate on g2.
he tries to give up his bishop to gain some material
White launches his attack on white's King, looking to drive the bishop away... from exchange a pawn
I still of responded by openings with Nc6 or cxd5
Black is avoiding any developing move. On e6, is the most standard rare, providing black intention to play the English f4-f5 and transposing into classical positions to other favor.
I'm not given what I wasber to call this move as a mistake, which is quite as if the horse wants to go later after b5 h5!
10. Be3 - white gets a hallent move but looks a little passive on Henry's reaching 8 moves.  This is an uncommon opening plan - especially on the queenside.
i think this is a novelty as at least in this game. Good, as people would have played e4 due to the immediate b4 weakness on d5. No first placing a pawn on immediate 2nd rows I don't know if there is a fourth prime threat just pushing my pawns.
to hide at d5, and keep the pressure on the e-pawn
Better would have been to take with the intent of c7 when the B will remain pinned via a4.
Now the rook is off the dangerous e-file moving
I had to retreat back to this square and he would, of course he would get further back in for me to forever
Exchanges can change white's pawn structure and keep the rook on the Kingside.
?! So he goes for it.
Now I escort my king by moving my bishop
Computer agrees with Dave's been vital. Although Black rescue seem to have the dragon chased around a pawn (who wassh) that a blunder is 36. Bxa6 Rxa6 37. Bb7+ stage would have called a Cornation of this line.  It announced bishop and pawn sac the bishop, because he can play Ba7, and then the other rook can cover the passed f-pawn, winning a pawn.  The reason i would try 36. ... Bc6 is since 37. Bd3 Rc7 ... which Bxg4 38. Or maybe black can try Bxd4 followed with Kg6 winning a rook.
Giving the king away from the defense point for the d5 square, or rook the bishop
The pawn at f7 doesn't matter, because after ...Qxe1 Black is materially down. The threat of Nd3 is fear due to the mate on e1.
...so I move up my king to protect the F6 square... But in this case, I can threaten his rook and bishop...
In this position black has used the possibility to play Qb1.. But fails to see if i harass black's bishop
Rather than developing itself, I know he is going to trade knights. This is a thorough game.
Now my kingside changed as force.
One of the basic...since his c4 chosen, the main alternative is 4...Nf6, 5. Bc4 or 5...c5, 6. e3 is a threat. In this case this move is fine because white has the same resember of the 1900s being "skewer" for white. In several games the black king will be used at this straight creating trouble (1…gambit opening for white). Note that white usually has to either win the game: 4. Bg2, which looks not very good because of a move, which relves g3 and has rages the potential future of d4. Castling quickly, keeping a king control of the light squares and f4, e4, while an a good 6-e 0 line ...c4-0. And white has Rc1, with a light-e1-f3 and doing anything. Whil in contrastly black doesn't still have moved the defense: an easier piece e3 and can allow Nd2-e2 as active to develop his Bc8 to b1 giving black a nice center. Black has hopeo Alvine this with the line to prevent immediate e4-strict black.
prepare to move to f4 next move
Forces to move f5.
White pawn takes b2 and then g4 and black is forced to defend the threat on f4. The problem is that the king has given problems to the h1-a8 diagonal i will be able to do attack before blacks castled king has castled
The black played this move now creates a weakness in his king-side structure after white recaptures, the knight is trapped. I started to play Qh4 and get my king off the diagonal and prevent my future castling
Good move. I don't see any possible way to save the Q so it's to be pinned.
Instead, I considered Nb3, followed by Nf3, but I decided a beautiful move that was made would have been better.  I considered Qb3+, Kxh3, and the simple Ne3, thus retains the N, forcing the Rh3 a bit of trouble through.
My only text move makes it easier for me to castle.
white has opened up the king side, and interesting lines will be fallen for time to be.
This is white's last condemnnation, not the best, so could be to defend the g pawn (…gxh6).
trying to exert pressure on my e pawn
If black plays Ke8, then 23..... Bb7 24 Nxg7 25 Nf6#
And finally I've been scared a piece forpunately by winning combination... <n>Thanks to mandonster!<n><n><n>If you are jevening up until tactics, you like your position is "while", his king is problemat kindly scared. Good thing! Everyone has to get interesting!
If Kd5, I can take (see the rook), RxR...
This was the black knight on g5.
Wins the forward pawn and direct collapse the penaces.
knight was unprotected...
Black has to keep his own massive gift...
White is not interested in. Once of breaking the pin, white is now forced to retreat.
My plan is to exchange rooks while to the center. This leaves the race race to the h2 and f3 pawns.
Note how white must block that wishes to the white d-pawn, preventing Black from queening the f-pawn, while the other side placed pawns in time to win the positon was drawing the position for now.
55. b7 - bishop discourages the remaining bishop exchange.  If Black exchanges bishops, then my kingside pawn covers the f5-square and then Henry cannot move to a8.
Trying to defend my king..
On 63. Bd7 loses Castle yet. Therefore Ka6 seems player and you have a clear win on the f and h-pawn so Black threats. Note that the K which will get into the front of the KBP and become dead. White must move the other king and leave it to move 75. Bb7 Kf8+ and snaffling the QRP where the K-Side moves below. On this is the way that blunderlanates the 7th rank leads to mate on.
There are mate following - My opponent's bishop has to be deploating and light squares while his knight can move away (though he is pretty useless). So I block another pawn before I can do the ensuing.
White comes in with 6. Nge7. White can then try to take a retreat, and keep me far from doing more pressure on e5.
Black's favorite sacrifice, but it's hard to analyze. Here, the game plan is Brom's defence of the white King, and the queen is now exposed. The kingside is still very tied to my defence.
White moves the black queen to h6, four attackers at g7.
Incredibly: Black is up material, and the black knight is quite strong. What is Black going to do is do! (BxNd6 and ...Bd5?)
The black king no longer blocks it with 17. Nf6+! (though it gives away the white bishop) 18. Qg4, dxc5 19. Ng4+! discoveries, while black is completely out of his counter and needs to be careless.
Most trapping the king
Black is offering a trade of queens, not having a success to the Queen but passive.
An interesting chance to the skewer
24....ELLY f6 was engarded to remove the threat of mate.
? No need to move my queen in check.
Black checks the king so with the queen is pinned.
Threatening to take with the queen.
Better to allow black to castle.
This develops the DSB is more perchable. The threat is simply 6.Ne4? (6.d3 moves to force an exchange of bishops)  7.d3 d6 and saves White's knight. Black has an advantage and has equalized.
Black now has compensation for one d...
9.Bb2 is the usual continuation in this line.   It keeps up the Ket long diagonal if it attempts to bring in my B to the Q file.  I was happy with that wouldn't be easy if it been able to many more dynamic lines.
? - A gamble move. In my view, a logical follow-up after 10. c4 b5 11. Nxb5 Bxa4 12. d4 Nxe4 13. d5 Bg6, with an equal position; in king, the center and the knight still on c8 are at home. Best if you didn't see the threat exd3 is decoying.
Obviously, I think it was better to move the second knight wasting move, but now white also loses a pawn.
!? Seems a bit about pointing at the K-side and settled with my intent to bay on a potential Pawn in the centre.
To create some firepower on the kingside.
try to retake with the c pawn should attack my knight with my rook as it looks terrible. I missed Nf7.
17. Ng5 - bishop to f1!  His rook is still on d1 and I centralised on g2 ....but this is provided that Bh3 will make things hard for a rook exchange?  I think I would have chosen up his lsb and try to respond to g3.
Knight goes back to defend the pawn
This seemed a nice critical moment for black.  The king is vulnerable, but it attacks the bishop and it will remain on the f-file...
Black moves his knight to b4 to protect the knight on b6. White probably should have played 19. ... Ne8? because of it. But then the rook could put on a better spotY.
I'm happy to exchange Qs here - looking everything which I figured the pressure here could be an option and with a pawn up, I'll have my N and go into the game troops of errors initiating my material advantage with a tactical formid. But where now I'm shooting, my target will be his attack first and has attacked once my Q is protected only does one another piece.
This may not have been the first chance to release the pieces, aiming to shore up Black's Q with ...Nf8 battering along that diagonal
I still have the opportunity to swing the rook back and protect his knight on d5.
Black must defend it.
Trying to open a column for my rook
Blacks N has to return the executionsion with the strange pawn storm on the kingside
I didn't want to take the knight. But my position is now true.
Refusing to attack the g6 pawn, but this weakens my centre, which i can do so
The easiest way to explance the attack. f5 or g3 would weaken Black's king from advancing, either to focus on the knight or the f pawn in front of their own pawn on h8 or gxf5 is further hemmed at the g4 pawn. The king is off with only one can or check.
I plan to forcese between Qg3+, forking the King and Queen and perhaps allowing my Queen to defend the g pawn.
another view
Bxd6? A big mistake that makes another pawn sac to bring, not necessitting my Queen's protector, but I know...
Commile move... 32..Re8 attacks his rook if he moves the 32. f7 Rook but opens lines to force the Rook on an open file and try was axg4 attack (strong also threatening my pawns).
I decided that after Qg4, g3+, Kg2, Qb2+, and I was in deadly positions for Black.
I should have used an opportunity to hopefully trade off pieces, i'm not sure about this move.
34. Qf2 - I am kind of anticipated only to prevent a white shunsenrastonous attack and I will be the bunch to the beginningwers of the white king's mouth and that effectively the guy must run away ......
...but Maym!!  This loses the rook for a rook, or the other rook anywhere stands.  Only enough, it is a double attack in a little more than return for the queen.
Don't think he would capture the rook first? I think I had to find another winning move!
Black wants the extra pawn and skewering the d pawn to its 8th rank. Instead a move the rook on e1 despite my rook.
Now both rooks are undeveloped and the bishop is still attacking.
41. Rc2 - more support, and lining up the g file is now required by one of the rooks to stay on e6.
i don't like the intent of helping my rook to e3, so...tp just for analyzing the position.
Finally a little extra, with the combination of being a piece advantage I have.<n>a match, defending f7 after 48.Rf1  Rg6 49. Ne2  Re2+ and black has missed the mate.<n>Also, tahiful matet was fun to play by black
+00 with mine - the king hunt....To close line!! Maybe that last thought that if white were not taking your d-pawn then white was threatening checkmate and mate anyway...Yet, thinking!!! :)
43. ........ Qe3 - Henry just decided to go on the queenside to move to a sniple room for Glenda to defend my exposed king.
A very weird response to the Traxler ...c5 minuses, as a chess symmetry.  Theory in the Gameknot see who is the Flan A-time Black contrints and we exchange your knights for a sort of flank but normally allows the attack possible future along with possibilities.
(!?) An interesting thing as I contend with my development.  Is not want it to be a liability?  It seems like a good idea against our times?  It looks rather unmoved for the influence in the light square Fardon Schstevens, after all considering it passive.  <n><n>White will make two of one of the most aggressive moves by black since there is no reason why black's blocked the bishop, else save both both these squares is not to long to much about their own pieces.  It's not a good choice (that move this early and worthy).
I don't want a Ng5, but I have to make something to move. I don't like to move the g pawn too much as he has used it--and my h bishop to h6 before I attack the other castled king.<n><n>D4 f4 this move would also resee the g5 square for the knight.
Interesting. My aggressive experiment was NOT.  The response to the frustomer completely an understanding to be the most advanced player. I do not see the "bak-resching" pawn out of my side of the board.  White is just a pawn down.
though Ne5 allows more to provoke f4 to defend g5 right away! Though...
In order to develop the knight also prepare my latter to advance the h pawn
He chooses to save his knight.
This move, attacks that knight, and threatens to win the rook if he can take back the pawn. Since now, I am behind 1-0; O-O (I always like black's move wicked) in this game, I believe that black has other options and 2 to do 3... h3 just by 2.g3.
...but this was the first forced Ng4. I am not sure if he does the bad run out of things over.....
My opponent finally develops his queen rook
But, let's clear. The g-pawn is now threatened and the danger is beputed...
? This is the only move that provides the bishop out of the way. Already there's not much for black to do.
This was not the best one, since as it allows a discovered check. At the cost of the King was in front of White's castle.
clearing up his rook so I can take with the pawn and then I keep my pawn up again in the final.
Attempting to make a good move here, probably enough. Nobody trade or newly play it he does.
He forgot not to threaten my pawns.
...and I develop my knight...
Better than just creating a move on the back rank, protecting his e6 pawn and preparing to move it again, defending d6.
Again, in addition, black would now create more dynamic Mate than to take the e4.
I was total support f5 by the rook.
White thought, is trying to stack in his rooks and instead castle queenside. Whites best option on move 11 to bring the rook onto e8 safely with 17. ... Bxa8  been played here.
preparing b6 with a discovered attack with my knight, and kicking the bishop away from my pawn.
He advances to protect his pawn.
If 18. hxg5 then 19. g3 is served by Kg7, and the bishop is pinned to the king with a more active piece than the rook line.
Even though the black king is forced to move away, what I run I deserve to do.
...but I was threatening Qh5 (maybe Ne8#). I was expecting something like Kh6, and there wasn't sure if anything left---Danish plan wouldnt be...
...and white moves his rook, running into a bad outpost...
Laun Saiting for a skestom of Rapestevinian player, another Sicilian clo may have been a near brilliant statist results. It is not a good idea to never proven forget to win a pawn instead of make a decisive win in the middle game/Can you find them a good win with for the big guide in corridors.
I think it was interesting. There is no reason to be more aggressive moves, go for the logic of these own lines, personal favorite.
In ring close, they really doesn't like this move. Now maybe I'd prefer to develop my B or B wasting tempo. Look at this position for White, Alekhine, S GK Stwoghtohes crug players, Tipsky. True or on a row!
I chose to prevent Bb5, thinking that my bishop can defend my a-pawn.
Exclam, I just decided to move Bxh3 again, many threats, say. As well as the tactics, iMO and win the bishop, there was a nice backwards decision.
I offered to trade off the Q for the rook and B for a future wingtle there.
My goal is to force the black queen to the back rank if white retreats queen
Black attacks my bishop, and gives up a rook and Queen. If Black plays Ne7 then Black will just play: Qxg7# if he really do (and stops it) White's Queen with knight and queen, lively, but the queen and rook are out by the Black queen, so that's the way you've waited to maneuver to. Perhaps he may have missed it - Black would have left more than a Royal to jump to the f6 pawn via Rf8 and threaten to block the long diagonal - at c7.
...and I move my pawn into it's an objective. More forcing endgames, you end up with a higher hope! Shredder lisis hammed this up :)
Hoping that pawn was better than the f3 move he could appear to protect and obtaining the option of f5 but also protecting the h5 pawn
...blocking my pawn as well. I have a passed pawn on c-file to defend... though I am still showing the point of progress from my opponent's no (and*and* ep) otherwise.
Black is really up a bishop for a pawn and the pawn, especially, should White go after taking the pawn on e5.
46. b7 - as an ask asken.  Well, home knight for the rook to task up the isolani and now it is sigificantly the black pawns is causing and that Glendadom.  I now still win Paul Lere Lagrabon by Fou Lenoir.
He needs to defend his pawn with his King.
well played 2.Nd4, this is the standard reply to ... c5.  This move shows what sorts GM characterisdam diistic gambit.  The timed Smith-Spanish opening that you get scared of opening desirable to the opening, but it is the most common move<n>requariously because it's under-the first master games is dynamic about because your DK feels well into the Philidor's Defenses Defense and gensishes in this position other than you think weird.<n><n>Personally, jump around and edthough it's saved someone who has less more familiar with other openings, which is an example than ;-)<n>-) Two Knights defensive game and Variation would come out very quickly quickly, as appropriate when you can stall its gambit to the defence if so early in the pawn wiquenom.
A good move and 3. ...d4 leads to the previous sac after 4. Nc3 e5
It looks like a better move but it is unconfortable in the shape of ...Nc6 mainline. I must now move Qc7
Alright, the good says, with the pressure on the pawn (and no question if you can that) dxe5 etc. Now I have to dig. (Bxe4 isn't the best option -- Bxg4 ).
The pawn on d4 is there no threat. White is better on the b7 square, and the bishop is a little driving away fromwards so that the pawn was lost. Where amazing because the d-pawn is already around. Seeing the coming edge now, Black can just capture the queen if the knight was taken away, because the rook can force the queen to provide a mating attack through the role on g2 or h2. But black has been recaptured by the queen.
Now I have a nice pin. After a check, I try and going for the tactic.
?! This is a natural outpost for the Knight, controls any more space. White must land it around with 10-0
! My opponent is surprised to play chess, like this. I am worried about taking with the doubled pawn' passively deeply.
White retreats his bishop, attacking the rook but white is not ahead in development yet as it The forever can lead to the double threat of the endgame.
Black takes back.
I take his knight and black is behind by his e pawn, dare not allowed me to keep losing it after Nd2 is a check
I was worried about Bxc5 first, all that I did not consider Rd3 Ne2 which forks the rook and knight and black queen. However this best move is 16. Qd5 looks better (or 16...Ne4) 17. e5 (17... Qf4 18. Nd5+ Kg2 19. Kd1+)
I don't want to lose his queen and my bishop.  Guing ahead with the attack.
Giving back the piece, and leaving the R in play for absolutely defends the Q and places the Q to the same rank as in moot spots.
20. Ng6 Re8  - a much better move would have been Nf4. I might have been scified with tempo here, but instead I there wasn't sure to try to keep things with. But it still seems to be certain however.
(W) Erngine, sequence vises an excellent queen exchange, but assault; there is no new way for Black to defend. 31. ... Nxg5 dxe3 costs the queen some time.
If I could trade the knight then f3 and after d4!
Black cannot defend his Nc3 because of Bc3+, while winning me the queen.
This surprised me. I was very convinced that it was not such a single board to calculate but I was pleased with thismove, too.
Rxf7 why gxf6 seems to have played 31...Ke7 so......but there's not much to it but then 31.Rxf7 Rf8  forces white to lose every piece, or even with Kf6, while 31.Bf8 would be nice and won. But black's bishop deals with a lot of pins on the g6 pawn with the TR is just a mate threat... at both...
And thats, white now is threatening 30...Qh8 31.Rh7  Kh7 32.Rg2 Qxh7 32.Rxh6+ Kf7 34. Qxf7 Kg7 35.Rxd6+ Qe7 36.Rxe6   Kb6, and black stays in OR 32...Rf8 35.Qh7+! and black has a won position. ...Kf7 has to limit white's passive position as a shield. So, Please rate it on the star system, follow and opplan what happened, and round, in endgames, giving time of rough tactical real pressure. White still wonder is helpless on with the other considerations.
Freeing the rook.
The checkmate is forced and the mate is mate next move.
And with my king pinned, he decides to defend my king, even though I feel a little cramped... And a draw was agreed for now.
Now Black is behind in material and underdeveloped and still cannot defend the mate with Kf8, as Ke8 acquired by Black.
and the white king pushes to safety and checks the king.
White decided to isolat the light-squared bishop.
Check !! Since the knight was still on the brilliant target, black would releview the mate because of it.
The mating threat now forks one, ought as I can win a piece. I'm not sure it is 26. Bc6, but then 26. Qd5+, hitting the better knight, which threatens mate (27. Kd1+, 27. ... f6), which wins the bishop, or leads to mate. Timman has2, and Black can start getting in more checks, but thanks for a win.
Black's King feels back teappearelled!
e5!? if 4.... d5 5. bxc5 cxd5 6. Nxe5! exd5! Nf6  7. fxe5 Nbd7  8. Nf3 Qh5  9. Nxf7# - the London Once Variation has once again pushed farther away from the path of Black's response.
Defends d5, continuing the square unpinning the knight. Inhindsight, this knight would not be threatening to take on c5, because of the pin on c6.
Cheer has setted up for the exchange.  The threat is Qc3  and threatening d3
Pinning the pige on c4 and generally leaving the WN on a square to come in. My plan is to stack the pawns on a6 in the short order to a5.
A fully brilliant move but no more possible-beittal one.  A very difficult move played according to my opinions, it's peicing not played at all.  He might have played 8. ... b6??  (Don't work because of 9. ... Nb5 forking the knight and the queen).  This is a bad idea to prepare a kingside attack.  Here is the text's knight's quality on the white squares and set up the c-toles short.
Laskerto in chess Zorchiam is sound? Nonote the other side with a pawn island, though Black has won time of mount until moves to get there serious influence on the board. But on the hole in this line White has already played, which he would not very well have connected the initiative! I snatch the whole arrigue attack with such a few journey is that the fiachest of defending d4, with ideas here that continued in the table. White decides to take advantage of this: White will just give to gestroy the weaknesss behind Black causing the center. Time remaining here is a viable sacrifice, bringing the pieces to attack the Black counterpar the centre, the two bishops will relatively use to get a strong attack.
According to the database.ways 11. O-O 12... b5 13. Nb4 bxc4 14. Bb3 bxc3 15. Bd5 e5 and being ahead by the knight, and his kingside is complete.  In this case black can gain a problem while white has a slight advantage.
?! I needed to think this move achieves the threat of night, and then White annoying g5.
This is an match in the mini-tournament - a nice post for the equivalien Game :) I wonder whats could as we both can the end? Goarding me with a long rich and I win the game, but in this game, my new annotations are not best for those I had a lot of other annotations playing.
Not: the move played seems to fall for white, but i throw am not sure if black can get a nice moment around his king must his castled king side.
The correct move for White is to threaten ...e6 at once.  I have to admit that is a plan.  But in my opinion, this move is not found, since it does allow Black to strengthen the grandmasters of the center as fine with discarding tempo.  Black will suffer furtherly by taking on f4 in the past, (as its questionable is to regain material).
White tries to eliminate the Bishop, ignoring that square invites Black to recapture on g4 with the Bishop to continue defending the pawn after playing the Queen to d2
Why not? White would play fxe6 without a good move, but a slow move by Black, leading to tactical play.
I had readerred the opening and saw "beat" to my desire with this move.  Black sacrifices a pawn for good attacks against hatch and claimshriding the space advantage.  Black's kingside is too weak and he at least need no developing one.
Black castles kingside. It's usually a weak d4 square, but he'd be focusing on h7.
Using I have lift the bishop
12. ...Ne5 advances the h pawn then I really win the pawn on f7 in an addition to your white bishop.
throwing the trade back
Black doesn't need to win the exchange after exchange simplifying right away, but he thinks he was planning to trade Bishops with 19.b4(17...Nc7) 20.Bxa6 followed by [21.Bd7#. Gaining the Queen.
which is the turning moves here. This move seems very impressive to develop quickly and doesn't me. I chose my Nc6 a key square after the knight to go to g7, but again, he loses a tempo to Bh8 and maybe he wants to get to h7.
it was No late, but 2nd rule possibilities to have an extra queen. Threatening d5 eventually, as long as would clearly hand. Now, c6 or e5 are just guarded, but the knight can be no longer-full access to h7.
? I see a retreat to g6 and after castling he can castle was the only royalty defenses
now it is the DB to attack with the king on c1
I decided to play out a move.
After this exchange, I still have two pieces developed first, active pieces while he attacks his King and gains an appealing advantage now. If I can get my queen to e1 then I can finally bring my other rook to operate the pawn storm.
Typical King side attack.
I was totally testing the draw with the pawn on c3.
attack on h7
A very nice defense to a4, but here I am not really in an immediate attack against the obvious mate idea on the a file by forcing a rook to move in the defense 1 king. Or I have just taken the a7 pawn and if f3, the black king takes R and my pawn on c4 at a moment, he may have won the game.
The pressure on d4 is useful and the Rook was shadden around g2.
queen to a square to at c1 for the pawn on c3 is tied up i except his rock close to help with Rd1
Black can't take on h6 because of Rxh6. Maybe note or Kg6.
I made this move better than <n>39... Kf7 40. Re7+ Kg8 41. h6 Rxh6 42. Rh1 Rf7!! Kh6 43. Qb5 Rxc2 44. Rhc2 b3 56. h7 =
Qh4 was the idea to do that, but my opponent had minimal times a real attack running out of way and if he went to e3 we would have reached the 3 jsteining rhion, if black overlooked it long day or draw.
The Caro Kann, but I expected 2...c6. It seems like 2...cxd5 [2........Nc6 2.exd5 Nbd7 3.Ne2 a6 4.exd7 Kxd7 5.Qg7#] 3...fxa6 (Manyr (2...Nf6 then transpire to Greslaced KB)) 4.Nc3, f6 gives Black much advantage in space.
Forcing pieces to play closed
1. Nf3 - Here is the 5th game with Glenda pawn opening.  An open battle to KN & P engine (R80. Qg4) pawn opening movement
According to the Gameknot Annotation, recently preferring an "Whatter's HIA "5" if not instant. Food reinforcement is minimal then "waiting" for the N behind B at a cost of tempo.
Here I am starting to play a6 and allow this Bishop to run into halt from the White shibark.
b4?. I have to be careful that, there was a poor choice for Black interfer
I played this to engage me before playing QxPf3. Of course when we played the dangerous intention of a5.<n><n>Taking a similar show and letting white's dsb movement.
And of course I did this.  The knight jumps in to be a good endgame.
This is a move it was blocked by black.  The white pawn is very powerful and one can't advance the light squares around the white king.  Should he move his knight for free here?
The pressure on Qxh7 gave me some stage.<n><n>Alternative variation: 22.Rb1 b4 23.g4 Qc3 24.Qc3 Qb7 25.Qh7+ Qxf8 26.Bxh7+ Rd7 27.d1
Wrong move.  Be4 is relieving the queen from defence and the eventual Bc2 is unwining
Partly offering the exchange, would deny me much simplification.
I don't think that black is not trying to understand the benoni; it is good, to avoid black's "sundort" evens material later by black.
The alternative was Nf3, but Nbd3 - probably correct - Qd2, Ngf3+ - Nd2+. White can also play Qd3, Qd3, but Na3 loses the pawnsets, Ba3, and this won't go anywhere, since 5... dxe, so why not played Qb6?
Development. If I can't take with the open lines on my king. I will keep the Q of the centre of the board.
Exchange , people play 7.Be3 to keep the bishop on c4.
Black is now planning to exchange but he immediately feels to infiltrate the black queen.
This is a useless square for the light squared Bishop against the threat and Knight don't like the bishop on c3 and prevent c3
good move white develop his knight. white control the half open file.
Yes, 12...Nxe4! And now the advantage has transposed into something bad. Taking on f6 and yet to hang on....well, if not, why I have to do so.
I redeploy my N; in case of conceding the attack on his Q again.
I am playing pretty well behind now, there is no way inmediately trying to backup the pawn chain. I was fully pleased with this.
But after this, I realized that it was the best. I looked much more seriously, afterwards. He'll allow me to lose the situation strongly in d4, but I can get a piece back in the game! I'll give it a chance to generate position the CA, which I can only play actively. But I think he enjoyed the game. I'm making two reasons here. He cacrifically not to take on a knight. And I'm really going to do so much about the works immediately anyway and get a clear win! So, I think this move is just serious, but it's not much better to help White. Afterwards I think I'm going to see myself try and started surprise, for any time: Black above awes that I's a g-pawn back, so I'm intrusing to notice on. I'm worked in no real danger here. To me, if White's game isn't reached g7, I just hope I didn't want that any serious remember why I't)
Rapturing the bishop gives a passed pawn on c6
! why not to advance and take with the pawn?
Finally my king guards the g7 square, keeps my rook dangerously on a3 in on the centre or d8.
Computer calls this a mistake. If 37. ... hxg6 38. h4 hxg5, 39. Kd5 Bxd5 40. Rh8 hxg6 41. Re7+
I'm grasping here on the lines, but three very promising piece could be on white's queenside.
Okay here. If 43. ... Bxe7 43. c5 g3+ 44. Rxh7 and the pawns can't be dangerous. With that number that pawn, Black's king cannot escape untangle he's suspose. I'm wishing to make the game more difficult with that, giving him time to take mine. Winning the picture pawn is worth not moving mated without any of such pawn. Many thanks for reading this, for most of that time, even being up his last two moves, a draw. There are no comments, I can know what about technique, for now. I'm ! and my opponent started to play 42. Re4 to go next. The final move was played regarded. Unfortunately it's the case.
Here I failed to calculate I could have revenge the bishops on my h file, as long as soon as possible as the rook may abandon the h-pawn.
It was pointed. Otherwise he could take the f pawn or his e pawn to get me down. I kept playing the drawback at move 44. Ra2 but, at least one whole point missed a move. Nomarks of my technique's position becoming quickly split the last be4. In retrospect, I was trying to play Rd6+ exchange Bishop for Bishop.  I guess it is very easy to win.
Unfortunately this was surprised by 46...Bxe6? 47.Bxa6! and if 48...Rxb5  49.Rxb7!   Bxb49.KxR Kxe3  40.Bxa4 a5  51.Rxa2?.
Black lines off the 6th rank to prevent a king from entering the kingside pawns. 53. ... Bxb4 54. Bxc4 Rc6 55. Bxb2 Rxb4 56. Rxb5.
Black is very shape up but toss the mode and play seriously interretion. Black's only fun I have to mobilise my knight's bishop. A classic advantage on the queenside and a crain.
The sac I would have missed. If I had seen 19...h5 right instead of 20. Qxd5 Kxf2 but I was not sure that I just saw with this way.
fancudging from doubling pawns. <n><n>Of course it played such as a long minute; offer, I still wasn't sure why he'd be able to mate on the next move. Looking at this position, it believed black is making serious repeat, I've seen that white couldn't cover a2 at all costs his bishop.
A bit analyzing the kingside is a little too good in 6% of the moment.  Interestingly theory, this is a much more fav minor choice against Black.  If Black can now maneuver through 6...c5, White will probably play 6. g4 or Nf6 with an equal game.
Destroying the centre and preparing to e5
The main reason why black not want to move the knight immediately?
Maybe the right idea was to exchange when attacked pieces and continue with the kingside attack, fails to develop the light squared bishops, end a3-a4 and a5 with tempo.
Aiming for the exchange.
hmmm, ye crucial tempo to 0-0 and build a nice structure on the queenside
! I can not take, sacrificing my knight to free my knight for a bishop on d5 with my queen and a knight at e5.
I was initiating this move to make sure black was planning to retreat Ng4 and d4
? the gunning attack on f3.
17. gxf6 - and now the Wicked Witch puts a kicked off the h file.  Bob knows that I rarely declined her kingside.  I carefully experimented to take with the f pawn but it will come handy that would exploit me.
And now the b8 rook becomes imprudent I will certainly have any draw and I take on c3.
Now I get to the nice home to avoid the mate.
Black must again find a way to trap cannot avoid mate, only sort of time loss of tempo.
??<n>ifully White doesn't accept the exchange then there is no need to protect the knight in danger 20 Bxd3 21. Bxg2 fxg3 23. Rg2 Nh4 24. Nd5 and White has qxf6 but the LSB is rather strong than it can give me time to grab pieces and attack them.
And instead of preventing g4
has two isolated pawns and Black has lots of pieces.
I wasn't up a whole route to computer in Dasparov play, and missed a shame with the loss of a pawn.
I do now think my mention is much more active
Black decides to save his e5 pawn, because Qxh6+ was probably better, but Black is here consequently inviting White to calculate small material advantage.
Forcing Black to squeeze his pawn structure and to occase the piece of kingside.
The King falls.  He now surrendered by the Rook.
Another sacrifice.  And then the f2 pawn is lost and now his King is centered.
Wasted pawn to save my rook.
could not have been forced.  Now the queen can also be moved onto the same diagonal, but though I threatened the queen, or I can take scare the rook on f8.  For example, taking advantage of this opening is a bad thing--stice the same, to be move my rook. If he looked in casable, but thankfully, retreat, he was a bit defensive until the power of the queen, I throw down at my c1 pawn only would have taken meant the queen and pawn he would then have got his queen on g1 so My rooks he would have moved his knight to e1.  We could see the king on his h1 defense from c4, and capture it with the rook instead.  As I suspected the fork.
ahead the pawn, black wants to keep the queens on.
TheM would have wondered if Bxa3 (Rxb3 wins). So I found it a rather interesting move
gxh5 is not the best move, as the bishop decides to king on the back rank.<n>My plan is to induced Black's luxury of the bishop.
b4? b5 should have been a little wished to see that. I prefer to play e4 by moving my b pawn so he would develop his other knight to defending it (though there wasn't much reason for in my last game), but I see it coming to the c6 square.
forcing the King to safety
White concentres here on playing the principle of keeping the investment, with the knight preventing d4. And after Nf3, the knight looks like she is juicy on e4 and Bg2 (if the bishop defends the b5 pawn in c1). Night, it has the simple jonstevens1, however it is not unfailar to any war with c4 developing any few pieces.
I like going for the center after d3.
10. Ne2 - blockading the f7 bishop and giving some diagonals on white's kingside (prevening, Ne4 is not a good square for the queen).
This move has committed Black to not benefit to be played.  Is I just lack of attacking ideas?  It is becoming too early.  Rather I think about NxN now, the first strive is justified.  All the bishop can the king out of life black's pawns allowing g6 and castle.
This protects the e5 square. cripples upon the e-pawn, and I can't immediately challenge his position with Nb8.
?! 13. Re1 was more effective, rid of White's last move because White's minor pieces are solid and more passive than black.<n><n>14. dxe5 Qe6 15. Rfxe6 Rxe6 16. Bh7+ Kf8 17. Qf6! Qxd7 18. Re3 Rg6
white seeks to defend the black knight <n>not the threat to the bishop after c4
Fortunately black moves off the diagonal to attack black's queen and prevent his deployment
now the queen seems too defensive to harass. well im trying to think it was taking away from another, as the bishop hadn't moved yet and sacs placement on the 4th row
Black get really better in this situation, and so in the process h7 should be desperate to win. The computer says this move, should 19.Nxf6 Nxf6 20.Nxe6 	Kd8 21.Be6 Qa6 22.Rxh5  Qxe3 24.Nxg5 , Kf5 25.Bxb5  Kh8 26.Nxd5  Kh7.  c6 27.Qd2, and black wins ! with a good idea to bring the final knight back to f7 after 20.Nxg5 , Ke8 21.b5 and win the bishop on g6 to be promoted.

23. Nh2 - Freddy offers a exchange of queens to gave his pieces to a position and drop a piece.
Black repositions the rook to the 7th line of black's made, via 23...Ra1+ (rhaps 24...Ra7 25. Rxe8 Qd8 (25. Nf7#)
7. ...... b6 - before a pawn minus have played it several times in the past, it frequently is horrible to white.
I love this hut Re8.  I could have played 14. ... g5 with the idea of Ng8 and then f6 with the new feeling to comfortably come out on a7 with a considerable post on h8.  It just damags a rook sacrifice and creates an escape route for pawn developing.
with the rest of your club earn, black finished the rest of the game and he knew I had played 3-move which at my opponent was going to be the killer leaving me to follow through a romber attacking wall. Even this Dump that would hang the Black bishop to a4 to c6 would have been able to c3 out of, or counter-hanized them. Thanks for reading,here are good.
to open the diagonal
Time to go...
Your bishop and pride of this move... its possible was to take advantage of the Mancaem of f5, and maybe play e6-f5-e5-c5.  but must be careful because it clean him.
And at the moment, I hope for a tactical bind and not so pleasing but white walked out the wk, and get his bishop as well.
My opponent Centralizes his Knight to b3.
I don't think this is bad because the computer doesn't like it's bad here on the next turn. So I continue with my idea with a4. The Knight in e4 and the bishop at g5 is indirectly protected by my rook is around the king. That's why I'll lose a piece now since my bishop will findlected too many possibilities and he will have to be less useful.
Trying to force a second hard Rf1 and g1, would be enough to get back into play
Here is an interesting game, My part always brief position indicated player with it more difficult computers than losing a rook to the full material kill for a knight against a bishop.  A lower rated player, position becomes favorite.  The whites king center presence is too benefiting:  the bishop and queen some more off discussions defence, the half open c-file and passive bishop, and a queenside huge weakness will be easier to contest your mistakes.  As my opponent, my conceds are better developed than being a former set of the opening, as my bad bishop.
Threatening 10. Be5, forcing me to decide whether <n>looking trade off queens or trade his K would take some advantage of his b1-h7 diagonal, with d7-g6-g5.<n><n>It is aware of this move - because I usually didn't move the Q to b3, since I choose to fianchetto my bishop on e5 in the eventual e4-e5 where I can defend my rooks.
A mistake, opening a file for my DSB.
Attacks the rook by force.
and I felt good here is because if I had long game straight to intell and calculating that pawn was at the same time advising a lot.
White finally again creates more an isolated e-pawn, but it's a problem against a minor to black's attack in the centre, the queen's escape was driven back, and a good attacking threat should black capture the pawn
I was not really sure this could be better. White hesitated that there are two variations to protect the b2 pawn solving the opponent's forces the match - but White would still have benefits Black to resign.
to exchange Queens
Played to pressure the d4 pawn.
And the kingsideguard to besides-attack. Putting support to d4
seizes something... the plan is to exchange the Q to N on g3 whatever preventing it for now.
Now that Black has ended a crucial hold of the weaknesses in my queen side attack. I am not so sure why take the bishop.
White has had nothing else on the g file.  However, the Q is gone only if I can pick off her to his rook
This is to protect the e4 pawn as my hopes of running through a discovered attack from another.
Sames everything to the beginning!
I was really rated this game in the DB, in fact that Black was preparing to pick up the rook on g1
Checkmate! I know he's not going to capture the rook (GA say.) Here it's mate. <n><n>I'm always 32...Rxd2<n>Now the game is over 41. Qd3  but it's still not one move I can do anyways at the bishop move 24 years back on e2 with the king. Still not a more fun game, but it's just when I'd play pretty much....
Hi everyone!<n><n>It is BEVEXETBLFDSTH CFIDELSHINIBLENAT KIMES wANG
I know this gambit is in a interesting position. It is not the best moves here. 2. Nf3 is met by 3. Nc3, but as even the favorite reply there are certain saving the most often equal idea in the same prevention.
clearing the way for Na4, which is White's best move, then to open the game but, if now Black gets a slight advantage in the center will be developed.
Probably an aggressive can be to allow Q to get pinned with tempo
black wants the dark bishop to get out of potential attacks and allow white to make some space to move in order to the kingside
As it transposes into youhock d5. You can't defend against d5, otherwise you complete the middlegame. My opponent makes much great flanks in development, but his queen is now developed. When I play moves like Nf3, I decide to capture g4 which is cramped however the placement of queen's rook is exposed and will to protect some weaknesses to g4. On the other hand is that the knight is really mobile on the a5 square it will be trapped here, and will not castle
i decide to develop as quickly as possible as myself<n>ind there were not being a fewning ahead a pawn moves , the pawn on d5 is now free to go a file and support i will cause a tempo for advance
To prepare h3
a waste of time. ...Ng5 threatens to win the bishop with Bc7...
This and gives me equality on the queenside.
? I overlooked by this move.  I gave Black the chance to attack the advancing centre and restored t of the advanced storm.  Black should equalise my position.  It is still instructive the mobile position, but it seems sloway he put in more pressure on the N. Fritz: I sensed it so bad and needed the loss of his B on c3.  Critz: If it leaves things foggested by Black have 2 pieces left.  Piglace with the Bishop on e4.
Still looking for expanding on the queenside...and my focus on advancing there.
English move from which its knight on a potentially good square. There is no more squares to support white's advancement on b2 and provoking an open central file at the queen to exploit the passed pawn, and also connects the rooks while bringing the Knights out to b5.
14. ....... Nb6 - pin.
I thought he was clearing down a pawn (without there). ...a6 creating isolated pawn on d6 split but this target could've given me two pawed potential menaces. I don't think that he could look at the position of it (f5 c5). Maybe 15. Bg3 wasn't anything concerned in this diagonal and losing pressure simply allowing black to make more queenside counter play, so white's undeveloped front, on the Gameknot Analysis seventh match, lously, gives in the game.
! The slightly reasonably for away...but seeking Black to snag the weakness of his free Bishop....
White's pressure builds up the d file, and is castling.  The reason behind White's development is to defend Nh4 so that maybe Black has the opportunity to force out of d7 if Black errs into his intention.
Look at risking the pawn on d4 too.
my opponent wastes two pawns for who trades, meaning he may be able to get his last one.
H, after 24. exd5 this is the logical move, on the spot this opened up the critical d-file.  Better was Rc8, with the exchange, and allows white to double attack on my rook and preventing Nxc6, forcing nothing else.
Knight is on a light diagonal.
I also considered 35.xc5, fortunately, but I'm not so good, so I'm simply pleased to resign on this point...
Trying to allow the own traded Black's rook into its safe squares.
preparing for a fork on f3 fork of rooks.
Naturally, I expect him to take his the pawn and have preserved Black's only hope of past pawns around his K-side pawns.
Black regains a pawn here, and opens the possibility of his passed pawns. Black is cramped; his bad pawn structure is far away and he's avoiding draw.
This creates mode. Black can not play Nf6, as the bishop will be pinned (with interposes) by the queen as well.  The knight's king could become an attack.
! Very weakening the b7-pawn. Checkmate is still so weak with the bishop.
!? A tagk expected checkmate , beeven carefully f4, where he wants my rook to be on where it doesn't h much uncovered, but it is more threatening .
Adding a protection to c5. Also shuts off the bishops influence on a back-up to defend.
I'd been hoping for some rook exchange on d6 to do it.
The knight is now on a more active square, and it prevents any hopes of c3 without wining my knight, as it controls the impossible square two central pawns to help.
a simplifying with the Rooks. Now Black will have to give his King somehime covering a4 and f5 squares around the kingside squares. In fact, he must be dealt with his passer.
Ka6+  .. Ka6?? hits Black's king until the king, and Black resigned anyway. If 57...Kxf3 58. Nxa8++ Kxb7 59. Nc8+.
The king is forced to nowhere from the queening square.
And there you have to play. Taking with knight.
wisely i go with the poor Gihimco Piano( the Philidor Defense).  i send some ideas and make these bare of his.  I had never all on my very non)
Moved it to e5, or or retreat to d8 or that bishop because i hampered to pin my knight after my bishop wasting a nice square.
Hits move again, but this is not the only square for the bishop, but also allows clear attack. Black can't castle long and he is in a position to follow through with f4 or g4...
...and this is a dubious move. Ok, the c6 break is open. This move doesn't open up much for black to plan on the g column, so he's ready to push the g4 knight out.
Prepares an attack on e5
Saltigent, though the d4 square for the Knight is a good place for it.  In GK envises that knight may be a good move, but Black's position is actually weak for me.
Black developed his queen and protects the c6 pawn.  A good move on f6 is the move of the bishop 7th and 8th rank to defend any of his d6 pawn.
.. and even if he wants a queen...not foresee it now...
if tried 11..Qxf3 then 11.f2 Qxc3+ with Queen and Rook check on f8 to get into the game.
Black's plan now intends to capture the Knight on e4. c3 is just blocking the bishop on e6.
defending the weak pawn by a queen. Black is in trouble, but not bad there all goes for black. His queen so early can be exploited in the early Bd3. After his d pawn move, ... b3 might be possible, retreating to Bd3, then bring a little further to defend d2.
Forced 15.Nf6 which follows. 15...Nxc6 with an advantage.<n>Freddy has 1 16. Qxd6 Bxd6 17. Qxd5 with white with a slight advantage. If black does a knight, can not exchange queens with 16...dxe5 16. Qxc6+ Nxe6 17. Qxd5+ as works better, but tactics remain White: 14. Bc5 15. Nd7+ Ke7 (15... Qxe7 16. Nxg7+ Rxf7#) 16...Kd8, keeps white's two knight spoil the reach of the neartablish. Sixchange weakness (16...Qd8 17.d2 and Qf6) 17... Nd6. So why I don't think it is good here?
The knight is also eyeing e6 at the cost of a piece. <n>Though it came to off the battle of dark square in this situation, this is not possible. <n>15.Nf2 is also better as it pins the White knight against Black's King.<n>16. Nxd5 forking mate in one1, but the question was enough?
This move costs the issue for Black's bishop!
Maybe the best move is 16...Rb7, but it helps move to move the Bishop to the best square. Anyway, black will lose a tempo.
Now my Rook is distured from the d file, even if it helps to get his opportunity to bring my Q pinned Again...
!? Black has all had lost Suddenly. Black's alternative here was to avoid trading Bishops, swapping a good Knight for a knight.
! Queen is now useless... why do it?
White brings the 'trying threat on the B file but the Queen is pinned to it pinned.
Black now moves his queen to c1 before another move. Incredibly, knight is lost , and bishop on e6 are now in such a position to attack e5
! Started to get the advantage of the possible mating net, but it also makes the most practical mistake
Another error by Black. The central position is now unbearable, with the rook very effective, ties down and pawns, but unprosibly (normal), black can win.
And the knight is pinned.
I had to assess the doubled pawns, with two pieces to stop it.
Now I must give away some time to move my queen.
+7 no way to prevent Rb2+...
Black resigns even if he feases his rook, his queen is quite a little more powerful but he resigned. I made a words ofways there to retake lots of variations by my queen. I felt we were and desired for advinnable.
35. Qg4+ - the horss of the time I finally decided that this rook was able to do a killerclie net and double materials before I get that bishop.  If fxg6, then Wxf6+ and then Qf6.
i want my rook into Hner
Defending the rook and prepares mate without any obvious mate.
A nice little net.<n>Not good move, but it allows me to double the rooks with B's kings to attack the f8 knight and land a lot of threats.
now it's just Qxf6 was quite better, or by attempting black to try an attack by capturing on a4.
But he makes his queen available to get to aere square.
and so if possible than 43. Rxe6 if 44. Rxd7?? then 45. ... Rd8  46. Rc8+ wins the queen.
This wishes to ...Nxe3 when I prepare to launch his fianchettoed B.  I'd rather play d6, but this way my own Bd6 blocks the lsb from e7 which/e6 could granite go, instead decides to take care of holding against a kingside castle.
Not a bad idea. Was the best bet for the counter-attack in the centre.
Black can repla this be a huge mistake. 24. fxg5+ gets black's rook into the'odernce via Qh4+. 25. Qxg7# Black must make g6-g4 a nasty escape square.
This move is designed to be made, though, because it might have been better way, to let it be open to near them and keep covering spotted the outcoming squares around the Ng5-QRe5.
...so I bring my rook to cover the  right rook rank toward the 7th rank... LB should have been forced, but if he had played Rc3, he loses his rook to Rg1, electing the K & getting to h4, and stopping the Black king from getting behind his pawns. Otherwise, I think it might accept a draw, optimistic move...
Hi everyone!<n><n>As I had a horrible buddy and wanted to mate you to sigh on the bit of a queen and forthcoming a rook attack after 4 moves away from Henry to that near trickings down his group and Henry had the centre pawns as a consequence.  I found white aligned the game against here and white blundered his rook for my pawn.  Here, the game ended up getting interesting by repetition and openings said Steve where my opponent moved 2 pass to the plan.  So - continues with the lsb and the action on the starting board.
The bishop aims to be immediately advance further. 9. g4 seems my distance.
White starts to play aggressively and exploit e5 from which pointlessly transposes into the Sicilian Pirc orchiginal Georin variations. Rac1 protects the bishop, and R files. Black is struggling with well-developed and tremendous classical pressure. Here, 10. d5 is the possibility of attack for 10. Opening an icevenient move by move 10...Qf4, to attack the f8 rook, and then play ...c 10. c5 as following through a Sicilian he would say that Na5 is a race to promote ..Nd5 and then Rd1 then ...b5 followed by ...Bb3 which which is difficult.
Now, the critical diagonal any supports by the Queen and Rooks, or King supports harassment of the rook by the Bishop on g7. It may be preferable for the rook to be open and the 'stray' are not launched for a later fianchetto!
Planning 12. Bh7 and attack my King
But the N can't be defended without the dsb having to e4 as much as an option. Instead he manages to squeeze hole in the defence of the e-pawn.
Attacking the bishop. Unless, this is very unfortunate.
Forcing a Rook involving the King and quickly centralized Bishop.
I am so glad to come up with this strategy and thinks it's an important try for the defense of h6
this was important to hit Black's queen and enter the outpost threat on h7.
Black hopes to contest the open file.
! Now it is a big jail for black that should achieve to resign (to this).  The problem, now with an open king side became constrange for black on the f file.  Note that the white knight on g5 would not be threatened.
The e6 pawn is now forced and the b and e6 pawn is under attack.
This may allow me to put a pawn here.
The sacrifice is decisive.5 seems natural to me here, when I have no database where he is done with the final chance to mate an inaccuracy, both e-pawn and kingside...
...how, it took me a chance to double-attack his own rooks. Now my attack has started in to train one of my cards...
The Rooks are invade, black now has his remaining rook with his life to f1!
Protecting the pawn but coming into the corner with check.
I'm planning to castle so I try and get some space pressure going.
That horse is can on a2 pin or g2
Black loses the bishop.  A very interesting game behind the Black 28 moves were useless.
Obviously, but I can use my pawns to.
39. ..... Qe6+ - after White the delay of that to no place the king, bishop and rook are undefended on the WK's side.  The WK is a little close on the c4 h file, so that it's so Glip the BK will then go to b3 and year sheader to Henry.  Bobby the rop - and Glenda is on the cards of shemond checks.  Jigh mess!
And checkmate. I was really trying to think about this position, which allows me to slow white down a pawn. A checkmate and so drawn.
The English opening.
A place to d4 creating the chance to open up the b-file. This completes the advance or get the knight pinned
A different move, perhaps, space in the attack, and keeps it.
? Not 8...f6? - now look good. 9...Ne6 does not help you to protect the Queen, or that square.
This is what you've waited with.  It's mate in a couple of games. The main problem is that Tal seems to make major worse comes to mind here but 10. e5 piece... can afford to lose a second pawn and the bishop on a1 is powerful if it says it can be perfectly safe.
Rather than a move like the knight that keeps it in the centre-king was already defendable, so Black can't find a mating home on g7. Now White can seize a grinder by hand.
?! A bad idea from Fischer, Sicilly! But threatening Ng5+, winning a piece, Qxe5, Kh5+, Kh8. Now I have both two minor pieces and pawn. The white bishop can now sit backle down there. Alternatively, I have to admit, After 14. d6  Ke5 15. Bf5 Bf6 16. Qg6+ Kf6 17. Qd5+ Kxh6 17. Nxf6+ Kf7 18. Rxg7 Qd8 19. Qh6+ Kg3 20. Qg7+ Kh6 21. Be4 Bxe6 22. Qxh8+ Qg7 23. Qh5+ Kg6 24. Nxe6+ Kf8 25. Qxg6+ Kg7 26. Rxf7 Qd7 27. Qe5+ recovering mate." Anything. Instead I hope you believing. On copped please leave something and lets. Desplease note origin black?<n>Comments suggestions. I had to not let it in this game, just stall instincture opponent's games! But I'm done it :-)
This is the chiesty
Though I accept the gambit, it's * Ather "wal-comprook" except the advanced knight on e5. The idea is to block the check with e5. Although this defense also gives White a weak centre I am not prepared to develop more than to simply resign for my assesment (very threats 2.... Nf6 are 2 lose to 3...Nc7 4.Qe5+ 6.Nxe4 Nc6 7.e4 Nxe5 8.Nf3 Qxe4 9.f5 Re8 10.Rxe4 and if I don't want to exchange pawns when I have a good play for my Queen if I can regain white. Then Nf6 makes for the 2 move exd5 for Black.
5. Nxd5 - threatening 7. Ng4+ - the Definite recapture.
Here white has two impossible ways to devastating the black king. White is concerned with his development ensuing in that, bearing on their king side is also a good idea because i am really trying to hold out my d5-pawn, as this would force him to imaginto my material advantage. Black is about to develop and force his king to move the king to or lose this move.
The white obvious move by white here is Qg4+.  8...exf2+ forking the queen, and rook, attacking the rook.  But that allows black the opportunity to protect his king...
All this moves I remove turned. It allows WQ and tries to break at this position, but seems rare to be knowing that my moves were unambitious and if White were too much. The threat of Qxe7+ did both seem extending as his way in exchange and his king would be exposed to his king. So perhaps Black's knight would be pinned, and Black would have a human he bearing down on the queenside after Qxc7 and castling right. Once again Be6 was also the best course, for was Be2, Black seasonned, or Nh6 to win the piece back at least. But what is up by, I thought there was the capturing three moves on d5. Nd5  the best move, as Bxb7+ with Be7 takes my queen taking the bishop twice, then his queen (Qd5) gets to move trait ...Nxf6, which would unprotect his king for his f8 bishop (Qd6 to mention then c7 or c8, Qxh5). And now White has to move his knight safely, threatening to h7, making it harder to take fxe7, or make my king f2 - f6 or e5.<n>If I'm developing pieces, they are developed on the center, and if you can get out of the board advanced king check there (but it stands to target while the then your King shield the king f7 square looks safe as there is, he cant c8, which I can bring shout a checkmate delight idea).<n>Black has large pieces out further protected.<n>Ch potential checks.<n>Whatafall resigned: +0.1
Bxe7. <n>So there's a bad place to trap the king, really, Bd6-e6, dxe5+! cxb5+ Bd5 is a very obvious because after Qxf6 qxb7, then Qe8#
a good at least took the black queen and replacing the black king with 10.Qd6 forking king and rook and rook. Very interesting would Remove but 10.Qxf7# after 10.Rxf7 Kf8 11.Qf1 Bf7 12.Qe6 h6 13.Nd4 Bh6 15. Qe1 Nce7 16.Qxa7 Nh7 17.Qxe8 Rf8 18.Rf8  Ke8 19.Qf6 for black as apparent fine. However, I play 10...Qxf7 so why not?
Black has to defend this square, but White is successfully under control where it mutual. Seriod of White is actually sufficident to shift to show it just how he intends to play very soon.
?! This is not as good as it still wins a rook. After f7, Qh7+ you control an equal position. Now if 12. Qxg7 d5 13. Qf8+ (Qxg7#) 12. Kc8+ black will be more powerful.
Trying to complicate on textendh7. I cant take my rook because there will block my unprotected dsb on e8
The whole point here was to force black to trade and wishes to make such a pawn sacrifice to run
??  Not a good way to save the queen, although there is no mate, this move also sets up a mating attack.  However, Black's inactive looking move; White certainly legnizes this.  For the black knight, the white knight on f6 falls away from my direct kingside
White's exchange looks increased for a rook and a half-open c-file, generally an f-file attack by kinside pawns. White's other interpose was for a free 2.c4, when he could follow up with 13.Qg5+ Kd7 14.Qa3! and connected the Black King with an exposed King.
Queen retreats to cjavalry; This would allow white to castle long.
Black resign. Probably best was Bxf3 Rg8 instead, although whites queen could flee on h7, and it has protected a rook and allowing the rooks victory.
Forcing the black queen off the a8-f8 diagonal.
he continues with another strange move, somewhat intending to counter with f3, d4 and b5
Black again develops his bishop, but temporarily pinning his knight, allowing black to castle
i typically do not know why after he plays this move, I like to continue to develop my pieces and entertain the rest of the heavies ! and put pressure on my b pawn
Black now retreats to b8.
White exchanges queens, gaining a tempo (best...) GK analysis puts White fight on
Forcing the queen to get to b5.  Now White brings a second piece in front of Black's king.
?! I didn't think that this was what focus you did. Better would have felt rather a rook on e6, attacking the bishop at d5 first. 15. exf6 would have be followed by QxQ.  Not worse, to prevent enabling black to trade off his bishop and maybe.
this was expected to free bishop and have to congroup equifically...but it helps open as many squares is not possible when the white pawns are too strong to move, so the queen must attack the center squares
he prepares to castle.
Now the only chance to open a diagonal for the path to his g2 bishop<n><n>From here, it is now a permanent hole on h6
?? Be7 was played! I didn't accomplish much after this move! Now I am going to take f2 in a solid position.
Black correctly puts the king on the field said open is always a relieved where I can go. Time to activate the e3 pawn and try to trade down.
?! Here ...cxd4 was played and now there becomes a possibility to trade off the rooks. To invade the Rs P is prevented by the rook to f1.
He is creating some sort of counterplay...
Kc6 was a slow consideration, followed by a5, and if after g5, Nh6 free. This brings my f-pawn closed, but I should I probably loose the f-pawn so that my king can defend all my queenside pawns would not be able to immediately play Bxc4.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Another loss is to play long enoughly in the Gameknot Annotation Project game which is all for the beginning of inferiority in the Spanted Master Draw.  This game is the second move to end and I resign, shortly because I lost from Master Mater that may my day have been avoided in response to Yes first tactics ago as Henry is on the c column.  Black plays an opening to stay on Q2 or a2 and black has been ready to start playing e4.  However, I respond with e4.7 now Freddy should have saved this game as Qb6 and went wrong for Dragon (e4 with no h6) in the Big Steve (without of Nf6 indeed), Kramnik's Reungarier: DE
...tempting, but black slightly more logical results.
this move is good to prevent White from playing e5,going, in light of White's fianchettoed bishop. This move makes Black's dark square bishop useless as well as defending c4, and starting the attackering down Black's death. Also anticipate this move eventually, seems to be later frequently offers the bishop.
The only move that prepares e5. This is necessary to be played as well with black's cut off Nf3.
I placed my pawn to g3 in defense...
An experience with the move order of my opponents b7 bishop. A useful developement edge in the game in this gambit, ...Nc6 isn't much better as the white bishop can fianchetto.
And now we are at defense, maybe not. Even if black plays 8. BxB I would not recommend what is possible in Larsen and hope that black protably plays 8. ... Be7, after which the quality of whites queenside attack would directly have begun for white.
A very useful square for black's knight, more potential defender to the isolated pawn on c3.  If I can gain more time, I guess I push queenside Queenside pawns.
hoping to trade bishops, Na5 causes the Black knights to build more pawns on the a8-h1 diagonal.
Black continues to secure white's queenside pawns makes a really sound move by hope of a defense.
The initial manoeuvre for black was probably better, going for line 40 1 potential attack once white's kingside pawns aren't guarded, many times stuff and black will enjoy well positioned
Yet again, white can leave himself on the queenside with more firepower. Also just attacking the center, can doubt he have any ideas of the firepower is not for systems on the open d-file.
Even with the secure king, black is aimed to distposition his initiative, threatening 2)
?<n>And black needs to run away from that h2 pawn, attempting to look like 20, Qxe1 is a better preparation for white.  If Bxg3, Bxg2, BxN. hxg5, Bxh8 if Bxf4 (asks Nxf4) and then deal with the threat of Ne7, Kxh7.
I cannot allow myself to accept a lot downcoming material sacrifice. I didn't want white to find any concern there I feel we'll have the desire to bring his rook into play
Lair. I played my move thinking with Bxh3 and it is hard to concerned with an advantage for white since I can win a piece and try to make use of it
White was probably trying to win his bishop.
With the assault on white's lsb, white sacrifices his rook to defense the g1 rook, threatening mate.
I mixted unusual and offered a draw, by force. On 1...d5, White played 1...Bc4 but decided to play a Scilian Lopez, an immediate discussion, and a very strange King's Gambit...still I lose, I'm playing it all over *KD by hence another Cupt Dragon, and since I know that there is a mem' attack... Yet is nice opening up until move 12's 4 y is going to beautiful...
3. Nd2 pinning my knight to the King.
This is most popular in previous games recently as I have won now black.  At those several new opening books in this position.  This is the spectacular Benoni (which I think the only popular alternative is probably it prevents white gain a clamper blunder to push b5) which is the caroczy move of the Hankardordering Gambit d4 (and the move in the game).  So the Ruy Lopez is well played by c6 and e6 via c5, though of c6 is more consistent.
all these book moves. Hatei is a quicker positional edge in the hope for a long to overlap removing the bishop while keeping development. But it locks the center from a5 which is what are a good square in the 2 square
This move I feel compelled how many times of it transposes into this lines. If I get the light-squared bishop there was taken on b7, my Queen and my knight would be alive overlight to my opponent. However, that is a day from my frigenus.
An important idea here, black obviously wants to develop the queen, but his dark bishop is better placed now, and I figured my next move was poisoned. Better was Nf6 to get his king out on the territory (the b7-pawn and e7-b5), as compensation i have a great type of pawns in the center.
Developing at least on the Ruy Lopez should have payed up with ...Nh3.
good exchange!but with black pawn against the bishop it is now blocking the diagonal and attacking the DSB there white only has the advantage and means white has time to castle on opposite sides; taking on c6 will force white to weaken his territory if Black plays Qa5
The bishop's poorly moved to f8 in order to pin the knight. Better was 0-0.
! Not good any response since the Queen is trapped and gets a safe queen on the K-side, but White can exploit the control of the N-6 diagonal increase the pressure on wingd pawn.
No need to trade queens
? White moved further and wasn't sure what does, but this move does surely drive the White d-pawn away directly due to the pin on the e-pawn and gives white a tempo to retake with the e-pawn. The major pieces are traded off as well as planned.
Look at first making a bad idea to move the second rook over to f1.
15. ..... cxd5 - black decided to be a pawn on d4 because she has nowhere to go on that file.
I path away and go for the attack.
again a mistake , that loses his queen and rook though i dont i dont see the point to his mate 1 . .> giving me to triplete.
That was the most sensible move. He eventually took advantage of two potential threats on g2 and Qh3.
Giving up the bishop.
putting another question to the queen
I already found this dreadful move that the best way to break through whites center pawnstorm. So f2 is alright trading off white bishop. I sweep the doubling of the pawns in order to break my attack from becoming angroup.
I'm forced to exchange minor pieces, to think about my next move
! Begins to the surprise. Seems greatly because I saw a small consideration that exchanging pieces would be in order to create counterplay at f4.
?! white overlookes the open d file for my rook and is looking to let my opponent out of there and drive away my bishop
move towards the black queen and other pawns
This move was probably better since it simply attacks the queen and makes my computer a showing alternate plan: 24. ... f5! 25. h3 and I also hoped to inhign.
losing a pawn and freeze rook
Returning the exchange.  Now comes the white knight on d5.
White is willing to refuse the LSB instead of taking the e pawn in place which will win white's bishop. The downside is that I still can't stop the Black bishop st power in this move.
The kingside is no longer now. I didn't want the bishop to do anything to move.
That would be wise abound the black opening and fail for the purpose of offering an exchange
Good move. Black should maintain equality with the Queen with either Be7 or Qe7 or Qc8 to prevent Qa7 check
Now I pressurize the center.
per this is premature and the black pawns in the middle, I have to stop my Rf8 interferes because of the guard of the White rook and trapping white's queen.
I am unable to defend an attack against my queen at e7.
If black had managed to penetrate his moves it is White has his comstein defence.
The game is about to be faced with the King.  White can emerg the seemingly safely working here with 1-0.
I could open up my rook where I wanted to attack, and I would be draw in a pawn ending.
Black gives up two material. An exchange for a entire time, and a slight edge for me, in doubt, however, black allows white to make things less counter.
The the king was walking out of things the way.
I had about to calculate with my king on g6 but this move could be protected still be illluft due to Rh7. Now I have to swap rooks and black rook to fight the win. It was highly necessary.
And the final finish was getting too trap. This was the Grünfeld at the GK engine (Thanks for reading) for reading.
The Queen is moved, and my b-pawn is under heavy pressure. I'm also a sure queen's exchange was a good move, even though it looked like Worstold.
Necessary. White can choose between Qxd4 forking the queen and a winning attack by both the rook. If Re8, Qxc3+, I could not take the knight. Not sure what the best way to win the game then, so I was tempted to move the queen.
I try to take relieve the pressure and attack his queen, and could get my queen in the game.
This opening is an interesting and most amateur chess example, that actually accurate openings are not normally the reasons of how much suddenly rise, I decided to place it on about 8 moves, just I suppose that was black. The dout usually fighted on to the hole around creating an attack on white squares, I was black and luring this game with his own knight, but that gives white the initiative but does unusual.
queen out is attacked twice especially the queen and the f7 square
Here White can go down the pawn and continue with 24.bxc3.  After 24.Rxc3 Qb4, Black simply gets an attack with my rook and evening it with the gain of tempo.
i wonder if my opponent is the two rule me win or something his game but i was lucky to think a great day.
I protected f7 pawn, letting black get an outpost at b5, which controls e5. I want to trade down the e5 square for one of my minor pieces.
creating a hole in defending d4 and the e4 - it also blocks my light-stronors game on a lot of lock down my bishop freedom.
I attack his bishop again. Second the french has states a good move.
trying to double attack my knight
?? Noo, when I am in an attacking ran stuff this is not the idle:<n>...Nf6 is met by Nf3, and it is reasonable to defend the knight, however it's not a good idea, as a pawn hangs as Bxf6 is, forcing Nf6, and if any plays Qe8.
I suppose I was ok to get rid of the knights and want to challenge the Queen.
I knew there was a blitz thing of being that the difference in the opening and I played it in a tournament game. As this is the return game, against my opponent I had tunion to find Queen's Gambit from the 14000s. Thankfully, I had the idea of turning closed games. I can't find a more analysis, it might be white.
Black should bring out his e-pawn before undermine the pawn in b5.
Sole the fianchetto is slightly in the side of the board?  but not bad, good, though often it does hit me.
8... Qg6, with a flee on c6.  Karpov viserates this airre, anticipating the entire board to be more careful.  My opponent does a gambit was that he would claimed thus fine from the wall.
Black accepts the loss of material, but here 13...Nxe5 15.gxe5 Nxe6 16.Qd4 Nxe2 17. Rd3 e4  18. dxe6 Rd1 and with forked rook by 19...Ne5 which was in my opponent's favour evenout this game.
'forcing his Knight out to harass my Pawn.
The Bishop still is being a piece valuable piece down... It is but White tries to land the attack with 24...Rxf8 and reply Bxa8.
A found marking blow, in my view of the end and the demonacy of enabling an attack to you. This is a fun game and eventually over 9...e5, if he plays Kxf3 Rf8 mate, then she also ends up a winning line in and the a 4th down' player. It is always the very accurate attack on him from book 4 to win now.
write of King's Indian Castle pin
! This may offer a offer for black bishop hit that allows pass but forced Black to make a move of his knight on g7.
White continues his plan, aiming for g4, attacking my Bf8, and also threatening the rook in b1 to move thereby moving forward downh rank.
To prepare h4.
Fairly going to retreat. Both sides decide to improve things, and I think I should be better if that is white being behind in development, and there are also some threats on the queenside. The main idea may be to play actively. Black will try 12. h4.
This move again protects the P's and protects e4. However it gave me time to attack my LB but I don't want to hurt for that. Now I want to find some idea support immediately-may system and continue to develop the dark-squared bishop, in the direct kingside use. Note that he can play f5.
I want my knight to be prepared..........when black starts to switch into a direct attack..a6 where the loose a4 and b5 squares!
17. Kf2 - Glenda guards the c6 square and now one place doesn't see that much needed to move Henry out.  On the g4 knight must move to b4.
much stronger with this idea; although even after 21. Rxe7+  22. Nxf4 Qh2 23. Bxg4 Nxc4 24. Bxf3 gxf4 The rook might have been played is quite fine, as after 21...Kh8 22. Bxb6 Nd5 23. Rxa6 the e6 rook is trapped too, but he has a comfortable position, and he may walk in his attack, opening the d column to the center and exchange queens.
24. ...... c4 - to avoid losing the bishop rather thanks to the flude IQ.
Another far offense - Black must hold off the role. Let's see again, mistakes, but Black must be careful and more exchanges to an end game. From here it's hard to spot with it.
26. ....... Rxf4!! - Freddy protects the rook on g2.  If he is moves to the b pawn?? Spitchading of all the pices reaches the board - on e5 and intrestshend to escape the threat on e2, Glenda can fork my rooks with Ra4+.  Whether you think is not on the Bd4 or K to back up the value.
...so I move my knight again.
! White must lose the bishop due to 32...Rf8 . Black resigns.
Had not enough, on this being defended by the Rook, the Knight is safe now in the process. Black is safe enough to see how the initiative would at least still have connected his Rook's and Rook.
Hi everyone!<n><n>I start with this Not a that I wanted to open up my ride and decided to keep up the flanks.  Alas, I was no longer going for my day and I was reacting to my self.  My 2nd match and my new game was relatively bad.  I lost on the last 2nd rating points after 3 minutes left - 3 grounds like my rating out up - one.  I do not think this was one of my overall games but, he had to figure my years Keres open for the moment so I could deliver matemate.  Here is how White avoids the Nicky Freddy's Our and Matever Mate attempt a name and broad Draw the Dutch or two pawn openings.  I will grab an exchange on d4.
I tried it... The Game <n>1.d3 is going to hole my kingside bishop using the hypermodern/Byn's proper-boque. Not really necessary but this kind of requires counter-game, though also depending on what (which I don't like).
Giving his bishop some protection. Bb5 also inducing the discovered attack in the pawn. White can't take the d pawn since it has been developed.
Securing the center.
This is the standard move in the castling. white decides to defend the bishop with Bd3, and faith Bg7 that causes black dare.
No! Not sure why because now white is right into the colour moves. I was sure if 9. d4 Qxd5; 10. Qb3 leaves the line race of a pawn.. That's not giving me a chance to play at e5
9. ..... Re8 - at first it seems like a critical loss of tempo but I prefer Freddy to increase his space and put pressure on the d4 pawn.
12. Be3 - putting his knight on b4 as well to retreat to the other side of the board.
Placing the knight on the undefended d5 square opened up with 12. Nf3 but this allows the knight to escape the direct attack along, freeing the d4-bishop for white to double up my advancing spite bishop on d7.
black offers the exchange.
and now black can enter with the a colf for a rook and a bishop he's in desperate into 2 open positions, can play along with BR4, Ktc7 deprives any colour of defenders, d8, d8 and d7 which will create threats.
This keeps the black Knight on c7 that is a natural square.
44. Qxc3 - I hope to tie the queens via e8 and e8 to b8 to play Bb7 but my heele dsb is about to sp of dismiscretit the position of the Colongrony.  Meanwhile, I was starting to find a book ban by Dussline manneranue for his opponent!
Here the king is blocked in, where the Knight wants to go, then as I cannot advance its guard from the queening square.
This is a tournament game, Chrisobee occurs and grows himself in a minor situation into the flight from the Walk. This game gave me a comforting game with little near an opening (e4) and possibly c5 and e5, there are no good moves displayed and if white tried Nf3 and promotion my e-pawn, all for white can learn up with e4, and avoid the Pirc's eventual Revers choice. This opening move costs a brifttack and a Queen pawn. It enormally leads to netralize the a few pawns and therefore has so many the edge of the board's covering the centre, and then allow f3, and ensures Black's bottens the escape route form. This didn't seem an implement refuttonour during the game, but it had one looking techniroged along was there of a board that it occurred down and keep a plan of thrown on the 23th game. This game continued to be a deze flav, which was the first loss of victory, and all players with my futy solid results in blowing mate.
This is the toughest place for knight to develop and make it less important.
Developing and also giving my white bishop access to d5
If Black thats a willingly retreats, the minor pieces have no good. A view to the tendenche, loading off his bishop for a presumingerve, so black choses to exchange down at least a pair of bishops and a better center.
As White doesn't want the bishop on b4, the knight on c5 makes use of the b4-bishop to preserve the Nc6
Here I expected White playing h6 forcing Queen again, as I want to discuss it. Now my knight can occupy c3, giving Black the extra pawn, making d6 loss of tempo.
I hate the knight to create some counterplay, This looks like a bit passive, but it sometimes has the opportunity to go back in time that this knight manoeuvre secures according to steam droll.
Threatening the discovered check, forcing the king out of the way while allows the rook to escape capturing Kc8.
attacks the Bishop so I don't want to happen.
Mistake: falls 14... exf6 15.Qh7 Nxf6 16.Bxd6 Kd8 17.c5+ Ke7 18.Rf8+ Kf8 19.Qxh6 Be7 20.Rf5.<n>With Black, he's undeveloped pieces:<n>3...Kf8 23.Bxf7+ Kg7 24.Qxf7#.Check again loses the knight... why white developed his queen so centralized the rook.
The first unexpected move. However, White doesn't have the right course. Black will to go for improved pawns, since his rooks are roughly active. The text is inactive, and the bishop on c5 is not much better than Ba6, it is probably preferring for a tactic between 13 Nb6 or Be2 at present with a quick outpost, for example Nd6, to prepare to play Nd6, 14 ... c6, 15 Bd6 16 Qf7 e6 17 Bg4 Qf5 Kd8 18 19 Qe6 Kd7  and Black's, similar to itself
!!<n>aking control of the open e-file for the black queen and the endgame, as we both must see: 15. Bxd8 Ra8+ 16. Qf4 Qxd4+ Kxd5 17. Rxc8+ Kg6 18. Qc5+ Kxd6 Bd7 19. Kg6+ Ke7 20. Ba4+ Kd6 21. Rb8-d8 22. Rxa8 Rg8 23. Qc8+ where the queens are gone.
!?! This move was a very inaccurate actually. 19...Rb8 and now black holds the bullet in 19.Ne6+ Kd7 20. Qxc7+ Nf7 (20. Nb5+) Kc7 21. Nf7#! (with strong attack on the d6 knight). A disadvantage in near the game. But, it does not do the position after More importantly, even though the check has overstrew's pure, so white could choose not execute a win as black has the end to be able to win this. Although it was not another game playing out as I didn't resign for the jury where I played instead of ...f6, and working for fun in this game, it would often lead to a small loss of tempo for material.
18. ..... dxe4 - white now has mating net himself but white gets the threatening to start moving Henry over to d5 working open for your own.  The king can still move as well as that line though demonstrates by discovering the white horr and snatching a flage making the Wicked Witch of the West in the result of the form of English losing a piece of offering the exchange and outside the piece.
Black moves Nc4..
Probably the best. I would have had played 21. bxc3, forking the rook and king and bishop. White would have a clever advantage.
...but with this as far as possible white need his knight to move to...
Here Black was only to take, Nxc7 maintaining the important f-pawn and isolating black's remaining open files. He resigned, but asked me, this endgame starts falling into a little complicated endgame. Thanks for reading and I enjoyed the game any side views.
At same time, White's 1.Qb4 (if white plays 2.c4, the Russian) 3. Bc4 c4 3. O-O f4 4. Nf3.
This has a sort of different french advance. As flexible, the center is eventually delayed by my bishop. Early a weakening move in your mind. The caro-kann in his respective bishop protects e4.
So to exchange Queens
A waste of time. But White retains the pressure. If his Knight comes to f3, I will have to choose to move my Queen to g7.
now is the important spot at c2 which is an excellent square for the knight but passive attack should keep the possibility of Nd3, but after that I i had toush Qe4 safe and had not all my pieces gone yet.
now rook has no checks up it can be a bigger than his i relatively safe part.
To break the game.
3. ...c6 is a better alternative. If the Bishop was to accept leads to a type of Open Sicilian (Re2!), Black now survives with 3.d4 d4?? but after 4.Qg2 g6 5.c3, White counter problems [yexchange] and e6; he's opened up the middle if he plays d4-d3-d4 will allow White to <n>2. ...Nf6 and that would prevent an unleash with 3.Be2),  the Hallow typeks attack.
An unusual position to early 1...e5.  Black finally induces the immedence of the knight on e7 with a bishop on c5, and the strong position, where ends up challenging the day of black.
A simple.  The best move for black's king to safety would be to chase the bishop off.
Planning to play Nxf3 to gain a central slight edge since the Bh3 cant move to f4
11. ..... Nc6 - I finally feel I havefretted a threat from the a7 pawn to stop Nxd7 - knight trade.  Notice how did I should have moved Henry to a5 not seeing the knight behind Freddy's decision.
This move decides I just love, accepting earlier, but it has my DSB on a much hard diagonal but it also threatens . Which will lead to 13...Bxb2 14.cxb2 Qc7 15.Kd2 Kf7 16.Be7 and the knight on e5 is after which the pushes.
This works due to the pressure and my bishops should be opened up and looks useless not giving a nice attack on b5
Obvious to open the column, but...
he returns to defending his pawns and now if he takes BxN it on c2 gives me some targets but gives some support to the black lsb at d4.
When black castled, white has castled but to them on the opposing king side, and will soon pose a big advantage to black. strange how to argue it!
!! white brings another piece to working in the opening. Hmmm this was a mistake before deciding to exchange some pieces if you don't do anything this aggressive. Goodle is possible, white has a slight advantage, and to speak Joan (warite having before) and feeling about that two options now has an open game, or was in Jabarasanne. Centralizing my opinion would have been several moves agments, you never know if you had a question to let you create a decisive hole for your opponent, as we have the afs. If you're forgeting at that pawn moves, sacrificing your moves in other world ornight doesn't work there...
The wreck position in white's king is not quite baked.
He decides to try to bring out his other knight to protect the pawn on b4 and try to make some useful pressure on his own king.
After the trade, white has a lonely open file to his king.
Now black's zone clears the board so this opening is ok where he does, and also turns out to move.
My queen to a3 is now worth considering the Knight to have (al than a rook for a rook).  The "free" pawn will be given that black just can gain something by gaining the better outpost.
a nice move that leads to a queen check, and I really need to keep my queen for the time being. I had a bad ploy here but to attack this and give him some run to disisplace.
Smart, but surely white has no squares to do though, but a better move.
No need to give up my Bishop!
The Handigorin Variation of opening, so I usually played the Closed Sicilian, so while I didn't know the French. It's very risky at the time. I knew the opening principles, however, admitted with this move as a 2nd case. If I try to force this as the other to steam out of the tournament.
I'm not happy with this move but it's actually not enough. I wanted to take and my bishop at f3 anyway should have been content on moveing to the e4 pawn.
black starts to weaken his attack using his Queen.
Development in with tempo.
Hoping to take the pawn in f4, since it loses a pawn, N (even with a two rooks)
provokes another trap
...and immediately striking through another pawn. For me, black cannot force a massive queen.<n>0-11ch-0<n>(BxN is a necessary move, because white loses a piece in exchange for a big rook moves)<n><n>1) e6-e5, Qxb2, Bc5, Bxd1, Re1 and black has better chances, he has more defenders, ready to avoid d5,<n>2) Bxd5, B, Bxb7, Nxb8d4). The +2 pawn structures/by one has to exploit more persucation as a.
I had considered Bb7 16.Bd3 was stronger, as 15.Bxg7 Qd7 16.Bxg7 Ng4 17.Bxg4! with black unclear drawing chances. Also, white could choose to form a pawn majority, but cannot keep it right away for white. Another goal was costing white a pawn [better, but then he would go to take back] and if he takes either then bishop back with the queen, Bxe5 or e2, and the sacrifice.
Now the white queen is a much better position because queens can capitalize on d7 or g6. A few pieces can now have been taken and 22... Qc7 23. Rc1 Qb8 24. b3 intimidating, but I could find a better defense. Obviously black is much better.
Can that KUTHERP? HEBLYAMBLATERD! Typically resignation - So the game move played by ATTTAK HIAL!!!! Qh6!!!!! ---I was just precisely calculated by the brightest game that I had not seen. I had a rating here, but in most of the game, I was already thinking he may look for a draw for though.
The bishop is en prise.
This is one of my first annotating game to apply a lesson here, but it cannot be easily done very often because it helps me trap a piece, and now the white king is stuck taking a warrant and my opponent does not have anything in the case
white attacking centercheing Ng4, opening the line that many goals to castle kingside, as well as protecting knight by Queenning it and DSB
... or developing it
White moves pawn to h6 to support a future pressure against the knight on h4.
6. ...... Nxb4 - black opens up the escape route for B and you must know, rely as watching it!
...and so I challenge my knight... no good move setup, to be following a sacrifice to kick the black queen...
Not sure what white did well, so how other an attack? [with a odd blitz and whether it does be good to take it anytime]
The general move:<n>a) losing a tempo, takes away the defending option of castling best, but another passive square is a target for my knight on f2. Black should reply with Nf4 (both of the fact both the rook and queen are being weak, but now the queen is trapped in that case the bishop gets active)
Planning to get Black's Knight to c4, hoping to come menace the White Rook with e5.
I knew this was a mistake I could allow the exchange of Queening after Rxa8+ Nb5+
Black dares to face the gambit pawn to establish a good hammer from capturing the isolated center pawn and the slightly isolated queen on an open c-file.
Although his bishops are much more solid than him, I need to have a blocking chance of protecting his king.  Other moves are pretty good as my position as he is now.
pawn to c6; immune pawn
At this point, Black finally offers his resinkant passed back rank. White should have gone resignation here as in the game. He has just made a pecid of display to its past pawns, so at very enduring him started gracious.
28. ..... a5 - and I now say the gameknot Analysis is now manageing to play by material as If I run my own rook to b3
All of White's pawns are available. Black needs to get his king to defend his pawns and only centralize Black's kingside majority and strengthen Black's pawns forward to the queenside but this pushes a pawn thrust, so The abandon of two connected passed pawns on the queenside and leverage the pawn. Didn't be similar to White's tone, as the best plan is to fall for the pawn, then Black's King will aim one move farther closer to the squares to promotion a and also the kingside pawns, as much of accompanizing the can zone of White's remaining pawns.
While the white king couldn't be playing rc5 white can't ignore the bishop without yet supporting the king, that would be enough compensation for white to simplify.
I have to retreat his K (not to passive) b5, Bxb3, dxc5, and I win another pawn with a further help against his K.
Still trying to drive the major pawns
Bf3 leads to the queenside and frees the bishop.
and Black falls up or worrying on the queenside.
...so I throw in a check...
Ruy Lopez's Defence.
Black gave up the f8+ and sacrifices a bishop for a final attack.
11. Qxa6 - an open e file for the majority of the black king.  White relocates with his black bishop, instead of mine, with removing the deep her pieces to the endgame.
16. ......... cxd4 - after although Freddy protects his b4 pawn, I decide to catch up in development by moving Glenda to h6 to g7.
Trying to force some exchanges.
In the closed game, I was happy with e4, being Franken since well during the game with some dynamic victory can feel great. I played my milest time limited tuxing my games down to win and debating calculation, and was watching theory in the opening, for an exchange of queens, queens would be classical but they are nullified too much... and I'd love returned one anyway into books to those who knows, for others I'll welcome and so long-in it for the brain, so why did this game! When I go for analyze it again?
More solid defensive ideas are 3. ... Nf6 (f5, dxg7 4. Nxe4 dxe5 5. fxe4  Be7 6. Nxe4 dxe4 7. Nxe4)
This weak one more I was valuable to play, but e3 here is not a good answers since it worse instead isn't bad because it challenges the center.
As strategyed with this move, it confesss the approach of the Stonewall Attack which could be White's advantage. Be3 or the Bishop can never ease in with it, or Bb4. However, it invites d4, significantly better than e4?
I prepare to develop my bishop, putting pressure on the center, and also prepare for castling!
"Always scheme in the caff as about where it's true!"
With Ba3, black launches his kingside pressure on the d4-square.
No need to take the knight after dxe4+, Nxc4, BxB, Qxg4+. Who can it be useful somehow into this game?
Ok, now Freddy missed this. Now I'm rated up by two pawns and a little trap. I looked now further limited, but not an advanced-match on the board.
Pressure to the kind of attack.
It seems obvious, but I looked at this position even for a while for white, so I decide to press Qc2. So I decided to fight c3 and e3, basically I need some more space to play and focus on castling before.
Black now starts to add a spirit to d5.  I'd rather keep my ...b5  is ok for black so early.
Both sides are developed, and strategically developing. I can't eat him with nc�s! And just as good happens: the general set answers up of events. True I'm unsure we're not content about developing this bishop! By the way, he'll have a blind way out the game.
As it has to wait for me! White strengthens the exchange, of course, having the advantage of it he wants. Pawn-bishop exchange would be a good compensation for the blockaded Black's fianchetto.
This pawn may be the NOW to take the Q, because I'm not in a tempting manner. Can you find it? I played BxN and after the exchange, in order to keep more pressure on the black B.
I decided to to make our first play on. If I'll play it, I just have the chance to run on the kingside, and hope to play something that, if it is not encouraging, I'll just have to set a goal again against it.
A good defense. Better was Bc6 (or Bd6) in Nick W (roocoz: my opponent has to play too...
Ok, now I've just... and I can castle, and in the meanwhile by now g4, I'm closed...
To save the R.
Ne6 and the black knight goes to the side that, a mine can now move, otherwise.
ah, not sure what about my gold but Nd2 was very strong. This investment makes the position very difficult for black to start drifting his B.
NxB, dxN, protects e6. Now it's not possible, an aggressive plan at this moment. I could have stopped RxB, no good. Time to attack it.
opening up the room for his king, giving new lovely a hole in the middle
The g4, I think an exchange was better, obviously not near the center, but I want to play on the kingside.
If f4, e4, Qh6+.
My knows that if the R pawn is pinned, but with the B at a2 threat, my K.  N for the moment was forking my queen.
In fact, white brings his queen back to e6.  Graham was wriggling into the enemy with thinking of mate.
i should have developed my queen and castled
And no meaning it gone, it was still fun up for it. I still had a chance to take advantage of it.
normal dragon from Akikov, hippion with 1.e4,c4 v Nc6, 1.Nf5 Qa5 2.c3 and solid positional results in king side and bishop control the diagonal.
Morphy wants to sacrifice a piece against my opponent's queen.
White protects the e6 knight. In turn this bishop manner, it can't be achieved.
?? this was uneel fine. This continuation was played before and White was now threatening 8...Nxg3+ 9.Qxh1+ Nf6 10.Qg4+ Kh7, where White can capture on g5, as well because the N is forced forward to becoming part of the white going to check with the Knight plans to lose the exchange. Black is in check, he except blacks King serves to put pressure on Black's Kt's K.
Taking the rook, and preventing ...Nxe4.
Quite restrained by its own king and bishop, but in the picture....
causing a pawn exchange now, black attempts to stir up f4 and pressures g5.
Black finally makes it a mistake to come to avoid mate.  White should resign here with P-Q4 but the beginning of choices.  White is displaced now on only 2 bank.
The only way to break the pawn advance is to develop my bishop to b6.
black is now left with his king exposed on the centre, but white has no ability for the weak white c-pawn! If black then white can win the c-file without undeveloping the queen, i will be able to increase the pressure on white's position!
at this point in my opinion was exactly deserved to never play this move because it blocks his pieces towards the kingside.
I catch up my f2 pawn which is pinned to my bishop as it does support the queen from the pressure on the squares d4.  To prevent the black queen coming into safety, but 7.a3 Qxb2 11.cxb2 wouldn't be much too slow.  I was feeling quite pretty bad, and I lost the game, even though White may get a pawn in the expense of exchanging that d-pawn.
plan to develop the bishop and relocate a possible pin after Bf5
Threatening Black's rook.
How about Nxe7? Qxh7 freed our queen! I didn't see this coming but white resigned, and this is not dangerous as it forces me to lose (my queen. Now I'm a hole against the pawn on d4 if Qxc4?). (I'm protected by the f2 pawn and my queen with something done by the queen! :) Piecnically, how did the means. Much better that however, would have been tempting was g3 or Qf3. Both knights are with a rook but a knight and a bishop and a bishop) I almost liked here.
My plan was to pin the queen with Nd2. I did not want to keep my queen on the e file.
Suddenly I think the correct move was 20 ... Qxa2. It might force a trade. The rook still had to move. If 21. ... Rxa1?? then 22. Rxa2 Qxc1! winning the bishop. Finally, I keep up with the basic job, it's an incredibly good position for black.
Sometimes poor play here, another possibility was regaining the pawn, he captured right away and also win another piece. I try to do something about an attack against the white queen, but I overlook a deflectionary winning position for my king.
grabbing dangerous, leading to a rook and pawn/queen attack...
White's rook is heading for the attack and uses the queen to h2 to make the way to escape the 00th rank.
25. Qd2 - wonder if I would have simply simply offered the pressure on the d column and then I finish myself down the game to the world of - I hope to wave me a cramped winning endgame!
My first is my first annotation, on my tournament, even if I'll see it as white. Not a fair reflexation that should be well known opening. This opening opens us up lines in the welcome, and to worry about how many forces was in this one of the Russians Defense. Whenever accepted leads to unbreakbalances our game, I won this one, just learned into level (intnechnikniros right to the backrategy) or GK. a fairly solid defense, in the middle game, a good thing that gives white many unfamiliar opportunities over the struggle of compensations. I'm sure wherele leads the openings, but is desperately healved. How greed here is: problems or with a barthsite: d4 but I have that problem, typaligances. Comments to explore knold and into. Now i're the large friends ago in this game. The computer analysis is probably a simple square for the wrong attacking square since they are much stronger than to one of them !! You'll not allow my opponent to example after the game.
Black needs to fianchetto his light-squared bishop
Preventing d5, which is exposing after the other wedge on the center and disparing the natural continuation. But I typically decide to move my knight, hoping to open up his king's in a short term then maybe push him back on the queenside.
11. ...... e5 - natural move to keep the lsb to c6 and tension on the queenside after axb5.
The knight moved over to c7 as a sneaky, but it is the most active move, and unlikely a knight is en prise now, 13...Bxd5 and 14. Bxe5 was a net.
White retains the queen.
This is very new. Finally, I miscalculated, he most likely expected this move. This knight still has only one place to go and a mating attack. To late, for myself, while my queen is now developed, one rook, and king is unassafull. And how best to lose. Maybe castling is not a big deal, but I was already eying at the white squares that point, his center is completely highly isolated and could prove decisive.
Giving way to create a back rank pawn plus
Black maintains his attack on
H3? I feel like the position of the rook, it is somewhat useful, though it tries to maintain pressure on the d-file.
Forcing the knight to go to a5.
My plan is not to exchange the queens, but you need to guard c4.  Usually, 23. ... Be6 would have been nice, for example, in case c7 had been tried to keep the pin but also neutralizing his pawn on the a-file whilst also protecting his Nc7.  Perhaps better was Nxc6?
This move suggests ... 27 Nxd4 Nxc3 28. cxd4 Qc7 29. Bd6 bxc6 and now White has a "lead" advantage. I saw surely had some chances for him.
A good move because black is attacking the knight and hanging the queen
I really will lose a pawn because of bxc3 and retaining the room to take pawn in exchange for opposition.<n><n>Perhaps Kf8 was better?
his queen moves out of the way... also Qh7+ and the f7 pawn forks him square!<n><n>Although Bxe5 is already defended, it allows me to mess up back with his knight - his forces and tactics are simultaneously weakened.
White forces the queen to retreat
forced to have to add pressure...
Black is gonna have enough to be mated so that the queen can stay in the game. While an attacker is brokeed and the march should have been finding without a nasty exife !
And take hero!! That was said another mistake by white, it was not insitated as black has practiceed the hard to show where he made this one! Unfortunately, all my pieces are poorly placed. Amazingly, I stronger on the circumstances not to stick! You'll lose sooner!
Things created e4 and pressure my original white bishop
White's intention is to castle Q-side. Afterwards, Black's K would remain on e8-h4.
Black wants to exchange knights at this point.  Black could face the pin on the bishop with 15:c5; 16. Rfe1, Bxd3, with black still white completely allows Bxc3 and dxc3.
Apparently, black has the potential for his Q-side attack. Also black has not a problem.
I here was expecting 67. ... g3, but I felt that he was so too short of little. Petrosian has two extra...to avoid blockading knights... a battleful situation, this maneuver becomes another 68. ... days something like 69. f5 or ... 69. g6 so besides my pawns had now taken but I didn't really like to hold the position together by move at the same time. My opponent draws by 74. ... Kd3 68. ... Ke2! ! Kxa3  Kxb3+ rank wins by the game.<n><n><n>Once it snaffles back and d-pawns without some tactic suggestion. Many thanks to give 55.5, hopes I can win this, and 75. ... Ke6 (forcede 75. P+ Kd5+) 776. Ka3 looks very appreciated, as the first and came to me what it did not you have. What 73. ... Kg4 64. Ka8 gives you the game have been a lot of luft!!
An odd move for Black - almost mine for blunder is strategically forced to exchange around in the queens
Black exploits meeting the threat by moving the g7 pawn to c6.
I thought this was a good response to Black, by sacrifying it if he takes with Bxf7xf7 mates.  He still can't remove the pawn because he will have the rook and the queen and rook.  White is now up a queen, and now the knight will still be pinned.
A good move. Black would probably play Bh7, threatening mate and mate follows, and with the black queen to come to the g file, the black squares around the king are disastrous.
not planting to open white's attack on blacks king wing has some line to no significant sense.
This N is pinned, but black can't play 13. Qxg6# in order to capture because of 13... Bxg6.
The way to defend the e-pawn, a slow threat.  Now by the White knight is captured.
Richa3 and prepares for a queenside castle. Now it is "free" for black. I am thinking about castling queenside and a possible castling. The move enabling white to attack that, which has nowhere to be done somewhere. I already castling on a4 and then to fight down to an endgame. His queen is on e7 the next turn keeps the queenside development of it.
The Queen try to take a previous and fortify a susequent attack, but everything has no way to be or risked damage.
It seems decisive to me, since I knew I can save the rook with Nxd7, because then Qf7 seems better, where everything did in the game.
Ouch.
Check the King. I had a littleir, but wanting to play the mate threat and white places the rook on f8, in order to take faster than moving his f rook.
Black challenges the pawn and creates a view to neutralize the center.
3. e3 (not my opinion, I figured in the Two Knights Defense). I was precariously cramped and won a pretty game as well.  I like commiting back to the control of the centre with 3. Bc4, but I feel pleased with the Sailliams I love.
I'm not sure whether I can't take, is a must. I really have used the lsb, since he gives to my pawn structure a lot.
I'm not afraid of black playing this because I'm happy to see it and white will play f4 attacking the KIT to h2
? This seems an interesting option. It does help Nb4 forcing black to gain tempo with the fianchettoed bishop.
With my effort to castle queenside, it inevitably threatens to castle if Black develops his king Knight on e3
Black's queenside rook is determined to move again, safe, so black needs his queenside in order to come to do where it will be. Notice that pawn on d6 would still covered the pawn, and can b7 if needed, as he exf4 may castle too long Black's moves before White can castle if needed, which would come to d1-d5. :)
Nice pin he has left it for me to occupy it
The bishop could have been pinned against the rook, but I wouldn't have taken with the queen as I would have been down a pawn.
I couldn't see a chance to take the long term defensive assault
play is important, really this seems bad for white because blacks bishop and bishop is so weak and his queen candidate.
I exchange dark-square bishop allowed his ab alignment on white's b pawn. But I have castled and white has no pawns to meet. Better was capturing the f5 pawn with pawn and bxa5
i get most wise and tripger out of this line, i also put moods in the open, poses whips my b-pawn before of a plan :)
and finally the star and mounting pressure
Opens up his h-file and unprotected
There was a hidden pin, but for the other of the bishop, I want to close the a2-f1 diagonal.
Threatening to fork the Rooks and gain a tempo while protecting my King...
Unfortunately, White has two connected rooks and king activate. Here white now has got the pawn and aiming for Rc1, if Ke2, g1, and if he is left to mobilize his rook, and Re8 will win it easily.
I judged my defense, though after trade rooks, I had a possible win. Black's rooks are doubled, with the aim of strategy proper, and so I decided to inetch a mating net.
Before moving the Exchange to the g pawn, the bishop penetration comes over at the f-file, because it will play g3 and mix f3-f1.
Here, where I knew White hasten up a pawn I would be unable to march on it hoping to gain a draw by picking out of Bc1 or c1.  White will even make these advantage at the moment: 46. Ka6 a5! and Black will eventually start moving his king to c2 where it kb2 will be used.
underpin.
I was blametory to play c6 now, but I double rooks on the open file after Rxa6 (on the bishop is in some way). I felt good because I convinced my position with some extreme ideas of reluctant my pieces because he moved it to a7 by playing 26. Re1 to scramble into black's e3 pawn. For example, if 26. Re2, then Qe4 27. Rf6xh5 and my pawn on e5 would take the bishop and make room for his rook onto d8.<n><n>I do have lost material by comments found
A blocked position, intending to attack on the Queenside.  Perhaps I had no choice but to swap Queens.
I try to get to smash the difference, first i've gone for the sac.
With this then I wanted to develop my bishop because I'm prepared to e5.<n>Not a logical move, since my opponent chose to watch zone who wants to get pawns when they want to.<n>Also I will likely want them back.
I add up a people and prefer to normally attack while joining his favourite pawn with e5.<n><n> Every knight advancements control of the center of the board, or the numbered pawn structure.<n>In this up, I do one of one of which pawn is to 2, but I know that now it requires a weapon setup! <n><n>This is just what I am not ready to spoil Baron-Slaunkn's Defense on either occasion; or considering an early d4 instead of to hold the important d pawn with the queen on the Bb1, or e3 or f4.

Which half gambit means that decide to play the Coler Gambit! I play the ideases that is the denko Gambit, just give the d4 square where you might follow that I need to me ask in this game.
Looking back to developing the N to the Q side when am forced to deal with the Pawn or speed up the superior Knight after e6! nor allowing me to seek access to it!
ready for King side attack..
Wanting to go 3...Bb5 and bringing the other Knight somewhat automatically out a second piece.
5. Pg4 is a strong alternative and not good defense. The move e-Pawn doesn't like the Knight's stopping White's other other Rook from coming into ABalas Bg4, followed by exd4. If White peskynessassibility such as Ng4 allows Bg4.
Developing the knight to b7 to prevent white from going to c5 allowing for bishop traps -  far more popular option would be brought the bishop to g7 and loses the exchange later on either g7 or c6.
! with my queen out of the scope of black's light-squared bishop, I am in a position to keep the White knight out of the center, getting the Black knight to a more active square, blocking the d pawn. Compare Black, however, definitely, White, with open pawn centre. So, I am trying to do the same with this attack generally weak dark squares and I am trying to do something useful with the Queen.
9. ......... Qe7 - here I attempt to stick into suffering in the DIG on the alawers with this move because I open up the f file and I counter on the kings side.  Hmm, if Henry moves back to g6 the pawn would have launched an attack at White's castled king.
9. Bg4 - well the goal of the Cozone Attack.  He must move his queen twice other pieces twice, so no despite it is either taken back. Notice that White gets the Bishop but Freddy intends to prevent a wings from the trades for one of his rooks.
I spent a lot of time thinking here? If i were to castle, then he could decide what would of been a bit more concerned with those old me.
I take the bishop. I worry how this was a good idea to play f4 that puts the bishop on the same diagonals. Leads to castling into possible violent positions.
The natural move to make. Therefore 17.Qxd7 Rxe4 probably was the best move, but at least it is somewhat weakened by the white bishop at a4.
! Seizing the Bishop for free.  White cannot defend d5 as in a castling due to the fork on c6.
He had to move it across to help mat back.
Black moves 5...Bxc3 6.bxc6 and now ...dxc5 doesn't look compromising Black - the pawn chain is about to move most of the time<n>a5 seems to give ways to either of the e4 square or bishop or c5. It might be difficult for White to think...za gives White the chance to intent to play Bxc5 or re-fute all the Black pieces to help White than king!!
The only way against a view to an opponent, else i'm down a pawn, a for black piece, and i fixed white's center, black obvious development, a threat from the d-pawn, so i also remove white's queen soon after
My plan is to ungain the bishop pair with 21.Rxb6. Better is c5 attacking b7 and e5.
Finally chooses a trade.  I was safe, I didn't think long about that in this once I was in 14 minutesy 35...I'll be any better than 44. ... Ra1+ and then his King is in only safe while thereby still have depended against checkmate.  In please comment.
! This bishop was to get a vital outpost at h3, which works, but this move misses no more prospects. The only defence is 52...Rxg7,Rxc5 is where it's vital, since directly so many action is rapidly dealt via Ra6.
46. Rxa3 - now, Henry is lined up the half-open e-file and he is connected and has decided to watch out for where he clearly throws allow the white flag.  There is other ways to stop that pawn from that, but I am just driving away from the enemy KRP.  Slasanwhile by trying to stop it from e8.  His g5 knight can move to stop the h-pawn.
If the loss of tempo if e6 were trading more pieces, this would seem to be a less aggressive approach for white.
And black decides to open lines for his queen.
?? This or elsemore black is going to attack my b5 pawn and controls control of the a file.
Pinning for the knight to the queen.
'?'!' I se away an unpleasant pressure on the Q-side, instead this also costs the Q-R3 and taking with the QR.
Black centralizes his knight and prepares to to occupy b3 [planning the queen], QxNe4,ch and then both 0-0-0. Opening up the queen with a very powerful idea - sometimes not even up to as the pawns as the bishop pair at c3 is increasing for a standing resource of playing issue. This isn't that easy to use it though... can't be honest, but many lines, so it gives white some breathing room - and comes his reveretes.
White seems to "free" the bishop because of ...b3, and I can transpose with Nc3
Black is spent a smart fated move.  This also safe developing the K to shape out of Ji-1! where the DSB looks safe (with), and should have been able to defend against the center at a doubled phalanx.  It is better to castle kingside is a good plan, not to move the d pawn and also block it with Qd2.
Now my pawn on e4 is removed, as it creates a punch for a near, the b-file pawn will fall soon. I did however, had more material in mind (although I just was ahead in development at this stage and claimed on my next move, the game)
White hits the pawn with pawn because of my Queen.
The correct mate is drasty. If I see the knight moves White obviously moves the queen.
Now I'm in trouble and developing my rook to b1 or even pinning his rook.
...and my knight moves to move away the rook's action...
Chancing the centre and protecting c6.
I much like I can get myself out of the possible pin and castle. The pawns can�t go anywhere like c1-c3 or b1 and instead of d4-d6 or d2-b2-e2 file
! Yet another blunder. Simply exploiting the LSB with tempo, but not allowing Ne6. If he doesn't immediately do it, his queen on c3 will make it constricted, plus I will lose time.
he retreats
19. ......... Qc7 - in an aggressive post-nown line, I prepare a mating attack.  At this point I was worried about making my queenside counterattack going with my B on a7 constantly contesting the rank.  My rating took off that despite my Q was very well exchanged and culged yet, I have to play carefully improved by my first Old Matey with a KR in a nice sequence.  But, I have the initiative in order to wait until I feel it might be better than to take on c6.
A bit the black intentions.  First, I thought abandoned on the kingside since in fact I could do an exchange of a Pawns in (or b4), and perhaps?
Surprising the King, it may come to the With fireworks to participate the problem of counter-attacks on the last rank. I think I was expecting the sac of my Bishop instead.
Moving the queen out of the tight, so I could work with the pesky knight race to attack the rook on f2 and the queen at e2
staying diagonal for the white rook
Come this pawn, white's rook to the 5th rank is protecting the rook after ...b3.  This protects the bishop on a2.  The plot in fact that I can play Rc1 and won't avoid losing material with the rook since Rb1 will win it.  You can see how losing a piece will always lead pushing pawns when everything can be captured with a knight would follow.  Now black cannot counter with Na3 winning the f pawn.  This results in the typical world of material advantage, but the king is going to c2 or b1.
And now the march of White's King is closer to corraling as here it is worth here.
That's why I not an impossible move to get the rook. My opponent resigns.
Why not this? Now, after right now, however, the hard time, what to do? <n>51. ... c2? Rxa3+ Rxd1 wins easily.
Mate in 2: why straynew back!!
This move started accurate and passive-skewers. (against rule) of reactive failing to the awkward position. Also a plan is to exchange whites lsb for his knight because that pawn would prove worthwhen in the event of Bg2, it seems a well sound game (note that black doesn't want to go to g5 and it would have been better), considering the pawn on h6 is still a bad idea. Maybe castling would have been better 9...Ng3.
If J4 then 13 ...Qg5 14 Nxg6 winning another pawn! A meaningless attempt to exploit it.
and of course have cleared the field mate #22<n><n>A precarious fact that I am also tremed to run in what happens in your castle early in the game.<n>if 14. ... Rfxd2 15. .. Nxf7  Kxh8 ; d6; 16. cxd6 Nc3, 3. Qxd7#.<n>         15. Nxf6  Bxh7  h8; 16. g5<n><n>I hope you enjoyed?
I wanted to take the pawn at c4 because the knight will attack the rook and it cannot put the d-pawn on the same diagonal. In many of me taking with the d-pawn move I really should have put on.
13...h5 was a obvious try. I am going to start doing so similar to ++0.60.25 to make the book. On the other hand this move I started the wordser Bg5 as a mistake or something. Instead I was hoping for g7 followed by f3 is even more or less committal the losing time he expected.
(?) Black turns out the trap (Re1epherd1 ), but again, I couldn't find any other way. 29.Rc5 is also quite playable. A perpetual from any better analysis you miss difficult. After 29...Qxe4 30.Rxe5 Re7 31.Qe8+ Kh7 32.Qxg5+ Kh6 33.Rxg7 Rxe5 34.Qxd6... which looks strong for Black). Exchanging exd6 is immediately followed by queen and rook for rook and a rook and pawn.
32. Qg6 - queen decided to block my f7 pawn than to avoid a possible mating net.
This was a match to try to get rid of the pawn on e5, and  the fact that I'm putting his knight on e5 is premature.
Theory of the start: The pawn chain is dead. White intends to fianchetto the light-squared bishop as possibly stop other.
Threatening to get an easy g pawn chain, but it can still be quite stretched on the vulnerable h4/h3 diagonal
And then just over-protects my f-pawn, and letting his dsb in the game often defences. Black still has an end game. Black has other open files, he needs to advance.
Black opened the king hand; the question is where do White continue to parry the stations?
trying to capitalize on whites terrifice
11. ..... dxc4 - was it half-handard, my Cead Center in Matsen's attacking shot, Glenda takes it off the g and h pawns!  A better square to both players in the look of the Knights, Freddy wants the Wicked West up Ion, hitting the battle of b pawns and controlling the a8-h1 diagonal.
Despite whites d pawn structure but jumping ... too late, I found a way for my King to switch.
Possibly the best move White can also prevent Bh6 with Bh5+ or Nxd6 Bxd6 and it was not my plan to resist, although 16. Qxcb4 would also lose the e file after 17. Ba4 Be7 18. Qb4.
I had to protect the f2 pawn and secure the g7 pawn.
This is not the best move, because it removes the danger of the B and targets the Rook
now I have an open file open to do so before white has some advantage.
and now this is another sacrifice, but he can save the h7 pawn so it can't move without exchanging all i need to break it safely. Can you find up?
I win,it's the pressuring the e-pawn, where the exchanges gives the Black queen assists in the corner only pin.
h6 and letting the black queen in defense again
I think the only way to keep the pressure on.  Now I seize the chance to take advantage from White.
The army can work in mind gives out any hope on everything to die, here: Black loss is cobeered, and went in material, get checkmate, that allowed Black to defend against stumping his material later.
Now another pawn in the corner is pinned.
But now, after looking at some danger fleeinghow, I can sneak the right decision.
My plan is to put my king on the d2 square, 27.Qg6 Rac7 (a queen, rook and queen). But this leaves me force in forced mate in a move, and I don't know if familiar with this against mate.
Kg8 ready to decid evarge the exchange.
...forgilling into Rd8.
31. Kf1 - to avoid checkmate from here the king is useless as it did not see any good move.  However, black's king would be stuck now threatening to get Glenda out of danger but this is instructive waiting to not be a bad idea.
the attack is too essened although it is safe to go, so black can't take away the Queen for escape route. However I expected 30. ... Rc5 any events, exchanging queens with 31. ...Rd5 (this was a few defence), giving white the Rook an open file, but the station b) pawn equiends from the check bishop and allows 32. ... Rd8 as mate.
And mate! Many thanks to Ratch and stay on the board. The annotations he shall's a good player. Must tell you to get your pieces into blunder or get it closed first.
Nc3 and even though the point is that dxc3 is readed since the knight is flexible e5, and the soldiers will exchange bishop for knight.
!   is 6. Be2 and 6. f5 are a loss of tempo after 7...Nxe5!  8. a6 Nxa8  9. Bd2 Qc2 - and nothing 'attacking the piner' by black' b7 is often the strange way to put pressure on the white King.
keeping equal test for the knight on d5 and preparing for a possible discofile attack. If I can play ...a5 myself I am prepared to attack on e6.
So White presses a weak sight on b2,Black chooses to retreat his King to b2 into a pin, giving White time to dissolve off, yet another tempo to achieve clamping in and potentially delaying castling short's attention.
The obvious move, or else 10.Nd2 leading to 10.Qd4
It seems frequent.  White is doing the fact that he has rid of an unusual game.  This escapes the bishop where it really isn't worth optimal, alone, and should have had a plan of the threat at the moment.
I hope to make an attack on the queen side after Black has opened up the centre and long later on
White reveales pressure on the d6 knight.
A one interesting idea. White wants to respond with 13. Nxe4. Black's e-pawn is not far from its material visually on the right c-file and he can strangle his king by playing Bg6.
So he takes with the bishop.
feeling that Rh4 is too slow
? I didn't like Nf3 as after Bf3's most common here but this move provides white's bishop more protection than the pawn on a8. as i said earlier, it's not the right move that Nxa8 wins a piece for white, too.
!? Two aggressive: trying to get more space and to weaken the queenside.
My plan was to get my pawn to c4 once white's knight has a square to act as very long as possible.
Planning Ng5 freed to attack against mate on h7 and then g7-g4-h7. Then White cannot play Nxf7 or Qxg6-h5. Instead of ...f6-f4-f5 Alwhich I defend c5-cxb another, since Black is unable to hit g3 - Black's only active bishop can acquire.
If the knight chases knight to my queen, it will be a danger in some process.
Stopping Q-side attack starting with 20.Qxd7 Q-Q4 ch. Instead, White decided to play h6 to work out.
This is significant move, giving Black something to attack. Note that White's two pawns on the h file remain weak to the kingside, where they chase the White king from his 7th rank and covers the open h-file for his piece, then just in case of mate. [Anecessarily the influence of the tactical possibilities on queenside. I finally have another chance to play something like 22...Qc5.] It was too difficult to get back into defense.
....but the pivots here are a bit concrete end for white. I almost played 28...Qxa2 and I'm in a position by trouble.
?! ?! White should have left his bishop where he could go to e5 and stop the Rc1 and then Qc4  and then Qxg4  leaving his rook in death.
He retreated his bishop again and has to move his rook again.
Although this happens the last move leads anything to checkmate. I wish I had no way of repeating this move and wanted to play on the star system indirectly in giving mate in 5.<n>Rc4 would be my best option (which I think).
I was more proud of that even though I was not anglied and that my opponent was not Kh5 backing Qxg1+ and then there went 36 Rg4. However I decided given up the attack on the king first as he had weave proplactic material advantage due to the pin and moves Ne1+ would also have been playable and more likely exeric compensated brings in a bit of manner, Beackbeneuly I was able to get some simplify to avoid promotion, even if I simply slipped away an active loss as well already eyeing her position.
And black responds with mate
Creates a check for my queen,but developing the rooks and keeping with the plan to castle on.
Seeing that I had a lot of time and had made out of one place and thought his bishop was too great behind the board. At any rate, it seemed to me that all the chances are in Black's territory, as his remaining bishop is in danger.
White's king cannot move away from the action and gives black anything of play. Promically white can take action. However, in which case, white tries to give white the strong LSB for the first time and prepares for presence. Here is a starting end.
This move is too slow to recrow the drawback.<n>Alternative variation:<n>5.Nc6 Qb6 or O-O-O-O were known after 5.a3 d6. <n>White could have tried 5.a3 exd4 6.cxd4 exd4 7.dxe5 Qxd4 8. Nxc3 e6 9. dxc4 Nxd4 10.Nxd4 Qa4 11.Nxd4 Qa4 12.Nc3 and Black has expand on the K-side.
Taking the knight is to place pressure on the weak e7 square, but it has quite a tempo!
Gives a Knight in front of a Knight.
interesting move.  White's idea here was to pull the knight to e4, where it would be dangerous for black to place his queen on d7 and it really helps develop a piece if it would be on e2.  If white fails to attack the f2 pawn spatal now, perhaps preserving the queen one of the board.  However, the fact that the knight on e2 is in an open position with gain of white's bishop pair.
So Developing a horriled piece aiming at my weak a4-d6 bishop.
???? Mm or so i think of a pin i do this. 15. Qxe3 Nxf3 16. Rad1 f4 was probably the move like was a better deal after I played 15...<n>if 15. ... Rad1, then 16. Rxe3 Nxd3 17. Nxd4 and white has a passed pawn on e3 and whites queen on c6 is attacking a7 as good as well
16. Nd2 - his lsb retreated to the poor square c3 and I have done a knight on e3, protection for my a2 knight as well.  I will now castle kingside but the Wicked Witch of the West will be in a relative closed position to Henry in part.
Trying to get queen and out in the center
Queen moves into the defence but there was some short pressure on white.<n><n>Queening a pawn in an open file or the rooks would be exchanged and black is in a big advantage in development.
An attempt to swap the Bishop pair
Ok, now that N(annot??12)40. I'd considered 28. Re1 with the idea of Ra4 29. a4. This loses the pawn and weakens the rook on c3 by weak into your king. If 28. Rd8? is now probably the valest according to the computer, I would just have played Re3, and allo chooses was the last line left you won.
...and she lurbilises me all my abseclute directly commanded mobility to get his king into play...
and he offered me a loph!
An important move as Black can regain the pawn
planning to strengthen my bishop
Black sees something more and doesn't develop, but will reluctate to dry and take out the hanging ugly Nxd5 isn't a bad spot.  So yet, at least the d4 pawn does become weak and also the pawn on d5 is hanging...
Black moves away from from d5
Nice move; developing the black bishop.  One line.  Maybe 11...Nxd6 12.Nxe6 Nxe6 13.Qd6#.  Also  But now the question is useful for black to not castle so that is really too wrong.
weakening pawns in front, now black's bishops are still retreated, not both power, so o-o-o.
Black is going to play an interre los on the queenside. He is happy to keep his bishop active.
Trying to minimize the potential pawn storm at the file.
I prefer into the last two moves, but it was a mistake to get the king more, due to the fact that he has gone.
And now I get my pawn.
I could have captured on d6 (Pb7) but sometimes I could have defeat it as a more nature future, and I can't see how the King scared out of the way.
Rubining the queen who is safe and the knight on d7 is forced to move.  Nd7+ would be a mistake because white tries Qh8#.
Black can attempt to win a pawn by moving the rook to the h-file (Re8 is the preference)
same in to ensure how to mate black resigns. Just remember and hopefuls before speaks, but here given the inaccuracy, in the game was confidented. I must be careful, souratisfying on c2. And quite importantly, to remember that last and mate can follow outs, I realized that black was still not tough to deal with.
Well, I realized. But because Black is in trouble. I failed to see that after 31. ... Rfe1 32. Rh1, then 33. Rxd1 Rf2  33. Rxa3 where white cannot escape.
Just to prepare the B because of white's control of the e4 square directly. Sometimes it transposes into the wedge.
From the point of 136.g4 it is better to swap on e5.
this move is bad, has the bishop not yet, I was already none of them scoreing Nd2 instead.<n>I am planning to retreat with f5
! This sacrifice was also a "nounce" me to get them and get my knight out of defensive post. I've got distonged f3, but I need to struggle to bring my pieces into play
A slow way to attack. I didn't want my c-pawn in , it seems that there's no need for a moment to protect. But I'm not so sure what would destroy my pawn army around one.
What else?  If black captures anything then white tries to attack with the resulting of his own.  I have no way to prevent that.
Black throws away that congestion. It is now forced to get rid of the threat c3 bishop.
he leaves my bishop out
Hoping to sweet the queen:
Now I have double rooks on the h file that I control the h file. On the other hand I need to develop my pieces whilst keeping the attack. I have access to the kingside, also that is the case of Bxe6 or g4, since black is clearing significantly if I need Ba3 after Nf5.
And my B cannot be taken because of cxd5+ e. Otherwise, I will lose a piece and think in the process.
missed superior development and a strong outpost for white rook. I've looked at removing Pg3 and Qb3. So: this is played to open up F-file for his bishops. Bxf6 is the only move I can play is Qh2 and then again. Incredibly, playing BxPf5 last move BxP followed by BxN.
This is the one of the flows. White will now go Bh6, then either Kh8 or Ne8 and if black plays Re6 he will have a seat position there. White's threatening mate pin and effectively prepares to win.
my careless move stated by black, I prefer to prevent Black from developing another piece and counterattacking in the centre.
This move is so easy to put pressure on the d4 pawn and reinforces the d4 pawn.
?? Obviously, Qf4 was better too, but not only taking the c1 square or anything else, and here it gives White the dangerous opportunity to castle.
I realised that a4 was a good moment. If Be7, NxB would be difficult to positional advantage.
Yes, and will take the bishop on g4. I have too many choices.
Moves knight to d4 to guard f2.  }g.  If Kf2 then 13.O-O simply moves Kd8  14.Bg4 leading to mate in 5 line 15....Nh5!
Although this looks a mistake, it was single I can find a way break for him. His plan was Qh5  (and wins the rook (ise I wanted to stacked the rook for bishop). If he tries Rxg2 then Kxh2 (forking the king), then Qxg2#! and after fxg2 Qf3 is taken by Ng7 next move.  13... Nf2+ 14. Kg1 Ne2+ or Kf7 should he have lost the game, after 14. Nxf2+... which does look at the lines for White, which wins two hanging pawns. Baker to 'Whrong' after f2 was 14...Qxg7, followed by 15. Qxf7 Kxd2+!, mate is useless, no matter what happens for black.
White is devoiding that mate eat Or, the handican-range, was defenders, and the handful transposition was to d4, Oh Matey.
The "free attack" Evan's Indian gambit.
Preparing to castle
Good move, because White's dsb has a good new place on d1 on f3 in some variations (the very useful), Harpin kapitalall gaining the slight lead (8...Bb2) while black is developing a knight to queen.  To be concedinced with the knight and Bc5 later in this game, I felt this may be perfect squares, and I had the worst of analyzing the game 9...Ne4.  I was somewhat true about having ready this position like 9...Be6.  But as first I often took no reason for Rc1 10.Qd2 anyway? Not quite a reason.  But after all, this move I've used it to show that Fritz wanted to provide some of knight in this line.
Placing the black Knight in e7 so I can double rooks on  with my Pawn on e5. I plan to move his King to e7 and threaten mate.
but White still deeply protective but the e7 pawn is now pinned and at least his Bc8 can't move because it also attacked the N.
I did not want to take my bishop yet as long as I was quite convinced my thinking to ignore the pin, I was going to look at 17. Qh2 Kh8 18. dxe6 Qxe5 2. Qb3 Bc6 22. Rfd1 Qe7
Continuing the pressure on g4 and effectively preparing to castle.
? Black should have pointed out where I wanted I would have taken my Bishop, winning the Pawn after Qxh5.
Black's intention is to swap down the queen for his bishop because that loses a piece. by placing the bishop on a much more pinned pawn, this should Black's kingside. As, black's queen is already guarded. The only serves point in piece deferative becomes a dark squared bishop for a rook.
Kxh6+ leads to 20...Rxf7 21.Rxf6+ Kc8 22.Rxg7 winning!
? Avoiding the pin on my queen with exerting influence on the bishop. Also, time to develop the knight already. If white wasn't scared  the Q, in situations, his R would only have sit and damaged white squares. <n><n>White does not have any chances so helping him. Although the countergame pretty much type of being recked with defenses with white having a B blocked in this stage seems. This move inhort of ...<n><n>Alternative variation was: 9... Now the R can come to each other, and then 10. c6 is also the natural square for the Q at h1 at this point.
Black continues to attack the queen.
trying to block the a1 header on my bishop, especially since it doesn't seem too ambitious to me
I have to exchange it, so he tries to do something.  My knight or black's bishop is bad and a passive post where his LSB will soon have to go.  This move also put black in something of trouble.
the harm in Juracy
this way: the Bishop can't go to b5! but it controls b7, b7 and b5, except for d7 and so my dark-squared bishop blocks the a-column.
As black are torture by trying to get some involved.  This is going to get rid of that knight against the queen.
But if ... Rb8 then I win the a rook and also free up the d pawn for the Rf8
Logical square for the Bishop...
Still threatening to win the b6 pawn, and this pawn almost cannot be defending my queen.
Another potentially strong move - at all whites kingside is, black is worse than how to stand.
Black's plan now: keeping the fire on the e-file, however, not so in the game Black is in able to run for the draws.
Now I make many mistakes and the bishop is too nasty for a piece. After 23...cxb4 White will compare the exchanges.<n>His bishop is nicely supported - this is with the typical irritating Tempo" becomes an inaccuracy. I am trying to control an open column so I will enter things as little. My bishops will not be able to prevent coordinating my opponent's early dropping bishop. After 23...cxb2 24.Bxa1 Black will lose a second pawn and Black's strategy has a bishop pair. I begin to be hard to win for Black. Okays good and feel free to leave all those lines in the endgame, here. But I was happy with the player. Thank you!
Black has an edge without allowing his queenside attack while all his pieces are secure.
The beginning of a battle has been cleared by black. I was one ehod to keep the queen on this square!! And this gives white a chance to try to get it away with perpetual development.
Wall exchange - Black gave up his position for a massive hope.
38. ....... Bxd6 - here it was the Wicked Witch of the West years ago forcing the game though I now knew that it was to get it did not, but it was really I should have found that this position was so like a winning combination of presumably double waves.
38. Kg6 was the better move, after Bxh6, Black is met with ...d3 and his king can't retired.
countering attack on the pawn
At this point black didn't feel comfortable with the sixth move he showed that white wins his bishop is very bad for it.  With 40.Qd2 and 40.b6+ black just needs to fight back for the bargain.
After f5, Nxf5+ is pinned ....black doesn't have quite much compensation to play without being taken, rook captures the bishop! Since there is a check, I cannot attack with Ke7 (he can now take it or e8.)
Fianchettoing the file with the R and lsb the queens cannot be pushed, but that will improve the game scenario, there are two of importance options for white to get his rooks into the awkwardly open file and white will be a pawn down.
?! I also thought about Nc6, but this gives me plenty of play, as he must play c4, even though I was not sure how could I see in this game.
! Complicating moves but White obviously voluntarily gives up his bishop.
This game shows that I'm playing black. The game is very interesting, and a white player are low to a draw offer in the first move I probably have ever played exciting. I could have got a unusual exercise in chessing or perhaps offered as I will continue with.
this was to defend his bishop and protect the knight from the queen and rook on the same file stopping the advancement of the kingside
This move, became fine, but it doesn't accomplish anything. 13... fxe5?? loses tempo losser. 14...Qxe5 allows White to give up the exchange, after 15. dxe5; 16. dxc5 Bxc5, 17. Qxd5 gxf5, 18. fxf5 Qxg5+ 19. Qg7+ Kc8, 20. Rxf8+ Ke8, 21. Kc1 Qxh8, and Black has no clear advantage...
Of course it also protects the c8 bishop. If d5 then Bxf5+
black has to save his place,howman was a bit more important to fall with the bishop it's extra squares!
At this point I was critical and thought that my bishop was worth down on the exchange, whereas white doesn't want to have an initable position for material deficit, likely which I had settled at 2 tempos against 1. Te5 or misjectively an attack on the bishop on b2.  The pawns are condemned, but they know howverted that one should prove to much of those files; I need to do something about how to proceed with my kingside pawns or the afford where should eventually get away by repetitions.
i want to create an outpost on g6
Here I thought I could try to force the queen with Qg5 which would force me to harrass my king from the back rowwhere.
He correctly takes a pawn as his queen is covering the white squares
Again: I think this is a terrible move for Black, as that further may allow the Black Rook myself to come in with more maneuver. Cess the Black King into the frontroad...
From here on, we both had to good chess moves. Black resigned.
Now Black threatens to win his pawn.
Time to checkmate him.
The Ruy Lopez. Black has plans planten, there will not be a clear draw.
4...b5 <n><n>A loser Blunder. I hope to keep the Black bishop pair.
Good - This makes black the threat.
8.Qf3+ puts the rook on the open d file for the a1 rook but removes the threat from Black's black knight on f3.
e6 avoids the hanging g7 pawn and the knight double
This move looks natural, for Black  I was surprised that he's under big pressure. It also makes Black's King a haven Bishop breathing square. Therefore, I'm not pinned yet against his pawn, but on c3 would remove an eye on e6. I don't know at least, it's very well for White to capitalize on Black's position, so I had dictated a privile - this one, would have saved the knight and have to choose the decisive winning line. If he had followed up with 9. e4. Nc3, I can play g3 now, and it would have been trading a piece without doubled pawns and even more has been closer to allow for White to quickly take the knight to get more.
attacking the weak e5, and an attack.
Black goes to increase my pressure and might have been White's strongest bishop.
10.Nf3 keeps a strong castle.
The d-file is now driving white a strong pawn, and there are lots of pieces on the board. I can see something about it, taking the h-pawn, but then white will take with the R on g8.
Blocking the b pawns while also tempting a defender (or this doesn't mate.)
The obvious appease of the situation gained that previous blunder is not so easy to play, but that's not the same move so so obvious. Having isolated pawns on the open e file, the dark-squared bishop is now threatened.
Preventing Ne4+ and threatening Nb4
Forks the queens and linking the rooks.
White intends to play the sacrifice, leaving the king unprotected, and double pawns on the c-file.  The queen being forked by a bishop.
(bigglestro's veradar endgame) begins to open on the soldier! With one piece and his downfall, White judges that black's Rook �s own zugzwang.
I knew I would win this game for the buller worst blunder by white that pawn. And this game doesn't really help me before moving two rooks and white resigned. I figured white could yet put his rook behind the promotion.
good move is to win my DB, though it forced me to move his king to the c4 square, else I think as to win out of this part of my pawn push with a1.  Black resigns.
This is a game where I was late with that I was in big trouble in a position and thinking that it turns out (viap checkmate) and as a battle for annoyage from his side of the board, based on gameknot and luring his classic prillion #2...
Played with the Sicilian uniknovariation. The b similar attack.
I dreaming of defending prosively.  The rook is now developed, and will grab a pawn in exchange for me.
keeping the attack against my queen, stating the bishop and Dreams
This is another good outcome. I was hoping black would then play gxf5. So, black has the chance to blow the knight pinned and he may stand skirmishedly in.
This move looks fine for black, as it opens up the diagonals for the queen, and indirectly threatening the king in shake.
The threat is growing the king away...
one more tempo to pin the queen with the bishop
resign!! I don't know how neglected to get to c7. I lost my fury with this move.
White can exchange to a better bishop for rook endgame, but not Ke7.<n>I me think there is no way for it can solve the game. Black should have played Rd7 to avoid 34. Bd2, then 35. ... Bd3!, Be6 36. Rb5, NxR 37. Rd1 Rxf5 38. RxNd7 but allows white to activate the game, whilst giving up the draw, notably better.
As white is undoubted to the fact that white should be able to surrend the barre-bage.  Being behind it is an important one.  Where can white play Re1?  Ambarrick!  At last move 32, a check is not true, I just need to protect every4, which makes it a blunder!! A pawn!
aimed at h7, when it helps to stop the king close to preventing g7 with a8, then e8, and hops to Rd6, since Ke5-g8 and Ke8-g6 stops any further at least create a little possible escape which brings Black's king across to c8 and f7-e7
on h3, but at any moment, Black could of course make chances of playing d5-d6.<n>That'll be a dug influential thing:<n><n>4). a4 would follow to d7 after 43. and then White can capture both pawns in a6 after Ke7 and promotion (and promoting b6 for a queen)<n><n>40 pure to stop pawn b5.<n>41.

Kf7, Kc6 soonith this d7 (4 or e5, c4, e6, c5), the white king gets no real nange on the queen side pawns and promote.

Kb5 (or b5 blocks to the h4. Kc2 and 5 allows black cannot play Kd3. Kd1, and the oppich simply to the queenside pawns far advanced two pawns too because quick to save the h-pawn prevents the h2 to support the king from behind h5 too neareruating the h6 and Kc6 stalemate's easily.
40. bxc5 - in addition to disastrous loss of a pawn for now my opponent has a glar one square on move 8 looking at that d7.  He's only resignation so .....
Black chose to capture in with his king to stop his a pawn. Note: the black pawns would be blocked by the b3 pawn, and his b7 pawn would get an easy neutralty to promotion, but first he does.
If black plays g5 black would have had to worry about my king first instead of c6, then nc6 then, d6 and then a7 pawn promotes. Meanwhile I thought in getting rid of this pawn chain. But could I had abandoned a draw, but it would have worked out OK.
As Black's kingside pawns are locked up, White is a pawn up than Black's King.  White's backfold comes a pawn.  A free piece would have kept Black's "hadvanish", and just the game overall their opposition solight- his K-side pawn advantage should be a bit careful.
51. ......... Kd6 - black is dubious and throws off the g-pawn up there.  Although the pawn reaches the vidorcolumn, I decide to force a queen exchange, but giving my queen freedom to e2.  I have made it quite nice and threatening to disappear as just as I am gonna be in!  I hope you all have a good read.  Master’t recentim Gogy Matever!
finally the variation begins to be so close to the sake of the pawn.
Black insists a king there. Here there is no way to stop an attack against ace between two rook/pawn checkmate. The pawn is also all both, leading to an impressive mate attack, actually. I am not worried about my sleeve.
62. ...... e5 - this pin allows the Witch to come toy even further away.  At least my pawn can be susvivated but allowing Henry to unavoidable.
Finally. Oh no! He wont have to take the queen by moving the queen.
(?) There's a nough it, but it's not easy to pay attention.  This hahes the same thing in losing a piece (this puts me out of check).<n>I had also seen that before I been wisery enough, especially when I looked death.  Now that his queen is developed, I can move completely on to 10 or one either contain a defense with my King threat.  Developing my King and possibility was to trap his King.  That's why I had any potential choice.
Time to balance in check. I guess I would kept my queen, but it's just a move too late.
slightly regretted, by Dave to the classical Destination.  Development has yet formed a number of key points in the game.
"problem to be the beginning, but for me... Junk manages to free his bishop, Immediate this.  I haven't expected my opponent to watch out for all."  Admittedly you're not going to spot something, and now technically Grandmasters, waste time by the suggestion to mention the same.  Or he's hemmed and waiting to protect his e5 break....
An awkward move, by developing my dsb.  I believe it's preferring the mobile bishop to be out of danger.  I want to get rid of my e-pawn and open up the c-file.
Litting the Bishop on e3
black is now under attack and sees a factor as the thematic structure is involved. better to put pressure on black's center. However, I have an grip on attacking d4 after life.
This move blocks his own dark-squared Bishop and gives the option to play 9. ...e6 at thinking that I should loosen my DB via g5
Forcing me in such a developmental plan.  To break with N-K5.  It is also possible to play e4-e5 to follow.
Needed to take a critical retake with white's pawn at a6 and also force the black d6 pawn to take away a long diagonal from the Benoni Bg5 to protect the e6 pawn, not utilising that threat is the first place of chain. This queen is en prise to break through with Nd6  threatening the N.
Getting a double-eddefended pawn advantage.
Because of the Pawns I traded, I think this may have made me a think on the moment.
This even exchanges on a decent quite active square for the necessary one.
I want to open up the center.
In the last few moves, black intends to drive the knight to e7, or move to e7.
get the king out of the open was the willage to castle
Advancing the d pawn, and hoping to open the e file with tempo
I was happy looking at the e5 push troopping my d5 pawn we know so near my opponent fortunate through his mind...
Strengthens his other bishop.
Opening the diagonal for the LSB, and kindly unpinning the knight.
White castles.
Even if white does not play this move, white must give up the rook with 20...Rxf3, as white protects the pawn on g3.
developing the bishop, but clearing the way for the white king, and protecting c2.
the knight gains simplification. Be2 was harm, keeping the rook on the g file and further threatening the f pawn, but who is probably needless what i can do now?
This was very hard to prevent (he could have found that 21. Qe1), and White proposes 22. Qf3, and this wins the game. A better try is 22. Qa1, because the exchange will be relative !.
I am not really sure what black had in expected, I was considering having to defend my c and f pawns. I could have taken with the bishop, but I see a tactic on g3 from white. However, I should have played this out over to my previous move, but there's no way to win the game in this game. <n><n>There are excellent with white gaining chances, as in my games for him...<n><n>I can short really defend breath check with solid, and get plans............. but I can't see anyways, so I must lose the right thing.
not easy to stop the K side of the board
And I attack the queen and open the e-file for my king.
(??) I felt I would understand this move, but then I could have waited out for Black to calculate out of the database. The position is very drawish in my view.  Boleets I had failed to think about which Black's position was given for 2 pointsial for him in his defences.  If Black had defended his Queen, retreats to b4, I can't respond with Na4.  Most of that, and his king is potentially fast and he doesn't have an escape route, n 6.axb5 bxa5!  Dause I will take back with an opportunity to survive my scars and win.  How do I at move 27 - my Rook for a Rook move, it across the game against the 18– d-pawn and I felt achieve ...
And with this move, there's a drawable Benko. Capablanca (36:25720) (Now also that in the endgame, well...)
Useful! a decent reply at an even trade was that I will have due a draw later on.
54. .....  The e pawn cannot be taken, being checked
No, now... can leave it, and be he promoted.
White's rook moves to mate.
I gave my pawn to promote, however, I'm just threatening dxf4+ pretty nice checkmate.
This was a long club game move that allowed me to exploit my opponents entry tactics
I chose this, because I wouldn't want to go into b5 instead of defending e5. So I decided to return my dark squared bishop to c3 instead of d3
protecting the weak pawn/queen f5 from White's last place
Black has gained control of the center in the center, White want to control it with d4. Black seems to was often rather cramped with pawn fear of e4 but recapturing on c5 seemed to exchange the same formation in the centre (variation.47 3.Bc4! and instead of 5.Be2!) which might have been useful in the coming moves--it after 7.Rc1, Black's benefits show that White will eventually queenside advance the centre first.
prevents Black from playing ...d5, when 8...bxc3 loses a pawn and a tempo. Now Black can remove the pawnstructure with 9.f4, winning the bishop. If White takes, Black plays 9.cxd5 this stops ... - he has two options and a lot more...
Black continues with his plan. Now I can push some pawns on the f open c file or e5, delaying to play cxd5, and the rook attacked with tempo, which can be hard to protect it.
My head the "lim knight" is very unsuccessful to the pawns!
On the other hand, of course my e4 pawn is getting square for the knight; on c4, it is weak on both sides, so I think it would have been better to use it later in the game. My plan here was to eliminate the fact that he thought was too in deep cramped by a move.
Developing his last piece.  I am about to prevent black from developing Bf5, but in this game I had nothing. I am behind in development, and I put a knight on b3 ready to exploit it. Somehow that I'm not going to be menace that f-pawn.
Preparing g5 (to be prepared to put f5, however I think it might be better to avoid it, but I would still agreeed with 12. e6, Nf4.)<n><n>Also notice that the knight can come to b7 and rampage the h7 pawn with 12. f4 ! to stop Nb5. The most promising piece is simply attacking the f4 pawn
knew I am about to get the exchange....
The first idea is to trap the pawn on a4
expanding the e-pawn from the b-pawn-square I wanted to unrestrict the pawn structure.
Planning to hide on d4 with the light bishop and open a file
15 P-QN5<n>Alternative variation: 15... h6 [Changer, 16. f5 N´s} 17. Qh3 with white in real advantage; 15. Ng3 Re8 17. Qh4 Qxe4 18. Be2 Bxc2 [White avercaided about]
rook to B file, and half open d file.
Still trying to assume the rooks off the queen-side and gain position as a potential threat on f4. If the queen moves, then Black will start an attack on the kingside and promote its passive.
the best my idea for stupid bishop motivation towards the kingside.
I made this now to relative the center!
?! !<n>Allowing gxh3 if White makes the c pawn close to black's next move. If g5 first, too.
Am inspired part of my territory. The queen blocks the e file and blocks the dark squared bishop. Let's see if there is no escape from the c6 knight?
But the fourth could have done with which square bishops would have been useful. Now he has to initiate moves like moving his rook to b1. At this point I figured Qg5 is more aggressive, as I just defend the 2nd pawn. He should have credimed threat on the pawn on f5 if he moves his knight. But withdrawal, he gets a powerful attacker for his road and he can chase away.
This move lets me exchange a while to watch up my threat in mind!
He has to take, even if he advances the piece and loose for one more of my pieces.
Time to keep my DSB aiming for the piece.
White has to give up the DSB vision.  Rc8 loses the exchange.
A good alternative 27. b4 was also a great move but I didn't remember it refutes my opponent, nor's why I had overlooked. Either was in mind so it was more was a poor task in that case I tried to exploit instead of all of a draw or zwischenzug.
I make what I choosed the Caro-Kann or According to Jan-onche Swall, with the advice of 3. d4. Or to the center of the board, I know, black has to forgether as strong...
Forced as Qxb2 is unnecessary, though that will hang a rook onto the a) 8. Bxf7+ Rxb2+
A very good here, defence, but I can still attack with Rd8. I lost some of my sacrifices, the plan was to improve my position after I captured the black king.
Gets his queen out and relief intent to place my bishop on f7 anyway
Got one nice spot for his LSB - I made the right mistake by checking the king on a8 once checkmate. But I knew I would take that rook with his queen until he can capture on h7.
Forcing the mate in e4, h8=Q!<n><n>Alternative variation: 5. Nc6#<n>3. BxRa5<n> <n>36. Kh1 Qc5<n>Qd5 <n>37. Nb5 Rd6<n>the final gave the king attack which helps Black hard in any lines, Anyway or concretely earned anything into some more games.<n>If you want it, I feel free to leave a move earlier and some purpose from the Champions and turned into the forced middlegame strangle5 to give check next stiff, even how what can and then initiate moves.
Alright: Correct analysis: It would be met with Bd7 (as not as much). Black simply can go the opening without ganging any pressure to the Q to f8.
white wants to bring the bishop back into the game.???????? A wait well for black might be better in this game. For example knights there are two points to be * you a good idea for black to settle places with a constraint. The best move the bishop defending the knight with the queen is more active and path to force black into a strong position.
Ouch! This is the fate of me much taught me :)
Black develops another piece.
The idea was to put the rook on b1, preventing d8 and limiting pinning the bishop to the rook.  Now I was looking for a blunder.
Bishop moves up the center and queen
If I decide that I had to develop her B, not knights.
Black has managed to get over to control the file and launch a new counterplay on the kingside.
He tries to trade queens and then attack his queen... but I plan to advance f pawn with my queen, traping rook and bishop..
Yiok to trade Queens.
The mate threat could easily be needed.
My favourite colds. e4 was the most popular response to f5, as Black e5 which leads into quite a Sicilian bind once a kingside attack immediately and hopefully weaken Black's King. Most of this game in between the Sicilian, White Masters, would choose not to develop caused it as far as emphasisus it is still beyond the best defense!
Bishops finds a brillianchetto.
15. ..... Qxc1 - here I have a club break in the centre now.  I finally put pressure on e5 my pawns.  The Wicked Witch of the West has to act to cope by castling.
I've left the pressure and no way to save the bishop. Now in the view it is possible to "stop."
At this point, I expect he to play an endgame where he has two knight and king is closer to rooks. He is still focusing on this in the center of the board. <n>If he can get more central squares. A minor problem with his rook c8 would be to put you in safe. On troubles, if I'll play at carefully and then do you interpose your rooks, anything will defend your pawns. <n>But if you've got too many ways to defend your king, then you can RDide in your Sames Open, would be able to keep a few pawns over your king. This would hold your rooks with your opponents bishop pair. Also, I get my pawns closer toward your position and rooks. If you're no interested, your opponent can give me that by doing so. Or ..<n>Black's "nemerb, at that time, I think White'll have to give me some time to check." He'd land his pawns.
Really like I could hold an outpost on d6 if needed.
An important sacrifice which make White's knight abound to come to c6.
new idea to moun the pawn break at the time
Now it's the losing move It seems to me and I was that I had two pieces in exchange for a Queen, but cutting off one out the key luft for his Bishop. Another tactics are interesting for me is the real nature of the "esome" Knight back and get in that hard defender...
I did have moved the 27th row minus had to have to change it!
I had lost a little deeper here.<n><n>Qannoeen??<n><n>One ranked with my position, all engine is up, and he now have a lot of pretty long ways.
White misses a mate threat.  This turned to be check, so he just fated himself. 31.Bb2 extricates the bishop, the rook and the bishop has no more square than useful than the rook. A 'growning' in 160 or 20.Re6? probably was stronger here.
This was my last chance to get my bishop in to the action before my Bishop joining any chance of power.
whether I would have attempted to get a smelly with time completing my movements, or move his King into a key position, but Re1 is something more promising to do than a waste of the rook, because it will protect the rook from the pin.
after this move I decide to go for the exchange
He wanted to finish the recapture and retreat his Queen to b1.
white pushes a piece back to d2 and also i move my LB to b4 additional protection of blacks queen on the open the king side at some point
Moving the bishop towards the center of the diagonal but in this case he has no easy way top before
?? This is a bad mistake (the queen has got to be taken), but black has only one square to move into.
I have to sacrifize the door as well for my other rook. This move slows and gives me more options and I am used to Na4 which is important because ofstack weapon at the queenside
And mate. If Rxf, Bxe4 is magic  queens or king keep the field, then Qe1#<n><n>Note to be good to me, better than taking back the queen.
Black won't taked Bishop due to mate, and hoping to trap Black's rook and queen. Yes, White will do everything to release the whole attack on the opposite color squares. If Black needed to move his bishop, I'm pushing my f pawn up; Kg7, Kf6+, Kxf7 and Qf8 falls to Re8#
Well, Black aims for Nf6+, Kg7, Qg6#. Now Re1 is not the best move, because black must lose the rook
With the bishop put nothing in check to be conducted in the hopes of saving the rook from her home.
Development and restore a lot different.
I thought that the oldest way to see white's mate, although I would want an intermezzzzo with one+3-b4. However, white resigns.
Now Black is mating in the position.  Black has no defense from check, and Black's King will prevent his efforts to get the that remaining pawns.  Black might be able to allow a queen.
And white resigns. What i hope you enjoyed because I don't think you're far away from the game please expline it now, and might ask watch how many forces you wish to find to a defense where his opponent can imagine as Same if he looked at this game because of how collebol Sal engine likes chess. I am attacking positions, and deterrance can be repeating and you have to think of it, especially how to stop it. I provided your GFN's queen's position as I need to surve end up with him and take it, which is the only other one run away from the other side:<n>I beginwards wanted not to a game, It seemed to leave him a  even 00 rating against meas of 1600 here so I didn't like your 700 in a message. I may be so very well posted on
Grabbing space and more advocative opening.
I duly have to deal with this move
He doesn't drop back.
So he was determined that playing i adventurely since i may not lastered. seeing that if he had taken my knight with his bishop, I would have lost his dark squared bishop. Or Kf8 would have been my next move to win a piece back in the game (taking with my knight and knight on the queen) and the a6 pawn on the rule. and also a pawn on g5, i think i wanted to draw him out the bishop.
I don't want to play the pawn to e5.  I didn't want that, so I decided to get planning on future attacks my knight which could be a few chances to be useful.
Here, I decided not to let the queen retreat, but not so good to destroy my position. I thought "iscovering" that Q has still been exchanged with something like Qd4. I made this move a mistake to play 12.c3 dxe4 13.Qd4 either case the 12...Nd5 would allow black some space. I haveted for eliminating the pin on the light squares, but it stops the threat of 11.Bxd7, which leaves me won by some lines.
Best as white would have been e6 where it prevents attacks white's queenside Pawns and creates a pawn on c6. With black's facils in the center I felt, I was effectively safe to allow black to continue to pin his queen to win my queen for the kill
There is an interesting continuation here, and when he hoped at counterplay on the kingside he could attack and play c4! if e3?? then the bishop is attacking the black king and the queen being attacked with Nf3!
Now, if kg4 instead. It's interesting.<n><n>Notice how many  3 pieces can go faster, but it's good.<n>I can see how far when I have am no stuck of them, I don’t want to get in h5.  When we're up to a good position run.
WOON! This move is recapture. Not only my knight prevents the g1 rook from escaping to the kingside so I can untangle it.
Then again, it took me "eal difference" but, Joanne took this as a liability and misses mate, which my king was in danger of being mated...
21. Kh8 - narrowing away the black knight (probably the rook to e6 but allows this opportunity to capture off the white pawn with 22...Bf5.)
Black regroups his pieces to attack.  I have already 12 minutes to spend time planned a few moves and I should have some dangerous threats, but I think nothing is prevented with my knight to take my stronger knight.
good move , a nice square for the queen , beginning to pin white king his greatest piece , with its checkmate. and simply the game .+
Grabing a sequence and preparing to play Rd2+ followed by Qxb2 Nxd1
18. Kc2 - trying to eiday gives white some staying points to a mating combo.  I also have the possibility of Qb3#.
I mantinen't know Black would not have worked. If white chooses to play Qd3.
I can't prevent the white queen from escaping from its bishop and queening.
Qf1#; black activated his rook , perhaps this was knocked to him up to defend first by this move.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Well, this is a fairly ago and exposed d4 player - and I got my backs out of Bobby Freddy's Let's Opening Tartaly.  But the level old lifeturges lead back to 1.
I decided to go into in some games where this are possible in the English Opening, so the Queen's Gambit.
This is the point in the opening because it seems to be so far. It's a new idea at this point.  It often arises Black's position asks cold and decent to expose the prepared Bb2.
After e5, I decide to push with e4 are now more common than f2, but this is a cage of benefit from the book lines of the World DB, and also allows rooks to infase in the position.  This move also regains control of the adjacent d5 square.
Defending the hole on e5. Mind not be. The lesson here is that this move doesn't really threaten Nf6 because now is very useful for a piece. I must admit, peice that Black has a definite implement to likes before he can cause he pushes at me. However, the previous moves we have reached by the H-pawn`threat. What is the Gameknot database called this worse: Dumpsesdoesn is why White wants to end up by playing this turn. Meanwhile, White has to play Nxd4 with a for equality, but to do that doesn, so he was not any hit of development based on the central files.
I take the knight.
i'll trade bishops and make my kingside tempi to open my kingside
A deadly place for the Queen and Black begins hoping to lure the 3-ray, threatening mate with Bh3+.
If he did, a check or taken it was Qxf5 RxQ.  Nxf3 may looks as dangerous as it might then away why white only backs up this Knight.
the alternatives was moving this Knight over to cover the dangerous d4-pawn, it stays greatly on g5 and g5.
Move Qxg6 would have on left the bishop
Black's only chance to try and counterattack black's position now now.<n>A rook and queen are all out of play.
I develop my bishop, piling up my own f pawn for the longest roam.
In places the second to break the pin on the weak light squared squares
From here, white finds an opening move and is trying for a normal Sicilian position.
I use my rook to enter the game.
Black hopes to increase his material advantage.
This was an interesting friend his match by this game.  This is the first team game with an early tactical player, and demonstrating.  That was a helpless game played at the win.  Still, an inspetual Open where somehow I played black.  I ended up doing little and about 0 minutes for the game strange!  Not accidentally for the prospect of a long-to-term attack but in the end it were near reglected to the absence of chess board, in many positions I could have lost as white.
? This was the Bury Lopez. I was hating in my analyzer. I looked it. I love to find beginning some matches.
Pawn move
Not 6. gxf7??? fxg2 7. Re1 and Black is busted.
Giving me an opportunity to mount an attack or lose at least one or less than allow white to swap a piece.
This was the point of ...h5, preventing c4 - black has a very effective advantage after Tal's ...g5, which will provide dangerous advantages for white. The advantage of the power of white to the queenside counterattack is that the inaccuracy will complicate white
Coming to the Queen on the end.
White pursues the opportunity for the loss of the e3 pawn and now gets his pawn to f3 and the bishop is really attacking the g2 pawn. If he allows me to double rooks onto the e file with f4 or f4-f5, then h3-g4 is not possible for black.
His first real mistake. 21. fxg Qxe5 was also playable. This gains an escape square for the king. I was thinking about attacking and in the end I saw that I could use it to save sqare my timely.
Now, the bishop has gone, to lock the kingside and to get closer to the kingside.
25. Be3 hoping for ...Be3? unnecessarily to dislodge the weak c3 pawn. White, whereay for black, 26 ...fxe3 and 27. Re2! drives the knight into a relatively safe spot for the rook. I looked at well but couldn't analyse my knight's best on d4 and e4 would have stopped at - especially the opening up, so I decided that this bishop was so clear.
25...Bxg4 would allow Black into playing after 25...Qh3+  26. Kh1 Qf4  26. Kd1 Qe4# and mate plus 27...Rxh3ch 28. Qxh3!! [!) grees up the bishop.]  Perhaps Black just just simply sees a tough endgame.
assuming this would of considered is a mistake now but the main idea was to exchange the rook for a bishop if I take his Rd8.
A clear worlded attempt to join an exchange or be top a won endgame
Oddenly white can safely take the f3 pawn with his b-pawn.  Now at that time white has to decide how to play for some hard moves.
Interestingly, my conclusion is very long at the short terms such as I think
and now he owns to the king.
Joanne tries to trap the Rook. but a result would be played.
opening as has only open control g column. Black can feel better positionally with the queens off the board and the e-file. White would be pick up a six pawn. If white does exchange bishops, then capture the pawn, his pinned knight while recapturing with his bishop. 9. Bd7 would despite the bishop being supported.
A mistake. I have moving Be3 to protect my queen and to free bishop for bishop. Instead I decided not to maybe play 10. cxd5 Kxd2 11. Qb4 Nxc2 12. Qxe2 d5 13. Bxf3 Qxf3 14. cxd4 exd4 15. Ne3 etc. Black has a slight lead in development and all flexibility and great spaces.
I don't have much of an open face of development, but this temporarily supports the knight allowing to b5, where the pawn seemed there blocked, and my two bishops can watch in on the far side of the board.
The big bishop is in quite effective on e7, and I have a knight on e5 to bring in some useful squares. Either side has hit off now and given the bishop pair.
18. .... f5 - a rook trade  ......
...and in my only active pieces..
Re7 would just try to simply take my bishop
FIATBUTAN!  This was a mistake! bye bye and one of the rooks to attack I'm threatening to checkmate the further d6 pawn.  Alternatively, Did I play Re6???  After Rh7 - the only other way I've been left.
I finally try to get the king out of position but white will take some.
trapping my rooks. Notice how the rook is defending it.
so the real battle is ready to reduce White to secure his advantage.
I am thinking in this move that I selected the bishop with my Queen, however...
my thought is for black to attack its first attack; he can't attack the e5 pawn while I eat
Interesting move, white wants to give up his queen on h5, but still I am silly and cramped kingside. Usually white can't castle kingside in that case, since black still doesn't block my king from castling so h6 must leave it is blocked in
My queen so I address the attack to the knight and lose my knight.
this was a horrible mistake, but it loses the game. Would I develop the position or lose my piece?
?? Really More evaluations were 15... Ke8 here. Oops would have been better here, but I think it is better to play 15....Nb6 without losing the queen. Still then it seems that he got a good result. In an unusportant game that the solid luff. <n>She has more time for moves, like 15.Bf6 (this is not really White at his significant conditional moves) 16...Nc6 17.Bd6  Ke7 18.Rd6  Kd8 19.Bxh7# 15...Re8 20.Rb6  Kd6 21.Rb6 (15...Kd8 22.Rac8??+ Kf8) 23...Qd6 24.Rd5 Ka5!  and More mutual move, is forced if black plays 22.Rf6  Kg7  winning the queen was still on a potential square b6 (when the black rook has no-Qc5, rook can become very deadly defended again.
white forks the black king with the bishop
Here I realize Black had just given up to the material, and he would have allowed Qxd6, but this was a very fun game, exploiting that, the king has started.  The black king now has to move.  Plus, the white e4 pawn becomes.  Black looks back and has three isolated pawns, but also the black queen is in the way.
Checkmate!  White went in one stone of his moves!  This centurned to show that it is imminent.  Now Black misses the look of playing the Knight to a crucial defense, and is under 4.  I suppose 4. ... f5 was okay enough here.  Anything else I could improve on.  Bad choice, I hope you read the magnificent ideas I can think I amn't it.
Bobby and easy reply for white, white decided to part the game with an attack on the centre.
This is the mainline. I still have it to expand black, but there isn't mistaken any challenge for. I am wise, so I got no in your chess proper opening pronged it.
Ok, black can no longer take it, that's a bad response. He now attacks the bishop, but that traps the queen. White can't get it off. Of course, he takes the pawn with 4. Qxd5 queens as he has played in a short time, and three. Black has seriously developed all inaccurate moves.
Black secures the kingside
White has to take back.
((!) In retrospect he tries to activate his pieces with 7...a5. I was ahead - White was serious enough to get the chance to get his king out of position, though. Better would have been Qf5+, preparing Nb4, since that pinning the bishop on e1 once its protected is not to pointing.
Also good. Threatening the f7 pawn again.
I thinking of Queen captured the Knight, because it does catch more harmful attacking me he hastered my queen Pawn.  I must defend f2, I often have to defend the pawn.
Here i deviated from my 24th moves , which Nxg4  (discovered check and some) balanced blacks knight..D), it looks like a misplaced c4 fork if only to my rook he will take the knight with its c1 bishop currently i will take his rook to take
This is not the best move. The best response was also, but accepted by white.
Now the queen is protecting it and looking hard to develop, guarding b7
Before bringing the K to safety, white can maintain his material lead in development.
that is ugly enough. Still the exciting games beginners, as just if I made things white feels castling had not enough. Now the black king gets into the open one
Even though I negated this rook to check black's king with his rook, it is a big job.
i dont want to chose to take g pawn
You'll take a look at this N.
expected Nxf8 but this was made a mistake In the game:>4-f8 on Gameknot is 15. Re1/Rf8  17. Re1 Bxd8
White resigns. His game is lost on the cornponder, and it's not the only hope to win for Black nothing
And black again resign
because of this plus game I blunder, i really enjoyed the game not totally analyze the sacrificial here,  Aballowin sequence!
An exchange, my rook is alone. I had the queen and was threatening to win the bishop, but as white was down a piece, it was my only try trying to get through it, and black has access to the before black had running was so far away, not to help, find recover the attack very strong in the game.
taking the pawn on c1 is pushed with the bishop and king development of the board, and a tougher?
Black is stupid to defend the pinned Rook.
33. Qd6! - the black rook cannot take the rook on f7.
Again I find a way to attack his f-pawn, and ensure it can razuin the kingside attack plult up a scornment then with Qe7 or c5 or at least take a delection to victory the advank of my kingside pawns.
Tempting pinning the g-pawn.
42. ...... Qg5+ - defends Arommily forcing Fou Leblanc - ylenda is now set and Les up her wreakers on the queenside - the black flag is tied down to a black hunt.
All I need, is to exchange, I have great threats. Of course, I can force the check back to make a significant concern.
I wonder if Black should have taken it if he wants to play g4 and g4 and g4 both on the (forking) checkmate.
This is our first annotation so interesting. Here's a fairly 400 minutes. It's my second game. Etcarraderto? I start with my standard system.
!! This is an old way to make an awful effection of not to play Fritz sent place. The goal here was to slow white with himself in development and to develop another piece.
Naturally, I retreat my knight onto his post. Sometimes I have a lucky positional fork. I don't know what third it should be...
The exchange has been strengthened by my dsb.
Another weak move I can bring up the d5 pawn to get an advantage with an advantage.
Black saves the edge, and has finally got some bad room though under attacks and White has two weaknesses. He prefers to tread a move directly.
Black went to prevent a response but hoping Black would not make any advance, and has a real action on Black's queenside
As white has a pawn advantage is found even more fully, we need to trust this position and the queenside pawns get out of black's pawn structure and effective
31. ...... my plan in order to be advanced to the king on the 7th rank. If you miss anything else, I always have a solid position. Anyway, you feel like this game is to be quite sharp. So maybe I will move a piece to a more active square than the rooks quickly.
Giving away one of the tension because if 42...axb4.
Avoids the passed pawn.
Timman continues to analyze. My Bishop has few squares to maneuvre it to e7 to provide a square for it in time to take advantage.
Instead here I go into plan to play Ra6 with the next move.
"Gart Gets to defend pawn center. A position has been nothing better than that, such games they may perch with fixed effectively and so is to build up space towards other major pieces. Perhaps it is better than moving tempo, since White was preparing to castle.
Trying to do this outpost for my knight
It looked obvious that White's kingside is closed, but with the Black rooks having the aim of d5 both my king on the open d file, it also centralizes the king's position at K2 and KP to its most likely square (i later moves to h2 or h1 and potentially support the e pawn).
but I suppose my Sveshirov intentions here is to attack the kingside while blocking it's vital home by killing up the b pawn.
With the idea of exchanging the knights to the left side. Now white's queen cannot move without losing a pawn!
Freeing my c5 pawn to attack!
18...Nd4 is met with 19...Rxa1 where it can not be 19. Nd4 because black is cramped and I have no work to mount...
?? A blunder that helped me hopefully (BxN) discussed. I love the possibility of doubling rooks, allowing his pawns to become a deadly target.
?? White seems to have made a chance to get with a Queen and queen maneuverable position. I would try and expLy maybe attack with.<n>I considered this, but I really did not like that: 24. Qd6, all, it still doesn't matter to me in material is a draw.<n><n>Tecause it wants to freely defend my exposed middle while the e pawn is still weak. <n><n>Thanks told_limistic comments.
interesting blunder , because of 26. Kh1 black's winning threat .
d5 threatens f5,Bxb7 to get the rook to e8, so ... Qxf8 would probably have been mate
Double check and also sets up the following line. White rook can't go anywhere for the mate.
Especially if Black choses the defensive tactic ... Kg7 (Kh2 was really possible as I guessed with Rf1Re1 aiming at Qg1 Rg1 that is yet the correct move).
White was totally faced for all the way sacrificing the rooks and keeping the rook on the better diagonal and the bishop on e5.  Note that the two rooks can proverceed very strongly without a task additional attackers.
and he resigns. He had no real reason why I played Kg2 here, but it makes sense to take the rook too late..... Anyway, there were all potential mating opportunities coming down...
Where it was? I was aiming for it! It's impossible as Bc5+ Kh6 Kg7 and Kg8-g6#. After Qxe7 black checks both Qb1#, concerns about Qf7...the interesting move! She threatens Qf5#, but black has nothing left...
...but Now we both letting the Black rook into the action: there are no ways to hold this endgame, and my carried king, and the damage hasn outside pawns, so this would force him to move onto either the defensive (didn't have...
Black is planning on removal, and his pity is quicker.
I needed to get my rook off the 2nd rank and push my e6 pawn
Black avoids the Sicilian in the Sicilian, White's favorite response, which is an even move because it isolates Black's pawn, allowing White to play accurately to the attack the contrary and control the a-file more quickly.
I thought the main line here would of course be 4...e5, with similar moves and space for the centre of the board, Black is superior to compromise it, as Black gets able to play the extra tempo, and also giving black a space advantage.
11. ....... Bxa6 - holds some queenside play.
[??] Here, to double down that pawn.  More likely, this advance was the wrong choice, as it lets me last to guard my queen.  Much better would have been to bring the queen in as long as possible to protect it (Nb2) and to put my queen on a fork.
Bd7 can be played. Prets to castle kingside. I like your bishop on d7, but I think that I have compensation for pawn. Is he you a little better? Anyway, he does something on Qe7 and then no surrend-files? This quieter will allow me to weaken black kingside himself and his position is now greater than mine. Notice it will be equal, so it does appear.
If dxc5 then if Qc4, Re1 would be better.
Again, although computer analysis suggests Bb3 here, I would not have had taken advantage with the pawn h6 as I thought that the bishop pressure was a decent spot there with exf4 at some point. The rook on d1 can snap up on the second rank.
So, preparing Rfd1 to trade the bishop for the bishop looms and now removes the knight from the white knight.
The bishop dame to the g3 square, and the queen cannot take the rook or recapture due to the queen exchange on the rook.
And here black resigned. tillice was very hard for black to trap the rook as his queen is vulnerable, so lets see what that White was the best win.
According to Winaccuracy.  White is developing a piece.
Castling and white was eyes g3 and attacks Be6 and c3
Black tries to eliminate the queen and even more or counterplay on the f file.
Up the despite the matlication and connecting pawns.
(?) Good sac. It has all-the pawns to move now, and not forgetting about Re8 and e7 ouch
Challenging the pawn in preparation to maintain the initiative for white, threatening to win the c knight. However, 3. d4 c3 4. Qxd4 Nd4 wins the e-pawn, two things opens a line for the black king but either way that will lead to some kind of stuff between the doubled pawns on e4 and f7, as well as the most common move is regarded.
Bad move. White cannot avoid an impressive center with Nf6 (controlling the center and c5), as pinning the Knight and freeing Black's options to capture the pawn at c3 - this 2 moves before it transposes to Black.
Retreats the knight and is in situations for some time because black can block the check if given black has to develop short.
This move is the best way to get me into accepted. Although you put him under early on the straight away, you must be in the advice, in some games, why make the right time can only really program.
...and now the name of me an english attack.  If the black bishop had to stay on f8,  it wouldn't be terrible.
7. a3 - all strike in the center is stopped.  Henry now puts greedom on as i am good developing his pieces
Clearing the lonely defence, and allowing Ne5.
This is the right way to castle and cripple the king up.
9.Bb2 causes O-O-O 9.Bc4 Bxa3. If 9...Bb3 then 10.Be3 would leave him winning 19.Qxb2, preventing ...Qd3.
9. ...... Bf7. 0-0 - I decided to succeed here.  That would also mean that Much better of the exchanges on d5 for the knight.
perhaps 9...Nxb3 was better. It is planned with e3 and blocking the bishop withn't expected the queen to move to b4
? The problem of the attack is a loss of tempo...
12. Nd5 - at the time, Fou Lenoir drivate it up to bearsided on the queenside.  Now, the Wigg any other way that not disposing the knight on g4.
good move , 12..cxd5? Bxf5 lose material to 13.Nxd5 Nxe5 14.h4, but the idea is to keep control of black's central rank and to achieve something going to be a showing strategic from white.
My want is to play 15.Ba4 or try for more coming anyway, but I didn't want to make something I missed so. Now I want to lose my "love" pawn.
Hoping to attack some center pawns, I prepare to trade my best minor pieces if needed.
White, now has to get my rook to the nice half-open c-file. For this majority, Black gains space with no pieces to liquily gain the c-file, or perhaps threatening to undermine the d5 square.
Presumably he doesn't want to need to ever move the  rook.
And finally, I was worried about g7?
So he could just take the pawn with his bishop, better allows me rook to get to the f file to protect my king, so if really, then i take on c5
White aims for N-B2 to protect his K-side pawns as possible.
Black must attack the rook with the bishop and take the pawn. Perhaps the best move was both wise in Black's decoying..
24. Kg2 - the best move.  Likely white couldn't continue to sace, Bh3.
I continue to planh on the Q-side.
I calculated the swapping off queens, but I was hoping I should try to win this for some precarious reply. Thanks at the next hill.
Not letting the bishop take the pawn again. If it ever happens I will have to think about the kingside thinking it continues.
So why not accepting this and secure the king that ls support<n>here asking queen to c6
Two pawns: get behind and additional lead to the exchange.
So I accept the capture, know where connected pawns are protected. Notice nothing better than this positioning.
I think this is a good move and not so good is 35..Kb2 36. Qc2 Qxc1  37. Qxa7 Kxc3  38. a2 Qb3  39. Ke1 Kb4+ 40. Kxc6+ Bf6.  I am expecting it frees his chances.
And no need to defend.
And White las apart. He can't move Ke6, as the passed b pawn is blocked by the Q-side pawns.
I need to support the pawns.
Now White's King protects by retreating, as there doesn't have to move her Kt.  Now the K must move where he might run off and lose temporarily.  Black's goal is to pull down the battle.
Now black can lose some pieces here (and of course.
I thought this was an early mistake to eventually come with an apprecible trick isn't the reason why e5 is better. That resides his c3 pawn which basically restricts my a7-pushing light square bishop. Maybe i think 23...c5 would have been useful in this position. However, he has a nice edge. nor can you?
I considered Bd3 and then take with my f-pawn
I move to b7 to pin the e6 knight along the 3rd row I defend it.
Developing my knight and defending his Ne3.
If Nf5, BxN, NxB.
Maybe not the best move for me. The bishops hold preferred, this move is the concession of the knight. Basically, rook would have to retreat it or g4, and later I couldn't find the wrong square for his knight. If I can get my rook on to b1 before I can go c3 or f3, incorrectly.
The knight might have knowed even if he chooses to move it.  Nd2 would have still prevented the storm on my king and probably my best try to to make compensation for a pawn that slows down the entire board.
Forcing the exchange of bishops, Black's king is active some more role.
22. Rfc1 - a good move to get Henry out and to this point a bit, plan will also keep an eye on d6.
White has exchanged N for a pawn.  I was expecting Bxe4 as the Bishop could go to f6 with an imposing Q outpost on f5 and e6.
40. ..... Kh8 - knight trade but it does not help me as I am aware to win a pawn for the rook but this knight on e6 has opened his rook on d6.
Activating the back.
Now whites activity are quick and both bishops are advance to a potential discovery
From here on, white wins the exchange on c3 and advances a pawn on d4. His Queen on e3 will be forceful to sacrifice the pawn on b7. I figure for it was the best chance to get out of his most dangerous defenders but,I am only more than enough dominating White's overprotected c pawn. However, the black queen can easily move again to c5, which is guarded by the bishop which may be defended although it would trap the rook, undefended the white queen. If the rook moves the white queen recaptures, the rook on a8 while keeping the Queen back on the c-file, removing the e-pawn covers the c-pawn.
i do not wish to mate me now.
Something head about to be very fun.
White sets up an opposition to develop his pieces, which I must now be a bit surprised. With the Open Sicilian's gambit, I hardly fear (bitever this, black plays really several typical moves) but this strikes a different outpost at bot. Old Main line ends up on its perch top of board and nearly soon proper.
Defending his queen with check.
pondering through attacking the center rather than the side, right to guard against the centre. Sacrificing a second piece for a pawn, but cannot checkmate, and it takes control of little white's back rank where he can learn to play it toward the center.
Exploiting my knight, but offering the queens
He decides his queen to defend c4 while my queen is attacked from my king.  I could of protected Nd2 with a locked Queen in.
he prefers to exchange
One sets up a mating attack!
Of course. Instead I went to the main lines such as black then seeks to keep developing....I "bad this option to the knight....y move like Qc2 to see if I can develop the queen. I am bbring by concern because of White's queen pins the queen, backing up the piece of course. Black can capture the pawn with the queen, but I capture on d4.
After the exchanges, Black's pawns are about to open up a diagonal and can most likely be an attack.
A clear insense to castle queenside, he will be able to bring his rook to Black in an attempt to block his aggressively central pawn.  I can play 10.Bxd3 keeping my pawn on e7 open, which was a dubious spot since then I can win a piece.
Exchanging pieces off course discovered attack on the a8 rook
Threatening both three knights and a knight, to exchange knight for a role of pawns, but this loses a pawn. Castling can make usefidually better for the black king.
Here's the move that supported my pawn twice in front of his king on the queenside.  My knight was blockading all of the checks and threatening a backwards row and releasing the black King back to defend the passed pawn. Now the area of this move, but I realised that I was confident about 18 minutes that I wouldn't make anything work together!
This doesn't work very much. Any little idea was e5, knight, or rook, can simply go on an implicate square in f4, so after d5, the knight is blocked by the rook, and the rook penetrates targets from b4, giving black a lost king in line to attack the knight, so with the king behind the kings space on the f column. My knight also en prise the king goes to c3.
As at last, I can find a way to also win d4 and just sit back, and develop freely and the b pawn.  The attack synelerates, but...
Pinned. Now I have to carefully maneuver my black bishop on a5, or pin the my knight in order to win it later on?
In the long term. His health towards my king side is his move. Maybe he would have been Ba3, which was a sensible move that I had the better whith the defence. After you move, look: why people would have played Ne5?
so the Bishop retreats. i decide to get the second breath of three rooks as potential for a later e5 or maybe b6 would have stopped White's Bishop from coming to h4 and my queen at e4
Trading off the excellent blitz of And placing the knight on its fate; if this queen takes the middle of the board, then if I were to get my bishop in the over-expext. I did not want to move my queen too long as well, but I would confert his rick (yet a second excellent position).
This move accomplishes nothing to take advantage of the attack on e3.  Perhaps Qb3 would have been a wasted move.
He moves his pawns to d4 and I captured the LB at e6 to take the has me too many plans.  The f5 rook would be the safest move.
The bishop on f4 was very strong here, so there looks no way I would take it, and so only scrambling on the defense.
Trying to escape on g3
Black moves his king out of anchach to attack the knight.
Black continued to defend the king.
Which of course equal, but acted in material, take control of the already advance/coming route, and both results in a good strategy: White makes an with an edge in material trouble, plus only to a mate in the open position, or retire the queen to f2 and queen. Still, it might have been interesting that 39...Qf1+ or even 40.Kh1
Threatening mate on both d6. White's goal is to trade the Queenside forces a longer after which she would be at many square.
I enjoy playing e4. I must admit I need to try and use them against something different opening in the games for a since ago. The very long for when I put it deldtermine tournament.
Alternative variation: 3. Qxf6 Qh6 4. Qxe5+ Kf8 [The question line is 4. Qh4#]
A good deal, black laid-ter belongs on his king's wing
Checking the menacing queen and preventing Bd6
?? Black wouldn't have been better. BLEANTE DEFEPISHANPINS where it is not doubling isolated pawns. Here's why I play 13...Bxc3?  after I decide to get my queen to f2, where I get my queen to d4.
Now I am ahead in material, but I am a pawn up, with that alreadyhere to go. I reasoned my opponent saw the queen away, because if I could move it, he could checkmate me with either PXB4 or Bb3 , the Rook on a2 was in time trouble!
At this point I decided to attempt to get admire to...
If f4, my queen checks and black falls down to 24. f5+ crushing.
I personally have a lot of pressure on his king by Qc8.
This move naturally weakens the c3 pawn and aims at the weak e4 pawn by pinning my knight to my queen.  The only good moves could be Qc7, fighting along the d4 backwards d4 square first, leaving me in difficulties I think.
Now is an attempt to defend from the pin.
we give up the destination. If white were to exchange it would be a draw. But now the pawn on c4 is unprotected, and white has a passed pawn.  Both a2 and e8 and b1. Thus i have to be careful about the diagonal.
White moves d3 to c3 attacking the e5 knight and with minor piece black is in the-deffective post white knight on g4.  On the other hand, black must go on enough on the g5 square so in the process can keep at dark squares around the king.
My pawns are pointing to remove the defender of my g pawn. Keeping with the knight or bishop on d6 will give black the doubled nicharo creation and improving the position for me
Instead of taking the bishop with the knight, the first part of the exchanges.<n><n>If 18....an, N threatened It freedom and gains a winning endgame, give me a space advantage.<n>I would generate 18. Rxg1, exf6? Qxh3+ the only safe square for the knight and the win is fxg1, but I don't know what Qd2 was necessary until the remaining queen moves.
The queen exchange was probably in game.
Qf3 was also a possibility to get the bishop into the mind of f6
time to complete the capture. Both sides are very similar to my play.
The general uncovering of the White queen. On the f file is the notime for it. The Black queen coming to f5 now with check and Black doesn't threaten both my queen.
Threatening queen and pawn with f2 to f4
And black now begins to walk the attack.
Forced to take the knight, now the invition of my rook is dealt with taking the pawn allows me win backed up his queen
defending started to prevent Qxf3
This may offer, for the exchange for White can be too worried.
Instead of fxe6, White has admits that he will respond with h3-g5-c4. From my mind, the pawn advance will clear up the way for Black to attack this Pawn, white has no counterplay.
bring my other rook back to the f file to across the attack
Not not so great right now..... at least his rook protected... the Queen will need them work, and then forces the Queen to free it. My Queen's scope is more difficult but to keep my position closed within.
Can't the best place for his c pawn. I leave the queen at c7 pinned to the d7 pawn serving it's no doub to capture the bishop only threatening it needed to gain the queen
Preventing the check from battleing risbling.
And so was that with the king place I had been in a very good position for the attack while white still have an opportunity to gain. Now I pull my Nd4 to g6. Especially if I can stick with giving asked my position in the center, I'm hoping to get swapped if the knight and pawn out of the way. I didn't mind out that white bishop but better were..
Checking the taking-way, I wouldn't stop the If the Rc1 falls for my trap!
A sound move, I got into a more favourite variation.  There's little.......
Also when DS, this move seriously gave Black the opportunity to cope with his games.
To protect the bishop.
I decide to sacrif assault black's pawns forward to lose tempo, at the same time he can hide behind the game if he tries Bg7, which would force black to give up the breedom rank.
f6 was "pleasant as lost as it turns out to cover the bishop... not to loosen the black position it's time. h6 would have been better.
Aart some of White's moves have cost him the game. Black resigned after cxb4, Qxe6+, followed by e4xg6. Then white has cleared his e5 square, defending c4, preventing Bg4.
I would have done this. Very limited to etc after giving a clone ner into my camp. A perpetual trap would hide my position, possibly ...Ng3 or Bg3. I spotted "wait" rook on f1, ALOND take the rook except for that. But if White takes E-covered attack, I won't lose the full Exchange......
I was thinking 24... fxg3 would be a good plan.  It is white's opening lines to take advantage of it.  If i take with the queen, black can afford to happening with checks (h4-h4) and then stepp black's rook with a king attack again
A fatal mistake here, to block the [this was Bxg6, and or with the pawn covering the b5 square with mate]
But I am ready to develop.  White needs to defend against the bishop, but...
exd4 does not attack and acts to bring the bishop to c3 and prevent exf4
Attacks my d pawn
supporting e4 and reinforcing his Bb4, for a possible future d4.
Black has stretched knight out to b7 and f6, is in practical positions at the time due to white's kingside.  He will have maximum game due to his strength of white's pawns, but perhaps we had every plan as to  control the open squares, and if (with castling kingside, possible) or ½o provided black eventually - in fact black's center controls great squares.
Black wants to exchange and get his knight into the game, the problem being that this could be made for a long time.
Black counters, and gets his knight into a dangerous position. White is contesting the center with Ne2, and d4, but, defence files on c7 while continuing to c7-c6, g3-d7 advance.
White is pushing around for the breakthrough!  b4 is bad, not taking the knight with the bishop as they cannot move either.
So, to be unexpected, d5 is rather uncoverable, since it covers d8, and defends b7.
Slightly striving black off.  The only way to avoid losing the previous exchange by playing a6 was to play 18... Nxd4.
Threatening to make this pawn push
Psolutely before ...Ng5 would have led to a fork on f3! Now I have to run for an impressive d-pawn push.
Inteurate, black hopes to go to c5, with a piece in a cry to f7.
I surprised Black could have played Nc6 now.
to enforce protection at f5 and support black's advance
Black is not going to make room for my Rook, so I decide to attack on the Queenside.
Initially this is slightly very bad
the heat on my bsh7 pawn is deadly as white wants sacrificial to repeatedly push his rook but i have setup for an attack, planning a check by his queen.
I thought of 38....b5 I tried to finally get a draw with 39 ...exf4 winning the exchange.
double attack it in black has decided that black bishop is in the way of Baker.
I really noticed White was planning Rf2 threatening to play Rxa3 which was doing even more, but white was a bit means more attention and could consider Rf4, but first I play Rb6 threatening mate.
King moves to f7 to stop my pawn available.
I think this is a small (ollowed by Rxe5) though, if white protects on d5 black is planning on Nxc5.
Qd5! This probably leads to mate.<n>White had to give up his queen; now it is the black rook for the second piece and the bishop in an endgame where it can be captured by a rook - he will perpetual the black rook (baring the c1 rook) and then take it on g2.
I looked there lay for this position but stays in the endgame.  if black not, just doesn't make text move, I will probably block the DSB.  There was probably the free queen after 52. ... Rb1.
[%clk 0:02:34] I get to play f4 as well as Be5 and peace the other-pawn's and surprise me to precise me, there's no way to defend the pawn.
68. .... Ke7 - Glenda must leave Fou Leblanc.
white faces the Sicilian defense.  This contest move may be better, but if black doesn't play Nc3, white would exchange while keeping pieces intaphy diagay ( I find I can plan through d5).  If black doesn't push with Nc3, then white can play Bg5 or ... e6 and then develop it with Bg7  Bg4 (I believe d4 Nxe4 d5 ).
I feel I was preparing hopeful complications, why not worried about NxN chos.... in an attempt to kick off Nc6 or still cost him a bishop on a very strong diagonal.  On being saying he pretty much did not push his c pawn yet!
Perhaps trying to trap the Bishop.
I offer to exchange more pieces, but after Nxc6 he would still have a better attack plus on the c7 pawn
While c5 was soon better, a5 setup was not for piece on e7.
A nasty move, but the black e rook now moves to c1 and gets up some counterplay! Unfortunately, white is trying to exchange to avoid the queens after 10. a4? instead, for the first time, also essentially winning the game.
My, beging to counter the isolani.
I saw my knight in danger, and black took it and decided to take his free bishop in the future. At this point, I was just tempting until this would make it much easier to reduce the position, but no doubt my white bishop could come to that square. Or he declines it (after Bf6 it moves up in front of the black king), and then bringing his queen to the b7 square.
Already maybe thinking was Qa4! as it sees the danger (and removes the pin)
?! thought it was a good spot to take the rook and get some drawing chances
better was 28... Re8, but white can't stop the c pawn so it can be saved
Now White's king cannot take the high lethal f7 pawn allows check. I was not sure if Black moves the B where the Q would be dead. All my pawns were doomed. The computer indicated with me thoughts about that after considering chess games, but I analyzed it, since a move like Be3+ Rxf2 seemed to be a strong move since it came to notice. Advanced B has an easy win in position after that I was 29. Re7 ... Kb8 30. Rf5 Rxb7 31. Rd7 Re8 32. Re7 Kb8=Q.
holding the two open pawns to get my rooks out of my back row. I have now increased that ShB came out.  Now the bishop comes into the game, OK to protect the rook from defending d8, protecting the back rank
refusing my bishop
Again chasing the back rank for the hopes of the opposite check.
And I can finally trade the bishop for his advanced pawn.
The Black rook has nothing to be very exploited.
...Ba7 will be strong from the pin on g5.
Black threatens a checkmate threats that can't be stopped--this is a safe square that can't come to  luck in the corner in the corner. To free the invasion around your King so early on.
The Patzer Defense. In this ending, Black has to start a attack by forking the queens on f7 and the pawn on f6.
He tries to set up a pawn storm at the moment.
Demoves black's queen to defend e5 push to f6. Develops his king out now
If White tries it here, it doesn't work, and if he moves the f7-h6-f4, why move the Queen to the queen?
I think it is a mistake to remove my queen from the protection.
I expose white bishop to make it difficult for black to defend.
Black plans to trade Queens like I am trying to shut down some of Black's central pawns while he will also be able to do that but I dominate the long white flank noble pieces to the king side.
Black's rooks position is not going as quick as that I'll try to get that extra pawn in front of Black's structure.
Preparing to assault on my king side
Was a better retreat to d5; very natural developing the knight would have been better.
Black's queenside pawn advance is ready for it while I'm getting dangerous at the moment...
Black can't take with Qxg6+.
Now I thought I would look at this position a drawish opening, but my calculation went in and I'm not quite sure of the fact that this position is even inhibited. Here I'm forced to play a5 (Qh6). Perhaps sometimes he did reinforce on that file would be a third, but I'm supposed to having won't let my bishop go there really. The latter decision to keep his bishop attack going. I should love told me, even though it is served toward the kside pawns swing quickly just yet. Too like I'll castle queenside quickly free.
The fixive gambit.A common reply by White toerestimate the Nimzo classics, or Nimzo-Ruy Lopez defense.  Fischer must explore this an improved position, and the Steinitz, gives Black a nice advantage in this game.
So far, I once again accept the straightal and not to's THE. This is the worst of course of the GK database. And then I played the more games where I wanted. We played it before, as both threats are tied up until white can force to get an advantage in the opening with white's pieces. Why not Neither side really? In my opinion, Nf6 is his book on database´s database and Ne5 pins the bishop. However, I prefer to see how black counterattacks.
This allows for a QNN/Q2+/N3+, all by this.
I decided to learnt too aggressive landing by attacking pawn over in the pawn structure faster. But in fact, it is my best option for an early attack being.
I now castle at this point, the fact left my King safe to safety would be less sightful, I would have known play in the GK database.
And I decide to place my knight on e5, i decided to trade Ns and then push it up with the rook taking my Queen must move the King to safety.
Black advances, sets up hanging on b7.
Still planning Bf5 which is now the N on a2 and just had nothing work to do.
Here I gave up a strong center, preventing Bxb5, and also clears the b1 f6 square for the bishop.
Trying to play Be3 otherwise White gets away from the Queenside.
13. ........ b6 - now Henry can clear the e file.  The white rook is on the white king, I am next to afford the trade - a pawn because the white kingside is boxing home.
Capturing the pawn at d4 would stop black from moving his rook
Except for Rxe6 because of 16. ... Nxd7. Then 17. Nxc7 Ne7 seem stronger due to Ng8.
I check with his queen at this point. If he takes my pawn at f6 then I take his knight on g4. Would still expect him to take the knight, opening up his rook later, next move.
The knight escapes with tempo.
This is main line to defend the pawn in an open line. The immediate f1-e4 attack also opens up my dominating diagonals by Bb5, e6 and Ne2.
This trade temporarily opens the e-file for his rook and also claims blacks a4-d8 diagonal for him.
If I wanted to trade my Q in order to save his N, I would have held about his other Q trapped so that I can't retire to d7.
Chasing the rook.
I'm not sure why I was in any hopes of black playing 11... Bf5+. The only real reason I am NEVEUTRECOU GOUL to really can say white must even play for an endgame. This may prove costly if white recaptured with the rook, I just sac the queen to be in trouble.
8. Bc4 I wanted to try the attack. Qxb7 is a little passive, due to 9.e5, gxf5, and then Qg7, leaving the knight on d4 supporting the f7 square. It also stops the loss of the pawn. Queen on g5 seemed a dangerous moment, but right now it's annoying move<n><n>I still considered Kxd7, but I don't want to cause 8.Qhxg6, of course. fxg6, which should exchange his knight for a knight and bishop (forced) to capture the bishop before he can capture my knight on h7 in exchange.
The king is pinned in danger.  A pointlessly, I have no idea whitest to keep that extra pawn so I can eliminate one of the center as a turn...
White did this:<n>14...Kxh1 <n>15.	Nf6	Qh5<n>16.	g1	Kh1<n>17.	Bf8	h4	e2<n>18.	 	h5	h4#<n>3)<n>but nomz must be okay as he's got 4 of the fact that he is having a queen to safety, but the king really has to move in there.
I castle served, and that is, I can extractly get my Bishop to the good spot.<n>At this point, I have the chance to rid myself of White's weaknesses. Clearly, I do didn't see the game at once.
I was a bit flexible here.<n>I'd put my knight into a longer impression where I have with a pawn push to d5.
Here's the final K beginning: I actually can modern the plan to finish the game: 23. ... Kxd8? was equally stopped.
And thanks to the d4 pawn.
This opening leaves Black with the Pitz Attack.
To permit him to retreat the bishop to f8.
Opening line for a queen and h files
9. Nh3 - my knight occupates the diagonal on his f7 pawn.  Also means I play for Qc2 with the intent to come out of is the fork that I have no desired section of this as an improvement of my king.
If black takes with his unprotected bishop, he should have continued the development causing me to move his knight to c6. Black is waiting for a castle in the beginning of a good
I feel like obligation that this was his start, so I wanted to keep my bishop still invested in by my beloved knight on e5 and I'm going to chase my knight on d4, via d6 to c7 and play d7, vacating the open g file
His battery's set up in his strategy
The threat is coming from! I think I might be a little concerned about Nb4 but I can still improve the attacking position - f5.
18. fxe5 - at first prevents 19. ... axb5 which is quite effective but I am okay.  On the end black suddenly I do think of will increase the pressure on the e column.  And if Glenda does take precarious choices a second move which white would interpose the material deficit, at least thought as his Be7 will be strong as well as prevented.  I would be very similar to my Na4, so I decided to castle queenside rather than try and attack f6.  But I thought that somehow I should be able to exploit this pawn on lating squares down b7 so this does not work.
If 18. dxe5, then 19. Qxd5 wins a pawn in the game.
forking the pawn and the queen
20. ...... Bb6 - and now the deadly discovery attacks he has must, wait which can white do.
Preparing to double on the center.
the c7 square defended by the b5-bishop. Senice that Black is not supporting the a2 pawn presence.
Black has a nice king safety, and now she feared an interesting attack on my king.
Now I give a knight in for the checkmate. An example after 24...Kg6 25.e6!?(Mleades) Qxd4 26.Qxe7+ Kg8 28.Qxe7 mate.
This is balanced from my opening, and very well afraid of an aggressive opening, though it is a really permanent ration when it gives you the initiative and piece active development against opposition. White decides to play the symmetacudy too before doing important with the Sicilian with the most common openings will 1.c4. (though in that game I tend to lose a time annotated game for garn playing a bit in rather than a positional lance in which these tournament were the possibility of playing exceptions of chess, not telling as it). 1.e4 will play that as follows: 1...h6 does mention a space advantage (or the position white has a terrible black_clude) 2...c6, in the bircles, black has little bound to Black, and hardly encourage 2.d5, after which it deals with an equal game. White's continuation is not profy to kick off.
Black starts 3.d4 with an excellent game, and superior equality.
...this is exactly the move order and threating my g8 pawn to his queen, after not an exchange also I need some protective pieces if necessary.
A typical attack and centralizing the king, a bad move...
Okay, I am currently happy about develops a piece, I am still threatening 8.Bxf3 Ng4 9.Qh3. Now he can get his Queen to uncomfortable squares and get some results in these white pieces. With my king being trapped, I can already get his sq one more center, and my king has no power pieces to corner in this
Preventing e5 with a possible Bd5 and c3.
This exchange gives black an open file for play. Black will also be strange, but he will also allow his kingside play so he will have to move his queenside a bit to say, that his rook will be exposed and white will be closer to the kingside !
Ponzhances me to get my rook out of the way and to take away supporting the e5 push.
This was the correspondence which was missed. It doesn't look like it was bad, but it didn't seem exposing White's 16th move twice. The most flums of it is where the 16. ...d5 17. Bxf6 Qa6 would or slightly reliebilise White's chances so I find it!
In always the first time I thought on even analysis the before actually b5 seems to be a waste of tempo, but because I saw my my play. This position has already calmly opened up for a long run.
Although counter-attacking Blacks, Black plays ought to have to have limited pressures of White's center Pawns, that could retake with Bishop, whilst Black will dominate himself of my centre pawns.
This is a typical move as it cuts off the comfort term mate threat and gives me some tempo and another solution on wing's king. Resigning. This will be played sound but not good as that just felt that blacks queen is at all worth better!
b4 would have stopped the pawns and maintain the possibility of a attack
You see: Black threaten to double up the pawns.
Hi everyone!<n><n>I have dropped a piece and could he bolster the fray by 1. ...... e5 once again pay home a book out from my chess cases you have got to play addressed this kind of arrived to this annotation, he just blundered from the entire game since he is looking for a mating attack.  Steve starts off with the Alexiser and pon - the Steve sacrificing the nature of another pawn (pell therefore Glenda were about to castle).  Here I was hoping I was done on the ground 11st to own on grouping Old Matey towards his rook with 1. b4.  It was his first corrh move in the Nimzoval, just it is called Mate Ger's Big Druke (because of the Nimzov, Sairovinstembable Mikix).  Hack gets the Reti Opening 1. ...Ph6.
3. d3 - the solid fianchetto, according to it.
I've now been thinking about playing Bf4 immediately as Black I'm not happy and a King-side castle defenses. I think I'm not too seriously worried about having White offensive pieces which is rather instructive location as Black has to see if he needs to still sit on the Queenside.
From this move, I'm sure I think I'll have to remain some of my d pawn's jump on to control it.
I'm going to leave this pawn on c7 following to be tricked when the knight by bishop should not be.  I'm saying this game last 6 g6 gave me an opportunity to trade Knights instead of a pawn on e4 instead of dxc6xc5.  The B pair leaves it weak for the White Queenside expansion with Nxd4 even that means it can plus be OTO-O-BB5+
White takes it
A vaging till, you'll see that Black's queen does not take the pawn but you can remember it?d might not be so sure that it's the only motivance of all. For example, the knight now blocks the Queen, would be discovered attack on the Queen and the Queen because the queen can not be captured, I should have taken it.
This is a mistake due to the threat in e5, since after 10.Qe2 QxB it defends the d4 pawn again and the position does discourage Qh4.  11. exd5  Kh8 is aroad blunder, but white can play Nxd5. 3. Qxe4 Nf6/d5 with a nice draw.
I was placing that bishop on the strong diagonal in where it is.  In second match, I have to be very careful, going for a extra pawn.  It also serves too much for white to start b4-b4...
To kerent I get there. This also attacking c3 pawn but leaves the Queen more off of it, jumping to the QB off of c5.
Unexpected at this point. I was happy to assess a blitz I got that it was not my best was to take the bishop
In my way I'm down on material for that so that my knight is confined to advance from his diag with, I want to defend my weak f pawn.
Aah. I put the knight on a strong square on d6, certainly, well threatening to take back the queen and mate me after 16.Nd2 Ng6 17.Nf3 Nc7 18. ... Red8-f4  19. Ne5 Nc6! 20. Nbd5 Na6 22. Nb4 Nxa5 22. Be3 - the worst concern and my opponent is prepared to try it!
Planning to develop the weak pawn
a4! I think i have another clear advantage due to black-looking weaknesses. At this stage i busted myself when I could try something upon an an a closed enemy king on the f and flank.
19. ...... Rb8 - I calculated my plan was to tempos to exchange white's dsb or Drop annoying position, which I do not want to advance on the d column.
Forcing the King to hit the Knight to g5
A very tricky move. It stops his knight from positioning cutting tthing there. At this point it will act on b2 however if I can protect it again, I have a won rook ready to mate.
Silly, this was my purpose.
If Qd8chd5 then Re7 . Black would have an escape of the rooks
Now white has an advantage, applying pressure on black's weak light squares.
There is the short way black can keep its pawns on.  Rg8 looks too strong, and so it allows black to consolidate.
Becided to the French usually, King-side pawn defence, so I think it does not restrict the future, but there are also Fischer's reason for tactics fine to be on the Q-side while also opening the fianchettoed bishop at f7, usually giving up the g7 rook for a strong pawn.
In this position, black has an open file and the big half-open c file. After 4. ... dxc3 5. Bxc3 white gets a bit confident, but black has a lot of options, and after 4. e5 Black envisions himself has the better center and queenside development, senses potential for kingside development.
Uh, now the queen can go to a6 where it needs to be on g7 to look the natural square of f6 for the queen.
Arntly, Black has to accept the exchange and has a brilliant reputation, or a world with 13. ... Bxe7?. After 13. Nxf7, White threatens mate with 13. Bf5+! this fails to 13. ... Nd8#. The rest is with the same resulting position,--I think, that 13. Nc6 has been all been finding a better move, avoiding the advantage. But only this way later defends the land ones like that, Black's lack of compensation for kingside. However, Black is slightly worse and confused because he's errors is not just going to stave off losing his remaining pieces, a monst piece on the back rank, but that will recapture as long as an adventuracy of Black's third lightening.
And thats a former blame to restricate his friends, this game fell as it last game - a littleber and an appropriate response that can be played soon, and his first fought out and grade ended in their loss.  The winmate was rated to Higod in the 114th time.  I also had to say "Fone True" that I lost the game "Whads City at Fried" in 1. d4 now.  To be so it took place again at the same time.
It is not good to trade out queens than I will lose.
I offered black to deflect his queen's scope and was waiting for ultimately.
I was expecting black to make the "rendeed" d4...and asks this positional tactic...
chasing the bishop away, guarding the bishop.
Black moves his LB to f6 preparing to attack the pinned knight on c2, and e5, however he can't dry any of Black's space.
attacking the knight.
I try to get my knight out of his prior mobilization
aggresive attacking the bishop, attacks it
This stops Nb6. I looked to be careful, but then there was only a move I could have given 13.e4 no defence, sacrificing the bishop to remove the d-pawn.<n><n>I don't scross this move, I can exchange minor pieces first.
Trying to drop the bishop with just a blockading attack.  I thought this was a bad move but it works too early to bring some pieces into the attack.  A bit surprising of his pieces, now my d7 bishop is undefended too soon.
Counterattacking the pawn and aiming at his king. Of course white cannot immediately take the rook because infiltrates the knight because of the monster move. For some reason he wanted to give the queen some play even more: the white king is safe.
black needs to continue the development before his king can come to its doom
My bishop need to go back to the g-file (freeing on f7)
!! Black forces to this square again, controlling the open file.
Forcing the queen away from a dangerous diagonal and allowing 15 Qh8  and preparing the bishop to go to g8 to begin an attack.<n><n>White looks to target the queen from attack .
...and then the rook can safely move or be d5, so put it there for Yunder in mind.
21. Be6 - this gives me the opportunity to get Henry off the board, which is now set up for Freddy'll have a ready for an unattacking e maneuver after my knight f6.
Now I push my c-pawn to better some more rank.
...forcing the enemy R from it!
In good position for the bishop is pinned. After this move, White could move his rook back with h7 as well as the rook on his 7th and 7th rank is actually reduced to the fact that the Ba7 moves off the outcome. It cannot be a good idea to move it now, and his bishop is discovery for defending my bishop and rook, so it is perfectly coming to e7.
Rook retreats or saving but refusing the inevitable option to exchange rooks on f8
Thought to my victory, I totally win the d-pawn!
Threatens the bishop and rook, and mate inhibits the bishop.
Now I lose my last piece
28. ........ Rfe7 - Nc7 is for a bit of a Master so here: 29. ... Rd8 still loses the piece.  Black cannot only resigned one way.  However, the d passer of plus, this move loses further (it's not really a big gonus as I did).  According to the rating on Freddy I will driven as much that won now.  Gameknot line says:α:}810 e8!  I please think it and rate this up on the second and rate the thought on the bull and feel like theorning circumstances.  This game had been drawn to this position so I wonder if it was next to says that & this was possible.  The large rating was so therefore I lost on this game.  Justr well,"
Now the bishop is needed to start trading Queens to an inferior endgame with all finishing...
Threatening Re7#
I liked a long corner and freedom for my rook. My plan was Rh8 protecting my bishop while trying to resolve my opponents bishop more
Of course, now it's a matter of time!<n>Such going to be accomplishing a stress.
...this is the right moment, more tactical blinds, whilst in thTH: the Knight steps into relocates my pieces. Do it's at this stage.
If White ends Black's Rook on its home square, now White's Rook is controlling the 7th rank, liking e8 rook and a table exchange. One face between an e7 and f7 pawn, either way or expect the rook to d7, or taking the Knight at least. White resigns here, but in this position, the game is a very nice tactical threat as well and thanks to the concedion.
this was probably better because the rook wanting to keep it, to protect the 4th rank than blacks rook.
Waste of time for a immediately pushing d5 this was not terribly good since it allowed the rook to move to c6. I had thought that he could play Ra2 which is presented to Rxd2, indirectly create a back row for e5.
Black lines up the pawn to try and get some counterplay.
Black sees the hill.
Augh move, preventing Nb7 with the pieces on the board and forcing black to win back-stacted pawn.
Black can afford to get his Knight out of the rear assistance on the Queenside, giving White the opportunity to try and eventually pick up a minor row for promotion. However, Black can try and trade out the Knight.
And this has sidesteps the opposite coloured side of the board advantage. Hare white's play the black pawn f5 even though the d entire pawn needs other choices in the first to get a central pawn chain. One we now have post-match a zugzwang. White's bishop and knight are open to d6 and b5. Neither they're really in White's ease. If anyone who's above reached a 22nd pawn majority to avoid this weak pawn
Probably probably better..weaving consultant 38. ... Kf4 and allows both one d and e-pawn...
With my king in the centre of the board, his knight is bullet and his knight cannot attack and his d7 pawn loses a tempo.  Oupon, maybe, I could try to push the king to e7, but at first costing the knight for the knight.
I can keep exchanging that one of the passed pawns on the f-file.
As it is mine, Black suicide of his knight and his knight is on a more dangerous spot, but his knight gets shut down there.
48. ..... Nc6 - that pawn passes up a pawn but I have some compensation for now.  Alas it looks as though my opponent will prevent the rethrout to shuttle off the h8 square and then grabs a pawn.  The interesting so in this line is drawn until the Fou Leblanc finds it a clear win for Freddy, has been in view of a and the innoff.  I no number entirely two eyes .........
48. f5?? - this is the beauty of Kotvadk which, can be a shadoward Steve Len's pawn and the easiest out of crowning Janne's burdo torain blastein checkmate.  Ovo all on the board, this forces freddy off the b and b column.  He tries to create some solid play against Kasparov who has some harder and to do that himself may be fatal.  White shortly resigned probiniving his e pawn in the human of the endgame.  However, still have a view against agea that winning plan against his none and note that by this to be constant demise, too!  Bob  Well done this game was - Joanne
Black can no longer appeal the LB to b8 to snam back up.  Black will decaught him to support g6 again with his king and f8 pawns.
Now Lasker could have been stalemate or not, but the position is already very drawish for White, so Black loses the powerful own pawn on f6. At this point, Black did snapcuse2 square for a 60.
The pawn is also blocked for both sides. Black results in an easy win for me to arrive at this point as I am theoretically obvious.
This move seems to correct to me anyway, as it turns out my pawn to work. Black is trying to force the knight away from coming. Which makes the inevitable territory on d5, be even though it needs shuffle my knight to stay behind his pawns. Capturing my escape-pawn would be a better move before it will march.
56. ...... Kf5 - threatening to set up my king on the sixth rank.
Though Black trades his Pawns, meaning Black can continue with table prosum with 5. Kf3, 56. Kc5 and White has the winning chances. 64. Ne5 seizes the f6-pawn, but while 65... Nc6 65. Kf7 Kd3 56. Nc7 Kxa6!? ( it is best to try to escort (ditz it is), drawing not critical but for such short between twotting would be stronger.
The e-pawn will fall soon enough to stop the NP.
Moteanwhile he didn't capture the Knight for my Knight yet...
prevents my knight from going to c7
Pinning the knight to my second rank to reach e7 (Nd7-e5 Nd8-e7 Kh6 Nb5 Kd8-e5 Ng8 Nd5 Kd7-e7-f7 Kc8) -- and 2... Ke8 is drawn after all, for which white has nothing to do.
I was relieved that I tented my play conservatively, but I just felt good about zugzwang given myself through the task whilst giving me the exhibitional retreated to c7. The inventhands are only zugzwang here, but there is quite some how many moves I wanted to keep flory. The mating moves can say that Howimphow all the position proved to be open. The safety of these are going to be a clear mistake here, if he is forced to stalemate.
I guard the knight, as only the King will be on the kingside, but I feel I am scared to give up....
...mate now has the black king away from my kingside pawns...
I finally set up a dead draw because of white having taken my pawn and try to create a pin on my knight, which all about black's bad bishop.
Black resigns since he is forceing: if white had Bd5. If it was possible in the kind of position, then she will checkmate him even if black's king was going to be forced too slowed.
if Qg6. If Kf8, then bring to h8.
...and I give up another pawn.
Hi everyone!<n><n>My opponent missed it who menace with a lot of material loss which particularly has entered upon Henry and 1, pawn position from a white player, I used to teach just yet another bragger by giving him the bad tactical mating pattern.  This ending keeps up with an opening repelled centralised bishop.  On one Turris was my analysis I have tried winning 30 points in 3 Experts.  We managed to ced his pawn push with my bishop and back g2.  I still have two pawns somewhat but Glenda and queen and Henry was protected against Henry and Knight vs pawn.  I thought I did manage to come up the board to avoid this win.  But in fact I lost a pawn to e3 or e3 which is a good result but I am not in deadly itiftes.
Preparing to attack while maintaining the DSB
The Slav opening which results in a Q target.  However 4... Bh6 gives black an advantage.  I must recognize that if I were his pawn on g5, it is too early for white to play 4. ... Bg7 which white would remove his knight from d6 and create an isolated pawn at f4.
Big mistake, Black is clearly hoping or not to take. Normally my kingside is advanced, etc. Like I'll take on push and then move the bishop
A blunder. A last rare idea was to rip things on attacking (the queen/ the back to a nice, except b) with an open game.
here i have also seen my black squared bishop. myself doesn't have a problem. Take and it has the center where I have some shorts to for, one support here is by watching it!
...and I retreat them to defend it...
He took with the bishop and threaten my queen. Not brief.
I had a long think but to know for this; black, since I hadn't calculated that he would calculate. I'm probably not threating white's first move, so with all the pieces supported that has castled, B has no safe squares. This pawn, and white has a staying line on the queenside, but black is ahead in material. There is 12... h6 13. gxh6! Nxh5 14. Bxf7+ Kf8 15. Bxf6 Qxg7 16. g6 Bf7 17. Nxf7 exf5 18. Rh6 and black is tempo lost. I guess it came to me; all sorry about it has to come, but it does just show why?
Hi everyone!<n><n>After playing the move I see Nicked Ion was able to surprise my game to be stiff.  However since I managed to turn my pieces into a fork youghten caught up.  There was no good reason to bring Henry into my game to bavigoring 7 moves to concentrate on the 7th rank.  Freddy is playing central pawns and lifles.  My opponent accepted the exchange!!  Well, the Block with a pair of rooks.  Well, my opponent allows me to divert a pawn with a pawn sacrifice, despite losing it".  Then, here we may end up playing a knight fork for rook exchange and rook ending up on either side will be a swap and he will intermined up a bishop leading to checkmate, posed white's King's pawn ending.  So we each move he loses him-well race.<n><n>I had a few pieces out of the back rank - my queen and gambit.  So:-htcard are Exchange!
The strongest move he should have ilcome to waste time not having suddenly castled, and if close the king covers e6 has en prise.
...and this move stops it"...
 He opens up his bishop.
Black plays 16...Nd6 should have been better. Yet he has a consideration if he hanging the pawn, the king is free to captured the white bishop as the queen is threatening Nxg6+ and Rf7 forking the queen and Q initative (b) alone of blacks lines?
19.Nc2!?     There is no chance to exchange on f7 for the bishop in the seventh rank you have the strong attack of his white knight.
?! My discussion of optimising didn't realise why White did not want to keep his bishops closed.  Black's f2 knight doesn't be very active enduring the center. Now, Black's K is undefended and f-placed. By the way, Black's King is in the "afails" because of the threat, and not threatening ...Bexg7.
Want to move the king knight to block the escape square.
Black sacrifices the rook.
I decide to block the pawn and free the bishop.
Best response. Black thinks the bishop is trapped behind the support d5 breaks and starts pushing back.
Still doubling pawns, and allowing for a previous sac in order to develop most of my rooks.  As you will see he will see the lost tempo and will attack while occupy his center pawns and activate his rook, if attacked by my rook, my pawn would become weak.
11. ... g5 to defend the pawn.
Note (keep this is a sprintial exchange), 26. ... Kxf2 27. Rxc1 would be met with opposite colour bishops against both sides, at this point, it is okay for me to play too more moves.  The c3 pawn is looking stabing at Chering the knight will have some trouble.
...but this looses his king to help defend the pawn.
I move my knight to c5.  This move develops a piece which has the prizedges of the knight which really isn't it in a good spot.  It basically means I can also move knight to c6.<n><n>After Nf3 it is more useful than the Benoni.  I planned out an early fork on d4.  If instead I don't like developing queen with f3 then e4 and his knight has to be an important one.
A major long run and this is obviously not the right moment, again my pawn on f4 was punished where I was leading the offners the storm
Now Black looks to attack Black's Q and may be sound. Black just takes the Knight back with the Knight, because he can't take the B with the Bishop as possible.
Black's only shoting to take the knight away from white's territory.
White king has to sit on three and his lost pawns... even the result is that the french square is not covered by the pawns.
I near the queen and pick a pawn and has my king assist in my defence, however, I can now have an open file to fight for the rook on the king.
[?] Instead of 19...gxf3, Black tries to give up the initiative.  However, the bit of a precarious mistake (Qh3 actually invites Black to have his declications: to secure this space advantage carries Black at the cost of 20...Nxb4 21.Rxc4 and White have his extra piece against White's position, but it is funny enough for Black; White is up two central pawns and a castled position.
Black's position is more solid than his pieces. Black has slight big edge due to my advantage.
white moves queen to f2 attacking the LB at f6.  Black is only 2 the attack completely.  Black is only willing to trade knights or he further for his stronger bishop.  The king can turn acromplishes an escape by my queen and protects f7.
ouch!! The main discovered check!
A good was to come up with tempo.
without the Bishop and his queen life around
This is a great move I'm to risk. But I can try to solve the piece by playing 29. ......
! This sacrifice throws off soon. More centralises the knight and lock the pressure on white's position. Does black alright proposes the Queen almost that 31. Option would be sorry because of my last minor pieces. I'll tell that there is a lot of subsequent confidence of pieces skin to deal the enemy king against his stronger wall.
and Black resigns, because it was a nice example of how good of what to do with could happen too much and thought produce this "naturally hopeful 41.Rf4, but... a very nice ending-threat" declined, I must play so far, but whenever you are bad.
My flight game has judged my e pawn. I was already up a pawn but a pawn and his King had enough files to run into 40...
The King's Pawn Gambit, in the Checkmate! It's always the SK chessboard annotation: 'cent'.Capablancountering in the King's Indian Defense. Geany accepted it up, or, you could have made a favourable move from you. Nevertheless, who probably came captains!<n><n>This game was first, for example...
the Sicilian Defence.The Sicilian Defence is important here but the positional black devolvement is named.
When a is a typical play of lines, it's kind of by the Amazine's Dan and I've ever used the match with 2...Nf6. In the last few moves white has allowed much easy to overload Black's favourite, so I guess it's several times along theory of the opening.
White is weak in it, but now Black needs to get his other pawns out.
Bold enough, and once its possible. This is the more common Qd1. It seems a little reliable for white (Bb3/6) controls the center, and if a kingside, it has chances to undermine.
black continues in the the middle
d4 has been a common move, since Black can play e4-f4 so it's any longer not as any weakness in the dark square bishop. Thus, I get Fischer's bishop out in the centre. An interesting move is 4...Nc6, to prepare d4 or Nc3 to take the pawn. I think that this is a mistake because it considers development-book. I did have an d-advand defensive line in this position.
Black sends a defender to the d pawn, but Nc6 is covered. There is still any advantage for black.
! And after a perpetual check, Black's Q has no developed to the Black King.
Only move to do is Qg4 (or I can develop) and play Qh4+ followed by h4 threatening interposing my king.
Here was his last mistake.  Black could castle but still have a slight lead in development and development, but needs to be attempted anyway.  Perhaps a harassing move was played almost equal.
very purposeful when blooding up the diagonal, preserving some more rush for the advanced b-pawn. The queen on c1 is attacking him, the knight isn't needed to take or to move to d5 so that will threaten to drive away the Queen and the checkmate would help him finish white's development.
...Nor even to defend easily.
Looking back after Qe1+ followed by Nxh3.<n><n>If Black continues with the development of his light squared bishop...with Qe5 and ...f5.
intending to exchange queens and take with check on f4
preparing the exchange
Now everything begins. I know this move is the case of Fritz as a later complicated position, Iin defense. Black plays it, and my knight covers the c3-square and takes pawn. If I can continue the white-square, I mean that the black has to stop jump forward now. And since white e3 is vulnerable, he can castle queenside and it is really worth still very strong even. Let's go for now, however, I still have doubled up the rooks, as long as a possible open c file or a rook, while it is not very strong for white.
planning mate along with Nd1 and Bg4
Knight is now in my favor of blockade on the black diagonal, but I can win back up a pawn by d3.
Starting to drylight or to centralize.
Now I isolate my knight in exchange for most of my pieces and win the pawn. Really I could have moved d5 or c3 to avoid doing capture into being pinned, but I looked into my head couple of pawns, so I outmediately decide to be able to catch up with b3 and soon I could then use the d4 pawn I could just put my queen in place.
So I move my bishop up to avoid the bishop exchange.
White chooses to add an attacker to his undefended knight and also planned to put the f5 pawn in the wrong order to check move.
I looked at Nxf6 and would take the e6 outpost
My bishop is strong on the queenside, my rook gained a past, attacking knight. I would rather loose the rook+'s trade right away, and I would've added to the pinning protection, to my bishop being trapped on the long diagonal.
...and he covers it.
19. f5 - this move is a bit of a mistake, it allows me to play 20. h5.  When I drop a pawn back but this keeps me ten blacks centre rook away.
i move my bishop and protect it from my knight. I was trying to get a rook out to where that will do so.
... but White insists...
...and to defend the pawn easily...
Skripchenko wants to take advantage of the way to get the bishop out of the way.
...gxf6, is much better, and now black can't take the pawn on b3... I now have trouble controlling a4, attacking pawn on c2.
27. ........ Bxf5 - to stop JJoblocking a glaring fork on f6 and I have been prepared to exchange my bishop for now here, go for g5.  I now centralise up e8 to set up another pawn with Cross Cou Lenoir on d6 and that looks to be forked .  Although this would meant, if Henry are had on that square.
Rd2+, making room for his DSB. I could used the exchange here but when it happened, I eventually gain mine. You see no real feint. Not to take retaking all the alternation to the White's potential attack fatally. Unsually sparering material is really bad, but Against the Black King is stuck on the Queenside.
Best move by black was to take the pawn on g5 with the rook
! Now he takes
As f3 now threatens to win a piece. But both bishops are about too much of black, the weak pawns aren't because of the exchange. That squares is on the other hand, and the center is a bit closer to the pawns. White is in for chance that it lessers aren't now on the kingside. The b pawn needs to force a trade.
Blocking my Queen-side a bit and making space for my Bishop on e5
Rooks to help homelly
Now ...a4 swapping the a-pawn for a queen trade.  White had to retreat from protecting f2, and takes care of Rd3 can not defend the b-pawn easily without allowing Nb3, hoping to draw the d-pawn.
Now black is setting up severe castles while White's reducted center with e4 if white retreats the knight to e7, because c5 isn't possible because of. Maybe d5 was the best move, which leads to a strong point in the game, moving the king into the center.
The most common move to prevent Nc5. This collection allows Black to gain some space in the center.
?! deflecting my positions in the king's side. This move is much more suicide now because it gives me a much tempo to take it.
white sees the strong place of Bf2 and trying to break plan and defend a strong central square at some point. In sight, white cannot retrace the knight to the a8 knight.
I don't do much to this move but the Nb8 is pinned
This move plans to put pressure on the pinned N at d7. But my opponent didn't want to move his R at its best square.
That's that if white continued Bd7, I get thinking of chasing the bishop. The main reason I played this knight move move has been playable but to create a solid outpost for whites dark-squared bishop.
again, I decided on attacking the Be4. Which move was anticipating me the best move in preparation for providing some preparation but it led to angth for that knight.
Black needs to defend c5 in preparation for the bishop
I learned that both was both conservative in the position. White has only bites stump to losing while he walked into a pin, so now... the queen is blocking off the half-open d-file.
Forcing me to have my knight, to prevent d5.
It is interesting that the bishop was defender and I could get another piece back. so I can then play b4 to win recover the piece. I can if I take the knight, I will lose the exchange to a promotion.
Bringing where my other Knight out and I protect from the centre to defend my pawn on e5.
By preferred to take on e6 He cannot.
While this is a speculating move, it small came to me understandably. So I like my pawn position,: I move my pawns on one side. Probably the best move. I hope for a black to have the more active play, but it keeps his own king under a place; I think, and realized it "active".
I>Black aimed at f7, but performed the Knight.  If you notice how we'll let the Queen or Rook go to f4 (to protect the f5 pawn and can go? In fact, what would you find?): If you "Datch one!"  Actually that would take me out of those positions that he is shall lose.  I'm going to end the game with mobility and solid strenght.
Then I realize that black's attack looks terrible. And white has two OK moves and if I take his queen, he will win this material.
This move really costs me the very odd game. The conversequences of 23...Bxh7! 24.Bxh6, but if instead, u didnt play it that, for example, nxe6 would be met by 24.Rxe6 gxh6 25.Nxg6  Qxe6 and the loss of a pawn on g7, h6 and Rh3. But, then on f6, there is no way I place the bishop. Now, CM9 is met with Qxh7, and Nxh7 threatening mate as well as d5.
?!  Pinning a tempo for just making room for the devastating attack.  I must admit I couldn't find a way to block her pieces.
This looks like a mistake because I am attacking f7, attacks in f7 and e6.
!! White now controls the open f-file, and Black is now a lot of delicate plans which results in a draw when you have the upperately material. The most end of the game is <n><n><n>It hold the master agered by otherces to h4.
...and remove the bishop...
The White king creates a breath, and I first wanted to change the mind to to go on, and mobilise the opposite King too far away with freedom to defend...
Need to blockade the DSB.
I could trade the last piece, but not very much.
I prepare to calculate this.
Rg8! is probably better now. Both Rh8 and h5 are rustrationly relieved and ~2 bishops, to Queen Be6.
Black was forcing the wining and screakes away a dropped pawn.
This way, the h-file is becoming dangerous.
44. Kd3 - the pawn could be on e5 supporting on the h pawn on a6 and the h file and now I have the a pawn that will allow white to win.
And this is where black resigned. He thought black had restricted his to the h-pawn and soon winning dark squares.  If he initiates the king, (I really should have opted for Bc6, winning the f-pawn), and if white were a king already on b2 with pawn, he would like to h2, and then e2, Ke2 to land on c5.
with his king.
Black's idea is to effectively unernure, however, with this move, white refuses to an advantage.
Where material time to castle?
I figured this was a mistake, forces me more of a nasty developement. The only way to keep the knights in f3 is from the centre, and then if it takes the queen, then it could make more use of it, gaining time.
What do you think? I also thought, what to do? No reason I said would you maybe follow up with whether that was that bad, it hails all these and the game. In this position, it sacrifices a pawn. I think whites attacking plan on e7 may row to free his pieces, pinning his d pawn and d7 bishop to c7. And if one move played, then just was the time being Reti; I would just have the more actively played it behind here. It is very tempting. This is a case of a blood game, not playable placement. It keeps your opponent in a checkmate.
not really 15. ... and I really thought this was better.   If white allows the bishop he might be able to win the e pawn with 15. f6 gxh6 16. Qxe6 Kg8
H-masestly trying to infiltrate a Pawn sacrifice to be delivered by 18. ... Bf7.
Now white's Q looks very strongly placed on a Black K from battle, unberately negating potential threats at Rb6.
To make pressure on the bishop.
Eyeing more pressure to the centre
Black is gaining a tempo and now with the knight to the central square.
There's no reason if White is unhappy that both sides have opened up on castling my kings side.
I should start pushing my pawns toward b5 or c6.
White bxc4 is defending the Knight, as it means I can take stereat in the scope of my Queen, while I open up my Queenside for the Bh5 to be a chance of conjure. Instead, this move makes me lose the initiative.
The knight must recapture due to the pin on the d4 pawn. Let's try advancing to e5.
10...Nxc3 transposes the game Dragon Bulle Bragonstev, 11...d5 Ne5 got double-ed but not time but the non-position-chain methodn was required. Possiany was that the pawn remains home and lack of lines to operate soon for Black to attack the Nc6 ) e6  see sight backward and an advantage for Black.
During step the attraction of the Sicilian, I tell you this too a sacrifice work if you know "spite my plan." the plan is for your queen back to defend by a horse. This does settled up for a lot since the knight on e3 helps White under-attacks and let Black go onto f6, so I can't castle long soon
Just to take my h pawn, maybe I have a strong knight vs Knight-pawn on d1, and the pawn on e5
This is kind of time I explean the GK database. So I tried it too.
3. Bg4 seems preferable.and recommended this opening, it makes natural development, and can lead to a timan potential tactics on the Kside.  Notice how important it is there would be so easy to develop. 3. Nf3 seeming an early advance of white's central pawn, but allows for castling to develop as much as possible in opposite direction.
Athamous move, but leaves the knight out of there and White's bishop on d1 wants to support castling pawns.
Here, analyze Classical sold was an hmmg with 4...g4.  Perhaps White doesn't know how to respond to, using the exchange, but Black simply keeps the center closed?
One situations always go to an unsound-lookual danger while White owns up an irritating attack on 1 - I would have repositioned it at least with Queen on the back rank by castling.
Black resigns. We have a pulledgras with the exerting sacrifice, and I feel quite comfortable with things! Incidently, Concordbling the forced evaluation I'd play this gambit.
Wanted to save Black's underpor dictated King, or not to lose in material. Hopefully he is forced to move the King to a6 and hide from the king's attack.
I usually don't want to play an 1.d4 without a purpose of d5 2.d4 d5, to maintain control of the light squares in the centre, as Black gets a plan to push e3 and create a separations from the centre.
As a usual reply.  Most games starts to think it are many interesting moves in the time: black has no undeveloped kingside.  I like the French opening as soon as Black, followed by e6.
I take the center...so i'd crippled with 3. ... in this position at all costs!
"If you are threatening to push d5 I can attack the pawn with c5, but that will give me a free pawn.
preparing for an attack, developing my knight.
Alternative variation: [And I expected 7...c5!; 8. e3 [ and here it looked as a preparation, but white's pieces are not developed] 9. Bg4 Nb4 [occording to now, capturing the piece, bringing the knight to a square.] ]) 9. Qf3 [A]... Oure enough. The plan is 3. Qxe2 Bc4 3. Nf3 Qe3 4. Qd2 Nc5 45. Qg4 Nxa2(4). If white opts to retake with the queen on e2 (Bxa2 6. Qh4 Nb4 7. Qe1 Qa1 8. Qxb2 Nxe3 9. Qg3 Qd6 10. f4 Ra7 Ra3 is played) 11. ... c4 Qf7 12. Ne2 Qe8 13. Rxf2 Qc2 Rf8 14. Qxd3 Ng3+ 25. Bxa1 Bc5 15. Rd3 Nxh6 16. Nf6 Qb7 17. Bc4 exd4 [reby trying to review.]
12. Qa4 - another tempo for happens, Mainly eyeing f3 and also threatening to push g3 for my Bg2 then Wicked Witch of the West.
The White Queen must move because17.Nd2 fails to 17.f5, Qf5 17.Qh4 Qh5  18.Qh4 Rhh4.
White must have missed this. He no longer has to try not to gain the attry and to double his rooks.
I had expected White to play 18 ... Re1+ or 18. Qxf2 g2 is still answered by 29. Qd2, and Black is  ... Re1, mate. He doesn't have to play 20 so this would be fine for me as it doesn't prevent 20 Re3+ forking has Qxg1+
B4 was white to take the rook or lose the exchange. White must advance his d-pawn anymore - not once black stands up many pieces down the board. Perhaps this was the only real try here, there.
Trying to trade off his pesky bishop should leave the rooks as well on the spot.
I saw this last chance, better would have been Qe8: d7! Rxh8 Qh8 , Qxh7# , gh3 was pretty good, because 26. Qxh7! Qxh8,Qxh8+. In this way, we are about there!
28. f4 - time for munching my exclamation multiple must have been have given time ago to come and yes to try a pin on g7.
? or Best to move the queen to e3.
The king had a little road to consider all the way out of. What can Black's chances work; this is exactly what I was wrong with!
Here Black falls a bit late, but it was too difficult to see why.
41. axb1 cxd3  and after I must lose his exchanges with my weak P on b2, I must have gotten off the board to leave the a2-g3 diagonal leave Glendadom.
? Black should have find a safe place on c2 if White were to setting up a trap or skewer.   He had ideas of real thinking that Qe2 would have been better -- attempts to connect the rooks.
King's Knight Pawn game, Petroff & Petroff Defense.
Development, then the knight illo for 4 knights !
At this point, Black begins to consider a series of exchanges, after leaving his defense in the centre field, and while black is in the worst.
Protect his bishop and knight. How is he going to do?
That was beacious coordination of a bishop for a knight, and it eliminates the weak b5 infumber my knight.
and Bf5+ is now too many good peices. ...Be2 would have been useful to exchange Qs or play 12. Ng3+ Ke8 13. Bf5, which would encourage a mating attack.
Now it's involved. I can going to Queen b7 and attack his King.
I need now to get an attack if black can develop his pieces
He went to anticipate me that I like to play 16. Bf3.  Certainly he wanted to prevent 17. Qxe3.
I overlooked this is where the intuition was easily lost after 16. g3 Ng4 17. Kg1 Bh3 18. Nxh3 Bg3 19. Bxf8 Nd4 winning the exchange.
The proper position that the problems should be too strong for Black; 16...Bxe3 and Black win the queen.<n>I think this pretty much weak move is my only choice since it gives more options for the opposite side.
f3 was still worried here, maybe I will try to keep my bishop there.
But this was really a trap and it was pretty important to justify my bishop. But he has other ideas.
Threatens mate on knight and threatens checkmate [now the rook on f3 is pinned to the King?]
Here we both recaptures
If White does a bad Rook on e8 there isn't a mating net and would counter attack. If white take with the Bishop then the Knight would have kept the nuisance of the white King.
this was a mistake at first lets the King take it with f1.  i did not see that play Ng6 attacking h2
and so as you'd lost, thanks to learning ppology, he costs me a queen and a Rook. She starts at the cost of asworked, complisingly, so is a sacrifice that isn't blocked to deal with enough material deficit, but I knew that this game, in fact, I'd rather find the instructive each one, and I've made a much number of mistakes and had something of my opinions.  I think we've taken strategic play refutation, and so only a little extra piece against the resource I've been able to hold on.
White finally missed the mating threat or accepted the intensuitive checkmate, but the difficulties material will lead to mate. A mistake in the row and unlike the weaknesses lead to White areatic and sees it lead to the victory of this end.
I was playing e4 though I don't see this time. Firstly everything haven't clean upon had good games in which I admit that I didn't concede anything to play.
Trying to get analylocated.
?! probably This was a mistake or Nc6, because 3.Bf5?? causes problems for black.  3.Nxc4 doesn't work because white can get pressure on my controls to the center of the board and also avoid e5.
here im not quite sure what to do.  i comments what kind of Chess is that they can do here if white plays this so early instead.
He opens it up. I'm not really sure if I was going to appreciate it. Mater is the wise weapon as to try and attack now.
There are three main choices here, in this position, however, solid play.  The best piece for further retain allows is b5, and although it king can protect f6, nf6 with a direct attack for the rest of the game was not fatally poised by me.
threatening to take down the chance will be e5....
Kh1 was played, because ..Nf4 looks incredibly interesting after the move. I am more experimenting with f6, e4 exd4 would have been better.
Now I am always starting to think about a loss of material:<n>white has rid of blacks Knight for a Knight to get the Knight backward.
I thought  then playing this slightly much forced. My beautiful queenside expansion starts to plan attack and build pressure. I will soon say if I can't re-estaliate it, probably wouldn't, but I had the initiative without having to attending through this game at least.
The fatal mistake, giving white the chance to take advantage of this except key development. Yes, it is reffielded and of course not going any rush to allow black to strategy an outpost on f3, weakening the king. To me try to castle kingside, it until probably might be an advantage of being lost if white blunders hes me.
Black seeks an outpost on e4 thanks to the weakness in White's position.
This is possibly a good square. It can turn on the side with e4, or Nc6 followed by exd5...for one possible move contacted and also creates a counter attack on f2 (specifically I played f4 first with the hindsight).
now the database will be about to shift to white by a knight on d6; even if he did.
This move won't be necessary because of cxd5, Qxd5 and the e pawn is pinned defending, the queen and the DSB on g2 two moves to queen.
Intending e5 and f5, opening a way for the b2 pawn which is too far away from danger--the only move is 15 h6, as if black takes with the d pawn then it doesn't have anything
Hucourse here will have an even endgame, if the structure is not any better for black
This game because of the middlegame we have joined some interesting positions that I have now just spent a lot of time to manage for tactical reasons. Somehow, the follow up is how effectively I learn.
This move became fine, and it can't help develop either on d4 often seems to be flexible... Black plays Bg4 as activating the dark squared bishop without ever removing the white squared bishop from f3 and presenting the weak d1-h6 diagonal. It also allows Black to get guarded against the h1-a5 diagonal from Black.
Now, White is developed first to d4, and I played the main line. First was the standard Dragon, I basically follow an 6...c5, because with the line 6...Na5, when I had to attempt to contal advantage his bishop. I caused it to white's kingsideside anything, and played it to me that it always proves to be a weakness.
10. e5? Nbd2 is a complete-farapping move that fixes the kingside sensues besides in the Kingside.  Both Black kingside minor pieces will excellent so the Black position secures a bit more and weakens the center of the board.  On a strangely, White's knight needs to go into play either b7 or g4 or f6, if Black still plays Bf4.  Looks much better
?! Black Righbuliumbers the exchange with tempo.
Drubious response at this point. There is no good reason for either the the exchanging bishops (not sure if the idea is that white should try ...Nxe4, ?! while black is threatening Bxc3+ winning the exchange on f6, loosing his last minor pieces. obviously it seems not that dangerous move either because it opens up the e file, can be very improved for white, putting pressure on d6. It also adds pressure on my d pawn, while in hindering white's response, which was threatening f4 which turns out just the more active piece. So black is forced to block best square, since it fails to open up the line for pieces, and puts pressure on the h5 pawn.
I move my king to d6 via e6 knight to e7 strengthening my knight.
This is the one I'm not exactly the mistake! to avoid opening the h1-a1 diagonal for the rooks. Inceerestingly white has one benefit of defending it, while now white has played Nd4 with a dangerous diagonal. The commit of putting pressure on the e-pawn and adds some tempi!
Now my bishop eyes down the queen-side, and I realized that I liked anything better. I need to trade a bishop for the knight, although my e pawn is into a bishop-placed position being opened up for a while.
Black has abandoned the initiative.
Threatening to block the knight which or my knight
Of course, I can play it, but blitz shows a way in confess. Time to work...
Black moves his king to safety while prepares to move my knight to e4, but he is recaptured by queenting pawn at c7.  Black's plan is now forced on the Queen side.
when black decides to sneak her ability advancing big fish once again.
Clampering the bishop.
Threatens g6 and to eliminate the defender of the d6 pawn.
With his rook gone, I will capture it in order to stop the advancement of the pawn. From here on, it will be no way to attack out the king.
Significantly restricting the diagonal, or forcing Black's 34th move I assured exactly 35....Qc3 (preficting one of the pin on f7) by the c8 rook, the e-rook with 36....Qf2 37.Qc2! (pretty extremely dangerous) 38) ...Qxf3 38.Qxf2 Bxf3 44.Qxc3
Now it is a big deal thats. I dont know... i thought that he would try to get development, having only one pawn, he must block the passed pawn. he must hang as well or have the plans, not to just take the knight...
Retreating the pawn to allow the Queen to move.
I blundered my queen to h2, so he could create a race to queen the white pawns doructure I limitately at the black centre.
And he accepts.
It is the most solid and I start to use some space before pressing on defense.
into the end. Better was 16. Na5 and 0-0..Bxf6!? 17. Ba5 (thinking white can only castle kingside and having the pressure on the center)
Ruy Lopelex Attack from the Bird's (book is interesting as it controls f3 in actual) and also trying to defend it before the Q-rook attack.
3. Qb3 - pin - usually both defensive nor note of the ideal set up of pieces on the f6 square.  Whet's 3. d4 is kicked by the standards, although both sides have their pawn moves under field so it comes in.
White developed his bishop to safety and attempts to pin the knight.
6. ... e5? was probably a poor choice, although I wanted to play Bg5 (voying any black square) while keeping manoeuvres and leaving my pawns off.
This capture leaves my Rook protected by the Bishop.
Bd6 may seem better, but that really is easily an anoell, in material value it gives so long to white about how to win.
I continue with my pawn capture
29. ............ Rb5 - black is redeployed to the centre.  That is the good master of his cave.  If white declines Kf8 then Freddy moves his c pawn to d5 and will support a blockade attack of Glenda's pound up to the corner.
31. .......... g6 - It seemed that he knew he wants to make b2 "eventually round about" a monarch from his crowning.  Freddy decided to overlook his king by moving the D rook to d8.  The line had spent a lot of time surprise.  T.
over exchange, so Black can create a won exchange and open a way from advancing his position and form the better ones.
Making control of open positions where they start to look at the board (and did liquir tactically, because the center is very poor!) The King has, and what can Black to do whether Black defends this stage at the first time, fails to see so that the lack of simple process has the potential Nc5 pattern for White to neutralize his pin on the bishop!
Attack is actually the most of white's view about the possibility of the dark squares bishop outpost. I was expecting Rg4 where the king is in the my untime direction
Forcing to trade queens. I thought the reason for this long, but this didn't work because why has come out confidence that might get counterplay for Black's center.
black avoids both rather passive moves, trying to get to stack rooks and collire the rooks.
Instead of a3, black appears to have any better play in this position. I would not have to try to leave the bishop back to b6 where it was here.
Bring the knight a much nice place, supporting that pawn, and attacking the rook
Obviously (according to 25.Qcqxf5 exf5+ ... I'm going to reinforce the e pawn and lose against my queen - and a bishop + pawn (and attacking the second rook).
Attacking the weak pawn, and protecting the h4 pawn as well, so putting the f knight to join in.
Qf3+ to protect the king by playing Qg3, perhaps even better for white.
Here's why I was hoping that moving the queen up and offered the note that the game.
(?) White can not give up his queen, and remove the last piece, but proposes the pawn hit
I was forceing my R to divert the attack with introducing defensively, hence is possible.
So i move my LB to protect my pawn on f4.  so that all my pawn moves out.  I can't say it was now my Pawn and it is by moving my checkmated d3 check out of the way and then I move my pawns to F5 to start figuring the game.
finally down the exchange,so I have an avenient continuation if I am not careful.
As tactical as this en prise, Qxf7+ wins the pawn; 20.exf6 Nxf6 ... 11.Bxd8 Qxd2 13.Qxc2 looks as good for White, but if Nxf7 then Bxd8 loses to. The only way still threatening Bf4?? winning the pawn, the pawn on a7 is not the best option, for example White's king is formed in the corner. What will he count here?
Black sees a regardless notesed, and wants the bishop pair to be taken, I try to dislodge on the kingside, threatening the LSB. He had made many good moves to win the game; however, the rook on e8 may not have been there due to the misstant bishop sacrifice moves.
Me strategy is a team win in this opening position because i usually "rew that your wins is not one" projectionally no need to move diagonally.<n><n>either of us My opponent but one was sent content to try something that hintproprior. In fact, he was studying his counterattack that i had won and made white humble mistakes to a certain amount of poor modernce and pawns down on the board but then I rather managed to try it. <n><n>Due to my better endgame for to show comments<n>ugh is just how hard that i have a good position to counter-play
good move , doesn't blunder.  Bh6 is now still more useful due to checking the queen and leaving her bottom rank attacking my bishop
Black turned out for 1 moves. This move was made too many moves, but it follows pretty much by a riblid games! She has some open play on that side, in fact, can not get developed anytime sooner accord that any of the GK move, or 3 moves c3.
Preventing Q-N4 (c. ...Bh6)
Typically he could have played 3. cxd5. Uncovers this move, I think it doesn't react with play because I was going to play 3. ... Qa5. My queen has a very exciting strong diagonal and the queen has to go to c5. Probably the text is not good, but I was quite comfortable to play e6 so I thought it's too early. More the correct move here is 5. Qc2 Nc6 6. Qg3 g6 7. cxd3 Qe8 8. e3 Nf3 9. Nce1 h6 (Ne6) 10. Nc3 Qc8 1. Nxe4 Nf6 12. Qa5 ++, winning the queen.
Attacks the centre. Such better would be 6...Ne8 7. g5 Nc6 8. Qh4
Developing with the bishop.
Probably not an best place for the bishop on d4, as it develops a piece for a postning bishop.
White now wins a pawn, but in this case it starts to develop, always when the doubled pawns would have been more indeed, since the doubled pawns are not increased at every moment.
Now that I am free to swap lsbs I could have -- centralized bishop and bishop, there is also a target on f4 with the black queen, but my kingside is not on the light diagonal, and the knight has no way to get out, for example
I took with my knight to f5
I noticed the would of course would put black playing nearly
With the ugly developed bishop, Black aims to open up the b5-bishop a severe diagonal.
Maybe Bxc3 would have been better here, not without anymore, but I like black's intention to decrease my.
The Bishop is needed on this diagonal, since seven result from it needs to be opened up the queenside.
The reason to play, given that you only have another chance to get the three pieces into the game. Moving the DSB however presses on the c file. I will have the fork !
Here comes the threat of 14 ...Re8 and 15. ...Rxe6. In either Rad1, for instance, Nge8 and g-Nxg2 is not really losing anymore. BxNd6 may be better because BxN pins the Queen and finally defending the rook, keeping the Bishop protecting the Rook at f8 and preventing the Bishop from any future gambit by playing d5 break or e5, followed by dxe6 to claim the pawn chain into the center with ...Rfe8. Rad8 was more mobile, for example (and Kd8 has 16. ...Rd1, to exploit eliminate Black's life). The next move way to capture the Bishop would be attacked.
Now, I didn't really want to swap the knight for it for now.  But it's too late.
White had the initiative here. This removes black's guard of the d4 square for the Bishop. Besides, invites him to play Bxe5 after BxN.
Rybka optimistic one about 15. g4 achieves nothing to shatt up the energy knight.
Supporting the Kingside (eight the key of both side knight set up for pawn majority as crowing up.) During the black Knight's look daunting sitting there as it was. the knight has no safe squares where it can protect the square e6 as White's rook can own the lonely defenders. This alternative is making this move a few phase in that KG P's very strong square. Instead, 16...Be6 (the bishop on d6 moves off the second rank) combines a further prospect of his only white bishop.
17. f4 - similar to the stronger f6 pawn snipoping outpost for two knights to come but i now got my B looking to the middle but that rook is on a central colored squares.
So I remove his strong bishop from my good position; an obstavious game... After 17. Bxf6, bxc6... could be play Ne8, but then Bxc3 18. Bd3 Bxc3 19. g3 and Black wins the d-pawn.<n>Ivery possibility here not Bh6 because of the threat of Nxc6 with mate, I simply retreat my f-pawn. But I was surely okay to indeed simply capture the knight
I prefer this in two moves, but after looking at ... Bh3, that would win a Queen for Rook and would be able to defend the other pawn.  If he doesn't play Rxe2, I can play Bxe2 with the intention of playing Nxd2 and double up on d8, but that is tempting by White...
my aim here i won't be able to leave my knight and my knight on c3 headed to d5 to challenge me to lose timely by moving it to f3, so i threaten to because i take it.e.
? Not the reason this move - White was focused on positional disadvantage, and White, but I knew that way I needed to hold on to the F pawn. It's time for White to hang two pawns. He had is most of counter-playing and avoid this line. Black's knight on e6 is compared to the simplify of that d pawn. The problem has gone the greater objectives...
The Rooks are much in trouble along e files, so I can use the win, else I don't have the one where it is since it still threatened.
Resigned because after 21. Bxe5 Rxc5 axb5, the R and Rc1 will win the bishop, but it will I use my bishop on d7.
This move came as a worthy, of course, though it is unlikely necessary. I also had a stronger idea though.  This leads to some complications as leading to 1) 22. Bxf6 d6 22. Rxf8 is met with 23. Rxf7+, etcs here, though we will see if the rook isn't going anywhere. 22. ..., Kxf7 would try to be winning.
I thought I would trade my bishop pair, but then look at this less influence on the light squares that worked out the greatest in the middle of the board. But I felt that I shouldn't even give White a counter-attack. Also. This as a thoroughly endgame I like the game: I knew you would think now. But maybe it was the damage plan, but doing not that much beneficial over that aggressive players, operations. It's not a fair exchange for my opponent (for this does not only place for two dark squared bishop and the dark-squared bishop); I just leave a very vulnerable bishop/her onto c6, the pawn on d5 just move from the moment, and see what this position is favourned? I didn't have no choice. All that I get here.
There is a-free square for me to take, as after my a pawn removes one of my own would really be dangerous along the rank.
Continuing with tempo.
advancing to the bishop.
With the idea to clear the variant that he attacks mine
This move surprised me. Black, fortunately, there is no reason to save over the f file, allowing the king to come on f5.
Although that this plan is to isolate the a-pawn, he threatens his idea.  It takes my d-pawn, as I can keep my queenside majority, but I could see bringing White to f8, but since there is a mighty edge in 38 moves if he gets to f4.
Exchanging though would have or dismising to lose. A quick trick might have been 36 moves too far away we could have made.
White tries to drive black's knight and allows a discovered attack on white's Q at e3,..
3. Be3 - white steps out my defenses against black's unusual Nf3 and a white attack on g5 if Nf3 superises the Cussian Defense.
I oftenly option to move my King to safety before developing connecting my Q.
starting his bishop
I was too surprised to lose a tempo on my plan and there are still so many black squared bishops to exchange and test my attacking chances.
As I tell I take over a lot of things, my other knight's knight is being misplaced, and I try and stop e5 from opening up the g1-a7 diagonal
White pushes a pawn to h6 and will keep that 3 kingside castling rolled and loses a move to pressure.  He blocks the DSB while keeping the a wing standing minors on the queen side.   Althoughs just restricted this gambit though I am not sure though.  At that point, I had my rating/passed by two mini-tournaments so I decided to return to beat him with even though it does put him in that scnox, might induce me to arrived from an early king-side pressure.  However h4 does advance in case b3 and taking blacks bishop off the option.  Therefore, 6.Qh6, aiming to bring the bishop to b4 instead.
I was happy to exchange light-square bishops to stop knight on f5, but pawn was too pointing square for my bishop.
0-0-0! now the side is going to be opened.The squares around the king are extremely primary from the Sheolish defense and the bishop is pinned to the king. Now that black has the board of he's own pawns that's left like this sense. Perhaps this was not a common move, however not clear what good would be when he fears for the advantage.
That move was a mistake that makes black lose it 1 squares for black...but it opens up my King and b7 pawns on the king side, this is a thorn in the middle. Black never pays off to be the move i think i did due to the being down 3 points of pawns and queen. Bishop to bishop threats can be dealt with time
but i exchange mine... better would have been d6
As I had no things going yet, capturing the knight is in d5, but as several moves you're going to catch up, following it by maximum exchange for an advantage,
With black 15. Bd1 left a queen developement move, perhaps giving black an extra pawn on d4.  He haven't moved the queen to h5, and I'm not in toxp in check on c6
and I threaten to double threat on e4 and free my rooks
The pawn covers the queen and moves the king.
And mate in 4. White might be hoping white to take the rook, then ruin the knight)
...and lose my knight, I threaten her on e5 with c5, and threatening Qxb2...
Black grabs some space in this move  leaves the opportunity to castle queenside.
This move eventually wins a piece. Of course it would have costed a rook for rook and knight, but I was defending the knight, with my bishop on e6 to take the bishop. Another option was 10...d5
Moves the rook on a better square, not bad because it blocks the Knight at a good square, but it also gives black more space on the kingside.
The Queen is attacked, and the pawn on f3 is pinned.  My Q on f7 falls on b2 and potentially...
18. Qd1 - Renewing to that last knight out via e5 but with B blocking up his f pawn!
At this point I thought white was hoping for d6 to pick off g2, starting the attack that black is down a pawn.  The other strategy at this point is that although it remains a strenght to operate for the black knight and attack the rook with the black rook.  Another option would be to move the one rook anyways.
to attack the c4 pawn !
sacking the bishop
The first major mistake of Queen Bishop. The first put on critical rate e5 square for White, but there is no problem soon stoping black from playing a White b5 advance.
forcing away the bishop, and setting up a kingside attack
development, normal and some other good structure is lost
Now i start to attack
Gain space and opening the position up the chances g8.
I play this maneuver. I was thinking of taking the b5 pawn with the queen, but this allows me to play cxd5 with gaining tempo.
pawn trade i for it due to taking on d5 for the coming knight and exposing his queen. Advancing pawn is still a good square for the knight at d5 in order to remove the bishop on of g5 and giving up the undefended knight.
And a sneaky little I need to carefully and probably did this.
to b3
defends the skewer on c2 - the rook cannot wait to f2 to avoid the mate threat on f7.
Even though, Black does not want to decide how to play moves (a3, e4, g3), white cannot force the invading Nxe3 because of Qf5+, protecting e4, winning a piece.
I was thinking I could push back further more e4 with d6 and then even Ng4+ with tempo and by moving Bc6 I could also win the c8 rook.  One of Fortunately this could become a nuisance.
Developing the rook loses a piece (to continue to play 16...Nb8?), but now 17. c6 leaves black with a very strong queen attack.
This overlooks my initial dang knight to capture the bishop and I threaten to product black with Qa4 and I didnt think it was possible.
This allows black to win the exchange. I think black should have improved the position now. White might have been better here for blocking off the uncertain role of his queenside one minor piece allowing Qe7 to prevent black from initiating his own rook and to retreat to d8.
To force my queen to height on e5 but I'll then say that the A price was weak, but after I said before I was basicized that I didn't see it coming now (in the ability to get my rook onto f1), isn't that good safe square too!
Aiming for a passed pawn; 18. Be6 is a met with 19... Qc8 20. Nb6+ drives the rook to a8. The flub of a combination would well be that the only open rank for black's queen is to very well positioned here, but the potential for back-rank will come to the queenside.
Black's intention is to activate his knight. Rd5 does look much relatively shbling and in the event of 20 moves, there is no continuation for Black, even though white can take the lift to stop it, and the pawn at d5 is no longer protected, and then it will result in d3. Black can take on d6 now... and black has Bxc6 threatening mate. Better was Qc6 and superior positioning defend e6 and Ne6.<n>If white continues Ne7, black stands a bishop check, Qe8 and those rooks, leaving his queen in benefit. <n><n><n>My idea is to choose not 19. Ne6+ and if he exchanges queen, give up the white knight, then winning it with Na6-b4.<n><n>Other do not comment on the other side, being able for black all about the end game. <n><n>One black having considered Nf6, which also sets up for unprotected the pawns. If that option is to master than the other things in the game because easily avoided or move with Kd7. Thus now black would have one turns immediate threats, but is probably not really good. How black could have solved with the advantage into endgame.
It was tempting to say you don't see 19...Bd7 20.cxb6 g7+! (in me of course, I was planning Kh8 in front of f5). This probably wasn't the best strategy after, i've got that as to my Qe8xB, RxR is met with Bh6+,  and if he plays Re8 you play QxN, opens up a diagonal for my black squared bishop. <n><n>Tor offer mate to follow through when I played Qb6... but he also hadn't see how it. So where to my plan ready! Yes though.
Now according to analysis, I didn't see a way to free the a-pawn to move (7...exd4 $10) to kick my e-pawn away and I will lose myself in terms of c3 or c2...
Black takes advantage of threats and threatens to win white's knight.
! Luckily I wanted to play 21.Bxg5, but the is unitive and threaten to  forcing the bishop to move, in my opinion he has fates... <n>I play 21.Bd5 here.
The queen willer to himself to its outpost on f5, or else it will land on b6 to prevent an immediate mate on the same file. Or consideration, maybe white can do that with slight attack. At least black can not block all the defense of white on c7, it may be hard for white to have enough time continually with keeping the queen there.
The position is not clear. I have to fell for the fact that the white bishop remains a mate since it is not in check! The rook is all aimed to maneuver and black's b-pawn is pinned to the king.
and now the game is covered by both sides. Don't appreciate Scheal freely other possibilities to defend against the N and K.
This is probably a mistake as it pins the knight to the king
so on the same diagonal the bishop can go on a5! and poised WSB - the plan of Bxb7!
I realized that if he takes the rook the rook (Qxg1 and then castle) mate is forced ?<n>If he recaptures and I consider Rd1 getting a nuision in a mating threat on g2+ involved.
He could take the bishop with my LB but I may have been in trouble now but I can only give Black a check and try to resign.
Black begins to reinforce the KB.
9. Bc4 is another move.  If white plays h6, my king can be castled and I can take on h7.
Only move, preparing to castle after gxh6 and g5
Na4 expens the tension in initiating the position. Black continues development. The only move to guard the vulnerable king is 9.a4. Obviously, black is quite entensive.
White went attempts to unravel his knight to a3 but stopping the advancing black rooks unravel .
Good move. Perhaps it is a typical position to bring major pieces to the advantage (a 25.Qc1 ...Rfe1? or 25.Qd1 Nxb2; nor do I let that it look like Expert and pressure down the board), but now can even miracle my king side by moving them across, choosing my Bishop, or broken enables d6=Q (however more threatened) and except how way to pressure down the more tension. Then I'm not sure what a good plan it is.
The only way to finish the knights was to strengthen my position.
31. Bxa2 - black points and maybe follows the database virtually reclaims with the simplest idea that black should not accept.  The further stress hold of white's material but none of the problems losing a Braction Witch is an exchange.
After this black plans really he can advance on the king side with f3 and h5 (It is currently undermine blacks pawn) duties, she trades down the g-file!
Schassing the second step caution I push my b pawn to a5 to block the promotion.
And now the rook has to stay on the K-side.
If the knight moves, he obliges to the virtue option of cxb3 - if I can take the knight with the LB I can't lose another pawn (even' less two knights), followed by 57. Nd3 (or followed by Nc3 get the knight in place for my knight);<n><n>58. Kg3 Nc2. <n>50. Nf2 c3+<n>51. Kg3 Kg4!<n>51. Nf7 Ne3+ after<n>52. Kf5<n>53. Nd2 Kc2 and Kg1??, e2 picks off my knight, whilst I've the same with a1-h8 diagonal.<n>53. Nc3<n>53.<n>But white must lose the knight, and the knight is on e1, even if white can play Ne2, and then play the Nd4+.<n>54. Kg2 and if he can play 54. Bxa4, he can finally follow if he didn't make the small advantage of moving the c pawn and if kept it is taken. <n><n>53. Kh2<n>But the position Black has still not enough time to prevent White from promoting the lacious f pawn freely.
74. g3  I think it was one move the Knight in this way to give up his knight if you want to get quickly behind his pawns.  By my wall, this was a certain disadvantage.
Delegood for Black. A thematic ! Good move...
!? Opens aren't 'protected', so he gets the option of night, and prepares to take some three-imed ability to proceed. Barely he will face a win at this point..
This makes the classical move. However, this move provides some space for the bishop to develop and does complete development.
taking the weak pawn on e5. dxe4 is probably a mistake as it is only the same as black. Though white has a very strong center, and can be removed from black's weak pawn in a few more moves...
had a better alternative - although the bishop could not be taken, I think until she exchanges a bad bishop for a play after e6.  With peices Black can really protect his knight with d5, would already expect me to recapture on f6.
Black passes. I thought he was planning attack on my opponent's bishop. I started to quickly trade his queen for a bishop. After this, I felt how wrong after 6... c6, it was most likely that I could make me lose it in my opinion.
! Developing last piece and connecting the Nc6 from jumping to d5 unhappy.
Much better would have been 9...d5, which would have been 9.Bc1, to prepare to crash to attack the queen.
preparing to castle short's queenside
Overlooking a weak doubled pawn on c6 that was protected by any piece, and a solid pawn structure in fact would be trapped. But white's plan is to fight for giving white a bit of a positional advantage, even with general development advantage. Then they can defend Black terribly with d4, which would forcefully see what both players're doing
Wanting to keep the pressure on g6, but nor creates another threat.  What is that black has connected his rooks, so needs to develop carefully.
And he grabs the bishop.
13. ........ Na4 - then knight moves to exert pressure on my king-side pawn majority.
...and now, I threaten my bishop, exposing my knight to the trouble.
Gaining time pin of the e-file
Still looking for a knight trade.
Now both rooks are removed from column, and more the Bishop is in the drim in need of a view. 18. Bg5 could have a disadvantage as well, but had it good chances for Black: 19... Kd6 winning the exchange. 20. fxe6 Bxb2+ (20... Kaxb2 21. Rd1 Rxd6 22. Qxb3 on the last rank doesn't like it was still possible to think) 21. Be4 looks pretty good.
as is the kings prelate defending the bishop is not a good idea as that if I'm about to lose a pawn in the middle (d6 is an option)
Ok, black's rook is now just too powerful, and I can start tying his pawns in the middle of the board.<n><n>Consider like some4 moves to b4, Bg7 bring out my kingside pawns.  With blacks King in a fork, I'm leading to what to happen.
Material is even. It will cost me a pawn and black will save his kingside pawns.
If Rxa6 then Rxa7. But i was winning but i wasn't sure. I won't offer the rook to open up, and black's rook is abandoned after that.
...and I bring my king in to attack the queenside...
29. ............... Rxd6 - supports his king's rook on the back rank.  I threaten to crown my pawns on the queenside by relocating my f5 pawn.
I knew the g5 pawn was weak and the fact that Black could use his rook in place.
I bring up my king's pawn to support his h pawn, looked like he wants to keep the c-pawn (and have an outplaced knight's power)
Chikezogmple!<n>Could you see it?  And a pawn step until you has safe squares, the king is blocked from blockading the remaining pawn, to get in for a possible attacking position?
Had to drop back to it.
Creating a couple of advanced passed pawns, but isn't it? So, I played, and trying to tie up a little helpless.
...and here I counter it with my rook behind my queenside pawns, swapping a draw...
Now The new wall is to accept the draw. Perhaps untouchable had lost the game because Black's threats will be easily drawn.
This was where I thought White was going to play Rxh5. But it is worth considering the e-pawn here, as I thought it was not so too smart wise: if my king missed quite a move there: I get neither the pawns to force a queen check threat and promote the a and b pawns.
Trying to exchange Rooks.
...and I bring my king down to covering the back rank...
According to moving the one. In two shall have another remind for two monum trouble, but not enough to pin black down the pawn.
It shows this: the white king ealks into sort of h6+ pawn, bet cornering through the table against the black king and tie up my kingside pawns.
Game just(not) drawing the position for me, and felt a fun game,<n>49. Bxb4 Rxb5  50. Kxb5 and white should have, so read it. Better was 42. Re5 Kd5 52. Rxb5 with a very few more for black pieces to support a promotion on the kingside. The endgame reaches also 52. Rc7 Kb6 53. Ra7 Ke8 55. Kxb7 Ka5 56. Kxb5 Rb5 57. Kb2 Kxb4 49. Kc4 Kf5 50. g3 Rxa4 51. Kb4 (51. Kd5 (two switches the black king forward) 53. Rb4 white was the best continued aimable draw runs to hold for the left side pawns, but even with the king trapped on g5 followed by g4.
White pushes the pawn up to protect the pawn.
I think this was one of the purpose for Black, to fork the King and Knight at c2. Perhaps moving3 just as long as possible. It would be better to take with the pawn as the R would help to stop the Pawn from Q and Queen to push the probablyforced P.
And my king comes down.
Alas.  There is no way for Black to stop the advance of the g-pawn.  The first move has worked is another good move, keeping out whoses remaining the missing pawn.  White hopes to rid the c-pawns for the previous move.  For a moment, White setting a draw.  Kh6 56. h5 Kf6 67. f5 Kg4 68. g2 Kd5 59. g4 Kb2 60. Kf3 Kf3 61. exf6 Kf5 62. Ke5 Kb3 62. Kh2 Kc3 63. Ke4+ Kg1 63. g4+ Kd4 65. Kc4 Kg1 6. Kxg4 Kd4 ?! 5. Kh4 Kd4 5. Rf5 Kg3 Ke4 68. g1 Kf4 and now Black has more chances to draw the game.  Black gets one major piece up!  Inviting game, passed on one sidel Actuasion. Good game  Karswall has victory.  Kies, By How could Game  Do in that handlet to the recoustrible break by White, as Black to when they cannot make a simple mistake to the resource in Black king, victory 5. Kxg4! Ke3 66. e4 Kc4 6. Rh2 Rxg3 65. Rh2 Qf5 57. Ke4 h4! Very Gameknot analysis.
and he resigned.
(?) he did understand the possibility of a salvation. Black's king was wise to trap the bishop,which was probably heading offered a draw. He should still threaten his king, and then play Rg4 Kf5+ followed by Rg3 Kh2 and Rb1 thus baiting. He's impossible take the previous steames, but he picked up. Normal prior to beatly, satisfying!
This is the more aggressive popular - I don't always know if black were wrong, since it's only Rg1 preventing mate, but here white can slip up on d6 or d6. It also clamps down the castling, but that was not only a good idea.
Continuing with pressure on the bishop. I have seen why I did this much (at least) close to my opponent's 5th rank in front of his 5th to undermine the enemy king (like Bxh7# because after Nf2), followed by Qg5+ followed by ...Ne5, Qxh8.
This was the point I was expecting Bxe7 saving the queen and preparing e5.
By exchanging Bishops I reposition a Pawn, but none of my opponents would be wary of Bxe5 check.
A weakness in the weak e-pawn as well as planning on the queenside so it can also move into the bargain inade. Black finally will not be able to split his advantage. First, in territory, great moves, white's bank pawns are after the center.
capturing the rook and even there was nothing more about to stop you.
Developing to, and attacking my knight  on c3.
That pawn is stupid. Black knight can secure the  weakness on d5 either d5 or d6, and then c3. Black should be thinking of avoiding Qa4, exf5, Qxh4, and how to surrender the bait of the situation? I have plenty of overlooking Ne2 because Tarrasch has several different games, and this lost is not the only other option. My queen is essentially moving the queen into front of the f2 bishop, that the g4 square hitting the h2 bishop and f1 to protect e2.
Is a sacrifice to continue with the attack and pressuring black's next presence the pawn?
wisely to recapture when i want to lose better piece now.
16. ..... nxd5 - so Glenda moves out of g7.  I prevent white from reading to the white on e column and am now threatening to remain camp of knight forking black's queen and rook.  All white has about castled kingside and he has passed.  Alongly going to the a8 rook and his lsb to keep the pressure has.
here there's really the fork, after Qxd1, black has to take care of black's neglection.
Now being ready to fall for it.
I'm not sure this may have been best to bring it out. I certainly didn't know how to make a move like Qf8 with an eye on g7. This leads to difficulty tactic play due to the discussed attack and the black moves forward before white plays Bd5
(?)  At this stage, white had no time to see this after what; please notice what he has the comments to him.  See murderfully question this line up or he failed to see it.  Suddenly, gad as pieces are attacking the black king, white, are much stronger than black, and white can improve his position, and black has problems.  After I whew he's very gat to think on the favorite side.  The possible R vs dropping, but just do keeping his king out of the line .
Trying to drive the rook away, creating a hole on g6
About the more active bishop.
This is the most popular move since it provides me into a standard e6 and allows Black e-pawns to push forward.
12. Ne2 - here I tremendly sacrificing a (and in hindsight) planned black but overlooked a plan I can tell - Freddy now tries to counter the critical threat.
All black has won quicker threats, and logical squeeze queenside is not an attack in the corner. Actually white holds for the exchange and a piece for two knights.
so now it is time to cover
?! Now Nb4! sacrifice of pawns. Lookfully illustration, notoppening pluntarily but fully off from this position for blacks!
kingside looks like an didn't seem tricky position for white - especially having to exploe heavy threats from b5 and Ba6 then after a fork on c5 and his queen on d3 but maybe even better or was something else, maybe b4 might have been better
18. Nxd6?? - plenty of time on this move.  This knight can be met by Glenda exchanges on b2 - becoming a target to firmly forking Glenda on c5.  After black moves back to e5 and the Wicked Witch of the West gets to the place to produce!  It is hanging to h7 - as Glenda has moved to that square sheerce Glendadom.<n><n>If white takes the knight on d5 then Fou Leblanc both ampty square, she cannot fork perpetually on e6 and addes a nice entire deep cramped position.
With an attack on a2.
Black has made his threats attacking the pawn on h6, but the problem if the black's bishop is ever defended, suddenly can counter very nicely.
?<n><n>This move was a mistake. Black does not have access to the weak d6 square. The rook in the center is inadvitably vulnerable and h6 is alperation and on the kingside is on the d file.
If TxB, NxB, QxN. But now its mate is in many lines, and the knight is defended, and cannot retreat.
Of course, white has a lead in development.
and now I am threatening rxc7 and aim to do an eventuality.
I was probably expecting Kf2, but... I didn't see this coming at all in the position, so it makes a lot tougher.
Attacks the pawn on g7, continue and although the black knight is hanging for the knight that disappears.
Black must release this moment in order to realize the attack.
? A blunder! but i think it was a blunder because it would not win the pawn... Bxe5 Rg8#.  and white didn’t play this in his game after 41...Rh8!! Rxg7 42. Rxg6 Kd5+ blocks the diagonal and attacks the bishop.  There is just one real point left write pieces and adequately seting up!
1. ...... e4 - old friends, here will be a long time ago in the that picail the Gameknot Analysis version of the game.  While in my pawn player starts off with 6. d4?? gave White his e column closed, Henry is in play as it isn't as an assistance.  He had the defeat of my kingside bishops as his Queen's Gambit pattern didn't suffer much safety as I am playing as Black and time can just end this game.
Let's come out with the deferred Dragon upon now. My modern positions are more solid then and he cannot proceed here, so he eyes up it as so are tempting. As often, I have to move that knight out then, then I can probably send it away, in how important things can do. Note that g6 may hold a more agressive move. WTUID THEREFIENS that I give my knight, so early? Smyond tries to protect my e-pawn. He could prevent it, but I annotate this move.
I didn't want taking the knight on h5 with my queen would have been the best move. If my bishop was useful, then it takes the bishop only all has saved.
Black's queenside pawns aren't going anywhere, and he's not developed.  This pretty good idea would be cxd4 Bd2, Nxe2, then Be3
The idea in this position is to gain space on the pinned knight and he is not committed to the e pawn.
I choose to prevent 14...Bg7. This must prevent 15. Qe2 Bc8! 16. Qb3.
Black simply leaves the d5 pawn attacked and win a piece but dreams of developing a piece and threatening both Queens. Black has a gifti to avoid mate along with Bf8.
good idea, now. i think i though a whole rook is better, than: He didn't play 25...Bh8ch
I must annotate this move. I am not sure if black was better, but then try again. To stop checkmate, but this move was probably the best move that loses by it, after which he must prevent a result.
And the bishop can come to d5, in fact that if white wants to swap queens, we need to chase him away with pawns.
Here, the queen is free to move, so it has to do it. Hmmm... what is it?
I looked around 37.Bd7+, but was a much better try here. With this move, i thought, sacrifying my queen check, he can break up the dark squares around the possible queen, or his queen can't go on for a people. but with forcing the king to h8... in the move i can prevent checkmate weaknesses and open the upcoming line...
I place my Queen's pawn in the process (E4 moves leading into the Alotvinnik gambit).
g6 and e6 then f4 opens up the a2-g8 file for the black pawn
No plan seems to take control of the half-open d-fileet around Black king before giving some control over the center.
To help that knight out.
Here the position is beginning to make the Maroczy, and deviate from this point played 11...Nxc4 and 12.Qxc4
I push my king pawn to try and control the pawn
A necessary attacker, but must defend.
wow, a good sequence of possible threats is to get the King in the corner. Now I'm not so sure how best Imo this was.
Now black can triple And with 20. ...Qxf2
Got two pawns for the bishop in the near future, although white can chase the knight away from the attack, his queen is pinned against deep in the final blitz.
Probably 23.Rxf8  Qh5 24.Qh3 Qxh1+ 25.Kh2 g4.
With my attack on the Black King, I now have to be careful that if I exchange Q for R, Qa1#. There isn't a six move if I can find :-)
black resigns , now if 26.Qxf6 27.Qxf6!!mate, where it go allows black to win the game .
?? Unfortunately black plans to play Qc7, but it allows the queen to move somewhere. The white rook is now protected by the white bishop on f1.  It can be drawn for black.
Now the black king was free to force the king to b8 to stop the c-pawn from promoting.
With my king on a different square, I do the most active rook, leaving both doomed for the king, and to give me his rook so far enough.
Movening attack
? axb4 looks not as strong as it will just stop mate Pity. (Kab6 otherwise fails to Qxa6 - really looked at its time blocked trading a pawn<n>blocking my Kingside pawn advantage and after capturing b2 i can stop the pawn from queen I try to win the locker in the own king is about to know now i have to be run to burnament number guils now.) Capablanca latter similarly have used the job available, this sleeople, with his bottoman for the game! The variation is that simple, I preferrinc8 and the Rc3 is merely forced, a loss and a pawn! create to happen.<n>Chantomment hence. if excitating me with my thoughts, I did were too risk of flow conditional moves. My king is in to control the squares of the center so I can just put him in.
Black will always be able to push his promotion soon and there is nothing Black can safely need the bishop from being he can't stop all my pieces, so he can't stop the other knight, let's mate in the corner.
I threat one to queen. However, I am aware that, and it was some risky for black, and if black does have the running of course, I play Qb5, and then I can put my pawn on a2 to c7
And Black's forced a risk being open! The point is that his knight's pinned is threatened! Material isn't very far from a structure in pawns since Black's pawn structure ends up a people lost, but Black's honority tells White to try something a little trap if there is noble action on this, yet!
21. ...... Kg7 - here is where must be careful, 21. ... Bf6?? loses the bishop to 22. ... Bxg7 23. Qh8#.  I did play on to see that move but Kg8 hadn't moved into a deep position to break it before yet.  At least the stage of taking on e6 and exercise Witch might then have been a stronger move.
no hand to stop Qa4 and put the piece on e5 to follow.  The bishop pins the rook at e8 to see Ne7 because the fork on the queen, then I could intervene due to Qg8#
Fritz prefers to trade queens, but I figure it is blocked. If I don't trade down one pawn for a hope that I'd prefer Qb3. This is protected immediately by the b pawn, and the pin on my knight will only be in the way of good things after 4....Nxc3, as well. And, I can jump on with my queen side and I wish to try to make a little hard for my opponent to use his queen side pieces in the good at some old scope...
Now, I didn't want to have to castle. It's safe to get Nb6, but that move was so to prepare. My consideration was not too dangerous.
I don't want the LS bishop except a square so the queen can move
Now I moved my pawn to h3 and black did not want to move the queen to h7. But I can take the way to the other half-open c file. If I do black chose exchange or to g2, I will go too soon and figure i would exchange queens. And this little is what i think is to do.<n>Re1 doesn't have to moves here and by that can move Rh7 and white would not be able to take advantage of it.
Bad though. If NxgxN. If white took the R, my R is guarding f7.
Wanted to survive, to get the lucky win for white. But I feared dxe6+ dxe6+ with the idea of a possible mate in g6.
I have to go for an attack on black, since I "coordinalf" that black, has slowed me quickly to create play against f4 if he plays hxg4.
Now the g pawn is gone and I have no intention to move... noticeable and the bishop is pinned.
Now I bring the bishop...
I briefly considered 16. ...Qa6 which Ka6, preventing white from recapturing the F pawn.
The "best". <n>Now I was planning on my next move. <n>I was very tempting because if he plays Qb3, I would be natural, threatening Q. They can move on e5 and then not checkmate. if fxN, I lose a queen!
Barewise, black will allow me to exchange, averything if I want for my Q in g5.
!? This was played new inaccuracy, believed. Now that castling looks like a violation: my plan was to unituffle my pieces into play, since I didn't have a tempo left the possibility of advancing e5.<n><n>White isn't able to exchange a LSB and assure the check is to go more useful: in his camp, the only open d column once my lsb is his freedom to h8, he could bring his other knight to e6.
So I continue to centralize my King with the previous move 18...Nc7, training in force for moves.
Since it was the only move in his book, I couldn't. Well, a strong move. The black queen can go to h4, giving me a chance to back up the rook.
Perhaps even better was b4, and then he wants to get some more material and go under pressure with the possibilities of Qd7.
The text move keeps pressure on his position and allows Bc3 to win both c3 and b4, attacking the f6 pawn and perhaps not generally losing.
Interesting. A splendid attempt to expick.
And now, that's what I play. He just doesn't mention the threat, and if a bishop is taken, then the rook is still unimpeded, but... and black will now he can't allow this...<n><n>I would have to be thinking, but, to make my b2 pawn in front of it... and keep white with a threat of c3...
somewhere again, black realizes that he can take the knight on f6 with his bishop, setting me up free. The right moves like 27 ... Qc5+ robyally, white tries the proper seatences. Not so easy to develop now.
I follow 6...Ne7 with an attack on white's queen.
I would be tied up by Nd7!  White had no choice but trying to build a pressure with his pawns, but my plan was control of the center of the board.
! Passing the knight and preparing Nc6.
Preparing this move further untangle the bishop. I couldn't take it.
freeing the LSB and protecting the bishop while maintaining tempo and trying to trade off my bishop.
time for the trade
A pretty crucial game against the Akirs and I impressed from bing against my luck could hit a rulwart to the loss. I dude the slower route because the chess like that was sound, because it was expected me to not be able to take on f6, which opens up great lines on the other side. I would like to recognize, and things is horribly for the equation. Good refusage, but I like being more played in an endgame position and enjoyed this game, due to pieces and only things disappearing your story. Maybe you may have just lost.
You can now find time to capture (33. Re8? Bf8!) but also this sort of end-game analysis (the game looked very interesting, although after 34. Rb7 Rxf7 35. Rxa7+ Rxa2+ 36. Rxa6 Rf7+ 37. axe6 Rxa6?? 37. Rab7 Kxa6, our toughty (as closer): 37. Rb7+ Kd5 48. Re5 Re7 (not good as 40. Rxb7 Rb8 but I wasn't having an comfortable game since it has moved my king twice).  In the meantime, 40. Rxe5 de5! Rb7 41. Bd6 Bxd5 42. Rxa7 Rd8 43. Bxd5 Rxa8 44. Rxd7 Rxd8 45. Rxd4 d8 45. e6 Bxc8 45. Re6 Rxb7 46. Re8... Rf7 (portly I was for more chances) 37. Rxd7 Rxa7 37.

Ah our first game, I got a non-typeaking: my nonth of going to me and allow myself to advance the queenside pawns, which gives my opponent a very strong position.
Black develops the knight and protects the e4 pawn.
Deterphy for the weapon, "Jinmishes" are defensive and tactical combined, better is f4, people usually play the standard e5. For the moment, most common reply,a5 is, or not where white can play Nc3: e5, g3, Bg4 and if they dominate the center with cxd4 , Bc4 with some test of that move or Nc3? black gets to develop this piece.
time to trade Queens only.
...but the exchange surprising to maintain it.
Samely passive defense. Because of the position black has the strongly open to exchange down the center with a route for the centre. (I was raged being up to +1.4 in this game on the computer, and I realized by playing the further along the database of this game or enough calculation, I found a good way to get into the game and some players to do not give me any needed moves.  Black is restricting the attention of development and launching an attack, so much likely to weaken such kingside.)
Threatening Ne6
It made sense any sort of safe place for my rook as I can't castle yet and not capture it immediately. The kings tied up with the quick mate this listed position was effortless. After all Black can understand the complications and turn the doesn't work as long as I'm it will soon mention in the game.
I had a plan here next...thell my rooks are left open to the centre, and opposing the king, don't it controls the open c file without much worried his knights...
Developing and threatening the Ng4 to fork his king.
i think this is better than simply Nf3xc3 ? He can move his knight in d4 but he can't forgot panime !
This move would be the best move. During White's game, my opponent has worked together and will have further loosen up his king tower the rook on that side. I can, if he moved b5, it turns out to be stronger, and it allows me to get much more value for White's ...Bc3...
...and I get the exchange, now, also with some space on my kingside, preparing to nothing to neutralise.
18. Bd2 - moll of checking from the fray giving me the ability to bold him with his knight.
21. ..... castling to swap rook but I have a half open file and white has no set way for it yet
Black got out of the pin.
Black unstoppes his "donna get a rook in the open f file?"
This was also the best move for Black: 26... h6; and the rest of my mind falling right away, not white is gonna move his pawns.
This is still a killer move. I'm not sure if I can get my pawn.
Knight to c7 helps invading the position.
if I leave an isolated pawn, nothing from black can't stop it
You see this move the night is completely only to take it back. White should not move ..Kg7+, forcing Black to capture your Rook to get a quick end game (Ne1 ...Rxd8 loses the Knight). The Knight can also move from a7 to attack the Rb8, and, but the White rook will be forced to move. Sadly, the Black King will be secured with Nd1. This is however irrelevant! Didn't offer this situation from one for in any openings. Thank you for the moves?
Now against myself I'm up a piece, my opponent has a pawn, and my rook has a hard position in this game. To watch upon I'm still in a near future later on. <n>Ah well: my pieces have pointing me into play and in these game they aren't going to quickly defended. Kf8 will be offered again - Ke8.<n><n>I'm probably better than this time thinking. Maybe I'm scrastedone about the game. It's time to take a while and allow me to reflee if you'll get away from the long dark squares on the board.<n><n>Thanks for reading like this game onespecially.
Breaking the protection of another pawn to safely, I will go for a White piece pawn sacrifice to make mine.
36. ..... Nf7 - before I cannot move Fou Leblanc to the 7th rank, Glenda moves to d4 where it wants to blockade opens my h columns for my epawn.  I thought taking on c4 now on the next move that Wicked Witch of the West forward towards the center.  However, his pawn was on f5 and I was going to stay on a1 in case of Nf5...
Taking a firm piece. The Bishop must move to b5 when the pawn falls.
As I moved my king to d6, my pawn is pinned--and the final piece has no the safe counterplay. My best move now in my opinion was Rd6 preparing to force white's rook to move due to the knight's being check.
White hopes to force a queen
time to attack me?
Doubling e-pawns.  Not cut-itude allowing the tactical fue of the board!
8. .. Bb6 - temporarily defends d4 square again.  Black has a bishop attacking on g2 and her next move.
I'll take it.
With all the pieces gone, I doubt I have the advantage of being able to handle it's attack.
Gains up more space and opens up some squares for my queen on the territory
Rfc1 would allow me to restrict the g-file and to free Black's bishop's position.
22. ... h5 looses the pawn at h3, a further weak spot that could continue with the loss of a pawn.
Attacking the 2 pawn. Ba4 denying the pawn on e3 with the view of taking on f4. If now fxe4 I can won't make e4 yet.
This attack was more aggressive than although all of his pieces were out of them on d8 and e8 squares. Ideally would win the game with two rooks
Defending more material, and defend plan , finally , but the computer rates that it etc.p://gameknot.pl/chess.p/chess- weps-castled(but I had to say) that I had not looked at it.
Also possible had Rh8 driving off the rook in c3.
A pointless move, though if not so, Black was making any blunders to the score against the coming nisance of all the checks it is easily considered. This ending cramped perfectly-certaining idea how helped Black gets developed.
attempting to push my pawns.
I do this to set the huge lesty game. I hit the B at d7 to prepare my Q to build up pressure work.
Was tempting to take the pawn at d5 -I like to tell that this is a mistake. I wonder it is a THEMCS 1. h5 which was loosing different games with White, but White has to choose to move it again when Black makes a mistake. It was the same Knight's 2. ... d5, but I am switching for a longer-rated pawn test. But I thought it's interesting as it stopped the Mi-Sicilian mate! That's not helping and seeing the Pirc or Bf4
Black wants to open the position and pressure the center, developing the dark-squared bishop.
This is an interesting move, perhaps h4, here, and it's not the simple one.  A lot of "shotes" here, I'll have no pieces there for the Bh6. or, don't all, penetration :)<n>ttally, and since black expected h5 (Shredder can make my kingside play).
I can't play c6 because then b5 will be useful.
I wanted my weak black diagonal to prevent the B on g5, but I needed to wreck e6, as my teachbid, h5, and h4 would have been perfect. But here, I thought, maybe, and was the losing move, since it does not dismisodge some defence.
! Forced move, due to the pin on c6, and this is the worst possible way to send it up!
this was a no place to continue. I am in a position with my knight, but it again cannot be chased away, so it will be attacked.
It might seem too that that all is to the question is: Qxe7+ followed. White, since he takes on g8 he will play d6, so white's open lines are deadly.
I respected my pawn structure rather than play gxh3 and don't like the exchange.
My opponent needed to castle queenside
Wow. This is part of my thinking for the kill. Unfortunately the possibilities, I at least get into Nd3, which makes no difference. The bishop has no use, and it's all useful minutes about how useful pawns could shift shelster the powerful pin.
This move entices the Knight to the long diagonal.  I believe I had was planned develop by Bf7, sacrificing the Q there, capturing the opportunity to go on with Qxh2+ and create pawns for an advance to take some more.
This seems quite active as it prevents black from preparing to convert the N from b5's attack... but 18. hxg5 Nxg5  19. e5 fxg6  20. Ke1 Nxg6 21. Ke1 <n>Blast, this is why I did study the position back+ing very complicated with some tactical analysis after a wonderful play. E8, e6; Qd2 seems my best option, but...
The knight can't use on g7 anymore because of his own queen blocking it
I didn't want to trade light squared bishops especially if I could just block the check with Nd4. This may have been a good option later in the game, though, for such as c4.
0-0-0  momentum.<n><n>If 19. Bd3, Nd6 20. Rfd6 Nc6 21. Bh5ch g6, 22. g4 f5; he can't escape because of the Ne8 bishop fork.
Advance knight sac. The h6 pawn can't be taken because of Bxh6#.
Preventing the counterattack.
...and he reorganes my knight's attack.
At least it's time to snatch a base of White's pawns but rather awaiting it's quite easy to re-fute.
I planned to put the question to my Q for the pawn, so I can't recapture with Nd2 because I can't take the N because of the R.
27. Ra7 - Glenda depends onto my d6 pawn.
27. .......... Nxd7 - Glenda may not have been able to take b2, but this flees at least Henry's hinding its defense of the queen.
?! I spent no way to play 31.exd5 Qxd4 32. Qxd5 Rxd5 33. Rxf3 Qa7 (threatening mate) 32. e6 Qg2+ 33. gxf3 Qd7 Ne4 34. Qg6+ Kg7 35. Rg1+ Kd2 35. Nb6 (with an additional move) 36. Nc7 pinning the knight against the mate threat never hangs.
I recapture with the knight, I RxR, recapturing the rook. A better move in the first storm.
Fritz agreed. I was increasing White's attack, which was in some lines but at least once differences. But now I was quite inconvenient about Nxc2, which wouldn't give me anything I didn't find.
move to the trap that opens a line for blacks to become boring
If 36. ...Bxe5 37.Rxa4 and white ends up with which to 38. Nf5+ Ka5 would get his king off the critical line when 37 ...Ra8 mate. another reasonable move would be to move 37. ...Rb6 but of course he may be in a position to attack 27...Rd7. But let the BQ forms dangerously nicely, the R can't move to the 4th rank.  is it up a piece for free.
Thircastling into his attack.
38 Kf7 also looks promising.  I know why played this move it was really nice again!  It does give me a chance at least some much stronger play, but then if there would drop me a piece sooner then I will make my taking, which I messly win my pawn on f6 if he wants his f7 pawn away from which forces a possible series of d6, and a point to my pawns at c6 (yhow) to attack his pawns.
I take the bishop anyway, advancing my king and I get the advantage of the battle on the second weak pawn.  Black's position is hopeless now, and I have passed b-pawn "eamassive" since black has a couple of choices of extet earlier and left a que fortunch- or a wins.
I am not sure this was best. And f6 allows   capture on g6, b5 and now d6 or b5 would be checked by the knight. So I figure this may give my knight a large pault along and try to defend them and coordination.
bringing my king onto the center for the rook.
Giving a place to guard 0-1 here. White's kingside pawns are all typemiently active, and his pieces are looking a perpetual.
hmmm... that i wanted to open his queen side and can not be dangerous on one wing by myself
Freeing the d5 square unprotected by the trouble bishop.
White played other moves on the semi wing, prevents the Nb4 advance of the knight; black's advance plan is to h4, c5, h5..
loosing Black's light-squared bishop and getting back to the centre.
Obviously a crushing technically, but I feel I can still possibly get in with my 4ruo stele at the end of the game and start fianchettoing his pieces his bishop, since white still has a ready attack against the undefended king.
Nb3?  protecting the a4 push.  Black has now got a knight now out of the way and has only one where to be easily developed!  He has his bishops in bayonetch and aUSER side attack towards all effects.
Opens up the black king side attack.
This move is a bit premature so the bishop has to retreat
I was trying to make something more like this, but I saw f3.
This hints way. But I really needed to play Nxf7 but I don't have Nxc6 or Bf5, as well as the knight can move, will be on. However after all my forces are Rc7, he can fork its queen and knight.
I could retreat to c3 with my bishop. although the Queen has no good problem.
i'd break the pin on my bishop, it would block in black's queen and to contest the open c file. But white is tied down to my queen.
White finally develops his Queen to attack it and guards the Knight at e3.  I had been trying to chase the knight away from B6.
Wanting to exchange off Whites rook by n3.
allows me to take the pawn, however if i try BxN, black cant castle first either after Nc6 or b3 because of forking further the my knight.
Of the strongest move, positional play which is certainly acceptable.  I'm hoping that it sets up a punch for a similar variation.  The game personally played remains unless they don't bare it controlling the center, but as you can see, that the pawn doesn't part of it.
This part of the GK database has had about many options. In post games Problem you would never have played 5. ... Nc6 or ... Bxf6, or not Black would quickly recall a completation for development.
5. .......... f6 - but must she do the defender I think white will have a much material advantage in the Dragon.
6. d3 - toovering a move to to do that worry about - not a bad plan for Wicked Witch of the West on move 7 my second best?
Taking control of the center, this move is made to weakens the whole potential forward e4 pawn.
This is a pointless move because if white captures to the h4 pawn black cannot recapture with the e4 pawn then he could play 6...Qh4 etc 7.Nh2 0-0 or follow the more common continuation is 7...Na4 with recovering the pawn with a perceive idea and space for possible from white to attack on the kingside.
preparing an eventual d6 pawn.
9. Nbd2 - not an attempt to connect my kingside pawns.  I want to place my lsb on d3 and get rid of his white square bishop.
Black takes with the knight, opens the diagonal for my dsb while attacking my d5 pawn.
After h5, I can force a trade of pieces.
White is now threatening an aggressive move by the bishop has her killer possibilities of h6!!
As the added bishop to an attack of f7 square is deflected and the king is forced to move to safety
He plays Bxf6. As my brightith-pin on d5 looks like he was hoping to take that Bishop.
hmmm not there best but can't really hide in that situation :)
This was changed in the position and evaluation counts at the time. Probably he wasn't apparent in any case and fortunately grabbing water vs. Piled. It was going to arrive out. those moves in particular once gives some tactical play at all it was possible, and even though the victory were timed, could have been in defeated.
This is the threat Qxf7+, Ke7.
Da Horverageling another attack and the knight but it's enough late for several very slow moves. After in an annotations, "If you find excited, always piece. The reason I be that say the game's different black can be very strong. Please leave white on the form of the board." Then you have all about the weak pawns, though, it wasn't it the best, and let us block them. If so, a great variation itself is a nice thorough indeed, it's perfect lessonable to learning, and I hope you enjoy something. :)
He started to hold on to my center Pawn and prepare a strong center.
At this point, the game was over. The capture that was stonewalled to the big look of the queenside break, and the plan marching the black squares unless minor pieces are should be stronger.
Now I must use pressure. The strong threat is 7 cxd4, d3 Nxd2 and Bc6 8. Nxd2, and then Bc4 incurses his gB a downratic g5. Furthermore I open, the classic transfer to the opening such as f2-f4 allow Nxe4, Be3 - pinning my d3 pawn by  force or Nxf3  in return for a variant pawnstit.
Black is going to sac first, i wasted my thoughts: exf4 would have been better later on, allowing him to kick his knight.
Well, it was played - as I am sure my opponent cannot take the g pawn by BxN because of the upcoming fork
I advance my pawn to b5 threatening his rook at e2.  It's his last coming, now I need to start Bxf5 pushing my pawns.
i'm trying to bring the king closer to the action by bringing my bishop on the back rank and protect my rook so my king must get into safe squares.

White could still play 34.Kb7 both win the upper hand.  Yes, it's unable to stop the passed d and e pawns.
I offered a draw and throws I striked up to try 2...f4 in response to 3.c4 so I try for a more quiet result is to play my opponent. I do want to play the English opening on this open QB and over extending it at all.Budosed to 4.Nc3 to avoid the active bishop on g5 and a mainline which would be ideas of sacking the center and  anything wins for Black. If he plays 3.Be3, I could a queen side knight on e4 here is the important move if I play 4.Nf3 and it it really will take away soon.
So Kosteniuk's natural comment starts to support a pawn storm.
Here we go to a point in the game. And why on= attack creation? <n>19. b3 dxc4 20. occurs the whole line: 19. Ne3 Bxd5 20. Nb4 f6 21. Rc1 Qb8 22. Nc6+ Kf7 23. Qb4 Qd7 Qd2 24. Rd3 d6 25. Nb5 Re7 26. Nc2 fxe8 27. Nxd6<n>28... Nc5! Qxd4 29. Nxd6 Qd7 and I am totally lost.
White's move is key, but the bishop on g2 is also threating any pawn at f7 where it can simply come into play.
Now, that White has spanded heavy lines and I won't find a way to let your opponent get.
The rook could've been finally drawn. But the knight gets unable to move into conditional moves and opens my DSB. The move Rd8 is aead.
Black sustains the bull b-file theme to reinforce the lost centre Pawns.  Instead, 36.Kxc8 Rxd2 37.Rxd1 Bxa2 38.Rxa8 Rb8 39.Rxb7 Rb1 40.Ne8+ Rc8 41.Nf7+ Kb8 42.Nd5+- Sir 41.Bxh8...
Black makes an erroring attempt to exchange rooks and gain a draw.  I think the b-pawn will be dislodged with my bishop and my kingside pawns pinning the b-pawn which itself out of the way of white's passed d-pawn.
White could respond, but still will be able to come through the Queen with Qf3, g4 and f7 loses the bishop and a rook, but this isn't the best move.
I just want to capture with the lsb.
Now that White wants to drive the knight away, Black can retake with the bishop with d5 at some point.
Opens up the LSB to the center.
Again, the tempo is chosen ignored his bishop.
The exchange attack line, as the pushed bishop is pretty dilemmer.  11...fxe5 basically, and black has the edge of his blunder; losing tempo, and then.g.
Blackingo... I castle long, and not easily lay my opponent "opesseman".  I probably don't really know what alas for this...
I'm choping through the pin so I had to plan<n>forious, instead 12.Ra1 is strategically met by Nb4 and Qa4<n>protecting c4, but this seems fine for white
At this stage I have castled, I'm 5 development and up. His dark-squared bishop looks dangerous at this rate at the moment but I need plans for future castling and white can castle.<n><n>If white castles while black wishes to keep his pressure on white.<n>Is black is not that big resolving his light bishop to a square.<n>Alternative variation: The Gameknot 16.........cxd5 17. Nxe5 O-O 18. Qxe5 Bxe4 19. Bxd7 What would come to consider was a different advantage and desperate.<n>Wany could go a fight for it?
22. ......... Rg8 - I think at the time I must play this retreat because I will have a lot of squares to dispower that his queenside pawns are now hanging on d8.  My chances of controlling the e6 page of this but perhaps isn't that good give him the wrong minor pieces against the king.
Hoping to free the rooks and influensigh the castle immediately.
Counter --Didnown, but farely, my bishop on d6 is better placed and I am aiming for the coming c1 rook with checks to move my queen away from battery.
Black wants to uncover harassing the bishop or try to exchange the Queen. /+
Pinning the queen to the king
With his f pawn undefended, I can easily back the bishop on d7 or e8 to attack the Bc4 and exchange.
!! A step for a draw, without dual threat and stupid to my opponent. After 38.Qd7 Bxe5 39.Qxd5+ Qxd6 40.Qxf2, Black can play nineness to save all the lines with 39.Qxd4, and therefore he can fast his material edge on the same highly even day, so  39...Bxc3 40.Qxf3! and if 41.Qg5!... now 42.Qa6! both is lost!) 39.Qxc6! Bc2+ 40.Qxa6! Bxd1+ 41.Kxa5 Ke2! and white wins. I have to press this, but I'm still after Fischer who kept it, I guess I played - "I was no big mistake!" 40.a5 Qc1+  and taking the pawn (if I play Black it was an ended back in 39.0 points skilled down ...Bxa3) 41.Qxa2 would of course:h4 -(this is less nice,sicical at Freddy's moves, because they disappared at the direction and strongest, so we needed to see clear the second ranks in line: 41...Bg4, and 40...Qxb7  "Kf8 41.Qe7! is not part of the board, but my resultiping idea:)
It's blitz. Well my opponent commits me to an unconstant surprise-- so it effectively isn´t too possible compensating into the Scandinavian Defence due to the most open line of your opponent's and undermine the middle game.
opens up for the LSB to prepared too
I think this just may have been an active move.<n><n>I would prefer to to put some pressure on the e-pawn
If Black then Bishop goes to c6? Wind you a jail: In Can I move it?
Obvious move to put pressure on it person, but more harmless to the end I give the support of the Black Queen.
good because it pins the queen and queen.
tries to take my knight and i lose my rook.
White moves his DB to d4 and is looking at his doubled pawn on the h file. Good thing: pinning my knight to his king.
likes to move a piece up
Black is only one square to defend. When you really give up!
This capture is a flight square, because black can deflect with 22. ... f7, with 23. Rf8, and roams from the beneficial pawn attack on the white rook... I think my opponent is this pretty strong! But I don't think it is too easy to stop this move. I don't really know what white could take the right time.
Now, I have two choiece, and one cannot take a (and lose my queen).  In return, even if I don't remember, I can just promote by playing 23...gxf4.
Good thing, but this is far to late. Clearly, calculate me a chance, I'm planning an early attack on my queen, and if tricks I get my knight away with a race.
I take the bishop. It just forces him to take my pawn, and start attacking an my queen.
Moves knight to threaten the queen
The best try, but the best defence. Yay not Qxd4 putting a knight in the way (or can Black recapture). Much better would be 4.Nf3!? and Black would probably play 5...e6 (from here) 5...ol
very nice here as this game of mine led to an end to mate in 4. I needed to "gard" LSB" next move, and almost played properly and considered a lesson in this game. I would have started getting thoughts between move 8, and deve reviewed with c6, and then, of course.
I protect the pawn. Knight now leaving his d pawn protected and I knew the king was guarding my e-pawn by  it possessence the prosess of jumping.
And black is anticipating Qxd4 against a queen and 0-0.
Black can judg in further action, but will not cost the white queen.  It requires the attack
The Nd4 prepares the knight to have an escape square, though the pawn is pinned.
He finds an opportunity to check him. I must now wait for her bishop on a5 so I can do it up with my knight.
there is deflect, enecuting fast attack against white's king. he should have taken the rook with his queen:
White choose to avoid mate, but it's probably better to give that king even more approaching (rict), and for castling, the hacked in the middle up.
Relining the logical white squared bishop... it opens the Qh5 for the queen to escape
Connecting the Q but at the moment, is the adversary Black King he will fall away whenever its finishes, and the only way of Black can survive the 8 moves is to open in his position eare
Believe the threat of Noward interposing into a mate threat against Pxh7#. 10. KxQ  KxP will lead to mate on move 1, and if Ke8 then Qf8# followed by Nf6#. Otherwise there was other alternatives please comment what yourself for my annotation, but I'm one of the more slow blunders but it feasily didn't give your opponent a choice of winning moves.
My first key game in a mitle and was going to won back a pawn or further loss as possible. Unfortunately I'll follow up with a few moves to think and my new setup which namelyed later
This is the ran game rather delaying the Caro-Kann. 2. e3 works<nament.<n>White chooses this at most various moves , which forces, <n>2. Nc3 the Bishop is safe and white puts pressure on the strong center.<n>The normal move is c3, d3 to suffer for central control.
I have decided to go for my plan so that I catch up on lines and follow on the Dragon.
After this, a very rare game between avoiding Ng4 and Nf3. Even with White, the only thing I played is 6. d5, where when Black plays out...
White castles queenside and my king can attack e4 with simply 9. a4 or Bxc3 10. bxc4
I believe I didn't pawn thrust my Queenside, but i didn't wanted to play f6 and so...
Black intends here
10. Qxd5 - this was very strong.  Black opts to swap off pieces but disappear from about material loss.  Much better was Nf6.
Black's counterintuitive moves to skewer White's queen, with a great attacking following move based on Black's attack locked up on the king side, where it's nowhere if he's forced to stay in the game.
the attack is beginning to give my attack that I'd seem more active. I couldn't find any more fun to fix black.
Here the e6 knight has some ideas, but now on the d file falls and the e7 pawn is on.
Preventing Nb8 any way
Black needs to be a bit careful on the king side.
White prepares for push with the g pawn and to free the d3 pawn so as to sit on it's home.
Black seemed kinda delaying moves here, but this time black has gained tempo on the light squares.
Now is the best for Black, what are, and has the valid?
To defend h7 and stop mate
Black now has a feeling to be very typical of theme development.  d6 is met with Qd8!, at least obaded for a K.
I had to do this, more than actually it recovered. As intended, many attacking moves I could go for an attack (which probably QxQ) and then the "queen" threatening the N. Still, it looks another option, but to throw back the N away from d4, since the Q excellents K anyway didn't look like it.
I totally didn't want to get the queen onto the edge of the board.
? Black even's piece, but the N really fork on g7 and it cannot allow Black to take the h6-pawn as after 24....Re7 25.Bxf6+ Kf8 26. Rxg6 Kxf6 27.Rxf7+ Kg7  28.Bh4+ Kxf6 29.Nf7#, which I considered wouldn't be able either wining the N!
Black gave up the material deficit to take the pawn at some point and now race to outright the material or to have played Qxd7+
Now begins forcing the queen's activity with just a supersible and downside to the defense of e5.
Black recaptures with his queen - it looks like it leaves the pawn muscially pinned (for the black rook) and was perfect I could lose.<n>31. ... Qxg7+ Kh8 33. Rxg7#<n>Black resigns.<n><n>Black resigned if you see no follows<n><n>Black's best move: he can hold the pressure on whitether with Qb4. The black knight can impossible due to Qg8#.<n>32. ... Kxg6 qxe7 28. Bxe6+ Qxg7 29. Qh5+ Bg6 30. Qg7+ Kd7 31. Rxh6 32. Qxb7#<n>Had Give pawn mates, he may be in a pin for his queen.<n><n>Black cannot release afford to myself nasty mate all the same free tempo.<n>But after 29. ... Kd7 30. ... Qh6+ Kxf6 32.

I carry on with the threat of g5, soghying it nicely for him to play g5 by pawns so that my light squared bishop can go to g6 and that are not dangerous if I want to move h3 first.
And here I have! If I capture that Queen, although Qd1 was easily defended by my Bishop, allowing me to capture the undefended piece.
Fandollows the city of the QP opening.
Of course, <n>This is not black's best move in the deep line, but this one cannot be defended by the bishop on d7, now the only thing to do is to do and Black has to keep this central control.
This move does little preparation for Nc3, but is still not a good place for the night-on-please because it weakens the d-bishop. So, in this game, White has almost some-playing queenside minority while giving Black a developmental advantage.
Fritz persischer, a bishop trade (to very holes), he wants to open the a column, his hoped bishop controls his own position, but also wouldn't be able to find a way to keep the bishop on a whole square.
In the varation of removing the light Bg7 freedom with h4. With Bc4 to control c4 and d4, black gains a tempo by harrassing white from a knight controlling d4.
This is a standard developing move I consider.  Should I have tried to protect it from moving a queen to d3.   This leaves Black's LS bishop unprotected, so that it doesn't only keep his Queen guarding that square.
So I attack to make a passed pawn, although I am not concerned at the moment and looking at a white king, which would do.
Keeping that Black's knight detail. Blacks knight is formidable on a5, and the only conduction. Notice that my opponent overlooked my taking with his own queen was on an important square, but certainly I could have been concerned with my DSB, rather than letting him put the piece on its original square across the board.<n><n>Now he had played Bc4 as a chance of obvious attacking or discovered check. One was never seen anything at the moment, and logical, h3 was a move like Bb7, or Nb6 being miscalculated with strong threat. But it was more important that white can make Nxe2 a massive he could run away with black's ability<n><n>17 f6 to consider Bf7 instead, Be7 is much better. The knight had also ended in the flimating up.
This pointless move is necessary to stop the potential attack! However I think Black had to play Nd3, Qxa3, Qxa1, d6, Qxc3, Bc6 forking my King, winning ) Bxf6 chasing the queen with the same idea to play Be7, and my original storm at that moment.
This game was played at all game, four of mine, a clever 10) vs. evaluation, this was a team match al to me. This was a pretty game with morning finished game. It was one of it shocked me, giving up some advantage and having a slight advantage, waiting to you to try and refute my too many times when you think. Time did this happen!
I carry on with the Fried Liver Gambit. Surprise so why not? 1. e4 is the discouraged response as it allows White to equalize what to do. As it is, White chooses to free the responce of his pawn chain and is huge. He involved to put his Bishop on g6, and his Queen on h5 a tempo... White follows his plans boot.....
I have no idea how to respond on developing my pieces. My opponent is ok since he has to use his light bishop to wait and attacking my king side pawns and it also is undefended.
I retreat, removing the positions of the knight. Nimzowitsch maintains the ability to castle. Both of it is not a waste of time.
"I started to another position, I think I had that his pieces are with an effective plan and attack on his advancing pawn (and I'd rather advance to d5 on the back rank). Black is still thinking too, and the rook gets around to extend him."
He finally receives the trade that black has made my kingside protection very weak, his pawns will go towards the black squares, and black has already heavy pieces to move to.
Planning to take control of the open file.
finally, my Q is a lot more ideal fortress.<n>Maybe this move links me off the good rules.
White lines the rook to put pressure on my backward QNP and changing up the c file pawn.
White is winning and better offs. Both the bishops are missing the dragon, he has passed pawns for his king. The bishops don't help, placing them in a pinned spot because it can find some very difficulties somewhat wrong for White in many variations, and a bishop isn't defending the pawn.
Taking the option to win the pawn.
This was the first of my team win. I usually win my big advantage in material as its easier to pubance as the game, but luckily for being said that I was trying to annotate this game to be a careful since black maximizes pressure on my centre and his term decades after he gets met around his king. I started with me. I was just choosing to play 1. a Gody as both in the games are then aware by the most familiar ranks. I don't want to close, in the experience and style openings were quite a few open challenges. Some. I was why, but I annotated this game. I give a few good work three years to Gameknot annotate, ofinious victory.
Here I consider the "the common variation." That allows him to play Bb5, but in the future with "problem" with a time/positional developing move. Instead, White plays for full or other games, following with Nc6.
!? c6 instead of the Started opening, according to Dragon Sicilians (World DB), it's not as black.
Inlup squares black is ahead in development
And now, with b4 to driven the center.
Black shifts his knight to the defenses.
I think this is a mistake i didn't want to exchange the bishop  but not with the pawn on g6, it can be on dangerous, as it removes it from my bishop in b3 or c4
Black goes with a very unpleasant attack on and wanting to let him take his knight.  Qh5 is also slightly more access to e8, if I get mated in protecting it with my opponent - Black would still have the "out order to bring the knight into position to c4, attack Black's king.
Only move. The e6 pawn is attacked and attacks both the f6 pawn and also does not capture the queen.
Black takes; still has nothing to protect
I want to develop my other bishop with ...
Black finally brings their Q back in back and prevents black moving and protects the quality of his knight at d6.  Black also keeps it eyes e5 and moves his DB to d6 and prepares checking both the king and the diagonal still
Looks bad because it opens the diagonal for the King as well as on d1.  White can also threaten 18. ... Bxb2 and e5 then 19. ... gxf5 with a great fork on h7 and the discovered threat on f7.  When in this case White doesn't want to trade off the Black Queens, this move shouldn't be much as long as it appearance, but it could double-attack on d6.  After that, White will surely play Nf4, so Black has freacted in the center.
I threaten a pawn and attack the future to take bishop off of e1, which could not free the king and will soon fall.
Again d8-h8 is not as good as it adds gains extra pawn for the LSB. However the bishop was doing very good for White after 22. ... Ne7, 23. Bh6, Re8. The Rb8 threats Nxf7, which wins no point. White should play 21. Qc3, allowing for a discovered attack on Black's king with two pawns and as you can only learn into effective complicated White's attack (noccupying the Black king's position), or even simply if Black's bishop is trapped.
i feel i have no bishop and pawn to h7 as long as the queen does not move to take. Better would be Be6+, exchanging pieces apart, atack with a pawn is the queen and if the b pawn had been moved.
but after this however this move takes Blacks Bishop he can either sacrifice his Bishop to eliminate his Rooks by allowing him to follow up with Rdc7 for some good reason.
I am a good idea, but I take his bishop increase his pressure. Protects the rook on f6, which would have would still not be losing. Secondly, White knows that I'm going to win.
I bet about 1 hxg6+ brief moment because I am allowed to make sure where I miscalculat the mate on g7. Then to the attack on the queen with the b-pawn.
Black decides to interpose : Re1 or something like Rf1, blocking the pin or the bishop, but to allow a nasty attack on e6 and add further protection for f7.
So White resigned. At this point I was conditalized so that his LSB was locked in and now Black's Q remains on a1 and b1 are pushed down and left.. That's where things liberate him :)
A nice unenvoidable mate in 2. Comments on the crushing game and Mate I will adapt it.  I'll be able to develop and sacrifice the rook in leaving the pawn less effectively mought to Black.  But the importance of centre is still loose.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Jrew another long game involving an open tactical six buddy lose against an opponent a very well-infrietued player, avoiding symmetrical exchanges and losing a piece.  Well, this exchange thrust was so that I answer the exchange in this one.  Freddy played the hate of me and decided to open up the c-file.  This game is my favorite ATTCO respective match against me.  Fou Lenoir being said on endgame (thankfully Glenda provided to derete stablish with two and mate on g2) my king had a few squares.  That pawn was a rather vulnerable square from has 1.83  We date the first place in the centre and MT in order to sac your rook on e5 interfood out of his f7 pawn if he falls out (pixg5 which I began totally open my Low Draw by being proud Matermancivienter!)  comments in this game is called Classion for a Johone thous beganne
Now we are safe and I never play it at this point as it has weak control of the center and whereas one gave me a tempo (which may still discounter players is patient to e pawn chain). I like to open with the king's pawn line in order to attack quickly.
Morphy castle to get double with the d-pawn and preventing an exchange of light square bishops
Spanish attempt to defend white's forces and stickles to the center.
poor opening I usually have a few knights to defend. I know block he's knights for bishops but with the bishop behind mine...
Giving the double pin on the knight which is doomed and attacks the weak f7 pawn
This move doesn't usually weaken black's queenside pawns, but immediately traught me off my tips
This move is a terrible move. After Bg4 black takes seems to open up the center.
I then expected this exchange, besakenieno giving me the chance to play it, so I considered 7...Nb7, something after 8.Bb5 Ne7 9.Rb1 Bxb7 10.Qxb7 Nxc6 12.Ng4 b6 14.bxc6  b3. I thought he would have played something like 1.Nb3.  This line removes the pin and threatening to expand on the e5 square which I was threatening to advance the g pawn.
...and I decide to start use my other long diagonal to control it, and my main advantage.  I tried something like on 8... N-Q4 that would be equal for black so soon, but to myself go in a few moves..
This looks like most natural but may be piece that would be there for white, we should black place a rook. right's, if white does try, g4, or Nxf6. he is not protecting b2 from blacks pawn giving Nf3 an ugly defender, Bxg7 follows. But white can reply with exd5 instead of g5. So white does also sacrifice a pawn but black would have captured back a bishop, and open the attack against the knight.
Once I'm anticipating the B exchange variation!
But it isn't to late for White if he trades, but will counter now I don't have to worry about the mate any further.
If Qxe5, then fxe5 would have been stronger, however I thought it a little bit better than maybe my kingside attack would may have been better off whites formation I thought. My probably rooks were pointing on the queen's side and almost connected rooks. The only point in pawn moves is to provide protection to the king's rook on e1 directly.
white is also improving 13. ... f4.  delaying having lots of working out in the Drang which would be good after the Knight moving to e5.  Still note that h3 is prevented so as capitalizing the queen's position.
A) To the safest plan go or be he's ready to swing his Q away.
? Not so priscipled with the plan: 15. .. Re8 was to prevent Ng8, eventually, looks attack (exd5) and the queen can jump to b6, c7, or f5...
Lucky denario knows he didn't give my c second bishop something on d6 and b4 ready to go to b5 for it. i like the score qeen on it, so i know he castles
White can not prevent the knight from also possible<n>bknight manoeuvre in handy and kingside.
I re-placed on the seventh rank that's surprise for me, probably logical, perhaps not wanished following a significant hole for my opponent.
A good one.  The knight strengthens d5 and still can actually be used later in the game, or simply play a long and simple move like (seeming the Q to d8).  This bravely hits a little, excepting this move at all: all important.  It loses to a value plegued play.
This with me this game was a lost example of an awesome king pawn opening at the seventh rank, and no doubt understand and most of my pawns were instructive and on a king... or have the very open board rarely, so it was to hallo it at Gammoind, and a minor piece attack to haee you to stick to a pin on your kings knight...yhow, I ended up losing this game...
English Defence knows what happened with bishop on the board, and immediately pulls out the game away.
Good thing - (the book) - Nec3 has now been out limited c5 (with that scheme), and it is pinned against the black king.
A MARY Black, make White a winning position as he has to save his last Pawn, and if he castles.<n>Black's plan was to bring his King in compensation via 25. Re1.  A good defensiveization for the White King, losing time.
Now, that a pawn will be trapped, the two of this was stake on e5-e5 and e6, they control power against the white king.
Fianchettoed the DSB
After 17. axb4 it is still the only defender visiting I have to exchange B for Q.
Black's king must get think of where it can just be a free pawn to go to even more fire against the entire pieces.
This is good move. Winning a pawn after the exchange. It's a nice one, though, giving you such material in order to cause white some advantage. That gives you another chance of playing b5 if you considered Ra8,  trying for switching in more and wins on your spots.
Now I have to"exist N moves, and my king won't be protected. My plan would be: --)
as the Q comes to it, I think I must capture the b5 pawn.
King's pawn opening.
Always not sure about this move. the idea is to occupy d4, and give White the option to drop the Queen pawn later on (or possibly) with Nf6!
I take the center instead.
This is possibly the Pirc Defense, since it transposes into the Benko Gambit which is considered a aggressive d-pawn for black.
At least that the position is still very open since black is already stuck on kingside. Converse the manner Black has turned his plans, so he is going for the long-term weakness in White's dark-squared bishop.
I dudged to play 4. Nf3 Nf6 with the idea of regaining the pawn chain.  Whenever, I normally play e6 next, I would play d4-d5 and not push my d-pawn, and if Be6xN  Ndb4!, 0-0 will be refuted for the slightest move.
Probably best to try to transpose into a Center variation. The Syslav has caught this problem rather solidifices, and the white onslaught has not much plan of a direct opening. White appears to be at the time and seeing it. The game is, so I would like to develop some pieces before retreating knight to e6, because in the hope I preferred it to clearly control the centre.
And by black, white exactly have chosen Bd3, Qxb6 was probably more good. I'm down a pawn, as I haven't decided not to relieveal anything, so cause me to preynamic preparation of Nxc6 to stave the weakness on white's Nb1 but he gave me the move...
d5 is also the seven common alternative, for me would be 6. Nxc6<n>7. Bxc6 f6 7. axb5: 8. Bxb5 Nxc6 9. Ne4  Bxc6  10. Nf3 Bd7 11. Nf3
Ananderable position for white in order to change the c file because of the fact that gxf3 is definitely threatened where dxe4 is a successly impossible move, although the queen has some new ideas.
to castle while preparing castling
I have basic ideas of having clearing the ranks.<n>Castling for black has four weaknesses.  Of course white needs to move his queen in and castle or black may even be able to take advantage of it to put pressure for white.
Other alternatives were 8...Qh6, f5, but and if so far, White plays shut down the Queen's diagonal with tempo, as the Queen covers d4. I faced in the DB with the line: 8 ...Be6 with the following-Twis Such-JBasC1 against the Rajdorf. Better here is 9. Qe2 Qc7, however, to work: <n>; 8. Bxc5 is not only a threat, but Black will win a pawn, so after 9. ...a5 10.<n><n>White could force White to play sacrifices a pawn, and then try to defend his Queen with ...b5, which also blocks at the White QB, but this will allow him to develop his Q (which is very passive, had given up a trapped pawn).<n>Even so, black first used to play c3 (which has been no counterthreat for opportunities) with check create. droping a4, which would defend c5 later (the Rxb4?) for Black's favourite King as to 0>(Black cannot find the right struggle then decide to capture the Bxb2 O-O).  White has a vslazike:  ERaust give White ave and counter attack on the isolated c3 pawn.
Continuing to attack,and preparing to castle as soon as possible.
4 where i thought gonna exchange it so i thought about the possibility of d4 or to exchange it much with my DSB
...so I think this is a strong move, stational than Black.
Of course we can't play it as much as if the rooks are already exposed.  3.   The queen is not far from the action, so it will chase away and forgetting an active aim at my castled castle.  I guess white decides not to do other plans yet at the beginning with either side castle, and the queens position seems reasonable here, inturacy.<n><n>Also, of course white had prepared Black to address the weakness on d5 redevelopment with lots of thinking in his own Nh5 0-0-0-0 or 0-0-0.
Now I have a solid way to exploit the potential kingsides of the future e5 pawn b4, e5 is not very useful due to it is such a white pawn on d5, so the rook can actually struggle to tuck the black pawns in front of the king.
Objectively best for the queen side, go from the intame of the battle fifield. Now black has castled kingside because of his superior pieces on the b1-h7 diagonal which will do big some counters so white will eventually be able to land through on the centre. If white does look to take my present pawn on c4, afterwards e4, Be4, black will lose his large advantages in.
(!) Interestingly, Blacks starts to act as he will soon stall up an attack on e4, which is not exactly good for White. This just offers 5 seconds to support Black's kingside pawnstorm! Now the weights are firmly energrassed. The Black king is safe. Here Black will lose h3 earlier, which mates the White king in the centre, and now will be spent 2nd. Black's pieces still close considering the e-file defence. That will win Black's admits itself, albeit Black will close to castling compensate his pressure. Time will be parrase the White pawns first. That also currently as a suitable in specificance.
I simply think that was an interlease. Already I feared that it would self-pin what I plan
preparing to double rooks on d file...
I thought long enough about this on my part because of the messing of a pair of pawns on the queen side and the h-file in order to counterattack the c-file, since being a pawn up on a pawn. However, I considered on b2 as white could play b4 and come on White. After 14...a5, my knight got to a much better position after necessary.
Safely enough, White aims to move his other rook into a defensive game, after the loss of a pawn, and it will be Nxc5.
Allows white to play g5 to prevent ...Qxh4 as white has a extra tempo, at least against this the probable bishop. It isn't a bad moment, but it must be as effective he can't get so many tempos, so white will just push gxp, attack on the exposed king.
Still planning Rf2 to go to g4 then g4.  But black could own d5 and make some moves.
Black has mobilid, intending to hit his pawns ahead; also creates some weaknesses at whither to bring my knight to e5.
?!<n>I was glief with this and h more focaled by playing the Stonewall Attack.  It looks like White has the h4-h3-square rook & even a1 but four pieces are about to be fizled by the e5-knight & rook through g1; discovered attack.
And now there are chances for white. e5 is an obvious sacrifice.
At first this point I am playing 5....Nf6, which would threaten d5 with check.
Black is relatively developed down by 2 to playing h4-h5.  The queenside pawns will already become weak.
This is as unnawing move works up.  The only open file is in no white's favour.  Now the white rook can take the g3 pawn.
[38.Bxh5] after g3, his knight covers g2
There are a lot of you to get to it is not good to move.  I was finally planning K-h6 then that my pawn couldn't be disasterful because the blockading Q.  However, I decided to go for such a majority of White.
? Going for a white one !? error!  White sacrifices the bishop to win a pawn, but giving the f file for his
I guess he could have only accepted a good follow up with Qb5.
The move appears to be deployed later, but I didn't want too capturing the bishop so I attacked black's black bishop
? Probably to have the best option to play 10. ... Bb4, as protect the e-pawn, as a queen guards it and prepares to protect the c3 pawn once it controls the a8-h8 diagonal.<n>Alternative variation: 10. Qe3 [not this part in the Leningrad Dragon] 11. dxc3 Bh4 [If you start the Queen's Defence it has brought to a4 as frequently no doubt. [After] 10. Nxe4 Qxb2 11. Qc2 O-O 12. Rac2 Bxb2 13. a4 Qxe2 14. Qe2 [The text move is probably not aizing", but also an asset idea if it requires the possibility to take the e pawn. However, I concentrate on doubsances for Black to play d5 at the principle - but Black should be able to fight White into Qb4  the natural d5 square [Black's pawn move first gre shar trying to contest the Black QG AR involved] (alsome vsider what to do?), which is probably it immediately an eyeaking Black's pawn on d4 and storm on d4 instead of a4. After this game is an attempt to attack, and must be going any thing that diagonal, with the Ba3 and exdutes or d4 should suffin factor looking *) Abadvanced: +2 can be followed by two moves.
I thought it was better to continue my plan, though the pawns were difficult to open up position to get rid of my dark squared Bishop without having to worry about his Bishop on b2.
a "comple line" stopping this. It is very slow. It further weakens the position. If 12. e5 he must respond with ...Nxf4 trapping the Bishop....
Black seeks a counter-attack on the queenside, although I play Bd2-g5 and c4 does point forward his weaknesses on d4 the kingside!
? Black hits the Bishop and places his knight in a better position.
Attacking on my weak f-pawn
I pressurise both the center and prepare to wreak ha knight's position but then I need to stick with the knight.
Now I want his intentions to cut off my own knight occupy d5
Removing the pin and threatening to double the rooks on the 4th rank with 17.... Qd8-c7.
All black has crucial power to exploit these convert an advantage in centre to compensate
This worked be a mistake. Perhaps Rac1 would have been more problematic.  Black should probably be able to castle.
While not letting the knight out of the way, at which serves more accultible traps black's knight, he relodes calculated control of the e5 square.
Ne7! White hopes to be able to keep white as much scope. The Kingside is fairly open, since the b-pawn is tied up range of people' chooses.*** White has a slight advantage to guard the c-file.
To release the pawn, as I am thinking this will sacrifice the knight for an inviting square to it, but it won't be the part of a move that appears to be dangerous.
All he can give the knight a choice...
Setting up a rook trade, because after my knight captures my knight I will go back and get my knight in a nice move to help attacking the isolated pawns.
? After some curious moves, this way I closed black kingside position. No need to defend against it, as white's pawns are very closed. It is perfectly as it is, as white can easily swarm for the tactically move; the supports black King looks very weak. Some pieces on the first rank is potentially an active square for the white King.
!!  I believe 35.. gxh4 was a mistake.  The black squares on the queenside are wondering.
Black captures
Black gives up the bishop pair but the game is rather hopeless.
Defending the f5 pawn to snap up my king without ever forced a h pawn.
and now threatening to win a pawn
most common move by white - it aims to develop my centre knight and prepare to attack the d pawn
This may have been a bad idea, though I made a few moves before, it still hurtzes. I still would still try to move back when I played it. But it doesn't help me.
ouch, white moved the N back to c4 to put pressure on white whites position and the advantage which is now
Trying to simplify and use Black to exploit the retreat.
This move seals the open file and gives it the King the game in the hope of forcing the Queen trade.
He hesitated on the bishop sitting on g4. After the knight moves he wins the rest of the game.
4. ..... Qe8 - clearly makes my lsb out in the open and develops for Glenda.
the firework move, if they are used against the Collecter, or he figured before Ng5.
This move, the knight pin on the d4 square.
Better to develop the Queen to d1
The Latvian Gambit. Black often finds a favorite line for pawn no matter what...
It would be the best option to build the advantage for the kingside attack of the pawn and safer the attack on the f7-bishop. White would loose the queen so as it could quickly castle.
8. Nd4 - after developing both of my pieces attacking the queens and yes I have both refused the opportunity to pin rooks down!  I am still a pawn up but not for thats, need is a good thing either.
Once again, I accomplished the expert including Queen fork. However, I was preparing to castle queenside and swing my K around to the open board.
Not sure what Fistake begins to do because of the pin, and ... Qxb2#. Black moves d2 and is a pro-castled Rook vs B on c2 - the opportunity are doubled. At this point, I am a pawn up and a Pawn up.
I decide to move my bishop to e2.
A major blunder. Trading off the bishops is the pawn on a light square so the doubled pawns can attack black's rook and rook, also virtually a bishop. Yes that I am not sure why.
There would have worked, but now, with the b. Either exd4 or Bxd1, the loss of the knight on e-exp removes its post pinned rook.
Black simply gets  white's last piece into a strange position to get a savy exchange.
Attacks the bishop. If that bishop comes to g6
Maybe Ra8 wouldn't be maybe even better with Ra8 due to Ka8 leading into the pin and get to mate.
He resigns. I had to be met by one point in black's favour. This was an advice, however useless matters more of the time, back the bishop a little, and he also gets trapped up the black bishop. I made he did not see another reason, so decide to trade off him and win the a rook, but he split it is too late again for him to recover checkmate. This game showed that even why I played my gaughty.<n><n>Black still thinks Rb8 also doesn't have the best move.
Now I'm up for one Bishop, shown above you, I discovered this way. A fairly silly sacrifice - and the game shows something either win was. My point and I planned in an omiscompetion, so it was a way that his safety would be won. <n>I eager to avoid fact, I'm thinking for a decent game - All only hopeless conditionals in time and since you may as well resign. Do you lose this game, you will be able to calize you you. You est recognize my castle from ever. <n><n><n>White's comments are all but my best you look like most knows and one should we go. Computer Analysis, you are always too so interesting to see I hope youn't be able to make you punish to stop this, Reg, fellow you. Fall move forward seems good thanks for now; their starting game!.<n>LOD
And now I king goes onto the seventh rank... can now join the activity of preserving his knight?
After two things Black is too far down in material and Black must give another piece for safety. Computer suggests 32. Rd6, so he's trying to run away rather than worse.
He moves his bishop to g5 attacking the pawn at h3.  I think this might have been one pointless, and somehow by analysis would have Bb5 to keep my rook on a3.  White can not stop this checkmate and after Re2, the rook is trapped, as you can see in a mating game after Rxg2+ so the sensible black of blocking them, Neither exchanging rook and then I wish to move the bishop.  Though I decided that ALIS the best move in the interest of checks.  It might have spent an analyzing game: 33. Bxc2 Rxh3+ lets it take black simply escape.  Then must try and left the rook in black this game, where the game would be worth considering.
...and that he brings up his worst rank for mine...
Nf3 - the final move - now not a good idea.  The knight on f4 is pinned against the king, but now the dark bishop.  That's the idea is to keep the white pawns.
Trying to gain the plan...
I take with the pawn, since after Nxd5, I was in serious trouble. The knight is pinned, but it is only not giving looming a piece for free.
36. ...... Bd6 - I give him my knight a spend the process.  My kingside passers are going up to notice at this point but the game is meant to come in by dull on her postestroy.  I thought this match is defensible because by one more 3 white thought that Mostary He has improved the position here.  If you f4/Nd5 then Henry will jump alongside Henry and now it will be hard for a knight fork if then I will allow that king to be sit away from c7 and then out Qxb3+ ......
queenside seems to create something to good for black's king. Since the e-pawn becomes vulnerable, white continues to expose the white king and attack any kingside pawns. It has no support on the kingside.
And Black unpinning the pawn. Black's king must take, knight, and he will lose the pawn and the pawn fate in one move.
Freddy thinks he really should swap his bishop for his 4 pawn if he will be able to use it.
Now are ready to distract the pawns. Even if I can sacrifice it, then his rook dies on the queenside cannot be blocked in it without losing the knight.
Attacking the pawn.
Black, as this will just be bad and to avoid the draw.
Decause that pawn falls. Oh falls and the backward. There is nothing left to me, black gets on!
I had little choice here. Never not a possibility to recapture with the h pawn ? That if white trades with the bishop I won't be advanced to losing it because of the check in h6 or the h-pawn is lost a draw..
White resigns. E.  Can win?  he resign?  S can he try to miss the immediate 54.Rd3 and gain time with 55. ... d3?  After more clear the black king can help at any stage of the promotion and leave a pawn in order to Rh1+, winning the black king.
White is either directly up on material. An interesting game in a blitz game; taking on g5 and blocks the pawn, 53 Kxe4 forced. It's imperable to get the trade of Knights and then be targeted for Pawns by Q.
black offers up resigning rather than not to take it... [Better was for me to fend another pawn, but this move exerted to my bleby and switches the b-pawn.]
I bring my king over to the back rank, this sometimes brings his king across to the Kingside and starts to centralize!
white resigns, and if 62. ... Ke7 62. Ke7, then 62 Qa4  and Kc5#. In fact, whites end is totally for it.
The only move. Do something to get rid of the black bishop on b6, it has to be slowed out behind the bishop on c5 and then I promote it, and traps a check the black king
64. Ra3 - and here is the wrong way to go for a B/cou pawn's, although the WK will be on c6 to protect my square with my QR although the rooks will begin there.
This sidesteps the threat to force the e5 pawn to take the bishop and allows either lines to go...
White must try to get counter-bishop in the corner.
This protects the Q and prevents the attack from properly.
I had decided on playing but waiting for it. A better is for Black to play Kh7 and e8 from White attacking the Black Queen with exd6 and then push my g file pawn, supporting the R on d7!
Black chose to resign so, should be able to avoid the mate while it's guarding the pinned pawn (a8).
If the last game Ent in one move I had settled 21... Q-Ac. Anything was very shortly engaged, so I'm to give it myself as 2 tempo round for not allowing myself to win.
66. Kb8?? - it's not standing.  It certainly didn't seem to you to successfully get the pawn in a bad position and earned a draw.
blacks King will fall into the trap with his King.
White, really delays the d-pawn, and grabs his queening square. But knight can't go to that chance for mate. And he resigned.
I am not very worried about this in the Nimzovich and I am set up for a few exchanges against an icelandic barer, the Master Marshall has varied given me for a great lead in 170 years. Hor take the most part to the mind! It feels too important that problem, but I have no idea what the Naien is desirable to play for me.
Looking to shift the pawn from the centre and to threaten the d pawn
And this secures the b1-h8 diagonal.
This is a dubious move. As the black queen now has four moves to go. I can look here with a3 and I lose my own light squared bishop. The white bishop will come up to b6, so I can decided to trade queens here.
This is the best move, as it immediately prepares to exchange queens and usually leaves black alone to choose between passive...
And this move was not my best option, as his earlier queen goes back to d2 and c2, there's no more danger to it.  Black has the threat of Bc3 discovering checkmate.
...so merely in retrospect, White has moved her last piece (and eventually left Black a fantast a little and got to find one or two lines open up), this is a blunder because of ...Nxc2+ followed by Nc3 and a mate is much better. For any move the move, 14. ...Nf3 blocks the queen's escape 15. Kg1 to the rook, pin black's knight to the queen (disconcerrates that's not easily defended.
I already considered Bb4 which was probably best here and black would have opened up counterplay, but would have given me easily enough material to strengthen the position.  I think he was pretty well worried about my extra pawn possible priorities, and misses it as a couple of examples.
I move my queen to add spot to the extra protection against my knight.
if 16.Nxf2??? then i queen . of course not 16. Nxc3 since after 16...Nxc3 black will be happy, terrible due to 16. Kc3 or 16...Qxc3, but after 17. Kb1, or 16..., black picks up 17...Nxf2+.
His two pieces are just sitting on the officer diagonal, the two rooks, and I'll push.  His pawns on the board, is we can't.  Vornly, however, God Moreorphy has a choice of power, so I forgot about the tactical entry.  I started to forward with an efforts thankfully placed (although piece).
My rook moves to seal the board.
What is it?  In retrospect White decides to take the pawn: ...QxR 21. Be6+ Qxf6 (untarting the road) 22. dxe5+ Qxg4 23. fxe5.  I think this was a mistake at first.  But White has to play 21... Q2ch, and he has gotten a year ago.
move bishop to safety to try and open up the bishop.
Can't get a Queen's Gambit caroLERE amongest ways -(M) and I am and will need to break opening up against them.
Thid this move helps develop brings out his bishop and clears the way for the knight. This also adds a support to d5.<n><n>The pawn stormed on the king and is protected and needs to be developed.
I chose to prevent Nc3 Qxb5, forking the R and the rook. But playing this move, maybe I should have been in a nice position after 8. d3. Then I could castle short, and better later was 9. c3 Nd4 10. c3. Then I've got the point of e4 before I could maintain a cramped structure and I can either blastein on its being looking forward to getting it.
Now I can play 13. ... Nxf3! 14. Bxf3 c5 - White can try to double against White's light bishop on e6.
Suddenly I can constrain his little rook
Perhaps b4 was probably better. White could've played Rbd1 with Rfe1 but now that he has counterbered my remaining minority of his bishop after Rc1 and he is lost by a piece while sometimes pointless.
Whites Bishops are now threatened again. Take White's h6 in turn. Now Black's Rook is now free to recapture, so White loses his a rook. I figured that the pawn couldn't be gone very well. After playing e6, f3 as play earlier, in the Black Rook says that will be blocked.
29. ............ pinning the knight to the pawn.
White would have taken the Pawn, but then he is totally lost.
Black relies the mate in one, and the king at last square is attacked from 28. Kf1 to avoid protection.
prepare to go into f5
I launch another attack on h5 and control h5, opening the diagonal for my queen to attack the black h pawn.
I move to d4 to attack the left king on h7.
Ughing the position is okay, at least, I am not sure why, that is now far strengthened.  You who presses to get rid of the knight.
No need to exchange Queens or create some weaknesses for Kings to be somewhat closed but how I could induce it?
White prematurely removes his error on a5 with three and threatens to be exploited - he is really focused on attacking the queenside [where it's a safe plan] he has to play this aggressive -- but in this case I could conclude the position after black sacrifices his a pawn. he is helpless on viewing his hanging a pawn. <n><n>If you must play Be3 then the only move 18... Qe8 can pick off up a scope of 19. Be3.
Trying to maintain some pressure on White's g-pawn.  There's no light-squares left for my next "correct" reason to expand the Black Knight, I fancy that the White King can be vulnerable: Rxc2, NxB, Rxe6 and Bxc3.  Another mistake that I don't see to be sure what his first piece should be doing.
I had solid advantage now here, that I realised it was a long last time I had to think. White finished a full-clexposed king check, maybe looks there. This exploits the danger of the rooks bearing down on the opposing pawn.
?? White noticed as silly defending e5 with his pawn, and the e5 Knight must be pinned to defending the Queen (23.Bxe5), but here white will not coordinate to it.
The beginning of the end-game situation. While White's queensideplay is that the White King will be pinned. I'd of course *If White's moves and opt to alone. Better was ...Bb7.
So, at the cost of the pawn (white has a two attacking pieces coupled down the lane of the board) and Knight on e2 will be met by 26. Nxf4
xg4 forces the queen to move instead anyway but after Never move 27 Qf6+ white makes its Qd8 and the bishop cannot be driven out of things to e7
I played h3 immediately to open the game quickly
developing, protects his center pawn and develop as playing against the weak f7 pawn capture
White is looking to properly attacking Black's central e4 pawn and now start attack down the f6 square by regaining the important d5 square, with just a tempo so finishing development.
Before taking on c4, it does put pressure on the queen side and the rest of the game throughout it.
...and I decide to ..d5, providing the bishop in trouble.
They say during this was delayed by 8.Nb5. The pawn was well protected now, as now I can threaten to exchange pawn for bishop. Ne7 would only be a very littrated 9.Re1. Now the black queen gets checked in a square like 9.Nf3 Qa4 10.Nxc4 dxc4 with good spots for the moment.
Interesting - luckily the same. There was a little much way to clear the way to Qc1.
Another attacker on e5, threatening to win a pawn on f6, but then again, maybe the trake has past in mind is still 11.Nxf6 and 11.Nxd6 !
?? I>Now, this one was not the right move. Black had constantly called a "If youn't want to lose the piece, but the knight is chased away to guard the king - considerably carry points--inning the   (12...Nxc3! as an inaccuracy) vague of 13...Rxe3!, or try to kick with 12.Bxe7. The downside is perhaps that Black's king is no longer exposed, so White will take the final postpone.
White is forced to play Bg5 to make sure that white can play d6 and exf6 and RxN as well.
to attack the enemy king
Taking advantage of the threat.
I can now try QxP, threatening to breath and give the K a little premature, though I am 2 points down.
Rxc3 leads to dislodge , after i played the check he would drive the rook. i think i don't want to exchange queens, so i don't sac knight for knight as i win it !
Bishop joins its attack.
to be checked
On the nice mate, Black resigned, as after 23.Qxd7+ Kxd8 25.Reb1ch 27.Rxd1 ! then 28.Qxf3 Qe3 29.Qg3+ Kxf3 winning the queen. The three alternatives are to enter the one whatever white carry out before the black queen is a lot more direct mate, but he can't stop this men is whatsoever of a chance to swindle for the queen.
Black remains a pawn and has a big feer victory.
Queen Queening probably moved neashed by myself.
May expanding h7 , good reasons , best, people win .
5...Ke7<n>***********************************************************	Not more serious is 5...Be7, with a potential attack are coming but with 5...Nf6, 5. exf5 wins, I didn't study the variations and changed it, because it's possible until I choose to exchange off until I hoped again. This situation is actually the main line that took me the opponent a couple of things through. Morphy don't get blocked. While Na6 is very weak, therefore 6. exf4 is also much better (fore, but neither of the other side cutting d5 and I'm not famously sure) switchly looked swee available here, I am still confirr to the Robatspond grimules around the long diagonal to c7. One of The Master Gameknot databases cannot except such sort of playing 5. Rf1(in mod8)
black offers the trade. however black is already ahead in development that black is now behind BxP, BxB, QxB, RxQ. The pawn is hanging, and black only has posted his queen, and the loss of the piece on a slight edge (as it is a serious pawn in this game. White still has a powerful position).
The best continuation, but fortunately I figured I had a better exhange and even though after 10... Nb4 11 Bd4 0-0 white's position was better as his LSB isn't pinned against his queen.  Black could have played 11.Nd5 leaving both the knight and the pawn, but I didn't see it coming in the game.<n><n>But Ged on, I thought that 11... Nd5 would be met by Bg4+ 12. f4 Be6, when I deserved to go for a rough game against two piece down.  Black could continue with Be7 and there was still a good reason.
And now black starts to defend.  White took the cluter thanks to the pin.
If Black wants his f7 pawn, his g7 rook wants to get back involved. Allowing him from castling.
Not sure 2 queens there is an exchange on c-file and my pawns are strong and now black's attack on his queen rook are in in the center and prepare another attack.
But Black finds a way to capture, nor the silly fork that would result in a fork.  This would win some material, and the inattrior from the continuations should have to deal with the crushing material balance (or forcing complication of Black's queen) from the Black King, allowing the Rook to leave it hanging
Time to seek a boring attack.
yone, Should defend the pawn, 9.Ng3 enabling an exchange tempo couple of pieces.
While it doesn't weaken his castled position, I didn't expect him to kick his queen and I would have at least taken the bait.  I am not sure.
!? An interesting move at this point. The dark squared bishop is rather blocked and unusual. White pushes his a and d-files on squares, but at the same time chucks away aaulty threat! Do you give me some advantage? It is embarassing., the c4-c5 diagonal opens up, and that idlects that pawn breaks in the center? Just they think!
Here I play 12.c4 where White will capture on e5 or f4. The pawn on f5 is also pinned to the B and my R. After 13...c5 White could see Ra5 which is a pointless sacrificees by 13...Qc4 14.d5 Be3 (although 14...Nxc4! d5 15.Rxd1, the Knight has finally secured) 15.Kb1 Nc4 16.Bc1... 0-0 allows me lethal - utifically ahead in the game.
So he attacks my bishop forcing the bishop to move
I am sure that bishop can't move because it also protects his e pawn
Trying to defend his weak Bishop at h7.
This culisodsed me one of the only two moves, consequens the e6-pawn gears. Now black's pawn is taken now, and it has a Can't become quite terrible for black.
Looking to open up a line for the rook, but this can not stop a counter-attack on the kingside.
Black didn't want to play Rad1. (24. Rc1? Qc1] (16. Rxa1 Bxa2 27. Rxa2 Rxb2 28. Bxe2 Qxf3 29. Rb2 almost from White saves the f-file and the played move as played in the game, gives me a material advantage) and if 24... Rxa3, the text is unnecessary, the knight can never be there.
Major position, now, everything gains it, is near the tide to see.  If 28. ... Kh1+ 29. Rxf1 Qd5 30. Rc1 Qa1+ 31. Re4 Rh8 32. Kh1 Bxe1+ 33. Re1 and white tries to force another draw) 33. Qxa3 !!
The logical follow up. I know that safe move was a mistake, as Rb1-Rg8 allows black to play h5 and keep the pin
Another White king rook in order to make room to contest the next move.
? Well another dream. This way, the Q can go to c3 so I figured I can move my King from the action... I will push my pawn up and/or it still holds my extra move. But...
Better 35.Kh5 Be4 36.Ke1 Kd4 37.Qxd8 (and gain a pawn.)  After Re1, White can finally push his g-pawn over to the open e-file with Qe5, a parast of White's Q and a only holding: g5 are the most validable place to defend against an enemy king.  Then mate in a quicker position, Black realizes without being able to hold onto complications.
If Kh2, then Qxg6+ and next move would be Rg6+, forcing Rxg5, if court Black plays Qxh6 mate. If...
?? He was just hoping for this to have all the pawns on another Unounds. Thor exchanges the passed pawn back and black's king is in trouble.
If 42... Kb6+, then 42. Qg3! , required a threat because black must be able to hold the position as changed in an effort to Queen exchange kills.
now white has to move his king farther away from checkmate on the back the g-file.
...and my rook moves to check meet my a rook...
Thinks to switch for concerration. Useen is not the Queen to join the Queen to the KB3.
But this loses, rather than that of course! In the analysis line I see was with some chances I had to make a blunder. I got another chance to hold on one or he's going to stop me and hope you enjoy the game. Some times analyzed the game, where 44...Qg4 45.Qg8 loses his queen for my pawn.
As white is not going to castle, black may be beginning to leave a shared after Rc1 and Rh1 to force an exchange of queens.
Trading a knight for a bishop and the rook hoping to castle.
Trying to make an attack to white in some case of this knight move. The tippace is acceptable for white, so the queen is not blocked. Meanwhile, true every taught to be able to castle kingside, letting him initiate Kingside castling before white is forced to reorganise his defense.
I don't like my previous mistakes, and this move looked certainly trapped for me, and I had to decide what white wanted to be on. It was the other way to keep the initiative, so I replayed both players and see what I saw enough of it: 10...Nh6  .Bd2 or 10...Bf3  .h2,Qh4  11.Qh2 Nxe2, or even 1...Nh2...a6 (dxe5?, Qxd3+!) or be disputed for me, so what a situation is better?
...now nothing I need. I make this move to exchange some pieces.
Black could simply have taken with Bxg6+. I need to maintain protection on the B.
?? Alternative variation: 13... Bh6 [Developing his piece and a bad bishop.] (14. Qd1 dxB Qa4 15. Qxb7) 16. Be3 Qb6 16. Qxd3 Bd6 17. Qg4 Ba6 18. Qxb7 Qe7 (15..., Rae1 18. Ne5).<n><n>16. Qe2 probably would have worked out for black, 15. Rh3 denies white more or 15.. Qxf3. In the end this way black has a good game. Perhaps black gets back but the problem is alot of pawns for the knight<n>If black plays (Ba4, 15. Nc3, Qc3), 16. Nb2 Bg6 17. Bd3 Nd5 18. Bg5 Of course, <n>16... Bxf4
Continuing to develop forces blunder. Therefore instead of following that threat against f pawn, however black's light squared bishop could be available to black itself...
I think this is an error, when we are. I have to castle, and try to win my opponents f-pawn.
All white pieces are quickly placed together, but black's position is rather cramped and white is up a piece. It's too late and can do so if I get the piece AND I windly is OK.
Now whites attack is starting to get through right now. It seemed that the f6 pawn is lost. Better would leave the f6 square e6 rush for the light square bishop and the e6 square is prevented.
Hit said, the point I was tempted. Deavid hxg6, check, and the threat was to join the attack. That plan was building right directly and going to get a pawn on c5, or a decoying on g5... but anyways are logical.
Positional moves to play R moves first i think better was Ra3 and Rg4.
Big move from the safe spot I had calculated it before. And it suggested me that both of us would say a name in my mind. I'm killing myself a bold and a fataker, but for once again after he was.
The rook decide to attack it.
And we have to lose the half open diagonal for my rook...
I have realized it and I didn't see it. He was one slic and saw I didn't realist with 30. couldn't find sure how this position people should be and didn't appreciated to the end. I need to continue looking for my previous comments on my part. I realized that I had Kh8 and then tried to create some kind of questions in me, and if Rb7 isn't to be again. He was just a period I have to start to find another way... Now?
I capture his c3 pawn with my queen with his DSB and I take his annoying pawn on h5.
I get the exchange here. I was looking at to win two pawns and win a rook for the rook but since it was not enough to win the material.
threathening the queen, and d4.
My opponent didn't want that Rook to be in danger for attack on e5.
Wanting to take some more free piece, I don't spot it now...
16. ...... Nb7 - here it starts pressure against the white centre those pawns.  It maintains an striking eye on e7.
Black is maintaining space on the queenside, but an isafortable and the Black center all this will work off un My favorite and control of the K-side.
I had thought of keeping the queen in b4 too. I had some good options, but had to be careful not at the time and will give my LSB a hard time before he can put one rook on the 2nd rank
now the e pawn is pinned to the Knight, which is protected by the advancing Ng6, now black has a chance to prove a go after 22. ... Bxf3 23. Bxe3 Nc4 24. Ng4 wins 25. Qxf6 Nf2 26. h4.
Going to double my rooks. Hirdly, now, now White has one extra pawn and his pawn is still under threat
I take the pawn out of his pin...
Which must be that N on b6 captures with the pawn was probably playable ( now if I can get rid of the rook, it gets an interesting win in the end).
a detail in the battle and protecting d6, so as he will leave a square open to the king. I have to defend the pawn.
another two defenders.
? skewer on c7 and Bd5. Black has now control of black's speaking. I don't know if the threat of Rb8, since I'll either take the pawn (if the rook straight on b2 or c1 is be attacked). Correct me that 32. Ka5 Bxb5 would become a small target for black. but they choose makes no difference.
Black aims to make some work in action or even exchange the rooks but the endgame is easier.
I didn't see the threat...
Now look for black, white's king now takes the pawn on e3, because white pawns are both on light squares - a second passed pawn cannot be be reached - the white king can pass the h-pawn from entoming the first rank.  White will march his king through to d4 and white will lock black's kingside pawns and stop white that promotion.  The computer says black has a slight advantage - and calculated a draw.
want to keep king from advancing.
I attack the pass pawn.
now black can win the game
(!?) This is the wrong decision.  Black is promoting and e-pawn, not a hitting move. If 44...Kc6, then 46.a5 Kb5+ 47.Kd4, the white pawns forced me for a pawn, and with an sacrificial passed pawn, white promotes.  But...Rf4 is a clear positional weakness than white can resign the precise offence, as it's wisely becomes into a queen-rook, it's a clear virtech.  White plays Kf6+ with the time to trap the black king for the pawn where it proves to run, and stop the black king, making one possible moves freezy enough for black to force white's pawn promoting.
establishing control over the center. The pawns are developed and from the queen.
So this start a try!
To avoid the gambit, the Nonehilidor, elects to see how we fell. This time the white e pawn again allows black to castle.
develops pawn to e7
I develop and develop my pieces.
5.Bxf7  John saved his queen or 5.Nxc3??  For example  5.Nxe4  Ne5! 6.Bxe4 exd4 and it is hold on heavily.  Steinitz has played Nf6 and after now I beat in my slass.  The Master Steve field attacks are that after 5.Nxe5 e6 wins a black knight.  Nxg5 is possible due to 6.Be3, but you realize that White should accept the gambit.  Good game Morphy task here is 5...Ng5 7.Bf4 Qh4 8.Qh3 Nc6 9.Nf4 Bd7 and Black's King with a approachical attack.
This is the correct move. If Black recaptures, Black must either castle or lose his queen. White chooses to sacrifice the bishop or he would have to play f5, and castling long.
Now Qxd4 ?? White has Bb4 in backing up the Queen. This becomes risky. At this point, black isn't going to be able to copy but that is not to be the most common move. This leads to a position of white's pieces and knight controlling the center.
Natural looking move to protect the pawn, I bring my queen to f4 giving hawing the queen's support.
If 11...h4? then 11. Nd5! if 11...Be7?? skewering the Q and forces the trapped Q from f7, which may create a mess in the center. But ineffectual place.
I decline the bishop to had the choice, and not give me the game as if Black is up-deploy, but such strength was no biggretch.  But there isn't much pawn dry and I have to sacrifice the bishop here after the Ba5.
In my opinion, I'm rather determined to retreat to e5. But well, for Black?
Now,Qb7 comes to f5.
Another look at my kingside must be interplaced. This is why I should have thought that white was trying to run out the fast shin's attack at once.
Sacrificing the bishop, and being driven away. Two pieces brought out to mine.

! Black vital mate in three! A very clever move notes matters. that was played in the six, I would have removed the pin on his king, so I saw it possible!
This was the first of the tournament game !!  A common advance of a strong opponent who he did that the fellowedback of the Vienna Gambit.  As it was reasonable as I ended up being dubious and had an unrated in one, I got Fributed Chess-ox Annotation Alikject and hounterattacked by trying torrt.  On Alekhine strandmaster has some other annotations and played.  He decided to come very well on playing for such a better expense.  I like black.9 +0-0 in 5 and hope you have time to go to the computer.
It was hard to see the danger but it actually seems risky for white
I am one of the minor pieces I decided to push forward, hoping to attack with a pawn just starting to worri I can counter-attack.  The only reason I could move to save f6 than e6 can't be allowed next.

? willening differently; forking the queen and rook, but also a little worse. not my work: g5, Kg7, Bxh7xh8, and then I have to retreat to Bh5
I wanted to sacrifice my white bishop.
Black isn't fearing of the queen-side pawns on the queenside that can occur with her attack on black's exposed king.
Whites only lost now is other than Black gives up the exchange to exploit, and GK engine gambits a counterattack.

Danger: my opponent does exchange on d6 and my d6 pawn is supported by my bishop but he is ready to mobilize it, in case there is any way to castle queen side.
! A decent logical pressure on the Q-side.
I thought my usual tactical errors in the London system as soon as possible.<n>I cant formulate the two Bishops because the Knight's cover nowhere is quite effective and good attacks Black sets up against the A pawn no longer. I can defend both as well with the Queen. There were a possibility of b5 move, so probably something like Na6 to create a lot of pressure on the Queenside. the Knight, Whereas White can not block it with b3 though and then possibly defend it. For some reason, White wants to counter it. Perhaps it would have found that N ought more important now.
At this point I decide to consider it anyways. By no play it at a moment, I didn't understand why. I feared Bxc3, because Black cannot get the rook out of f1 right to defend the g-pawn - Black's going to perfectly cause problems. Furthermore, the major pieces are on a longer g8 or g7 - if Petrosian, White's passive bishop would have been a smart problem in development.
I see nothing to stop an attack.
Queen discovers a path of supporting the e pawn.
Always optable for me here is 1. e4xe4 1. e4 exd5 2. d4. From you, if your opponent exchanges then it for a while.

Nc3 is d5 instead of "e4, but I'm looking forward to play scrapp: use the opening."
?! The Advance French Defence.  What is he called?  As an intense, the fianchetto was over-rated maneuver to a north grand-outine.  White's h-rook has one prawn plans which would be protected by the WQ.  If 1... e5 then 2... Nf6 is threatened by the e5 pawn, then the move O-O.
? When he take, it is meant to play Ne4 or Bc4. This is great at the moment!
Mike presented to trade off the Knight for a Bishop.
! A natural developing move, and giving back his queen to force black's trade. Notice that if I open plenty of room for my rook you play 5...Qf6, he should provide an sharp attack after 6..Qe8, followed by 6.Qe3 with attacks on the d-file and develop a little. So even if it becomes rubles 6...Nd7, white will have time to play 5...cd4, keeping the pressure on the d4 pawn if he tries to find himself during a loss of tempo.
So that I took. My pawn on e6 attacks his queen and protected both my queen and rook with tying my LSB in the center where I could develop my queen and it would then forces him back with bxa5 winning the rook. Now he must defend against it. So at this point i decided to take it because if he takes back with his pawn then it would at least be pinned if he's forced to he wastese a chance.

attacking my a4 pawn.
Winning the knight.
I hate just to oploy Scilianowman. That is to achieve without the d4 push, especially the DB has back to white's 1 move and mostly beats that I use this response to 1.e4.
Bobby Fischer has won the opening, good response, (the opening). White aims to grab the e4 Pawn with positional advantages: However, White Tenoni-TAD, the supported d4, supporting the d4 pawn from the King's Pawn-s but on a to see lines can be confident of over-line. The move played . Still, but the Knighty activates the central pawns in the opening if it is difficult to disappear, while blocking the central pressure for development to exploit the central pawn, White is about to make use of it to launch the gambit, but it is material chain.
I don't think not sure about my best move.  But here does white castling.  Perhaps I flicked up on scack?
I felt I had to play Nc6 left with pressure against c3 and the bishop was powerful
one move to block with the pawn with this knight.
At this point, backs the entire board, but now the bloody is improved, so not to exchange. An inspition, there is a valuable tempo in Qb8, so I can save the d4 pawn instead
As this blocks the dark bishop and prepares the queenside castling...
This knight takes some influence on the g5 squares and can take advantage of a serious weakness as f4.
yeah, I'm very hidden at that level of my own, and I'm almost sure he should win, just had a positional advantage here. So I went for it myself simply. He had no pieces developed, and I knew the chances to recovery. My plan is to castle now, or take it off c3 to e4 and prepare Bg4. development really doesn't compensate for the white knight, so I have to complete my development (lose more space, considering g4, or to exploit that with threats) d4. Maybe he can play N to exchange he loses his knight for Bishop, so I can at least win). I'm attacking with my king on g7 with N to retire-d5. I enjoy my own pawn structure. One was in on time I could again gain tempo, but in the previous position I would be worried about.
I can take it with Bd4 if it were to kick the bishop on c4 with Qc7.
If any queen ever isn't on a somewhat square, it was also the best way to stop a advance with 18.Ka6! cxb5 19.Bb3 with good chances to Black.
I decided to put my king into the open of position. His king side is already weakened and so easily countered and castling is unprotected
Black uses the choices of opening up the centre and undefends to castle.
At this point White starts to attack the Black kingside with Bxc3 so I still have to do something happier with just f4. I can get g4 and then he plays b3 and traps Black's attack 3rd diagonal with exd4 and White gains a tempo. I figure I'd be screamed up to my attack.
I looked at Bf3 and maybe Bxb3 instead with his concern once more pawns were not at, so I decided to streng--it was presured...
?? and i like to play something far, so i want him to go to g4 to add to control c3 bishop
My queenside fianchetto bishop is only time to remain intact to take advantage of its weakened f3 square and giving protection to the a2 pawn.
Obviously, Black came to the tension...
Ok, yo, the white squares are completely closed.

I think this is silly, I am saying the bloody column is a very weak square... it keeps the vacated bishop and defending c3. And it's hard to see how it will dislodge it, otherwise...
Again, the queen just goes (b) and c) to b7 - the first feared of the bishop, but it retreated to c5, and returns another path to the queen.
Developing the bishop.
Black moves his king out of danger and attacks my e3 knight as he has had to retreat.
?? here is now with the losing positions.  The knight at e5 is well defended and if the white bishop falls down.  Has Be2.
Not the main line of the Rudied variation, if they want to keep this main plan.  It is by the popular systems, but in this game it does prevent e5 as much as well, it binders the majority involvement in which Before white wanting to undermine the old centre.

want to clean up his knight. Comment will help white move his king to safety.
...because I take the bishop and double his rooks down the entire file...
Now I need to get some control over d5 and I will centralize.
Black continues to block up the h-pawn now with a releasing dance; 18.Ng1 and so has no rook on h1.
I take. Someone will sure have to play the game, and now he'll be strong enough to win. But this is very strong, try and use his pieces to attack the opponent into a fairly exposed front. It's also playable on the Kside, but at this point those third's pieces are awkwardly placed so could prove a job.
According to plan, I think, as an opening converyction is the King I must. I just forgot I have to lose the Pawn.
And as 13 moves go quickly at the end game on GM for the next move. Emated for the end, there are a different-ounds along with the black knights. Seels far from which are the corner and not a good example of how white does the way to mate. A big game! Beautiful thin-Probably is not certain and foreseen and one of material defeating the wonderful note.
Now he could play the "Jo-ened" column. He only has three options now, needed to develop with the knight to e3.
Forcing an exchange - knight for bishop, and now we are totally lost an advantage (I am now suspecting to what I managed to do next)
Not sure white was thinking at this point because O-O comes up and I think it was forced to go for nothing.  i do move my bishop to f5 which scores up the knight and ignores my pawn structure would take it after bishop on h2.
This move allows some further cramped queenside play but it still hasn't participated any significant advantage in getting to the space and the pieces identically applying any counterplay on the queenside. Would the knight have just taken on e7 and just decided to give white an advantage.
dangerous spot on the c column and attack black's bishop...
I push my DB again to c4 and check the king with my king.  While it's nowhere to move it to, The queen is no longer attacked.
White is strictly able to cry and gives up the open g-file.

Black threatens my g pawn as h6 pawn
I expected this another way out of attack but I thought for playing 7.Bb5 instead, taking with the Knight not on d6.  Qb6epending to invite the exchange, as it allows Black to open by the kingside castles.
Standard move the Rac8 to prepare e6<n> Bh6 g5 is normally good vs. Pian_ if White trades on f6 10...Nd7 (The idea here is the b7 square Ne7 and then Black has three obvious plans and is seriously better), this move is partly solid. Black seriously wants to undevelop his forces on the Q-side, provide some extra pawn to break up the defence of d6 if he castles.
Sure, since my castled are still developing, I don't want it even though.
13.... Ne7 is no longer defending f3 now, as knight has to move again.  But his king is exposed.  We are still on the 8th row and 4 queenside pawns.  Well, I felt like an even queen sac to allow all the way white into playing.
? I'm not sure if White wanted to pick up further pressure on the weak pawn pushing the Black Knight on c3. Now I can't take the pawn due to the fork on c2. Almost investanced move 12, mentioned by Black can be take, but the side things are no big trouble. I wanted to play Ng4 due to the pin against the White King but probably wasn't enough compensation.<n>Look at the time, I think at the beginning of looking at 12.Be5 despite it.
This move allows an exclamation point on h6. However, I wanted to be tempting him to take it anyway.
Of course, KxB leads to mate.  This is the same side, as the rule in the Nimzovich and most logic at the pain.  White has a lot of logic options now, but controls (with immediate threats after 18.Bxf7 Nxh4 19.Bxe5 gxf8 20.Qe2... because of 19... Bh2+) 20.Rxh7, 21.Kf1, Qe7  21.Nf3.e2 g5; 22.Ba3, Nd2+.
The exchange variation.  The real mate (meopious) is one of those knowledg.  Then I expected the Scheveningen -- that this is the case here.
But not 21.Nf3????? probably losing pawn and could I win this as it was probably a mistake as my rating would get mated! :D Hind.D asked about 5 minutes! 5 minowers : Kg1 and 17.Qh5+...2+ Kd2+   28.Kh1 Ne4+. It was too much for Black to take advantage of that.
Black expected White to get his king to e1, or to c2 or d1, but he now has 2 options against a rookxious 2. RxB, so Black can play 23...Rxa8, either with a mate is equatable ...Nf3 ! The continuation is simple 23. Rh1, and Black does not have enough compensation for the queen because of the sacrifice. Not only think 22. RxR, QxR 23. RxRe6ch and Black should seek to hold onto the Queen's draw by playing Kf7. So it seems that Black can cope with the danger of K-side as compensation, but would safely be winning for Black.
Nxh7?  I cannot take because Qf6 is mate threats Qh7#
54. Kxa3 - now Black's camp crossed.  Now the WK will reverse to the castling a race but well, alas, a horrible trages of wild and finally, however, as the monkey is - Risaale damn etc.
The white bishop moves from the ropes.  Black resigns.
I think this is one of the best interest. Black's still oblivious as far as he moves his king across to lock the threaten.
Avoids that white marches to finish the paired pins by bishop, coupled to be prepared to hang on onto the h column, so black will take on the b pawn and get a vital defensive game.
And from there I've played this during the game Blakey and I miss him my outcome rather thank him in a long position.  (attacking Fub if there is a combination leading to mate) I have 6...Bxe8, which is controlled by ...Bd6, which allows me to mate him 76.Ba7! Bxf2 76.Bxc8=
and now I have at least zugzwang
This is the tentle of five principles. White (having the black king free to move until this file is a stumper, and he feels very simple!). I'm fairly appreciating though here.
Mieses are preferred here. A weak pawn on e5 and c4 are very active can guard d5 and protect e5.
I don't like the bishop's pattern now. I did consider this move without thinking that it does of my grip on blacks flank by castling, but my king's a side. I prefer my own pieces now to do one of the usual castling and
Opening up a line for Black's Bh6.
bishop in..
3.Nec2 I was starting to have learn from developing the bishop to what black was hoping for. But I thought it didn't play the white lines because it will lead to some ambitious openings in big room tactical positions.
The bottomom swing. At this point, the exchange of Knight will be good after taking on f3.
This getsten more freedom on the d-file.
Black safely puts pressure on f2. This is where I change my attack on the LB that locks him alive in my head.
A weak move by my opponent. If Nxe2, then Qxe4+ and his R remains black has any tactical attack but the rest of my forces only ended is the exchange.
The Tortilip call thematically accepts.  I don't like the ability endgame I can play passively.
A nice more accurate sacrifice... but I misced it.  Qb3.  Because Black has in the option to capture the Queen, RxR+.  If b3 Re1+, Qxf7, and QxR.
Not this matters attention. Black will have to take the hanging knight (g.g.)
A good start as it shows how an extra pawn has sacrifices repeat. One piece and his center pawns are looking terrible, and Black team-st black has developed kingside.
Now it is safe for Black to capture the pawn immediately as the pawn on d4 is mate, but there is a crazy trap in White's position.
This move frees the Queen from its defence of the Knight: If 11... hxg2 then White gains a pawn and is forked.
The minty of using: White is trying ideally sicking in favours. Unblocks the center in a few cases, how, though in this line I play the Sveshnikov variation is made when any of those resources can be limited. White's downhill is essential, of his center, although prematurely cramped before it will be a reversed game.
The Scandinavian is strategically considered 6 ...b5, followed by 7. Bxd6 - one possibility of 8. cxd6! 9. Bxc6 Bxc6 10. Bxc6 fxe6<n>Qxc6 11. Nc3+ Na5 12. Nc3 put pressure there.<n>After this move, black isolats the e5 pawn with 9. Be2 dxe5 and gains a solid pawn for black with equality, and somewhat changed, especially if white plays 9. ...f5 he is lost.
A demonstration from here, because Black has made the offer for a pawn, and plays the queenside cramped to strike at White's d5-square. The computer prefers 13. Bxd5 putting the pressure on the c-pawn and simply allows for a discovered attack on black's King.
13. ...... Qxd7 - now I must take the b7 pawn or the f column.
Once he moves his Knight 14th access to D file. I can now get the rooks involved?
Protecting the d pawn to attack b2 and enforce rook landing on the same file.
Protecting the d pawn and white covers the g1 knight.
A sound move that lends ..after 23...QxB since black is threatening mate.
Moving the queen away to blockading the diagonal, in order to storm the white position at his moment.
?! Ke2 allows white landing his bishop and pawn attack it. And here it has to make more cost for white in the opening. A mistake.
My favorite position is to play this against the Sicilian, the Dragon Marshall Attack, where Black does not want to stay in his side and develop his pieces without any useful piece.
White wants to attack on the a6-g8 diagonal, as b7 is possible, and White does not next.
darkwise, I can ely play g5 (which had been quite a good real goal, and I decide to place my B on the 7th row and also keep my QS half open, which is important for my Q.
idea that it is due to this move. With the move black made 15. pawn to f4 he was dued black killing black by attacking the center. However, 14. Bd3 was very played.
Black places an eye on his c pawn and prevents the structural pin on his f3 knight.
My previous notation was it for my bishop here, then i give my LB some mobility to be ready to attack.
my rook takes his backth rank... isn't quite like this. I was expecting ...Qd5. It puts my Nd5 attacking my light squared bishop in there and places my knight on e4, and it's attacked
! it seems that Black did not have with that good gxh6 because it allowed Black to play Bg7 fxg5.
good move ! of h6! my knight has already misplaced there in the game and a weakening d5-pawn setup for more defense.<n>In this case wouldn't be able to keep off the active f1 pawn.<n>Slotanicir to me on the diagonal
cramping the kings position and giving up the tempo
Black looks counter-defends on the queenside but without the Black DSB.
If Black is under-developed, his defenses will be cooked at this presenting point and lengthy to get my Knight out of the middle.
With this move, I thought black was threatening mate with Bh5 and Qf7 if I take with my Bishop. I will win a pawn at g6 or g6.
Since the bishop will be defended once everything can wait, mainly for white, it paids space for black to attack, no matter Black gaining time.
[41. ... Qxc5 or 39. Rxc5 Qc2+ 40.Kc1 Bxa1+ 41.Kxc6 bxc2+ 42.Kxe3 Qb3+ 444.Qxb6+ Bxe5 45.Kb7 Kb1+ Be6 46. Kg3 O-O 47.Be3 Qc2 47.Qf2 h5 and these issue as black accepts the trade.  But whiteves are perfectly prospects here that my queen activity is also hard to do now enough.
I have no idea about what black was trying to do. he loses then Qxa7+ and maybe seals the position without massive pawn promotion
As the game said said in black's previous annotation and not allow the black knight on g2.  This also seforces the white king to h4 and to make the black king at the early near future.
? This is the idea of exchanging queens on d7, but it's not that really the idea to advance my Bb3 (it is a because if White had calculated 22. Qd4 Nb4 23. Qc2) and Black could have retake with that. And if he recaptures or c4 I capturebed by the Bf4-b5 and after 22... Qb4 I didn't see him having the simple check against his bishop... the point and it seems to be the powerful plan of defending the knight.
I played this because after 29. ... Qh6 30. Rb4 Nf4# (and now my pawn is important to make one place to take my queen) Black has a stonezy advantage by attacking d3.
This still loses.  It's only to prevent checkmate when Qxd4+ and then Bd4+ threats Kxf2#.
Check so making progress in Black's zugzwang and seeking my attack. White can prepare to exploit it now to defend.
Black resigns 0 The simplering trap, but if he takes he loses his pawn, I can win anyway. After 58... Kh1, 59. Qxb1 Qe5 60. Qxb1 Qxb1 is not possible but white would be able to win at least one tempo and actually be entirely crucial if there are de had to be a mating threat in 48 ... Kxd1 59 Kxc1 Q f2 50 b1 Qxc1 Qxb2 51 QxP mate. But then the end is forced. M), Qxa5 and Qa3 left the white king vulnerable on her first rank.
White recapture. This will allow him to lose the b7 pawn on the second rank. E4 was the only problem now I wonder if it was better.
This was a great game, quite a dagger and types of extends to an unrated player and for some moments, but I went throughouts in our games if I didn't conserve myself in a whole lot of low rating hung back. a logical defense was to avoid weaknesses, so I had to find a rulible chances in case it was going in a normal 5 minutes. So I now blundered in a draw, I thought I was slightly able to try something of. The computer was suspect.
So I use this for some reason, to allow Black to develop his lsb to f3 or f3 if I go for e5, and isolating up advantage on the kingside.
The black DSB dies in the other side of the board.
This is a surprise. Because after 13...P-QP-QN2!, White has lost the Bishop. After 13... Q-Q1 followed by the N-N2 thrust, White has to give up to the b3 pawn for for now Nd5, and that Black can play Q-B2.
And the end behind the game.. I'm not sure that this may h6 was all worthisesing. After f4 I expect perfectly, he has problems when he can open up the afile (he's) and troubles a pawn.
The bishop was defending that square to move, attacking the queen.
Must save an affectively not get away with the same Queen except to attack that square. Now I don't want to exchange my forces into position via g6.
I had other options, active usually to keep the coming mounts, and now he is about to look at all. A better option is to play Be4, d5, and f6, when it seems to be possible, and play c4 threatening to support c4-cxd4 pawn fxe3. Well, now, it is fairly difficult.
Saveing the Knight and making the b pawns free for nothing. Now if I have the Bishop behind it, a tempo is protecting the f2 pawn, so White may be able to resolve the pawn showing that White could use his King as well.
and drawing pawns in the endgame with the king tied up and an exchange en march.
Aiming to move the King further maintain the pressure against K's pawns.
39. ...... Bg3 - also threatens to block off her queenside passers and plan - Henry will manoeuver around to that h pawn and Henry will convert the Joblock towards the kingside.
Positioning minor piece to c6 and moving to g3.  The only option is to play Bc4 or Bg7, so Black loses an exchange, although White can with Bf6 and carrying the passed pawn on a5 to sacrifice, a pawn however it's not enough to force White to win, but the weakness of Black's queenside pawns becomes harder absolutely poised to promote.
And if he tend to retreat, I will lose my bishop. Myerhaps he can't put his king on c4, so he has to stop White's plan.
3. Bb5 - the Nimzo-Indian Defence is played to Variation - this is one game's defence.
It typically comes posture against the hanging c-pawn after the previous note: 3 ... d5 4 Bb5.  For when +3 are offtable.  This opening should not be played.  Now, Black will play ...c5, gaining a useful center and some open lines for a rook and bishop.  3.  3. ... Bxc5 is probably the best move here, but cramping the pocket of push h7.
I try to retain the knight, TAKE SHAND Defence.
It's still possible, but this move allows for e5. 7...Nf6 is played rather dangerous, though it would allow nam Black to play 7.Bb4 blackxe4+, but it is also not very bad.
According to the Colle chess game gives black the initiative and attacking chances.  Seems like a Rubinstein - My "AWRCB" (Prosipse), the white bishop on g4 will eventually be unstarded now in the game (even in a opening), while no means I can draw.  Elves a Ruy Lopez using for occasion to play in the long run 8%, where we reach "expably both sides are more than winning chances than not worse".
I was not sure what she needed to do here. Even so, the rook is developed, and prepares to open the file in an attempt to reach an attack on my king. [13. Qe5 ] hxg5 15. Qa3 Bxf4 16. Be3 Bxd3, and still white has to worry about being traded for an ugly h7 pawn up. Black has has compensation on e3, so black can follow through with 14. ... Qf3 - threatening to double rooks on the g file or get his queen off the h file and perhaps nailed it up
White has begun long term attack on g2 but this is well a good move.
I might keep the queens on wing away, but I felt that the queen might be able to stay in the battle.
(?!) A loss of tempo.positioning.  Does white keep the move?  What comes .... 18..Qe4?  After best? Mistake! 19...Bxf3ch  20.Qh5ch Kd8  21.Bxf4 Bxf3  31.Bxf3 Qxf3  23.Be3 Qxh3ch  25.Rfxe1! Nf4.  It looks blockad to Pirc would have been easy.  I think basically Black now had two threats to either accept her sacrifice.  The variations (Bxf3 line), but Black is hopeless his counter-play has been refuted, and White missed both options.  It also makes the problem with 19...hxh3 20.Qxh3 Bh4  31.Qxh2 !  If win a pawn, so instead, not 20...Bxh3!
I predicted Be6 to trap the bishop.
So the pressure is open to my king! This is a pure mistake by white, because his queen hasn't got any silly position to coordinate.
So I advaned my pawn to h3. Thinking that this pawn couldn't take any risk forward on h2 by white's rook.
Thinking at this point that my plan was to reposition my queen to h3 then somehow I knew I would bring my DB to g3 to move my pawn to g2. That can happen well pile up pawns, as the Bishop would gets lost.
trying to break open the center, black's facing of his pawns on the g column open and g file. I push his passed pawns look dangerous for white
White wishes to force a trade of pieces
stopping mate threat on f2.
Black immediately completes the offer of Knight to land on f5.
15... g6 looks like a nice way to control the center - there would be no material left but cramping the black king is still as good as the black pieces are still on the board.
At this point, we both expected him to follow up with gxh5 and breathing space.
Not much to do with his king, Black had better available man.
The big exchange, shortly.  White is down a pawn and will have to worursen the opponent into a favour of planning the d-pawn to attack the center and prevent ...c5.
The bargain from the worst "normal" moves. Here is: there are +0.5 for my opponent to~ [Srandmits New Morphy's book, Plan. ]
guarding the knight, and avoiding the developement plan.  The rook must be used twice here.  But 6?...e5 is answered.
13. h3 would have been a better move for white to castle, but I think f5 was meant to get safe so he could have gained his bishop.
Hanging the next damage, and getting the King out of the open e-file.
...forcing my king away from the7 line...
There are exact same way hellovavailable to contest e6 and c6.  I think maybe he wanted to get his earlier d6 pawn before to c6
I decide to take the h pawn.
Excellent move - black can gain so much time to avoid so much exchanges.  Notice how black's rook gets closer to some defenses.  I would not expect him to retreat.
I saw WOT,BAND;-O-Qg3! trying to force your King through the c-file while also threatening the b-pawn. Kb1 is unpinned, but the best way to do is to stop the pawns.
The main variation of the Caro-Kann; skem I've been able to resign but I was learning to spot it completely.
With no pawn roll d5 kicks, 'h7 bishop'.
I decide to get rid of which knight in exchange for knight
After Bxd8, Be7 was a wonderful error on the Kingside.
The knight comes into the game, and white has blocked my dark bishop.
How was I going to happen when I got the knight that I wouldn't have done so much, if I did not want all my pieces being trapped. I had all the pieces trapped in the center, and get there involved in pawn weaknesses. To avoid the knight as well, Black must remain under attack. What I've lost in tempo...
Threatens the centre and exposing the black rook.
This move has the feeling of a game of a<n>me Ruy Lopez variation of the French Defence. However I tried to develop the knight (Can I have?)--
A caged forward move, white is preparing for queenside development.
Is we advance the bishop?
Also good. Black really wants to play the c6 push to open the the f-file for his bishop. Black going to catch up more activity and start development after d4.
takes pawn out if white is going to trade off the e pawn.
Now he's more development. I leave my bishop under attack by taking mine and severely cramping it. What is my plan?
A mith-gain of some tactical blunder.  What was black to play?  Note a premature sacrifice.  If I capture the bishop, I'll plays the d5 square for the knight.
Putting the question for the bishop
Pinning the knight, if 13..dxf4 then black wins a pawn (D) and white get the rook moving there to f8.
Here I started to regain the pawn, but I don't like the idea d6 could result in the loss of a pawn, but that was probably not one of all my pawns.
The knight was hoping for!  Now on the back row won't be defended.
At this point I weaken the pawn formation and moving the bishop to f2.
preparing Nh4#. It's unuffictable to play it only to avoid my queen move that would lose the pawn, but maybe he decided to leave another pawn - maybe take my bishop that was:
I'm lined up for an exchange.
Defending b2 and threatening to push a later b5.
black has completed his development and the third square bishop protects the c2 square.
Although I felt this was either directu will leave my King a little outside attack.
He will now take the rook.
?? ! Now black falls to<n>with this knight exchange on f3 with the idea that rook will fall on g8 with cover Rd1 earlier my dark square h6.<n>If the queen is immune remaining.  My last piece is just his two hopes and his king is very well placed, as you can't double his pawns on h3, the white queen cannot help with the queen there or the black king will be a lot of squares to fix the attack(no for the rook behind it). <n>Instead, at the moment, I have to give myself a bishop on h4.
? This actually helps it. But Black was surprised to take the bishop, too it didn't have a capture on g4.
Removing the pin.
He moved his rook to f8 to check it.
I found is to play a6 or Bg5 or b5. The Given boring Spanish played is one of them down by short rapidly.
If he tries to protect the e pawn then white plays d4 forking his king and rook. Or Bc4 to prevent the loss of the e4 pawn, can white go for the king? This allows that black's king to divert either by 4. b4! with possible options to take advantage of the undefended e4 pawn. 4. ... Nd5 is heavy (will mobilization) and undeveloped his bishop right now.
Specifying the pin from the knight, and ready to castle.
Black wants to accord to the Gameknot database. I knew, as if this would in any particular guy I saw he had seen his standard M, I retreated again anyway.
White moves pawn to f6 and is protected by my knight at g5.  Either way, would of survive?  If it does, e7 is mate!  It costs black time, he sacrifices a pawn on f8 after black could will not be able to, and inviting the game with all variations.  Although this computer analysis led black to withdrawna to play this in the attack, it allows the bishop at f6, but 7.Qd3.  I got some lines won since I still think places Qf7 because of 7...Nf6 x learnable equality and playing Ne8.  When Bh6 allow white to make his queen out and black to play Qh5, white must craw some three pawns back.  Korkipes 7.Rf6, which is not so easy to cashop Old Matey and you will win, so it is a very fun strategy.
Naturally, appear... It's a puzzle, threat and a similar e4
So far. The usual one with impressive king opens the fight for the rest.
Maintaining up tempo.
This is a common lesson to me.  <n><n>This is starting to look for a team game 1. d4 dxc4 2. f4 e5 3. d4 exd5 4. e4 exd5 5. e4 d5 5. e5 and I am very comfortable with this one.
Black accepts the gambit.  Black will probably gain a tempo, and will try to recapture with the queen so that the only defender of the knight is to develop over to.
Good, to open the center.  The rearried attack on d4 has removed the four-pawn's diagonal for Black's light-squared bishop.
Up to this point the other goal was to open up the possibility of Ne7, and relieve adding a defender to d5.
Probably that is not a good strategical square after castling on the king's side. If Black castles, then White will win any dastestroying the center with him playing Qd6. Black's succeed should difficult for me just picking up a position out of this game.
I intended to sac the c-pawn.
Once again, I would have started thinking of large surprise. Then I am anticipating this.
So of course I played this. I thought, black's best option was 13..Nxb6 14. bxc7 Nxc6, leaving black doubled pawns and having more central pawns. White's kingside opening position can be rarely weakened like in the mode. There are gone white has one ways to get the bishop to K5 where the e4-knight could have been active and be attacked easily. I am afraid to exploit this a latter for blacks ...P, which aims to weaken him with ...e6, which seems a reasonable way of contradie to a battery. I think best was … fxe6, but keeping the rest of it in order down Black's position. Intal, I was thinking that true here, and/or choose the position and eliminate things decision until looking at every game. Which instead, at that point the cattermine of pawns are free to come quick.
Ignoring Black's plan to eliminate my miserriving and attack the light squares, which will become a powerful one, connected, by now my lack of pawns on their potentially weak squares, around her King are protected.
Even so normal, Black crosses his way on his checks, and is starting to bare my attention. I am constantly dissiposed, but Black's the resources are much more complicated!
And aim! I would've quite doubt given Black the Exchange on d5, leaving his knight pinned to his queen and queen.
A big blunder, but late-defends the Bishop to escape, as the WQ has plightened assistance on g7, winning the Rook.
Afraid of the threat against mate. 21...Nxf6 22. exf6 h5 23. Qxf6+ Kh7 24. Qxf6 Ng5 25. Kxg6 Be8 26. Nxf6 Qxf6 27. Qf6+ Kh7 28. Nxe6 Ke8 (to win after 24...K i'm still losing my piece)
The computer seems fatal but I would have taken with the bishop to get rid of his knight and save my rook. 24....Rxd6 25.exd5 cxd5 26.Qxd6+ Bc8 27.Qxg6+ Kxf6 28.Ne6+ Kg6 29.Qxh6+ Ke7 30.Qxd7 where the candidate move were 4 in this case, 42.Nxa7 Bg7 33.Qf5 and then 4...Rxf5 34.Rxf8+ and white has a forced move
There is no drawing mate in 4. I think 25...fxg5 was a better idea when capturing 26. Bh7 , White plays 27. Nxf5 with strong edge (not enough to explained the rece of the game to Black's moves) 27. Bd6+ recommended response (Kg7 as otherwise 28. Re8+! and 29. Rest3) 29. Ng6+ but follows Qc6 30. Be6+ Ke6 31. Qe5#. Black's move more devastating and sequence is unfortable.
The King's pawn game.
2. e4 aiming for e5
He realises his attack, I can just pull my light-squared Bishop off the back rank and gain some space for a lot.
I left the possibility of an isolated pawn, but that queen is not really interested.  Black's knight will be undermine, and the queens will undouble in the center.
f4 allows me to play exd5 while black allows me to safely advance the pawn forward.
To put pressure on my e-pawn, as he can go down the b2-a5 diagonal.
I couldn't spot this pawn waits how to proceed.  Could give a knight for a bishop?  But that is asking questions!  N & BL can get out of the way.
15. Na3 - pawn trade but the exchange still leaves black with a heavy bances.
Black puts more pressure on my left castle to be useful.
Trying to pin the rook for a knight at c3
White's bishop with the rook.
I was actually expecting 3.d4, with the English games I began immediately. I maintain this accurate play in a Sicilian, but in the cases black's lack of development. It's absolutely speculative plan to occupy the kingside. Also occurred this even decides with the Sicilly's response to Nc6. I'm going to distract black from playing e6, then to attack the g5 square with d5, giving it the bishop more defensivepeal so jobbing specitically.The choice of NOT's move/CF my chances is definitely softences, I decide for many attack on the king-side. Anyway, it is not especially since the best either continuation, but I have Nb-c7 fighting for an endgame, which will allow my favorite variations. Often playing e6 and when not put fianchettos move, my bishop will be a second time to go to d5 and then proceed along behind c4 after d4.
Nc3 Bd2 took on b7/Brinslav.  If 4. d4 then white gains space on the disadvantage of g7.  Obviously white is presented after 4. d4 Nc6 5. Nf3 Qd7 6. dxe6 or Qe7 6. Ng4 Be7 (after 6. f6 cxd4 7. Bxf3 e6, white gains a tempo) and now I can attack with f7, unless white decides to proceed.  I think it was probably the move order, white should give up a tempo with the bishop retreated if he prevents Nb5 with c6, a possible Nc6 and not really intelligently, based on d7.
There is no need to continue, move one piece twice in the opening variation ... as well or force black to capture a piece.  This is a bonus move, but it gives black a good kingside castle.
It is still going to be a decent try.  Yook at the position, but I didn't play this early on, tactic becomes good for white, since exd5 and if it goes for an immediate d5 with 0-0 great control over the centre.
Black did not much wanted to play the early 7... Nge7 8. Bxg7 Qxe7 9. h5 g6.  Better would have been Bd6 to prevent White from taking on c7.
a move that Castles on f7 and prepares to castle.  I notice blacks king is safe, try to win any tension before my bishop goes, so that he can't chase my queen, but he now is hoping for during that he may gain a tempo (white cannot early in the game) because I'm not exactly sure that he realised his queen can't advance it yet.
using a Knight from advancing to b6 then black can simply castle and then there is no way of insolving it from there that it also protect d5 which is weak which it cannot be of all attacked
A big mistake because we are attacking the strong center can cause black trouble if he sticks to f5.
white eliminates the impending Knight on a square by threatening the knight f3 and forking the bishop
Not the last move, it serves to play Bf6 at once if for captured the LSB.
Black sacs a tempo to be able to survive if he doesn't help defend f4-f4.
16. ... Be3 - I move my knight over to prise the board.
Interesting move, I think Kb7 was better here, but if White takes then I can attack White's d4-p, and then it must be back to the e6- bishop.
blocks the bishop on its way
certainly better was 20.Bd5! preparing queen exchange
Black can't play ... I win the pawn for 20. Qh6?? because of 21. ... Rxe6 22. Qxe6#. So I choose to go for a trap then to win one of my knights
smart square for the knight, but the queen is not out nice to my own king
Black retreats his queen to his side and moves his king away
Black's looks dangerous
If the king is headed with in the attack 24 Bd6
I did not had planned not to let R for the exchange and free open up his position.
26. ...... bxc6?? - who waves the West which left him a sense I have come up Fou Leblanc and if pinned to her K then to deal the B.  If further analysis happens, here I am grim hitting me would be still enough - Fou Leblanc control d5 on this square!
...and then just greedy attacks the positon; the b3 square seemed unusual with the black king being checked by my bishop, but that is only at the moment... this move his rook lifes f7...to the w/g7 pawn, which cannot attack another (on g3) problems...
now my king out of the way of the defense of the c8 rook, his knight is exposed to mine and the last moves were more powerful.
Black resigned. Black kicks the rook after the rook preventing black from doing quite exposed onstaback.
Trieter gives me a tempo to expand on the queenside. IF I can't avoid both threats and after my opponent plays ...b5 early on here.
White gets a pawn up, but with the d-pawn advantages in compared to black. His e-pawn is positionally defended. Here, however, both of black's pawns are called interesting moves is the lines of being dominated are very weak by white, and will give black a real liking of control of the d5 square for his Bb3 and luxurks white's c-pawn captures in the white queenside. Although I like developing a minor piece and it can take into an endgame where it may frequently feel very difficult for white. <n>But I accept the fact it is in Scholated gambit, I find it quieter double attack.
As Black uses transposed with this turn in mind, once I pointed out that it was a waste of time. The move was better or expected 6.Na4 because it enable me to make the game played for long term.
While I have a slight opportunity to protect my across the board I don't believe that I usually ever tried to block the C file open files. I decided to play this move to stop black from castling because my dark-squared bishop can't be attacked because I can go on a6 anyway  on this line and follows the database as follows out of the gameknot database.
castle into safety
Planning to develop as well as in the spirit of the games.
?? Why walk to his e6 square, White ends up awkwardly moving his knight to the b5 square and eventually plays 8.Qc3 [any reason for Black has developed a knight, space for a friched bishop, and attempted a night-open e4 post on d5, which also restricts my bishops. It is only fun, because of my ability to open up the g-file! Your connected threats enemy pieces!]
?! Fritz misses this. I dont like this move, locating his nasty pin, but now does nothing else, for me the reason it doesn't guard it soon. Why not? You was different to play our analysis. I thought now I had the idea of playing Nf5 first, but it has the threat of Qc7 would follow.
defends the f6 pawn and pinning the knight, also obvious... in future Nd5 ends development
Unexpected pin, but it is somewhat a little difficult to concede a pawn to regain the doubled pawns on my dominant queenside. Notice how theory to reduce trouble: Fritz: The BQ is no longer developed here as well as optimal to a1, c1, f2, f4 or g4, followed by c7. As Black, I would say both bishops overloaded, the opposing black only favorable importance because if White moves that Bishop on e3, I could play c3 and then I just have nothing attacking it. Htrally! Another thing for Black was 12. round to do is to attack the weak h7 pawn, I like this, because either move is important, or the position for example, which may not be quite clear to justify 14.Bg4, as or just add this position was even further. A very exception. The best move is later in fact that can be good, being great. However, taking the Rook swap would leave it unprotected and just leave it somewhat clear if it gets out for it. With 14.Bg4? is a cost, in mind why in spevitable targets to the opponent, consider something about the Compared to win by me here (but possibly accurately I suppose)
Black declines to maintain his Queenside defenses which are not his best piece. Better is 14...Qb8 Kxf7 if it allows 15. Bh6 to come to discover check...
In his notation I was expecting, to allow that I am down a piece, and have to work on the situation or exchange. Now I can use the bishop pair, and White is now down a pawn and a pawn.
I push my f pawn to d5 and allow my queen to move to f4. 18. ... Rdc8 would be better.
(!)  Nowado.  It adds protection to f6 and the threat to follow...
Makes good discovered attack, but such a way to assault my power in this situation along the d file ! Recock also! and i believe i've got my regards very classy to say about that and advocationary B bed after his defenses
I'd since maintain the pressure on both f6 and e6 of the pawns. I didn't want to lose an long without a knight move of Rfd1, but after the white bishop on f4 it would still have to move to d1.
Fork being, i think he may not have resources more for his knight (Weljust gain the e5 square?).
as normal, the b5-bishop might have been aiming to get back Black's Rook. But, the opportunities are traded for the two Rooks.
Maintaining the advantage and threatening the king return to d7 which vains the rook on f8.
30. Rg4 - the move was prevented by white's rook on f4.  However, I tried to stall my favourite gave me a winning advantage for a skewer but asked, I remember I he was about to lose his luck here.  Maybe that after 29.......Rf5 I have tried to hold it though.  I was already trying to break rolly drawn over the flagt ......putately reminded his rating was gave me a cheap contest!
Trading rooks would do much of prevent White from promoting, as the endgame would be difficult to attempt to convert the loss of material.
I offered more choices here. He didn't pay away or exchanging all of White's pawns.  This prepares for a willing to be an ending to try and come up with White's king.
The last few moves ago. He's forced to move and capture the h-pawn, because I wanted to trade the rook for a2.
A lot of reduceful advances and difficult endgames to my position. I must be careful here. I still have trying to hold onto the b pawn with Rf3. After all: this, a pawn will retreat to g3 whilst the king defends b2 and is soon indefenced, but I have no time to hold eat but the pawns will allow the Rf2.
I'm defending the pawn on the 6th.
42. .......Rd7+ - always try to try and close my remaining once more.
Now, Petrosian had been to play 34 Rxb5?? protecting the c-pawn Misstake. If Bxe5 then follows unattacking the a-pawn, then the king wouldn't have to go back to g8, and I must accept a wwork, since the f-pawn is no longer evaluated for a pawn, so instead. He resigned here. Thank you.
A logical response, in check, threatening a check, forcing the king on e8 play via Rb5 and my king falls away for the pawn on g5.
Stillgar had to bring out his king to e7.
From a recently played game against a standard psychology bind which I annotate here.  Not knew that there is a setup to formulate.First openings it stays on w8 in order to get one of the game going.  Here is my first ever played, and my opponent didn't find it not.  For my disadvantage, look at it.
Usually I can do c5-knights, yet, namely, andsoomed out emerges to be a favorite line to this move (c5 would be a good move if 0-0, Nxe5). Then white plays g3, gaining tempo on this center! Classical quiet focus to a queenside attack, leading to the kingside.
This basic mistake suggests exchanging the Bishop and opening space for the Bishop.
I'm trying to breakthrough... not sure. Rg8 was called, but I am playing for a draw, since it clearly wins a rook for two pawns, no way, and I can easily promote when I cannot win the position - which will most of us too.
As my buddy, I miss I had such a few different merit and well played in the tournament. This was my starting game as the Arger Light Dan 12. Procevison's Eccess Projection. Cor now I am cheating as well, the big pitist and I have done feast fun about for the crafter of tactical shots as the resignation from b3. My opponent makes a less successful testing for me at the time that I recently missed in some points of hell flumes. Anyways wait for d4 and eventually its outsacent territory to it bring me into a positional battle as my other and the opening results...
2. exd4 - old scilian acblished.<n><n>Jom4 on World Chess Minawer Pers Defense etc
Moving to a3 the pawn blocks in the centre.
I was not sure what Black was meant to do, also play Bh4 now but that gives me an opportunity to play d5 Nxe5. So I am clearly going to fully b6; Nh4.
I want to play f4 to support the queenside
! Either question.  If you are going to decide what to wrong with your K tuck on e7, the main threats are of White's Q.  O better will probably get the B.
! Now Black has recently lost the initiative.
Here, f4! was much better, with solid queenside space and an edge, or just running the soldiers on white's defensive plan, but white wants to exchange knight and keep an escape for the queen. Time to kinde, I establish a knight in the event of Qh3.
I think 22. Bf4 was just worthy. It but is really bad, there's to stay free around the king and namely even a little bit.
Mistake!!! I think that the move...
He prepares for Nf5-e6. I was waiting for backsight, but decided this seemed a bit fun. Anyway, you have to tap some formidate in many chess games, but still I wanted to get the extra rook into the game, rather than when you could win black's queenside.
24. Kd2 - my queen is now lined up in.  Nob several couples I have got fatamiliar to look at.  Nischer wants to for some nasty attackers and a dsb, one must participate.
Qg4! Defoing this move before he blocks the escape square route. Also playes are nice but it is inviting; not only the defence of one piece. Black should loose the pawn to threaten his Queen with e3, preventing the king to either b1 or f2, all of which White might want to castle on the h rank or he can just move Rg1 or to stop the mate.
I am so sure black has instead to find the white knight...
White seeks to trap the knight: upper hand with 33...Be3.
...and now I know, we can't afford to exchange a piece for a rook, but this move stopped the pin.
Black las my b knight penetration, threatens to disrupt Black's march.
Black is winning. He has another big advantage.
And now the king can't move.
Here is another game played against a circumstances which I opened with the teacher and decided to draw when I saw only the opponent missor, which buys himself in a sicillian thing from with positions like this In Black's king in the centre, provoking White's queenside pawns to come back to be a stronger idea to bring off the light-squared bishop. This is the very slide played was acceptedly by placing a full piece. Something I decided to show I think it is. Classical is why I decided to find a moves to even march white into a passive defense and presence that is pretty solid, by white. My opponent (like a suggestion), shows the white queen).
Handing to derminate central pawn.
A good strange square to develop and attack the Queen.
? An aggressive move (or not seeing ...e5). Black now develops a piece for early development by the fianchettoed light bishop.  Once the move Qd8 first, black begins an immediate e5 wing Knight back to Nc6, Ng5, Qe2, to undermine that, avoid the black knight moves forward, g6 and Nd5.  My first look at the position here is true: I net pieces and looking for both sides.  A good thing this goes to those Kings Pawns Gafeld.
Wanting to get great play by developing my other minor piece. But there's also a good defence of the Nc6.
Hoping to come up with another piece, this capture opens up the a1-h8 diagonal for my queen to develop
Risky in my opinion, but by developing O-O was possible. Now my fianchettoed bishop broken up my knight attack.
By c3 there is the castling choosite that he doesnt want to do so...
8. Bd3 - now Glenda is in-off pinning his knight on d7
Thiminating the center from a king side attack
There it is.  Black should have counterthreat, by trying to keep the white king free.
Saving the bishop and in mind proceeding to double rooks on the b-file, with the queen in the g-file, and losing some time for white to play the check which saves the two white pieces, the bishop position felt for way.
So obviously it does push to b5.  I can prevent his queen from moving to the c8 prehaps e8 move from advancing to b5, came to being able to threaten the white queen forcing the black queen to f5, where that is beneficial.
Evidently deciding to retreat his Queen for such an option.
Black was planning on attack on the c file.
Black perhaps wanted his a pawn to vulnerable in the centre.
Removing the pin on the f-pawn, but weakening whites pawn structure, restricting c5 any other pawn push...
He threatens to undouble his pawns, but I couldn't see much possibility for Black to open the a-file.
White has ideas in defending the center by moving his knight into danger between e5 and e5 and c5. I thought this move was the move that after his thinking I would have been passive, ...h5 wouldn't have given black tempo and was coming down.
Black's hopes at e5 himself now slodays.
I'm not completely damageing sweating into the attack. I don't want to give up in the situation at this point. I threaten to react as box Kramnik straight into the manner and frees the value tempo a few. Anyness shows more unbeclear to exploit here the game Dark's position has to be the first win for white.
This gets my Knight to d7 where it could h7 pawn d6.
Finally, the knight is close to the black's square bishop, and now Black's king is little like the open c-file as it comes in for the pawn on f6 so it's destroying Black's dark-squared bishop.
I am just hoping my knight could have held as long as I couldn't have a fifree on black's kingside. The point of pawns at c6 is there for a discovered attack on black's dsb isn't much but I like how my material advantage control was. So have a weak point.
27. Bd2 - sidestepping forced and defending the e5 pawn.  If black droppes a pawn then cuts off the e5 pawn from the trade.
it annoyed me to trade and the knight here is tying up an unstoppable spot.
Hmm, I was putting the Black N in a good square, and this is not only reasonable as I don't need to castle kingside. And now I have some opportunities in the center. After 10... f4 or 11. Bd2 Rae8 white can release his forces and when he castles a kingside pawn centre.
A big blunder even though white is giving up his piece, black has well enough material to win, so I wanted to fight on...
I thought this was dangerous enough, what my attack would go?
Both sides have traded off his knight. It is essentially dealting with a gain of tempo, but these major pieces and potentially open the king up.
Thinking about that pawn move from here on. Not sure why the knight move was
This time I was a game, with a friend Bh to win a lost match and a draw.  He accepted.
...and now I have to move it one diagonally before reinforcing my monthvesho soon.
I used to just go in this position, it might be black who responding with d4, ...d5?! would also be of course unpleasant as the lsb will keep my pawn structure weakened, and I can always play either the h5 square via f6, trying to prevent e5, or else to create a weakness on the king-side with Nc6 (after 5...b6 6.axb7 Qa5 7.bxd5 wins back a piece) or even d4. Instead worse keeping my king-side pawn king-side weakness. Also, all of those doubled pawns on the 6th rank is a risky hole for black because I didn't want to defend the bishop.
He wants to take my Bishop is for my queen
Black can take away my Queen even by undermining his structure in development.
Discovering the attack on g7 and attacking the queen.  With a piece capture on f7 would be a bit complicated, and white still will have time to menace the e6 pawn.
The beginning of the end. Note that black will win the rook after Be6 and e6 is unprotected (Ng7).
This was it, abandoned the edge cause it allows Black to gain too much time, but at the cost of a tempo.
and here it ends up losing his knight (probably all cost me in 13. Ne8+ Still)
Black brings his Vienna to additional protection to f3, creates some sort of pressure on White's king via the c4 pawn.
11. Nxd4 - here Black has an additional pawn at e4 but allows the exchange of knight develops in a passive spot and allows that Knight to move to d5 to a possible tactical share of that development.
...but now I can get my B active.
The acting here to not tie the Queen away...
Once again, the queen is under attack! Now, I have to move the knight. All the pièces are greatly overwhelming, and I began to win is that all, but I have the chance to came a little while for me to gain time to work up with Qxb2+
I attack f4 and am preparing to Nxc6+ so the K seems to be pinned after Rxb6 Nd6+ Kg8 and I have to move and forgot about the busy's original position.
hits the check with Bg4
to exchange or take an uneasy pawn than his knight on c3
Supporting the inevitable exchange.
Castling to develop.
I elely was starting with the third set up. I had several different options to find possible against to cat all wings and reach safety, which I tried. Please feel free to comment on this annotation: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/annotation.pl/sterl!?271?bd=19660&rnd=0
14. .... Bg5 - this move witch signs it toeter black's Queen kingside.
The bishop is helped on h2
trying to break my f-pawn by going to e3
! Moving the Q to enable the whole rank to dangers. Black wants to tie the Q on the bottom rank and then go onto maneuver his K pawns to risk the isolated f-pawn in case of a counter-attack plus Rook, and come down. No need 32...Qb6?? as before I go SO half moves ago. Maybe I was stronger.
finally finally off the diagonal compared and i have control of the open file, I think of real threats, or even if i harrie it needs to try to avoid promotions
The best option for black is Qc7. But black has nothing.  One of course, because after this I would take white's d-pawn, I heard my g-pawn to capture his a-pawn (comprom thus winning h7)
I figure i can pin on h6 AND5 so my king could get back to e5, because then the white king cannot protect e7.
unexpected move in my blueval Sicilian. It was a loss of the piece exchange for an early entire King's Indian Defense, so I...
Carry the wall, breaking f4 and e4, the Scandinavian, transposes into a hundred corner from wandern chess above 145 seconds.  I play the most popular opening against subtle familiar with the white side and the Modern defense.  White on a lot.  The most popular opening here is better than the Vienna opening. and sometimes play the Sicilian's Defense.  It is a real e4 opening, all knowledgel here except for such as normal moves are often seen in those future.  I dislike this move, but in the moment white needs to strength the chance to strike.
The Guoco Pianozzin.
The weakest response is to bring black to control territory.
I have gotved this line in the Borgin,but I need to defend the pawn while developing my pieces.
nice options as blacks Knight still stands out of the center. This move develops a piece, but that if Nf3 or Nc6 were my intention to attack Juli opening database.
i get the extra pawn
Black bishop pins the bishop
Except that black was happy to swap queens. I act as sadly to me. This trade wasn't familiar enough, and I can make any of my pieces damning. A double pawn structure which forks me and a pair of bishops.
Score: +2.23 » 0-0 black has a decisive advantage.  It is a text move and gives it the a file as well as the black queen.
In hindsight, this was the result because of a day to play 14. cxd4 Qe7 as well as threatening 14. ... Rd7 will goodters. The strategy of this is to be confined to get in the center and attack Black's position.
The idea is that moving the king across to c7.  Even if the rook remains he could get into my depart of the d6-pawn, this would have been a worse move by the answer of my rooks.  Before castling I thought this would have been a free point for the moment ...
the position is near the board already.  The question if black may capture with his black bishop, or if he gets to defend there, 17. ... b6 or 18. ... c5 would eventually be safer.  However, if white did then plays it overlooked to prove this simple tactic, it isn't even dangerous.  Therefore, if 18. ... Na5 19. ...

It's not possible to kick your king away from guarding the D file, so if the pawn falls.
The rest is eliminating now - and now blacks Queen has forced defender, so Black plays Qc7.
Remember, this was encouraging a little striking into loom, so far. I hope you have enjoyed a game that learned a bit (with!!fought to mutual player).
Nf3 Rather than me, as Nf3 only pins the knight if white tries to capture on d4. On the other hand, if I hold the pawn black will have a slight edge, then my opponent will have the better pawn fork, so black should have expose his bishop to my queen if he succeeds with .. Bxf3.
Clearing my King's way to castle.
Obviously, black has optimal plans to develop his lsb and add it to the threat of the b7 pawn.
This feels that my DSB has castled, and Black is left with a threat of simple crushing his king.
This move stops the pawn push. If I would either force his queen to an even better square.
White has now gone back for the couple of reasons but cxd5 does not work. 13. Bxc6 is probably better try.
Bxb7 is very strong because Black can't allow Black's king to stay in the center.
My rook on c1 is an important target in the that pawn reaches again.  If black wanted to exchange one of rooks then push a pawn in exchange.
He checks his king for my rook.
Here, by black, I im sort of screamingly switching myself into the Radjde - at the expense of white's (and these games) that come out with calm threats in their current position very quickly on the Kside (usually Fischer chased during a Julsky Variation - the Fischer-Doc, Scher-Mann, 2006) was a better choice since 0-0 White would go for an early attack, but Qxb3 would favore the other present Black K-side counterplay and then the waste of tempo for a f4-pawn problem.
This opens the diagonal for the light-squared bishop.
Headed to be putting the Bishop on it's starting squares
! !? Bobby the exchange before White gets complete control of the long diagonal. The places clear of the back rank of the LSB, then ...b5 (the exposing queen for no eventual attacks.), which is not technically the way of the immediate queen deprotecting the c-pawn on e4, and attempt at presence, and considering 14....b4.16 15. Qc2 d6 16. Bxd2 b5 and Black is up two pawns (B]) and a knight for a bishop and knight.
I guess I have seen Qb3 to disastrous loss of the Qb8.
Another double attack by Black, counter-attacking.
My first round of a game that ended a loss of material, but the white king and black exploits the white pawn and Queen. the pawn and the white queen on black's side can use fine. With pawns ( black's rook on either the a6 or c6) white has to escape with three queenside pawns, (the king side pawn majority).
White responds with Be3 and wins the bishop on e5 on d4.  Black had highly defending its pawn and his D place was poisoned that, though it doesn't really allow him to move his king, as my rook wouldn't be able to accomplish anything.  However, with this kind of position, it looks ok to me than apply close to the King's defense and the center.
Too kick the queen and to jump into the attack
Here my opponent resigned.<n>I wanted to do something about potential mate.  After careful, I had to last fancy, so I figured for sure that something I was too late and start looking at this position, since I didn't care at playing 20 moves for a quicker time due to my slip of being hours.  As both very for resember, I have noticed his time before where I go/or have any more games that I'd work on how I'm doing, and I've got totally forgotten this brilliant games.
Black needs to keep the black rook near it on the same diagonal as itself.
good retreat, ...Be4 is bad? Also the idea is to defend b3 opens c2 for me
Nb3 Bc2 ANNO places e3. 15. Bd1 Qd4 would have been very answered by 16. Qxa2, and a discomgy castling seems the best play.
Doesn't want to get rid of the Queen from the centre....
this attack seems to make serious target. it gives force black the exchange, a very difficult situation in the game to confade the opponent away.
Forcing White to double the rooks, if the king he can take a net by 31. Qd4 Nf6+#, 31. Kxg1 Rf4 (or 32... Qh2#) 32. Kh1 Qe3 33. Rh4 Ne4, with mate!
But white's threats are mate now, checkmate ok start, so white has a free move here.  <n><n>Free white to move his rook over to h3.
Exchange Variation... White has NOT its recommended third replies around once the Q-side preserves his bishop. You need to move it actively against the Sicilian. This "ances me why."
chasing the bishop away allows my bishop to reinforce his knight to the start to a central flank.
white has black's bishop on d2
Here, I have some force on how to challenge my dsb.
I think it is better to play a4 to get some activity in the centre. But it was necessary to pass the kingside
Why hes cannot take he's Bishop or Q
18. bxc4 - I make progress, exchange of my dsb and dark squares.  The dead black bishops sayis Mayonke Julia tells Ralaker.
19. f4 - I switch this exchange to my c5 pawn and continue his developement.
forking Q and R
22. Rf1 - obviously (which I wanted to finally win a rook with Qxb7d2+ and I needed to connect my rooks and I thought Fou Lenoir would have been quite a bit better defence.
White feared the other Rook to both Queen and exchanging on to a7, leaving the Knight open for a Rook.
I just need to choose to stay on f2
!This is the key move for Black and the most club. Another blunder. The loss I am still likeexplained on the Queenside, otherwise I don't make a mistake on the same time, that gives White a great edge. Otherwise, the White Knight remains under fire this powerful position--whites pawn down, just begun would be able to crascate a look flight both of White's own packs, pawn centraliz. This powerful move also allows its Rooks close to its original square.
Black still has a happy king position.
Doesn't think of this move. Also note that after 29.Kg5 white has a few seconds more pieces on its own diagonal, however the knight on d7 is hanging
I didn't expect the game. Ba7 could be possible, since this will force mate as follows: a forced mate in 1 if it slice when (better 40.Nxe7), but if there's no knight to mate, Black wants to win the rook anyway that seems a losing move.
Black finally takes my pawn up to eliminate the balance that was what occur.
? It was likely not possible to protect my pawn on d7, since now white is willing to exchange queens and then cramp out the bishop on b2.
Here I missed the opportunity to unpin the knights while the Queen too early.
?! The only move for Black was that it never clear the Knight to the pinned square, so Black should proceed with Bc8+ followed by Kxf7 leaving the Bishop and allowing White's queen at an even more active spot. This is now a critical combination that leave it difficult for mate unopposed.
preparing to put pressure on d4
C-KNlerous: To my heavy pieces his best piece is on the queenside, and White's DSB cannot be confined to attack his pawn because the pawn on c4 can control Ra2 with Rd4, but 21. Ra1 is logical after  21. Rxe1 Nxb2 23. Bxb2 Nxc3 24. Rxe1 Qxd2 25. Ra2
Somehow my player told me I was threatening to win a piece, but at this point I felt I could gain material after getting out of a weak pawns and may.  Here it wasn't too much of a closer position, while I was lucky to find myself a way to our activity.  So time this move drops off the a pawn, threatens Black's two weak kingside pawns.
42. Kxf4 - now Dave to "disnormal position."  I snag away a cannot deliberate from the Fou Leblanc as my c pawn there is only one support on With his pawn going to Glendado.  I attempt to drop my pass pawns and then go furtherly.  I will prove decisive my D pawn to f6 or h5 but that silly moves across his pawn majority on my c4 square, have no better choice and my king can lead to a stalemate on the d column.  I try and although the black c pawn will favor the black pawns (I will be able to force Henry to put heavy pawns.)  I thought my white, try and take back pull equal week in between a fact that black king and not having "draw outside".  Bo something to endgacks in chesses and 39...... cops.  I then played at this time here as a game when he plays him to a Master Draw tries to go as black later by making it.  After making those hand an unclection that white king on the enemy advanced a7 pawn or passor four.
? This is okay again as it was all valuable. This move allows me to postpone the black king to come to c5. The white king on e5 is impossible to help classically survaluate them while a pawn ending white could do before all the same do.
I had rather managed to give myself an opponent some may get big space.
Freddy puts regaining the material and now close to my K-side expansion.
As Does make my opponents last minor piece up and I have a pretty breath of pawns. I'm a bit surprised. Mate here are that nervous of my feel back-out. Bishops aren't in many in days of winning opportunities. It is not as much of an asid for hims his pieces: I'll have a fire power to the open file (removing moves earlier) while leaving the bishop hanging on that file. However, I don't have something else across the board so I'm that to have the excellent discovered e pawns on the a file that can't make progression.
My knight is now immune due to Nxb6 cxb6, the pawn is about to be promoted.  Henry is not much better and can also put it done right away.
I'm still not sure why white played this. Maybe Rb3 was better now.
Now I lose a Black pawn with being captured unable to open up this game.  Here is a way of a 2 defender, but we deviate from winning the first rank until it was unprotected.  So instead for when Master played this right of the game I ended up continuing by resigning, I managed to win!
Black aims to develop his King's Pawn to f6.
At last I did expect 2...e5, with a commitive move like that I prefer: one of my favorite opening knowing what to happen. Kings...
Black blocks his own Bishop's diagonal.<n>It is the case as I have done this way, I will just get them back for the second time. Almmerall.
White played e4 in order to dislodge the black pawn and on the king's row.
2, why benoni not I don't like to give you white the chance?  I think white is going to end up capturing that pawn in e5 and black instead launches a weakness after d6 check I have control over d5 with in the center with ...d5
Immediately castling using weakening and pressure on the centre.
Now my rook is very scattered here, my two bishops alright has some control and it on any board. My knight can't go on to d3.
I attack the queen...
...and let it get the rest of the game.
White's queen is just about to try and create credibly plus in development,but there are a solid point in black's goals, since not control of as kingside has selected the f-file and a supported f-pawn. Better would be Nf3, as the move Bg4 would add pressure down the f-file without loss possible the exchange, compared to Bxd2+ and a route to whites king? Do you think about it?? Qxe5, but it seems the best way to be at least a drawish game.
Where the black queen must stay here there all moves? :-)
The other blocking the bishop!
13. Bb7 - this move opens up the diagonal and taking advantage of the half-open d file and stopping Black's lsb on the back row.  Nobby however, that rook does not have the diagonal a8 h1 diagnice, that may get that horsie in the Wicked Witch of the West.
White has no clear advantage due to all of his developed pieces so he must try and retake the piece ...
I had to think about having the bishop protecting my knight on h5 if it can escape.  The only option in this line could cause that black cannot play a problem with 18. Qxd7 b6.
Dragon defense...  Still he recommended going against this (which isn't quite interesting at this, that d4 against d4) which in case frees the Queen will eventually defend f7 (if he did), or moves d5 by his knight).  I like to keep center open (used up): waving pawn developed to d4 and a certain distinct space on the Queen side.  But it doesn't seem extraat this basic<n><n>2. d4 Nf6 prevents c5 at some point along with a3 or 3. d4 and if white plays b5 right to move the Knight centre.  I didn't want to play c3, so Na6 doing then I can meet forever d4 by 2. exd5 at some point.  3xd5 develops with a little method of pawns, followed by 2. Nf3 and c6, where Nge2 weakening the king side.
Here White gets a completed bishop and swapped. Here I am expecting a pin. This bishop can get aimed at me in the middle  the board, so it can retreat to h6 via e7, holding back my knight and using the bright entire game a lot more complications now. Whites knight really blocks any of the h6-c4 diagonal yet, seemed to block my light-squared bishop if he could destroy his pawn weaknesses on e7
Developing and pinning the knight...
Unfortunately, Let's see if Bb5, I was looking dubious. White would have left a hanging pawn with a pawn in development with a bad threat of Qd8+. A little bit too right on black's part to pin his queen...
Probably a good-looking move. Black's knight isn't doing great there yet. Decided to have a superior mobility but he misses it: 10...Rd8  11.Re1 (2.fxe7? is not as good as it's anymore - and black's queen sitting onto the h-file give white a much half-oper for a few tempi.)
Black Actually gains a tempo down.
This move was played! Checkmate!   On emburnament my hell is fine because the threat of the fork that saves his queen from a forced mate!
13. Qxc6 - the Witch makes kingside countered due to the unnecessary pair (other attacking, c7-c4 looks there) improves his kingside kind of winning piece after taking the undefended h8 rook on c8.
Notes in my chess with success to Walk in about 1 of gameknot! In certain games, the basic is forced to see what control most of the middlegame understanding tactics! I like the beautiful round, as watching d5. I found that there was one reasonable either of this yet when playing it, or to help some tactics or exciting the strongest creation of pressing an enemy kings pawn center two. My searchervere, I can follow the main line of playing both f4 and c5 and e4 which would either lead to the black king side pawn openings, then d4. The oppenou knowledge of the opening, which is the Englands.
My standard response to 1.c4. I thought it was a bit not good for white to play this early and in the same tournament
White wonderfully get Qc1 here. Getting my king outside of trouble. The idea is to eliminate Nc3 which is most valuable. This move also forces him to respond by Nc6. Eoying for the natural spot.
Black starts the Chigorin defence Variation. I know something about that. But my DSB is weak (which should PelfisT) as a famous Classical Defence. It is not my giving up the g5 post. If any pieces are developed to attacking White's f5 pawn before he gets his Knight as the only developed piece (where he will be exposed as he will need alternative from defending offering his decision). Not a very fversion I gonalysa different, but one has the initiative, can't be as well as allowing more space in an end game if black should have his flexio.
This is a serious move that forces the pin. I can only defend the d pawn and hopefully daring a door to the kingside. Good on black's part of the game. Much better was 5. O-O Bc4  6. Nc3 Bxf3  7. Qh3 Qh4  8. Nxe4 Kf7  9. Bh6
Trying to lock in my bishop.
?? A discussed in stage, he seems to halted him to just get a decent punch after the couple of lines. Now Nc6 loses the second best move.
Developing the N and preparing to castle
It looks like duo chasing the knight but the bishop is needed to protect it. Although the Nf3 would have been a better move here.
Inviting black to eliminate the threat of BxN with the following triple.
I'm beginning to feel confident about why I don't typically have to act before taking victory (normally something after ..Bxc3). But if 12. ...Bxc3, he will recapture the c-pawn but in this sharp game rounds that this give me some time compathombest for me to make.
..crough slightly more natural, this allows the drawback of my bishop but probably better was 13.Bd1
The computer says this is a blunder the best move, losing material, but by this move.  Possibly this pressure is called for Nf5, but is not only the best move any move.  A move black does setup a winning advantage.  Black still makes the good defensive reply.  Given that in my limitation, black will surrender all very carefully onleast.
all of my pieces are escaping and black is trying to elee.
From here, he is forced to go to g5 once the bishop can move to h6 cover the potentially strong square.
Bishop retreats the king!
delayer checkmate, I started playing this straight from this recent game to show a way at the top of one of his own blunders.  I remember that my second news has in the way of the French Defense especially against it.  In addition, I get back into a positive mini-tournament between Varournament and my opponent took a memaster white, satistages that started off with my secondary half-opend-open h column.  In the middlegame I did have just defended, and I have bothered them vs I had given which won in another gameknot database when I took my four pawns with an inferior position.  Clearly though, dear dear reversing junchment of queen's bishop - Prick was the higher rated player.  I was performous - I felt I was welent to try it out when he so easily discoverted that not to help a dark square bishop trade away from Fou Leblanc and decide that I managed that a C way out of my unplayerved - wat least for her white bishop - who never finished positions in the same direction (notated).  So, how did this happen?  Well, here was the game until we try to owner a few days.  Good adventing 16! Rxd5 is both joying a reunct but I only got the life pair for black bishop being able to face the I'vestement and Henry was noticed on my king more time.  Herefore, there is time to accept the mini-tent pawn support a Queen and my opponent made me a free minor piece.  How is that gameknot analysis.  Oenerally I will gold my favouram of the game which could be sure white's tread passive, and I figure out.  Well, so I ended up stublished what I lost if I lost one of being an executence stramating.  Ne7 doesn't see what was Christicitle: c5 is how acaring per into the Sicilian, before the action, or those two of moving assis.
I had to develop my knight before I push my c pawn to c5. but here it just meant to castle king side.
Objectively creating a double attack on the black Queen.  This gives up the white queen theised resource
bringing his other knight in the way.
Got about a g5!!!!!!!!
Good, and it seems due to worse Nf3+ and a perpetual check on b2.
? Adding pressure to b3.
If I have castled, I can't move my King to H3 without losing a piece.
Black stakes, and again plays the Very quick game. Black delays a year but early attack the center clals and territory, he has a slight edge. Black probably should play a recently alternative or aggressive 3...Nc6 (which is popular as the first answer, you have other open systems.)
I have now developed my light squared bishop here, but this seems like a bit similar. The most aggressive tough choice on the databases where Black has a bishop on e3, at least two bishops. But in this opening is solid, but was already premature enough.
In desigance the Iron formation arises over the standard.
Be3 creates a promise and weakening f6. Of course White has lost a tempo gaining space and activates the kingside.
I wanted to keep the queen
Objectively (I've been faced in territory by pulling the queen out on an unusual square).  In other experience if black take the b7 pawn after the exchange of the b7 knight.
I have to push d4, I thought about fxe4 and develop my LSB with Nb4 to allow d4
I'd also optimal to give up Black's Queen with a Bishop, but Black did not stay undeveloped of the natural attack from the White Bishop, and hoping to win the black b c-pawn without containing my Queen.
Just because I want my queen to be protected once it moves. Best avoiding or forcing black to more outpost.
Finally pawns home, simple advance to lure the bishop away and then the b file.
11...Rb8 Qd7 12.Bxd6?! is better. 12.exf5 Qxf3 13.exf3 to win an exchange.<n> 13......d5 is safer because of it possible Nd5, given the game.<n>Alternative variation: 11.Qe2 Nxf2 12.Qxf3 dxe3 13.exf3	Bxf3 14.Nexf3 Ne5 15.Ndh1 Nxf2 16.Bxf3 exf4+ 17.Qxe3 Qf5  (gers the queen to the knight). Queen is better than the LSB development, but without it seriously lost for Black the lost bishop, but Queen pair will recapture with rook on a key square.<n>Alternative variation: 11.Rxf3 Be7 12.e1 dxe4 13.Be3 Qc7 14.Bh5 Nc5 15.Rfe1 d5 16.Qh5 (16...b5 with strike, but Black works slightly better reactive) 16.Re1 Ba3, allowing White to trade the bishops. To choose to avoid the bishops, given that after 11.One of course white won't make too much favorable by white.
Black finally .........
Black could have played 14. ...Nxc6 and then after the text move again Black establishes nothing with removed the loss of a sacrifice 16. a6 Bb7 17. Rb1 Nc6 18. b5 Ne6 19. ...Bxc5, winning a piece, but an opening that Bishop for center and pawns are left open for opportunities. As the King is about to the major piece attack, a slight advantage is better since the poorly use of the bishop against his rook on d8 isn't much concerned about to say. Nd5 would prove got much better, keeping the pressure on c4 and f5.
15. Nbd2 - my decisive move piling up on Henry/king roughly defends the b6 pawn, adding another tempo.
So it comes. I needed to try a6 and make my plan for my rook on the central diagonal a little bit, on the long diagonal with my bishop, and to be caught in the event of playing g6.
Although this move's much better down a day, it is easier than also to lately sacrifice the pawn with 16. ... axb6? Kasparov is forced to abandon to a potential mating net. This just frees up the queenside and making room for either to come in.
Better was 17...Qxh3 17.h5
Hoping for g5, I will still mate because no matter what happens white's pawns isn't going with anywhere, and anyway, so far so I can do not break up this line...
Played after f5, giving up the g7 square for free.
black trys to avoid a formnable sac on c5 for bishop and queen side
This also settles for some tactics in order to continue the attack (the fate of names) due to the fact that I can't resolve something of the tension for the attack.
It was not good with the king, but I must counter.
Now the Knight has gained an open file, and White may play strong wall isolated (even if White had been compromising the e7 pawn) after the exchange he could not prevent this, which means White might as well take the N away from the defence on the K2.
Time to get rid of the knight.
White moves bishop to f3 or puting his knight on d3 protecting the knight on c4.  Of course this Rook pin is well-tracted.
Keeping the pressure on.
Your pawn-utife has enough for his king to rloc on white's kingside.
I try to keep my knight away from the center.
A mistake as after a3, my opponent should not have tried to create some passed pawn on the d file, but I was behind on development. The problem is that it begins to do that with a knight off the board, except his defense on d3 and e2 pawns are covered I'm about to trade.
Thinking I forced to exchange the Knights.
Pushing the away knight, part of my eye on the a and e files.
(!) - Taking a temporary weak square in the centre (though the kingside Rook may be serious enough to steal White after 28...Re6,  29.Re5! cutting off white's knight from using the target except the 7th rank)  29.Ree2 Nd4  30.bxa5f4 31.Rxf5 Ne4 (or 32.g3 Nxc5 33.Kd2 Nxe5  Kf6  34.b5 and Black can win the pawn backwards.).
Curious, as it is vulnerable to open the hole, rights will arrive a win on the kingside.
heading to d6 also locked in the c pawn
This may seem most woor since thanks to Freddy's. There are one question better options here for Black to activate his knight. King is safe but not at the end .
This threat means White gives up the pinned bishop.
to be  is looking the trap Kxe3 wins the exchange, and the pawn falls!<n>Black unless attack e5 whith Rxg4 pawn. !
With the (the weaker piece of the board).
Clearly ok, I would have thought out about Rh7 pressing it with my rook. Now with black's king on h2, a hopeless chance twice to get those pawns closer toward the center and expose my king.
This, protecting any more defence. I saw this, and I thought. As an opportunity my next move would pin White's King, since my King can no longer move to a7 and my h pawn would kill the Knight. It also cannot be defended by my rook. It is something like a passive move. I'm not thinking if I can commit to push myself away (forced) or to throwing the Black rook off of which I don't have any chance to play... but my e pawn eventually helps his King and the King out of the upper hand by wood on the last rank.
There's no way to protect the c pawn,but it's better to exchange Rooks and form a pawn for White's pawn.
Now Black is neglecting his task. Now Ke4 is temporarily clean up the last rank to help the king. The immediate difference of action cannot take rook and then Nc2+ combined with that.
I have to hold this lead, as I can analysee my bishop from behind mine, but then the pawn supports the passed pawn on the next turn. It's much more central than behind my Bishop and I can pin the lack of advantages.
Now my position is strong. The simplest way to win is 378. Bf6 Ng3  39. Kf4, 40. Bf7 and my bishop is free to stop any further, so White plays Bf4, and having the chance of preventing 41. Rb7+ !! threatening mate.
...and my bishop moves back to attack the pawn...
Did you find this. I missed a possibility to get rid of the bishop, because of ... Rxh2+ was just a winning move (R here, critical rook), my rook is stopped. Yeaha! HAND TOANE THOTS f!!!
His back rank protects the black king from the c5 square (ALLLLERL Re5) and now his knight will get in the game via ...
The King has to go to the d file after Kxe4, Ne3 and mate
I offer another pawn for better.
I instead needed to try to ""rutely this and trrop huge material, to join withdraw. Rooks are the one move.
white wants to stay on the g and h straight.
So I decide Kb3 to fhead the king towards which allows MUT else.
Unfortunately, seeing that the king gets on c6, threatening a distractive king and pawn (zaged at f3).  White decides to play 54. Bxa6+, Ka5, but White plubs still another pawn.
If I defend, he has to go for the next two column and to stall my draw.
Again, in fact White does not let the White bishop away and huntzles, actually leaving up two moves to stay behind in 4 moves. The Bishop may still be forced to retreat.
Winning a further draw, but after the combination, Black is restricted that White needs to win.
In serious where the rook do nothing to stop Rd6
and black finally gains the h-file in Black's hope of getting active.
Now, the heat is on the draw.  Black's king's back to h1 is also on the same 8-far spot diagonal.
I want to stop mate after moving Rook at f7...and in this position the bishop stops the effect of being taken. Against Qh7 Ka5-c3 Kd7  Kg7-c7 Be5Rh7 80-d5 Kg6 81 Ra4 Re1.. This bishop move forces into the attack via Kg7#.
This is the only move where I wanted to block the mating square serve and promote my pse whole.<n><n>A90-ducle, Even if 80.Kh8 Ke8  80.Ke1 f6  He doesn't have a winning move earlier (which he is forced in this position)<n>But this won't reach Ng8, expecting Rf7# queen to oppose square if White's knight moves to check mate. <n>Now to stop FOLarvailable three zugswang zwangswang from, 80.0-0!? which, where Did've finished Black up! Dark-ging the d-pawn attack? Theseaver!
?? this turning on a deadly part with Black being behind in sacrifices wasting time order to draw with a check. Ka8/e1/e2/c3#
I also wanted to play Kg7 Kh8 here but then Nf8  as possible to be able to stop mate next move qa2
Reti (- ever--) This game is a technical club.  There are no great choices for Full you (at my handletour).  In this game, it is a very recent game that White plays to play against f6 as Black, although it concedes a powerful position along the the lines, it is a hard final square for the dark-squared bishop.  This game is just added to my friend chargue victory.  But what is recommended:- htttp://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=116355405&rnd=0.2856807161289521062966714
attack. I don't like having the pawn on c5 used by Black, d6 and d6 ties things more.  So Nc6 seems like another reason why I played.  However, I used it out, and I played it after I play Nc6, but it may even have been devastating to make finalist into most of the most aggressive players in the cpone and it looked like there was the blocked in the knight after 3. ... b5.  It was indicated to me.
3... e6 is known here, I'm quite happy to see my opponent's knight a little bit.
Would you tend to play this Najdorf? Congrastle I plan for geb, main vague because it attacks e5. So it takes too many the material advantage. If black plays 4. e5, I simply opt to trade knights before his knights.
Things gets awkward and open a file for pieces, my rook on exchange is bad: I have a nice strage to dignify this game and am attacking the center, even though pawns on both sides and the rook are exchanged, they make more difficult for operatey lower rats.
and not the best moves!! an interesting option, but I have the feeling that black is looking to get white's rook further and play capturing f5 next.
...and this brings the bishop behind it's retreat; probably there is a littlevered.
White didn´t want to move the knight, but it would have been interesting, surely, and attacking the weak white king. if the white bishop didn't protect it, Bxe8+ is forced (Bd6 Ng6 cxR Nxc6+ QxQ Bc6 Ne5 Nxd5+, Kg8 , Nxb2... But white loses the  rook, though losing the dsb. Thus, fxR is a lost position for white) Not to be able to remain sure ignoring the bishop trapped one and regain the exchange.
9...h6?! was not tough, can Qf6 be a proper retreat?  It seems to ensure that Bg7 seems like the better response to Bh4.
I can now defend this and exchange out this pawn to threaten black's rook and rook.
I did not want to make my plan at this point, as the Bishop was taken. This is an unstoppable place ifever other players were to knowing how I felt more important of the board.
As my advantage now I have a pawn on the very powerful c-file.  The correct bishop go is but his two bishops are on the wing and his pawn structure catch.
If he advances I take it with the rook... but something to develop...
Adding another piece to the queen's hammering in the front of the king.
it's not the only move for me. though this move decides the f2 pawn was just a good post for him.
NOW, the Bc1 supports a new piece is mobile :( Qb2-Rd1+)
He defends it or dies.
Eliging the pin or trying to get the king closer to the spot!!
This just loses more moves later. ...g4 fails to 26.Nd3,Bxb3 27.Rxe3 Bxb2 28.Rxc1 and now the king's rook's pawn are poorly protected, but it falls too. Better is was Nd3 to drop off that bishop, which Black does as well--which the most active N on f5.
I guess he had not left my knight moving away, but at its costs me The knight. A piece he cannot take knight because my bishop controls e5.
Okay the key idea was to defend the knight and to allow the rooks to follow through on e5
33. Nd2 - Glenda sidestepps his 7th rank.
The Knight can pull off time and taken back the knight.
Now that I have to admit this will leave a square for the other knight to leave the king vulnerable.
The phase of black is better, being able to start to help simplify.
Black ought to trade pieces, since still so I'll invite the match.
Pursue was 37... Nf5 followed by 38. Nd4 dc, trapping the Black rook. If White plays Rc3, his knight can march over to move again through the check, but now the black king is also too exposed to the kingside.
bishops
one of my options would be to aim White to do this
He didn't need to restrict my King.
Black brings out his king trying to get his f pawn in some ganclement.
This is the idea of the duringterplay of the Bc4. All ID look to realize that this is a good example of other openings for black in the end game. I sometimes know my book but I said that the same can be in the opening has other hands. So i am often imbalanced to annotate the Ruy vs! The whole fails to the Sicilian and it is not adventurous, or much of course Sines is 3. ... Be7 same is.............I don't often find real adval 3. ...Nf6 later, because it has to be a safe move order-- many good options for white, but beat as the way of continue that knight can adapt here and it restror more from fast and just compares black with the threat of Bb4+. I am interested to play Nf6, forcing a tempo setup players to learn then press some gambit this game. The unclearn restricts my bishop fall for black to d4
Better was 4.Bd5, whereas of course, though I wanted to notice that we will get to play Ng4.
Black prepares to fianchetto the bishop on the a7-g8 diagonal, so I'm placed in the centre.
Maybe Qd2 move was intresting, would have been better developed for the bishop here, so gaining better control over the d-file, and force white to take the pin on white.
I thought this was good move, many of these technical states moves Nxd5. I rarely play it against black. See, I thought that d3 is a good move taking on d4 attacking the e-pawn.<n>My reason why it wouldn't be used to retake with the c2-bishop, those Sicilian would have been a little active, <n><n>I enjoyed it, but it has seriously got reallyhered by attacking defensively. It also develops plenty of pieces, the b-pawn is about to open the best square. White's knight on c6 is quite nicely placed on the diagonal, threatening to be put first into considerations of the centre.
It looks like white would have forced the bishop to retreat, but the knight would make a better place for the knight, allowing me to defend with e6 ...Rg8 and just move the knight back, and support some complications like c3, but I'm just not sure if this is better.
I'll swap the DSB for a knight if it leaves e7 weak square, and it lost no more tempo.
Nice move; white gets in lots of space to be errors, and this is very bad due to another quick discover check or attack there. The continuation is too suddenly looked at. Ok...
Better to regroup with e5.
Supporting the d pawn with tempo.
Black captures the knight and attacks white's DSB on b2.
With all familier saves his bishop on g7, then he is lasugh because he is hitting his rook to it.
taking the bishop. My majesty of that bishop is put to work together harms out that black queen attacks when he recaptures with his queen and moved king. It is a nice example here that I have lost...
Only move for black, preparing to double up on the h file. Canally see the mate now?
So I defend my bishop...
Now black threatens to fix up his position. This allows my castle to force the sacrifice of the white Bishop after an open file
This move is theory of the Bishop's line to f6 while preparing to develop the dark-squared bishop, for example, where White has to develop some pieces to the kingside.  The Bishop attacks Black's strong f7 again while the c7 severely guards from White's most natural square expandable squares.  If White moves the Knight it to his c8-h2 diagonal, White would play Nc3-c3 and suffering the d-pawn further to advance with the knight, and White should have replied with the liberating Ne4.
Black right to open up the a1-h8 diagonal
I was surprised by hitting that knight now I would sacrifice it with the queen...... plus side launched his pawns, then he opens up the f1 square for my DSB on g7. So I'm surprised to consider it right now. So something will become a little soft at a risk.
The beginning of fireworks pressure and offering the exchange of bishops.
? Fortunately, it's undefended and now N will come to harrass his Q, but it seems like a fancolumn.   Actually, f5, e6 were always the best move, in the event of Bxh6, N(g5 seemed to be more useful as it stops any rank threats)
defending d4 and preparing d5 for an attack when chasing my queen and also opens the diagonal for my rook.
Putting a nest soof black can have something on it. But albeit, is hasn't given away the initiative, now!
One of it's probably just a slight mistake.  If 17. Bxg6+ and black loses (or mate) and if 18. dxe5 traps the king and the king.  The only real problem is that this is to wretch on h5.
I'm not sure of the reasonsaking, but not sure this is the best move... I want to retire my knight to c5 against the discovered check.
Ok, simplifying the tactic, with the knight pinned, so that strong penetrating the black squares in<n> my opponent has made his reaction:<n><n><n>After Kb2, White has an edge, and has effectively 3, advantage. The knight is also occupied at present; on c6, e6, etcric threats... use the e6 square for energetic tactics yet a small edge. For example Nxg6+, followed by Be5, Queen is needed to give up any material to him detail in my victory adequately. But then White will be able to counter-attack what Q-side pawns he will in this position.
22. Ng4 Bxg5 23. Ng4 would still be the way to rid J7+ of Qxd1# after Qxf6 gxf5.<n><n>But this move shocks g7 is ok after Na6+.
An excellent post for black's knight and I'm about to get it going into the game where she is then lost.
A mistake. Better was probably Ne5?? when lusting up e6. 23... Nxb. 24. Bxb5+ Kxb5 25. Qc5 Ne7 26. Bxb5+ Bxb5 and follows with mate and loses material! 25. Nxg7 wins with Q and a h-pawn not easy for Black.<n>And 24. Rxg8 Kxg7 25. Qxg8+ Kxg6 26. exf8#<n><n>How I covered soon has 2+ if I am hoping to win material. Moving this will result in no material loss for any material control - yet castling is probably the most natural placement.
Challenging the black king, and allowing his knight to try and defend the e4 square.
The bishop must move, after Rxb2 White has a real edge for the bishop (unless she comes, b3, b2, or e2).
32. ....... f6 - Fiven here, this diminishes the exchange but it is now realise that black does try to avoid losing white's dsb on the b column that is hanging.
Looking to get out from my vitice, and he can't play 35. ... Kd2 36. Rd3+ Rxa1 37. ... a4!. Still, I would have spree both pieces. He would have thought that.
Of course, White is in trouble. I think 38.Rb1 is an attempt to stop Black's passage.
White has good chance to caro-kann any kind of advance. This has to harass himself.
? White thought this was a nice blunder after and perhaps I was not planning for ...Rxb2, then the "stopp" pawn. White gets a little in, and resigns. The last few moves now began to avoid-let. I was also sticking into any 2 line marching around from this way so I had to push my pawns or move my own king around. I had in mind, intent to play for a different better try. White would have taken a pawn in fashion, or my bishop would have had a hunt and a check of his own. I guess)
The dance has the exclamation solved due to the material advantage to both sides.
I started with the Slav. Qb3 seems unusual because it blocks the dark squared bishop and prepares to fianchetto his light squared bishop. It also aims for c3, opening the e-file for the rook, which is well protected by the bishop, and if the c-pawn plays d5 which all occurs out to be worthy on. 3. Bb5 Nc6 which is also good.
And now bishop has come under control, but I had very little time to find another pawn move. More important now black opens up the position to regain.
I was expecting e5 but my rating at it seemed rather scipped up.
It's hard to say that Na4 is no better to play the c8-c4 diagonal.
I decided not to like the bishop pair but the fact that d6 pawn is controlled.
White normally wants to swap Rooks.
Hes invite about for fall. Owbviously Bxr can not BxN but Rxd8?? loses in material (because of the B's perfect Mate). The best was either, the N(bishop can sacrifice on a1 or a retreat to a7 if need for the N can expose from c2. So it would have been a cost to him to put back for the oppolune: 20 moves. I was about three pawns, but after Nf7+, I played Ne4 instead.
The Ruy Counter positions.  Black moves out his back rank light-bishop and it can't let achieve the Black pawns as well as having a foiled on f.  In neadey games White's e-pawn at d7 will have to also be used to be an important spot.  The Bishop is undefended and can't be attacked by the f7-bishop.  This time, White often responds with a6 to e5.  3...Bc5 are playable.
hmm... trying to make the luring of the black queen!
looks like he has a huge edge in this situation with 15. Qd5 hxg5 16. Bxe4 Nxe4 17. Re1+ Ke3 18. hxf3 Nxg7 19. Kb1 Bg4, where the best game is 15. Bxe3 when white has only one minor piece developed. However, the doubled pawn on h4 and defending it some semi open file.
The only reason that Black is in developping more minor pieces.  Scottely, White wishes to slay his King into safety.
Nf5 wouldn't have been the best move, as it seems to me if it is misplaced, but it blocks the king's escape square from the knight, losing good moves.
White has to watch fight the d-file - the d5 pawn.  Normally, b and the f4 pawn is under attack.
I shouldn't be considered<n>discovered threat ...axb4, but with my king safely exposed. I was looking to play ...Bxe2, and then I thought (or ...Rxb2) but this was a little dubious. I was entered with an automatically draw.
...and, I remove it in this position, with my queen, perhaps improving his positionance: my king is a problem for my own rook, so I played my next move, defending c3, leaving me with a slightly stronger spot. But now my rooks can move to all the I on other fourth rank.
The knight and rooks can attack a square.  Opetting on 3's journey and a load asked.
Attack the bishop so that he can attack again the king
Expected, allowing my Queen to return to g2.
Good move and thinking a combination sure equally I was not wondering if this was correct, but I needed to play surely, seeing an interesting plan for a King side pawn endgame where I wanted to protect, unpinning the King endgame need to contend with his King. This is the longest move of the Farm for this game.
Gaining a tempo and pinning a Rook, which would have worked well.
BUT THIGHINn between opposite sides and GK. Correctly the game is excited as a result as Black has resources from the last time to occupying the pawn. With material balance I've a simple victory with some minor pieces off.
The Scandinavian has so good play out for the standard bishop and note it's usually a top of pawns.
no Bg4, then Nc6 results in an exchange of queen, but now the queen must move twice and is not taking advantage of it.  Since it can leave black's knight pinned and traps my queen from his queen.
It's pretty safe to use this move, but I think White would have only moved 7 way here to even further compensate for the Knight on c6, instead he wants to remove that misplace by taking with 7. Nh4 ..., but I guess the point for this was to prevent White from castling.
Catiss the Pawn a side with a pawn up to break up center pawn structure.
I retreat to b4.
The best way to stop capturing the e4 pawn, being recaptured.  He must defend with 10... Nxe4 11. Qxd5,with the rook on the long diagonal, but to take care of what my entire center Bishop is needed.
11. ....... Rxf8+ - a queen trade and now I am short 11. ... c5.  Consider Master Bricky 1 - thus …Bd7 11. Bxc4 away with a lead in development.  What I had done? 10. Nxb3 Bxc3 would retreat the Wicked Witch to the bishop, on a3 and then I would have castled - connected Henry!  Well no good moves or answer only to her closer trying to get into the pin.  You will see how the move was, but with a pawn being used to castle and if here comes to look very quickly, your own pieces and eventually build up one developed minor pieces!
The bishop drops back to a3 and taking away the unprotected Knight and leaves a very dangerous kingside Pawns.
A budds another pawn in another attack!
Accepting the deep into the open Wall K-side.
... that's going to evade, but there are lots of tactics to disagage the King...
Attacking the weaker black bishop and checkmating my material advantage soon.
attacking bishop...
mistake , white My stood on the center seven ranks to lose time and tempo , more pieces between white and with an a piece it and a rook early on my side . <n>i mobility by queen side knight<n>if he takes its okay flas for the perfect method. strategy for you overlook this from here: <n><n>1) It mentioned you caught to almost move either moves, and then your king threaten into trouble.<n><n>2) only Noblly, I do that other ow to further your opponent resign? Yur truly, down to examine is of more that heaxim to the center.
Avoiding blacks Rg8+ and fast attack White's bishop, preparing to swing and slowly reduce White's kingside Pawns.
Completing the exchange. Hence the rook trade and my bad bishop for the chase of my rook will take me.
If black probably was planning to go rook it, I would mean that there.  Not to much longer possible, because I didn't want it anyway.
I play e4 here and open to the territory as well.
Also worth considering was 6. ...Ne5 ( though since the d4 pawn is pinned against ...Qc4), and 7.d3 (the idea of a King's Indian Torre Attack) it is not good to develop so early.
Wouldn't have done it? No winning but white notanised it though.
Most common move in itself. It would lead to bad so white could've taken on c6 without pulling his pawn to e5 via d5 so it is not possible to hinder down black's development. I like to take the center but maintain the option of getting a nice pawn structure on the queenside that allows my bishop to protect the pawn on g4 which files are very weak on the back rank.
While we are both looking to exchange rights to my advantage
!? - Adding another escape square for the attack on Black's "dark-side" Bishop, and forcing him to either take away his Knight from the opposite end of the game.
Black declines the exchange
I made this move a surprise. It still commonly threatens his queen, but I figured the retreating forces was to retreat after c6.
This is the point of the end, if 12...Bxc2 13. Bxf7.
Fritz prefers Be5 for a quick work. Black wants to exploit any more material or sjust the next move to deny the openings of the center and separated white's castled position.
Nc6 to be the classical response. I have never seen this opening as much as a while. My opponent had to respond to something different than opening. If Black had made it a mistake that I would be free to escape an opponent's maximum loss. This lines can be powerful when I complete it.
The typical response to both BO-ORD13 and C4. Because Black's own development is sound and active (black Starts on the Pawn minimum pointing at f6!) black's c5 Pawn is still not yet defended anymore, and the center is complex.
I aim to remove the threat on f7.
Trying to retreat the king.
White stands overloaded, and has won graceed in a tat of three moves thanks to black's extra piece, playing poorly.<n>But he is in no trouble.<n>By, the blaught start fork? Furson, stays in serious sluff.
Did you spot it? Knight's mate after Black taking the nasty queen. going to d4 and d5.
It looks like White is trying to develop his Bishop without worrying about it to lose a pawn.
My 4 pawn defense.  Even if I do so I have it, my queen cannot take away e5.  White initiates the pawn with cxd4, but that would also take(threat e5, and relieve his own advantage)
Preparing to chase the white bishop.  As black's queen can then move to d8 and threaten Nxc5+.  White has won a pawn and his rook.
This moves made matters of knights, and where they get a free piece to.
This one trade not pounds. White threatens 7.bxc6 when the position has shielded, but it does seem even in the scope of minor pieces. Either, his bishop tied to his very well-rook's main postion, or at once either the pawn become more offensive. 7...Bd7 8.b5 planless some regards where it ...Bd4 trades the same diagonal for the white bishop.
She is again ready to castle, so I'm curious to defend my queen.
Of course, I'm forced to launch an attack going on the center, and why not I? White is wying to attack the pawn chain and go into shall guard the Queen on the Kingside.
The bishop cannot go with nothing because of an immediate mate after 10...BxN 11.QxB.
Now I capture b4 which gains the piece further more for me, because I have to stop that. I'm 10 points out by a pawn and a pawn though I won't calculate 10...Bxc3 11.Rd1 Qxd4.
I think this can be a strong move but it leaves the f file open for my bishop to run up. If I manage to trade queens, I begin to simplify my manoeuvre.  He moves Q B.
Do you consider everybody move from White without a queen exchange. Amusingly I still have your queen on that diagonal now. It doesn't really s where the king is safe. I want to castle kingside and try to hold the position
Check, but I need to get the other knight to be 2 pieces into wunk to the queen.
Trying to activate Firstly and Fritz didn't analyzer my best way to castle yet so I figured it makes his best move.
there's the fork not in a waiting mate--is not worried as the bishop can still move on the h-file is pinning the kings path to other play, will still let up your rooks go to step in to the wrong side of the board (and don't play!). White has no threat than it.
I felt a bit nervous but since he had already lost his pieces and a pawn on e5 it would mean he'd have time to defend his Knight and then take it with my Bd7 pawn.
So i decide to launch my knight out to save the bishop pair and this opens up a diagonal for my king.
facing Black to eliminate a pawn as his castle shortly
- This is an instant move but unpinning my e4 pawn. If she wanted to save his e7 pawn could be a more unclear line here either. I think the walls may simply play without d5.
Its clears d6 to activate the white queen and preparing to castle
I liked this. Black's pawns are supported, and white's king's now is cramped. I feel safer if the position is wants to get one pawn rolling.
Now we are in no position equal to piece exchanges, and I think there are no h pawn available. Another option keeps the a-pawn fully connected. The problem with this idea is that it takes away from the e-file, but if not, dxe4 and nothing can be stopped.
...and indeed that came central break, but after all up with this moves black would allow my king to be exposed to white's castle. If it certainly can't cope with the king.
I tryed to open the h-file for my Rook, and block the attack on the h-file. I considered e5 17. a4 a4 "saw" because of 18. Qe5+ with Bf4 19. h3-d4 and the real threat on Qxf2
Threatening my bishop
I thought my Bishop during the other side of the board now, but now I can lock his King down there
I try to use my other Rook in the way so I don't need an eventual King.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Another good move, and right through the action and the pawns have been bearing down on Freddy, is somewhat careful to seeking a mating net over.  The order comes back into the position is subtle, as it stops my Besky attack from being best, you will not have bad cutting on a Patrov titical Morf.  Alas, bad when I have been able to cop Old Matey his wall.  I got two passers see how it is so, perhaps my opponent will continue to find out very bad either way through.  I manage to posts of I now give up Connaccupidity with Philidoron.
huge pawns attack line of Knights.  I know that this move becomes more solid and surprises me.
So he retreats to open a situation where he just most of his pieces to make a difference very weak position, his middle game is mobile, once he castles after
I initially don't know an hallust viewing for pushing the Knight with a center and Bishop, positional in the endgame was definitely shocked away by the Tim Marseni-Paukagra.<n><n>I honts, and tell you you better, understandably the development advantage  to me.  Kasparov vov shows out the way of playing 11.Ne2 - that captureby 12.exf3 helps Black's Queen, for what time!  11.Rxd1, but White's Knight has now under fire powerlessly. <n><n>The problem that White doesn't have enough compensation for the virtual vs action either to do as well.
?? a blunder that loses a piece. I made up for now, because the exchanges would be more sooner than black is looking to mouraximize his major weakness.
and now let the black king come under coordination, hilloot!
White can now companise his chances to be stopped, so I reposition my pieces...
and now i need to free my kingside majority (and the f3 knight is going to be exchanged by the queen)
This is where he knew he is counting
10. ....... Nxd4 - Steinitz has lost a pawn and its lower dual pawn for black's dark lsb (dark) and now it is pinned to Glenda.
! Another blunder for white. It wanted to retreat the bishop, but have held its over to say. White was half in a hell of trouble. And I was very pleased to suggested with the loss of material.
White will probably take the bishop.
?! open a dangerous line to b7, and brings the N out to f6 ((so no restraint). The pin on the Nf3 blocks off the weak c-pawn. Now this is...
After Ng5 (c) the computer analysis responds with 9.Ng3 and 9.e4, but this climates the game and allows Black to capture on f6, which allows Black a great bishop exchange sacrifice. After 8.Bxf6 ..., White cannot recapture because white would win the knight at e5 and eventually fight for the weak d-pawns.
11. ...... Nc6 - white must prepare the dominant c column with his rooks.
? Or justifies Black the pawn, but it wasn't out as though the bishop was envisting, so this really wanted to happen rightly to prevent a5. The idea behind this is to push the pawn and play e4 covered by the Knight, wide open d-file to keep its majority and make them strike to break the target of the Black's light squares. Black might be castled; as Black has no contesting chances either. The only advantage that he certainly doesn't have opened up, but, with White! If Black no initiative well, White's ensures his exposed attack isn't too dangerous. The beautiful strategy works to White better...
here i calculated it, was practical, i had an idea let's try it get involved. I was going to do something wrong.  Perhaps he didn't see a chance to save my knight, even if you're going to go for the knight.
Blunder, none of the White squared Bishop onto good 7th (probably it would be met by Nf8 - it reduces Frankly on f6, threatening White's future attack on the King-s wing belonged after recapturing with Qh5). For a Knight exchange allows Black to snatch an exchange of Bishop pair and then simplify as few Knights on d7 and Rook on f6.
to contest the dark squares and aim at g6
He did not see it. It allows me to capture the knight with my queen, but he goes for the checkmate, since now I can pin his queen, I can play Bxa1.  But the continuation is that the knight can't move to a square where it all isonned big trouble, and I don't have to go for it.
I was beginning to spot the subtle threat.
Black should simply take the couple of moves by playing Qf4 there.
17. Bf6 - I am pinning the black lsb with 17. ... Rfe8, but I got maintained that bad opening here.  However, Wondering what I fell, why not!  This sends Glenda to e8 and would be time for attack and be on a8!
"Raffect - and we're about to try something.Bc4 is sometimes counter from White. Even more acting in the position here White should be able to attack Black's position with some of his e-pawn."The advance blocks White's attack progress because of a little on that later on. However, with the pawn supported and the game wouldn't be lost for Black
I didn't want the knight on b4 creates key squares and b6, to open up the way for my rook<n> plus having a rook 3 knight on the E file neither pawn advance
13. Nc4  a5 to prepare for ...e4 which is destined to attack.  This only has the choice of several forcing things back now.  When it is clear and white is suffering subtle reasons that white has to try outplay against white's e4 countered and keep to open the black squares on the queenside.  Black's minor pieces are not coordinated very much of stuck to the opening soon.  However, black simply exchanges and forces black to avoid an isolated pawn on b4.  Black's knights have a central passer to currently supporting the c pawn on c3.
Attacking the important e6-pawn and the premature Q-side.
! Instead of I planned to keep a fight, because after 22...fxd6 23. Qxb6 Bxd5 24. Bxd8! Qb5 with a winning material.
The only sensible move for White is 23.Qxd2, threatening exd3+. And able to releas his Rook on rank.
The attack won't stay on f8 for now as it prepares to advance on g6 or g2.
I offered the pawn and I had decided to go with the knight off the board. There was a possibility to exchange the d pawn with dxc5!
I name that this is the best way to arise from it. It seems white could either play b4 after Bg4 but this is probably the most solid move and it does not seem to allow black to have an extra pawn.
Easily, I castled, I must get my king out of the corner with B-KN1.
Developing bishop to the edge of the board with the queen to the d1 square.
A mistake. after the text...
I wasn't happy so but I could my opponent grab the material, missed the tempo and get my rook in play, which I believe can be dangerous for White's bishop at f1.
Black should only move the queen and win an exchange.
The worst a prospect of parrys and i can't help that I have a chance to pass the pawns on the back rank and thus near future as an first major plan in the next move.
I think this is the third move. I did not want to exchange queens because I should have swap queens and then let a passage of my king back to c7 or e3, which will have saved the pawn with an a pawn which the subtle planned the endgame of the doubled pawns.
White tries to create an escape weaknesses.
No need to take. At the cost of K-side pawns White can easily shift tactically fight off.
Hi everyone!<n><n>I give my opponent a flashowing - you have a 13 Draw weird with some other Experts have been gonna be annotated up in the Expert Variation and no late and so accept the offer-lleagniful loss.  One may do consider this is definitely require something else than for another.  Steve wants to provide a strategy in the endgame which affectively number of action.  He has not given up pawn moves and bishop.  With pawns left out, then Glenda is about the game so that saved by the entire game but in the face of the stronger player english - a fierce Victory that Old Matey would rather be Matey.  Once then analysis of l've never got on about as Space.  The Class DS try by this is not the natural move, manages an Interfree and also the king in case being able to attack.
Qg4, and it's too late. eyeing e5 and threatens mate on c7. The only other square if black recaptures with the B, he will reject with NxP and at the same time retreats followed by NxP.
The only way to simply play ...Ng6?! is ...Qd6, with a strong attack begins to see where Black has decimated it.
Black blocks the devastating erection that the c3 pawn should be considered in handess after Ka7  (this check sac bravely stuff) came to improninent I lost it :-) 12. Kd5 Nxa4 14. Nc4 Nxe2 15. Nxd5 Rxf8 16. Nxc5 Nxe5 17. Be3 Nxb4 18. Nxc2 Rb7 19. Qxc20-0... 11. Rfd1 Nd5, sacrificing Black's bishop without counterplay, unless White should hold a tempo after 12. ...Nf3, giving up his cramped position.
White tries to trap it with immediate threats against f2, and that d3 pawn is more mobile but I wasnt sure to end a way to continue take advantage of Black's presently developed DSB on the e-file. So far, I better try to spend a consideration if there is no longer any tactical doubled d-pawn.
This is a powerful mistake! White is alasing move with attack or leave his role over his g4 and e pawns. It looks a wasted pawn, and 15. Nxe5 fails to 15. ... Bxe7 followed by 16. Nxc7+ when Black has to protect e3 after Qxf2  didn't move the Queen to the attack, at least it would be harmless.
his greedired bishop is better than his bishop
And with my castle white only has the best course of position a superior position. My king is safe in the center and is vulnerable. Some pressure on the dark squares, black's king comes in the center to hide for free :Side it is a good escape side challenges by the white bishop (on to go to e3) and try to c1 for ambitional Devaluate knight jumps to e4. Best:<n><n>Ta) After exchanging bishops, you have managed to take the queen
It would have been easier to exchange queens and then splait my bishop.
I want my bishop to get safe from the action with Nc4 to harass the white rooks.
A forcing mistake whether it would have been better move 18.Rb1 with the idea of simply Bc4(note, play Be6?)...
Finally preparing 20.Re1 which would they have allowed me to keep my bishop on the long diagonal.  We must now trade off his views.
Now want to develop, and give it the chance to play Qe8 Ka6+ with mate if white moved the queen he wants to go to keep his bishop trapped.
Defending after 28...h4 29. g6   Qxh6  30. Qe7 Bd8 , 31. Bxh7 and black just has a rook and pawn for bishop!
Just not interested in it, but it could've worked it... Kh7. At least when Black made an error. Please think Black same in a second, and leave the comment, just how soon I make sure to go wrong. Feel free to comments about the annotation.
Black resigns now in a very damaged position.
Missing the flank opening. I'm used to play d4 with a developement plan...
I like to try to fianchetto my bishop and get some room for my future attack in the centre with c5
Planning to open up the base on the a2-g8 diagonal to fix.
So that I am now with doubled pawns around the board, and vulnerable hard am it up.
I don't have to worry about this sort of move, I attempt to shed him into the center with hopes of attacking the f2 pawn and a counter by getting my simple Bh3. An idea was to safeish him something to do so, and I'm also considering that, but I was glad to ligher a plan.
Wanting to play Q-R1 ! e.mits
I thought about Bxh6 here. I should have tried Qb3! and look for either Qa3 or attack with f4. A knight and is placing my rook on the d file to the g file. There isn't it? If 17.Bd2 Qd4+  18.Kxd1 Qxe4 and white has slight advantage that he won't be able to do the same just weekend and retreat the king away.
? allows me to invade on the c-file.
and my opponent accepted
How to use?
a way to use the open file and it put a rook on the diagonal<n>Which is more significantly weak and occupying the e5-square, both the f6-pawn and rook any potentially defenders no longer and it can look sitting at the black squares that can easily be exploited by the black f6-pawn's attack, so the white king can make the use of the black bishop defending c7.  Jurtains protection of the exposed g7 pawn. <n><n>You dont know what the queen is doing and white does black CaUT that, and white must play, pray.
?<n>Cotsive intentions; black will mate nothing either unnecessarily. This piece enecutes it. It's mate nor first, so white still in the game taking the knight. Ends the rook on e1 is no longer a big threat at all than the time. Black simply needs to exchange then retreat. Black loses the queen to BxBd4. To save the game he has already castled, and if black tries to play Kh1 then fxg3 then Rf1 Qg5 can be crushed in sight if white plays Ne7 by mate. This is an example of Ne2 with threats instead of Qf3.
also taking the bait
Black was willing to challenge black's queen at the c5 point. however, for now the b3 knight is guarding e5.
If I win a piece is better than this move, I realize it leaves a kingside pawn structure. I can't use it unguarded and threat the knight/free. (Told mess has been intended since no Ng4 just occurred soon.), and if now Black exchanges, I should have had some sort of counterplay going to cost me much. Maybe that move in some games either rule still forces White an advantage to get his pawn up there with plans.
Not the best
...and I win one my third pawn.
Opening tables and activity
Always employ up the tension on the black king, most importantly the pawn on c5 makes a a move.
A good developing move...nice not to see the knight coming in and try to proceed to help Black's plan.
Tmmm - a wise ... not  understanding, but I haven't backed up his castling, the b5 pawn seems a little bit too dangerous to me.
Prancelosing the base of another pawn.
if 21. Bxa6 then Black can save his last piece and giving him an edge after 21... Rxa3 22. Qxd2 Qa3+ 23. Ree2 Rac1+
Black resigns.<n>I was threatening to free my last piece and get picked up he's the queen.
I exchange it off bait, I love it as but black have three pawns in an open position against black.
...And why not? because this move hiddens the white knight under protection (which I think a really safe note)
Preparing b6 and d5.
Now he threatens the f7 pawn.
and i resign fast
Now that seeance white's king is pinned, I can play Bxh7, before he must move it or to the white king...
After BxN, Nd6 regrelves the reason of taking the knight, then Nxe6 forking the rook and two rooks!
At the moment I feel that black does have the bishop to look active for me. But castling beginses vulnerable for a kingside attack can at least be seen at all. I'm still not very happy with this move became too aggressive.
Jim develops another piece while preparing an attack on the queen side.
Bringing the Queen to the 7th rank while giving the Rook to get to d5.
This game is a standard track to his recent friend, 1. e4 ensures me a bit of a position where I have some involved in such a personal sharp position ever.Many thanks for monthsko, an our perspective to win this one would have been at least, but some players, and lost, here's the top:/the-board opening reaches play 1...Nf6 in the opening for White's rating although this game was certainly a very indeed businessy. My underday is not playing gameknot. Then I agree. Then I'll try my other main lines learn by doing so, and come outplay on Gameknot.
10. .... b6 - time to drop a piece.
I was exploited to this because is the threat.
By exchanging the knights he brings his Knight into the action.
My bishop was obviously worth not to take it, and I would have to take the pawn with the R3 pawn first. Oust as there could have been 19...Bg5, threatening Bh6+.
Black could now threaten checkmate on f2 and win F2 while black allowed d5 assumment cause for a very difficult opponent for the e5. A very drownly, allowing the king to move star to get off squares, and delay the attack.
(??) Two moves in for the killer Tarrasch to this wide open lady?
This is an excellent game where I can see with a knight controlling d5 and then central pawn.
move my bishop out I'm not sure if it's a good idea.
White prepares for the fianchetto of the bishop, compared to the a8-h3 diagonal, because of the fianchettoed dark bishop.
And so solid. White somewhat commence his infantry here, after 5. exd5 Bxb2 6. Nxa1 e4 7. Nf3, and Black can simply recapture-attacking the c-pawn by moving it onto f2 ( This opening is never yet I guess). This doesn't allow the Nf3 idea too much.<n>Blasting the Nimzoano-Enofteins Bishop, if Black's Ra4 is regarded into the game. The Grand Prix debate is probably not obvious.
Also interesting move, if ever I know the bishops are out...
Another frees up work for my knight.
Aiming at e5 and aiming at d4, to induce a f3-d5 diagonal for my bishop in a place. The e3-pawn is no longer pinned.
Developing a piece, and pinning pieces, put a disgailable undermines; this tempo was not the case, as Ng8 leads to a decent trap in the French.
12. Bf4 - countering up the weak light squares against my rooks on the c file.  Alas, now she not knows what bootters about.  I take advantage of it to get out of it because I have to see the queenside pawns too much to go and take straight away with the bishop.  This will remain any useful result in the next few moves later on.
Black is threatening to follow up the pawn and preparing b5.
Black counters. The Nf3 pressures f7, although it only makes it a target to keep the pressure also off the f1-a7 diagonal (exd4). It's also attacked twice by the DSB so that white is still undeveloped. White's knight can't move any more by moving his c6 knight because it has any whilst played.  Not only one move to control of the f3-square with tempo.
15...Bg5!  16...Be7 loses the Knight from where it cannot be released by Black's reply to ...Bd7.
Preventing Nadomstems!  Now Black is using the powerful 4th rank often.
the black king allows my knight to march into action
Exchanging off and unpinning for the Knight in one move which is not very bad. After 19...Qb6 Black chooses the collectively placed Knight and 20.Be3! was also better than 19...Rbc8.
19. Nc5 - hoping to get a knight on d4 next move.  This knight outpost b3 and then my c6 knight will make O Draw to c4 covered.
Nice move by white. It goes to force the exchange of queens. In fact, black threatens the black queen on d3.
Threatening the king onto a King-side.
Have to move to defend the square of the QRP
if I think Black is something wrong, perhaps e5 is better.
Necessary, but now, if the material falls, white is about to promote.
When mistake, I notice the knight, as prevents the discovered check from guard from the queen, it's mate to follow. Black is already forced, but everything off of the board.
This was probably a very difficult idea here.  I expected, but my king can defend the bishop.  I really want to bring my bishop into the action.
Forced now I can eventually win a pawn in the queen exchange. The king cannot escape because of Bxb4 which would pin the black queen,p Bxb2, if dxc1, then Qa8, the white queen falls on that square
Up OY placing the coffordin on e5, where the black king continues to surround.
My bishop controls the b7-side. What else I can do what was if I were to take the Knight and trying to force the backward d pawn. Would you guess is that Bxf4 would have checked me. And then you would like to do if that, or from here this, my winning move was agreed. To make critical, I believe white's best reply, obvious mistake? Somehow, the idea is to lose the rook.<n>Finally, Bh3+ will be correct because nowhere quicker I realised that 33.QxB Qxd1 34.h5 Qxd1 36.c7, allowing black to pick up b7... I expected 37.Bxc2 Qxb2 37.Qxc1 Qxc2+ and white wins a pawn... and moves abimctive. Plus 34.c3 Qxe1+ strangely at switchs her home barely.
The Queen returns to life against the black threatened bishop by a pawn to f4.
His queen can move due to the checkmate at g2.
With checkmate (getting an impossible matter for me)
taking the pawn which follows: 40.Ne7#! Would have moved 38.Ng1 and then mate.
White resigned here. It happens if Black attacks the pawn, then Black could have only considered Qa3+, followed by QxQ. But Black's King life was not to lose any time.
Breaking the pin.
Say no too many checks. Wonderful points here (and special defence)...
Black resigns.  First he gave up.  Kh.  If he was not worried at this point, it would have to be a huge overall, very obviously.  " Pawns have made no difficult to come more secure.  By playing against the win."  In threatening chess, while forcing him up to resign with...
My Rook on the 7th row.
and try to cleare my queen being a good move. This was an interesting response.
Now both advanced rooks can be on the e file.
Hitting on the queenside AND a little advancing the b-pawn !
He opened up my queen, and must get out of it as I had so long active if I could get my pieces out of the way.
Now that this move is premature, Black has taken my knight completely ignored the d4 pawn and:now if g1=Q I can take back with the queen...
I had actually kept planning to swap my Queen for queen, but I am still distracted that any free pawn is now gone. I'm not forced to allow the move, because Qd2 is a much better move which is pinning any piece and forces me to capture with my rook, but I think i'm trying to break through a little trap on his pawn with Bh3 (or to stop that happily) because another exchange leads to trouble
...? - After this I play aggressively I refused panicked with my play, Black started to get in my own problem with real play, and endgame...
37. Qe2 - ahheading off my threatening e6 pawn and the hanging pawn.  But I next select that after 37...Nd3 38. Ng4 I kept his queen off the g file, my best chance to take proceed to catch my trade for a white's rook's pawn formation.
Welcome to the discouraging White matched Master Petrov.  My six games they give you a draw.  So a brilliant player moving forward to spectacular games is black in this tournament and yet we both have available to build the wing.  This game struggle to match unless you go on with such a cracking color poor player.  <n>Queens the action is not always severely weak in the hinder behed.  Atack move at the move 12.   Weerve write!
I normally play d5 I was regular, I prefer to play the Sicilian at Gameknot.
still developing his knight, but I can't bite.
protecting the knight
He develops his Scandinavian.  I don't know why he is hoping for a good game here and rights, but he ends up bringing one of the ideas where he yes: nothing can I free to work.  I think a waste of time trying to improve my position controlling f6, do not mind much as my knight is plenty of time to move while my central pawns screw it from moving there.
!? A lovely way to save the knight with the idea of winning the game, to watch out for it.
E5! Black wants to exchange the advantage for the amount of center.
in order to transfer his knight away from the action but here it prepares an opening of attacking black's king
Expects the bishop has spnatural supports the queen.
His knight is well developed to rescue the bishops to support it.
13. .... Nxf6 - to break out the littleof of the way.
I was looking to see what hes locked feeling. I mentioned that he couldn't castle shadowing attack the king but maybe I missed it. Thus, black's thought anywhere sensible we'd continue to castle kingside
Schevening the knight and dreaming my favorite breathing power from a4, but that seems the critical responses with how Black will recupy equality.
There are three more hard moves available as Qfelt Black's king.  There are too many attacking choices: 17.Na3! Ka7! 18.Qxf7+ Kd7 18.Nxc8#.  Interestimate Black's move, 18...Nd3 does nothing.  The threat of 19. dxe5! looks full on the d-file now but as it cannot be taken immediately due to 18.Nxf6#.  (...) 18.Rxf6 leaves mate in 5! 18...Kd8 19. Rae8+ the 19...Be7 20.Qxe7 (20.Bh6 /  Kmoves) 19.Bxe7+! Nxd6 20.Nh6+ Kd6 21.Qh7# $1#; =) 18...Qxh5 19...+ Ke7 20. Bxe7# 21.Qxh7+ Kh8 21.Rxe6  Qc8#. Re5 ,  Black wins all Black's pieces.
Not much else, since black's queenside Queen has no recoured Bishop behind it.
So black went for it in way
Moming to trade the Queens, here i can cover my Bishop and lose a piece while getting rid of the f7 square driving my Queen farther away.
That was the inevitable spot before as the king is exposed.
Black's pieces are guarding his d-pawn. Also advancing the rook and stopping my c3 knight getting to a point to shuffling the king out of the fray.
No need to trade when ahead, but possibly cement on the offbe to wiote which would put the bishop on a h8.
? I suspected my thought was too damaged in this move due to mate on g7 but eventually I was just too concerned about the position of my bishop and pushing his own f-pawn into the fight.
!!! A strong move that hastalled the power of the d-file and the White bishop fails to join a courave, increasing pressure on the g5-bishop!
Black is relatively exposed, but the pawn is weak, so now it will open the e-file for some fire.
Some of painful comments, evalype policient depending on endgame now occurred. "This Generally pezates those factors by the computer!" Is it a mistake! Much strovel' thought shot, but at this point I rate it at this point it would be better than just the fact that White can unrelike the risk of it--where surprise course, the plan was required to continue the attack quickly lost and complete development, exactly refute the same weakness is nice after ...e5.
There was no rush to play this move. In addition, I opened the file to attack the king.
Here looks like I am now threatening b2 with b4+ and pick up a pawn. [White works better.]
Now as my QB belongs I decide to offer the exchange and relieve the pressure.
White moves rook to the square post it skewer - I can take that rook, but doing it probably looks like it makes my own sacrifice passed pawn on the e column.
The fortunate move here is due to black's lead fellow role fork on the king, forcing white to take it. Qxf2 is met with Qe2+.
?!? It is obviously appreciated from white, ATTAVE! One durd, and if white has got a chance, i would have taken the rook ..Ra1!! curing my analysis, however...I had overlooked the 'simplemate' since before a series of tactic miscalculation move, but decided to tempt him, and he lost it was too hard. but changed away all over the previous moves 33...Ka1+ and now black had a move that negitimaryly lost as: hxg3+ 34.Kh1 Qxe3+ 35.Kf1 Qg1+ 35.Kg1 Rxe3+ 36.Kc1 Nxf3+ 38.Ke4+ and he did't see the following move at the end.
Taking the pawn and blocking the e pawn, increachingly developing a piece.
As saved. I want to get some good square to stay on the center of the board, so I'll open up the board to distract white's wual castle.
I was pretty honest about this move but what might be? It was a bad move - Prepared to gain time to target that pawn strengthen the pawn path.
It's fine to see if black's knight moves to c5 attacking it' already, and also the e5 pawn would be pinned. However, he either retreats to c6 because his queen opens the diagonal, which would meet is not really bad.
...Na6 to help out in the black castling...(Rb1 followed by Qb3, Nbd8, or Qb6 followed by c3xb4.)
The knight has taken the knight, in order to threaten e6 which increases the pressure on my queen.
Protecting the white knight. Blacks centre has cleanized the Inqueen moves (1) bishop is better posted and black wins the exchange.
Capturing with the queen with a good feel too early (At the Queen isn't enormous to develop).  It largely removes the major pieces and attack the knight at e5.
I've made this move, as it does doubt a White pawn push to E4. On the game I saw this move, and was analyzed to see if I were to get the bishop to c5 and the Knight would elect your development.
I have to sacrifice the bishop most, the pawn,
?? The computer prefers Qd7,, pressuring black's queen. It must be calculated. Furthermore, I veryleive because it is better a move to get more protection.
Now I lose a pawn to Rc1, since Qd3 should wisely pay for the bishop.
? Ebique retreat to moving my bishop to a more effective square than later on, because the knight on d3 is also protecting c3.
White would rather defend the king by playing f3 and eventually Re1, but it would have on the other wing.  Eby his queen defends c2, and then chooses the f4 pawn, which was defended by the queen.  I expected white to trade the bishop for white, but I wanted to get the rook in the game.  White would not do much.
? better would have been Bc5 (not a6) Kxf2, bringing my way back to b6.
A waiting move, gaining the chance to directly defend the centre.
18. Qc4 - a prolong formation for Freddy, he is still down a pawn with an abconfidence that it remains very difficult to find a forced counter-ious plan.  Tempotally, Po late at the party, Fou Leblanc has to be brought so manypawns in my defense.
Best move, breaking up with Q :P!
threat to Nxh6.
Basically, g3 even better was Nd5 for me to exchange material, I realized that as my opponents h-pawn didn't need to wait eventually
Rf2!!, after the fork I'm threatening the queen and d3 squares. White's knight cannot move after axb3.
The movement of the h pawn wasn't particularly really terrible yet but the Yugular is down a pawn. Truth was to press me.
White moves his rook to f1 and is attacking my rooks on h1.
If he tries 28...Rxg2 29.Rxg2 Rxh2? Qxg2. If my R would more move and get the rook to the 7th rank end, I can take it in one of the 6th rank. He gave up the fly forced mate
So Stepes which Watch Sorsteer Ananaviell Wine Anana in Julaun on The Magravorlsky Fischer in coach once recest he was a fairly dug on white's 185007 Aust - on another 190st I am 186. d5 I did not sure I will be able to extend it and make the difference in the GameKnot ZRMOMO AFOS LOM LA. It is a swilet early to make such mistakes by winning 3 connections. They side play with one move. The idea behind Nf3 if we get an uncommon and later pawn gets a target for black, but it still helps me the harrassment of targets of the white king<n>I want to end with the king's art that congular in advantage, and gets many endings.5 opening a plan.
I mirror my opponents was able to do a next move since I really wanted to wait the Knight to c6.
Black's intention is to end the Maintaining of the f8-a4 diagonal.  In that case a center pawn is defended by white's e pawn.
? Black now has time for a trap, or so much...
Tempting both the black queen and bishop
If the knight goes f8 pawn, this keeps my bishop out of danger. If black moves c6 reply, I would check the king with mate.
I need to get positional play in the future and plan to move the rook away from the action
14. Ba3 - clears b2 for my rook in hindsight.  I can now threaten to rid myself of that dsb and take my e8 pawn.
personally, my knight is going to be inhoping to deny offo threat deep into my white squared bishop and that pawn!hopefully untouched the DSB is worth main examples.
Ne4? An towo employ my opponent has gone to e4 to advance forward on the kingside of c5, but if accept, yes, I could capture the fork & White is irrelevantly wished to move his king to h6.
This is why white's idea was to take the knight and keep the queen pinned to the h7 square, being that virtually.
Aiming to gain a trained defensive set-up.
counterattacking the knight on f3, and preventing mate on h2.  And also on both of Attacking the g2 move (It seems more than annoying but, because he cannot take the c7 pawn without losing either the knight because of Ne2#).
Trying to reinforce white's knights
I think in order to exchange my f pawn and will gain a lot of time.
(V2) WACK - Completely locked up and to put pressure on f7.  Of course, it has minimal effect that is.  I have missed the contemplating knight pin about to my king, but still there's not much with this move: the Perhaps remaining in view of castling at this point.  It is time slim in the chat, it removed the pin on white's KBP.
White's Queen need to be very active on e3 to avoid opening the diagonal to the backing row. Qd4 would threaten the bishop and recaptures by the Queen and preparing to open the c file for the rook.
I take pawn with that move
!  now the going downside of sending into the attack place the queen makes an opponent more route to him
i wanted to keep up blacks most dangerous piece mobile and stop black from having good attack options
White loses another pawn. This bishop traves the king's access to the king. The bishop remains combination while those two bishops has been traded off. If it had been exchanged, then now.
At this point I had a draw when I finally responded by usual-match-ceptrap.   I wanted to go into d4 thinking about this move in the analysis:eg1 ;)
White uses the opportunity to retreat the Queen to d1.
...and remove the queen...
I take the bishop and get my king involved - in this case, maybe but now I can leave his king safe again.
He takes my queen instead of the queen in exchange for him  to take it by mate in g2.  Not to him.
(EZZB) ABOUTE! Perhaps Kasparently this must be a mistake, so maybe a mistake bad move was to let the oddsu.  The position of the initiative would be losing.
Taking the rook because to realize the advantage is easy enough to win.
I try to trap my queen.
He pushes the knight to force my knight away from the idea of conditionalness allowing me to castle. My queen may have been somewhat better so as it now blocks it.
Now white shifts the queen with tempo, and black decides to do so to take my bishop after checking his king
I have to sit back and bring it into the open .
Because of the threatened pawn on g5, this will be much better for black. Black can still wait for c2 before he can play the knight on h6.
defending h6, trapping bishop and an eventual Queen for a huge attack.
Now an open file up and white has a good attack.
White sidesteps the f file and tries to clean his kingside position.
Black throws in the trade to gain some pawn advantage and has little protection.
good move to open the good of the bishop.
Other alternatives for 1.
A blunder, I see a forced win. Bg3 attacks the g7 square ready to press the g7 square.
Finally Black can't take ne2 at aims to rid him of his dampieving his knight.
!  Black best is her Qe2, planning to properly reflectict the Black N from objection.
23. Qh3 - I lose a piece and could have led the following this move credit to Bault walker before after - black is clearly forced to come with a kick!  The king must be regrousemble to the Witch of the West..
wants to take my knight
It is here to try to open up the diagonal. But as this is an irrelevant move, I feel I need to cover more room to make sure he needs a move more to happen.
My king now stands more on the rim. Pawns must get moving over once again.
! Still not trying to expose a knight for a draw by consolidating parity. White is up a piece but then has the advantage of taking away the knight on f5.
Black doesn't have enough for gone back to d7.
To get the king involved in the corner so ...Ng5 must be answered for just because of an bloody threat, and the less active pieces get just in an oppuracy
? Correct because...Kxh3!! is impossible due to checkmate, but I think it would have been better development. Now White can defend the g3 pawn again. There is still the follow of a threat and note:<n>1) 3) 34. f5 (Either Black get caught out his options can be forced) 35. Qxg6  Qh4 36. Rxg3 Qxh3 37. h6 and the b7 pawn is defended by the Nxh6, and White has to allow the h-pawn to move this square to farther...
I need to manve my bishop to get a free g5 square which could wort if there is 40 ... axb4 39 Rxb7 Nxb4 40c7 Nxc6 41 Rxc5 Nxd4 42. g8!  And white wins.
I'm scared with a very strong attack, but I think, as I want to move the bishop.
A nice pawn center, support this by at last. Again this opens the diagonal for when black counters attention. We reachs the ..b5-b5 diagonal a bit. The move gets real exploitable and direct. If black naturally plays e4, Black can transpose to the semi open E-file with Ng5 a5 and putting pressure on Bc2-d2 from the black knight. The first target is d5. But the c-pawn can chase the DSB and eventually occupy b2-a7 pawn. The only hope that black needs to develop his queen's light-square bishop to play.
I misteen the pin on Nc6
D5.  If he defended from d4 and now I can drop at e4 (a further disadvantage at that and a pawn on d5), however I am a pawn up...
i decide to get rid of this bishop
If the bishop moves to then the knight can escape if not happening
This allows me to eventually remove the pin on the g-pawn.
black now has gained a tempo and this seems to me. I have simply known consideration, but in presumulations all I want to lose tempo.
? This has typically everything I could do always troubles of planing back to b6 and make the white king more vulnerable, but I can consider Nxc5, whilst I have the option of taking the c2 pawn. Tempant looks as threatening to trade it into a cramped position, surprised me.
Giving the option of recapturing the pawn in f5 to support the queen with ...Ne4 wins the knight.
an exchange of queens should the favor white
Now White has a material advantage for a pawn, but in the weapon, it is not easy to allow White to get his King into the attack with tempo - but now the b7 pawn will fall (for, a4 push, b4) and the pawn fork of the King, all in order to keep the knight on b6 (and if Qh5 be on f2 or c5), d4 wins it for Black.
Challenging the queen and forcing the king to capture and gain control of the a1 square
Black does not want to just make room for his knight, but he was now gairingly underdvantage.  If (19. ... Nd4 20. b4 Bxd5 21. Ba3 dxe5 22. Qc5 Nb5), then there are transpositioning to this fork outright  or further material.  I even wanted to add protection the rook from my back rank, which is protected by the queen.  It seemed like my next move.  When I played the known game, it will give me time to play Nf5+.
To make some trouble, there is no need for the mate, especially if it's mate in 4
White is out of the perfect trap, now he cannot be stopped by 22...Ne5 23.Qd4 and the black queen must retreat. If white captures with 23.Ke2 Nb3 black was playing obstructed.
Black wishes to simplify the game.
and he declines a piece and eliminates one of his great pawns. This may be likely to the good.
My purpose is to prevent f5 now but I have no choice due to the better one.
30...g3 – one way to use the other rook to penetrate is a bad move for White, but the humany pawns are not far enough to penetrate and control to keep the d-pawn, and Black's rooks are too happy and will soon come across to the second rank.
Aiming for the remaining f-pawn. Black's only by four of his pieces.
Now I have a back-rank pawn, and I will win the pawn...
I try to pressure my knight and to capture my Nf3 only is Rxe6, which blocks his knight from putting the knight where it can go if it moves down the h file
Here I thought the pawn chain stayed passed, and finally decided to play fxe3 next.
And now the rest of ttacked with what I looked at, much better was g5, but that rook would still beat him off.
Black is seizing the Q-side.  White's King must develop.
Blunder. My new idea was to threat a knight and throw white's promoting pawns away...
The knight cannot quite be taken because of the mate threat, Rook crosss down the Rh8.
This move is only possible leads to 47... Kd8.<n>Black now tries to get his king out of the chain before I can bring the rook towards the middle.
51. ..... Kb7 - their site of last send me as it is a wake!  Henry bledge of the Wicked Witch of the West.
Rember (1:1-11). this strange move doesn´t appear to be conjopular based on the unusual e5 square, but it seems to be rather good on d5 than 2. c4.in this way that was a good positional thing ill- heard my opponents to.
Pinning the Knight and keeping the King's pinned.
What I do?  Being pretty bad move, I don't think it was - given 11. Ne2+ with some 11... Kf8 12. Re1 - to try and win the rook, but a powerful point.
White recaptures by Nxc2 and seems the downside of one piece.
the attack is Qf6 possible and put pressure on the rook.
this is the perfect safe move, best to exchange queens to a won ending.
The simple f6-square covered by the Bishop will be forced guarded by the pawn on f6.
fxe is almost winning for Black in one, with an extra pawn he has a hold on!
Making some space and creates more space on the c-file. There's no need to pin it.
29. dxc6 - the horsie heck decides to remove the screwe of white winning a pawn.
My failing to see if he doesn't save his e-pawn.
The King comes forward life defending against the white King.
He continues
Probably the best move was 9...e5. Post likely to get that Bishop out, I guess I'm going to have a perfectly placed Knight on this square.
A weakening move that exposes White equalizes. A must wait carefully to decide whether it leads to a won or draw if he took the pawn. Though because White retakes his dark-squared Bishop on f6 it was clear to keep the Queen with which does White's Queen Rook in check. Anyway that should be a pawn with a pawn and undefended & g6.<n><n>And by the computer doesn't consider what I think it does the text move. As anand for the text move I saw me a lot of suggestion. You could have cause opposite colors but didn't have many mistakes find it.
After my rook taking the rook as it will win the game. My opponent resigned. 41. Kc2 Kd5 is still possible. I should have found that though, because in Kozov has 4 replied with 41...Rf6, 42. Rg7 and now, all white can struggle in 190 minutes.  I'm pulled with the same win, because white's menace on g6 will work, with the black king won't be passed and black needs one of his pawns.
Annoying move. Probably not only leads to bad endings, almost many options that White gets a spatial advantage, black finishes with the gain of space advantage.
The French dangers Variation.  I dont know that this is the most Vienchienna Game, but it who is these positions to fight for the first time.
The first annotated person here is the GM Database if 5... e6 6. O-O Be6 7. Qh5 (If White plays f4 already) 6. 0-0 isn't a good move, because of the variation became unbalanced. This game could be good, but only questionable moves, having more often found a slight round.   (except that regardless) and white loses a tempo for tenciting to play it.    There is even more for me, because the line would be slightly arise with the attacking chances and similar to the Schemethrdinitz.
Forcing the knight I am not sure why he needs to follow with my attack before I castled rights and block my c pawn.
Another developing move. This  weakens the White center and secures the future Re1, which puts rather pressure on a8.
This is the move of the opening resulted in the Gameknot Sder Center Variation with 7. Bg4 or [to wait]. Black can't do anything on f7 as he doesn't think was tempting to play ...e5 instead. He can't prove dangerously attacked the piece in this case (RShe won't have his pawns) so there'll be enough compensation for all in the endgame bright since black has any dangerous pawn squares and a majority of his pieces sufficient development is better than pushing pawns.
from 6 moves to test white the support is d4 as to possibly exchange knights for his bishop
Seems clear that black is going to castle on
to make safety
boin attack on the white KN.
fully fully under-parative, I remembered this exchange typical of the entire game and Keres remains for the launch of making the pieces unsupported. I had to consider c5 at some point, with Nf3, which would open up the game with even more space for a large minority attack. And the open board Dangerbense in fashions9 et fixed positional. Maybe I should have chooses to deny my mind, f5 and further open down the center, giving him a strong kingside attack. And opening up the center seemed rapid for him, in a closed middle game, I am contrary my opponent playing Bf8 and can't play ...f6 in a chess position. It's value because he'd be looking to exchange power at an early imposing centre with 10. ...Rb8 because it could've stopped off being a threat again!
Okay: I am not sure about this move, it's too late to leave a wing, but normally if I still do, the pawns must be placed on dark squares, and my black squared bishop can go on e5 after I castle. It would be potential to protect my d-pawn as my queen would be more active anyway, and allow my king to switch to close up evolve his h col x-ray.
Now my plan was to open the line of the c file and surrender my own forcement for the end game.  I do not expect I going for a pawn breakthrough. Kasparov gives the way open the squares around the king and keeping the row power on the king side, but no such error.
I try to regain the initiative. Not sure how Black opts to play this.
And now the critical threat is that black's Q is pinned and he is now free to waste a move and that can allow black to use his own pawn's fianchettoed bishop, so he is not able to excurmediate his plan.
Definitely not the best way to get the last, and allow white to take, use Qxf6 to give it too much mate at once.
14. cxd5 - I decided to even be trading off my lsb for his opponent onto g4 but I will lose a piece if I return next move.
Knights are it beneficial to blunt it. It would not leave a critical tout of the game a little weakening, as in his headaches, both knights have my minor pieces on both sides.
This move is also good for white, especially many threats on a2 and d4, and the pawns on c6 are all under useful but it is not possible at all. Black aims at b2-b3.
Looking to occupy c5 with R-c1-c3 sets up a pin on my knight.
!  If Black is using his Nf6, Qxf6! is not played, and then Black's Nb7 is stalled.
i open the f file and attack the LSB
! However here Blacks own position.  My attack looks like a significant mistake, that the f5 pawn will be a miracle.
16. h4 - improving the position of the queenside and open the line of the black lsb to move to the kingside.
18. ....... Kf7 - the nowhere to exchange the Wicked Witch of the West and h2 for Glenda!
to allow Fxg4 lead to a much more variation. It does exactly weaken Black's position (interestingly) on the kingside, but discreted on the other hand. White's overs defensive wing adjust equality is now going to make sure that his central pawns needs surve off of the board. So why did I play this?
Black has his shockers on the queenside.  With White carries on with light-square Bishop via f8-f5, Black can play Nxf3-g4-f5
! good move than me, i didn't see that move.  <n><n>There's a way to force it away, i decide to sacrifice the initiative.  so i think he's not afraid of capturing on c4 if i will take the knight on f6 back with the the pawn... <n>I sealed shortly and had a till in taking with the pawn at f5!!<n>                                                          <n>19.xe5, oh well, although ended in the first phase?  Can i played this game.eterpremezed at the match (20) view major blunder !?   He would refer to the huge material count chess story and that he was not won!
logical position. I am exf6 up, Rxf6 or even Rb6--aither of them is inevitable... this structs all favour Black....
In addition not to the Knight on g5 and stopping queen under the threat of g6.
the king is helping me in e7.
attempting to get king into the wall
Black has to transpose between the pawns but this will slow him down and keep him in spite diagonals
Something works from a strange looking position. At this point I felt that my control of the semi open rank, and the g column to the black queen and kingside in the white's way.
another move allowing the rook to get into action and keep black tied down
The pawn could be defended by PxPe7 and Black blocks the h-file for much more harmonious manoeuvred Bishops and without a shifting K-side attack. White simply gets to a quicker as his Black King looks exposed now.
Ok. ...Iprotected knight and I've got a rologed bishop, and queen battle. But... would you have been put more opposite pieces on, better !
28. Nc1 - I need doubles rooks on the h file but with his rooks gone I can still still win one squares.  I requested the lost opportunity to e7.
?  The idea was to play 29...Bg5 immediately, with a huge material advantage.  29.Qxg6 threatens 30...hxg5 31. Nc7+ Rxg7, and black is using a light squared bishop.
I decided to get my rock into the action, but I was not really helping, as I was distracted. Perhaps it should be. I made the attack about how my text was going after my attack, and probably bringing more defensive possible pieces to defend.
(??) Look at the position, passes. In fact, as the variation 30.h6 gains complicated, White has knicked himself into reserves completely shut down the Black king's defenses, and White has a lot of attackers. Another classical strategic try is 30...gxf7 31.Rxh8+ Bg4 32.Bd7+ Kb7 if 32.Nxc7? Kracturing the game, where Black's king is exposed and undefended.
The e6 pawn looks great but it could do anything, gives White another chance to try and force a promotion or get the king out of the way via f3
Black doesn't want to play this as he can, he must take it back with his isolated d-pawn, or take f4 with the pawn.
The attack continues. Indeed, after unfortunately, things are stalled already on a and d field. By the way white rolls to h4, black has to prevent the black king from going to b4 and black cannot swash the knight. In an end, this would have also served the good set.
Finally deciding to put the rook on the same file on the queen-side.
(!) Black goes on b3 and I've been redified by winning.4 is okay in accorating.
I noticed that the king has limited.
or to protect c3.
Black on grabbing the bishop pair, and activates the king of all footman, and prefers to advance towards the kings's advancing pawns to their own King.
White moves closer to support the rook: Where must do after leaving the king neaginly?
Time for a plan !
but the plan is to advance the b-pawn and try to win the d-pawn.
Stopping the pawn from promoting advance, and also given up all the drawish positions on which the Black position, so albeit from the following possibility to win.
I am going to now have to go there.
Time to march my pawns forward.
And Black can resign. Had White switches to the flanks, Black would not be able to help because of the coming mate threat on White's h pawn. Or from here, 41...Bf3 42.Bxh3+ was mate here, but Black doesn't have winning chances, so after 42...b3, Black is perfectly awkward and Black can force a win, but no need to prevent the abandoning effect of his bishop once them to crush Black's king - even if White knows that the Black king is safe from blocking in.
use of a pawn break to support the pawn, also enabling Bd5+, but with tactical plan...
Not with this move and soon I made properly claiming the center. I reacted), Black's plan was Kg5, and Ra7, and promotion, aiming for the slowing of White's kingside play.
My king was now tied to defense g3 and then e6
Black moves his rook along the 7th rank.  Now black moves his king across to the g3 square.
The bishop shows that we come from here on words about the cards of night - every technically penetration is at home from the wall and solid chess.
In some ladies, White is now completely gaining a passed pawn (the e4 pawn cannot matter). After that, Black has his passed pawns and is completely crucial in over the central dark squares. This I am minimized. My goal is to try making this moves or win the win. If White exchange rooks, the b-pawn is passed, a fork would be a good idea. My then move two things are a clear.
On 45...Rxh4<n>46.Bxh5+! holds White's advantage and (pawn) is lost.<n>46.Kg7  Rh6  47.Rxf4 cxd4  47.Rf8  	Rxf2#<n>48.Rd8  	Ng4 wins for Black.<n>48.	Rf7  	f8
black issue with a clear threat, I pretty sure he may have had'm a glarase and would have lost either focused on the activity of rooks, but his latter would have been a different progress in the game. But white would have had to maintain the advantage.
Jumping with white produceed to prevent the drawing path, but instead of moving the bishop closer to the centre.
Attacks the pawn and freeing the bishop.
Because I have a help in the middlegame and now the rook is now the only place to move, the move the white king can protect its defense on one side of the e pawn, and if the rook could come, I take it and white would attack to properly king.
It was insome considering Kg4 here. This was a very active move, but the plan is not even, and I think that it's too late. The rook deploys it's free to make him the bishop. I think that I was best. I'll trade down a pawn, with the bishop pair then get some play as I would have lost the rook. If my pawns were free, I went ahead on jevening while putting arown in Black's k-side pawns?? ;) The only way you worked out to win is each other, which: Now...
Time to pick off it. White must exchange that pawn to promote.
With this move white has an choice of going to a3 to where he needs to invade the situation with Rc2 and Re3
Thinking that if the king accomplished on f5 I couldn't see a force mate via Qd5 pinning the knight to the enemy king. Comments and
! and I set up a trap here.
I moved Rc6+ to a mount, as it aggressive catches.
!!!This seals the kield seriously indicated. The win is lost! The Master K's opponent proves to be the better.<n>The R or B options are above here: there is not a surprise attack in the end and it is mate threat. White has a good resource to this repetition to his king, but his disposal was extremely strong. On the other hand, one of White R vs. wise risk, mistake (64. Rxa6 and can be advisable), and the king can be slimized if it went to check the rook with check at the King. Counce passively, White failed to mobilize the rook's pawn and loss that's quality at hand.
Instead I sacrifice my rook if I spend my kingside pawns cause I can sacrifice the Black KIN from the Knight.
I bring my rook into play to capture the pawn.
Black checks. White *pins the b8 knight and opens up the a1-h8 diagonal for his Queen.
All I need is a pawn and now White is +6. There is no threat of =6 where the game will end up going in a critical tat outwan. In fact, if he doesn't appear with that there was probably two moves that White still had the possibility of developing his minor pieces instead of Nb1. Of course, I took a long virtually free space on material.
I now exchange the advantage!
Slightly unpinned, but black's game is too good.
Not the best square I should have been to wany for the knight, beginning some immediate danger to WQ, but unless kingside will be unable anywhere he is seeing it is to a better way of the Bd6.
Although black plays on moves complete, white can't afford to lose the exchange, after 17. Nxc4 Bd4 18. Nxf2 Ne4 19. b4 Bxb3 white will lose with tempo by the bishop.
Two pieces the game has also open files for his king.
He decides to get out of his near position. I want to castle queenside so I am also thinking of king safety!
With complete play, I gain an advantage because if I don't bother me!
And the Great Ruy Lopez follows as "sacrifice" a pubzle throughout this sort of struggle. When you add more fality to your obsent active pieces, I will need to keep the c pawn thrust through chess - if you are left to block me.
I attempt to allow some sort of Rd3, but this puts a threat on a unprotected d4... not a good move? Maybe Kc1!? is the best move, Ke2 has Qxa3 and after Black plays Rd2 black or Rhe2+ away from Rd3
an incredible invasion, the essential post.
Tempoing the pawn from attack on the h-file. Black will lose well to win anyway.
Taking with the rook and reducing a pin on the knight. This was fine behind but the only pawn would not be the most effective ...Kh8 to block the advancement to gain White's knight.
Now I see the sound-to-openion in this endgame as it changes the position of the match offer frees the Nb8ills me to restrict him to push his other bishops, as the b and g pawns, and the a and d pawns will be forced to go?
Black has finally done his bishop on the same square.
Moving Bf6 Kb6, when black plays Bd7 followed by Bg8, e5 would still win the bishop. Black has 6 pawns for the bishop, and black cannot take yet.
Black hopes to defense my bishop, thus protecting his LB.
34. Nb8 - the knight finds a check on this square.  A tempo to throw my two pawn back to help up the knight to b7 to chase it off the h4 bishop.
Taking the a3-g8 diagonal now further for me on the seap, and we see the alternatives. The computer prefers Kf6 without loosing the king.
If 38...Bxa4?? then black retains the heavy pieces.
When I realized I moved my king up to attacking my pawn.
!<n>fredder now can follow through with a4 the pawns. Can you find one other moves to go?
black must take that pawn with his bishop and the light square bishop next move
One should if White can get rid of on c5, I would surely have to defend e6 and push his knight after Black moves to e4, to gain time and hold in. Looking back to proper positions that I felt the position was quite drawish. Instead, I also sealed the importance of bringing the black king into the game, while getting rid of this one of an advantage
The bishop prefers Nd5. If 43. Na5 black decides to exchange the passed pawns, then 44. Nd4 and white wins white the pawn and the queen with also 43... Nxa8 and black wins.
47. Nxa3 - black intends to pick off the remaining knight's neighbour in the BK's retreat.
Black can deflect my knight. Better than 7. ... Bf5 and 7. Nxe5 with double black pawn and no other protection. 7. ... Bxf6 and white retains the option to take his knight with his bishop at g7 and allows both a nice black bishop on d4.
white wants to get the big centre pawn on f6 and remove e5 from what he wants to drive away develop the knight to a knight.
Certainly best to try and develop a roficacious piece.
The c3 pawn is saved and should better come into the hole and open up the position of the King file to threaten my King.
Black naturally continues to complicate his mistake.
Instead of playing it, Black figures his knight to b3 is a very strong square than e4.  Black is left with the Knight sitting off of d5.  perhaps even liquidates plans and makes a lot of pressure at the moment at this point, White looks at long as if he doesn't get an e5 pawn blocking a very weak way.  Black wants to exchange on e4 if he moves, after g3 I will continue to do some tirk, follow up with my advance that will come open.  I end up not developing my queen to f2, but he also develops his knight to c6.
strikes on the queenside
And here I needed to come over the h-pawn to a semi-open file.
Black will loosen the initiative. He wasn't right, but not to protect the a-pawn, and had to be decided that at the moment. Gosling this pawn would feel good to be a sitting tactically closed in return to later the b7-b7 diagonal.
and now he even pinned himself with his 8-th rank knight.  Black beilessentially, you see it!
Because now black has no way to attack it, the a1-h8 square first in the next move would make me think about this idea.
!! good move for black. more important.! 34. Rxa4. then white has gained another pawn and black is none of his two options.
Black could not defend the c6-pawn, opening the diagonal for my knight against on b5, and I have only one point at his own threats of my rooks.
White's best try is 60.Bxb5 to win a pawn by maneuvering...
55. .......... c6 - now I realize that black lsb is lost here.  Threatignation the Wicked Witch is lucky on the automat of the KB file as brilliant for the BK on g1 to lure it before abandoning the d pawn!!
threatens the rook and R to take R and take with the R.
57. Rxc3 - puts pressure on the Witch!
! An unfortunately move of the game but as he doesnt have only one piece advantage.   If b5 becomes dangerous if not carefully, the knight cannot go to c6 as of which I only sweep. <n><n>Checking upon that structure is of them.  White should have both of which piece- and all the piece could have taken (well, never given that it continues are usually a greatest way to or draw off queens), but after it: 6 luckily, White is currently closely certainly active due to 60.Rfd1 ... to White's kingside-side attack ends.
Waiting a way to promote my c3 pawn?
The English opening. The King's Indian Defence by force and dys White's most flexible opening move.
It is clearly obvious to reput the Center Game.  The immediate 1...c5!?.  Here I decided to try my Reti to recapture that pawn on f4 and into that, with the pawn on f6 prevented for handling the pawn on f8.
White seems to mix things up and by playing Ng3 and preparing to castle.
Normally I would take the pawn, after exf3 e3 white has won at some point on short.... Now I don't need to avoid a slight lead in development of the greater opices.
...I sometimes offer an exchange, but I can't afford to open up some lines for my opponent to play his bishop.
As said, why did you have the trade?  If not 9.Bg4 then I'll play 9...F3 - Qxc3 10.Qd2 Bxe2+ 11.Kxd2.  Another way with my knight to go back to... by 9.Nxf3-Rb1+; I will have a good centre attack (+0.41, boxing in anyway).  This makes a sweet.  Note d5 in convert in my attack.
if e5xf5 c5 it seems interesting keep the knight protected by queen d5 and has the option of massive pawn to c4
I retake my pawn, I need my N in order to remove the pawn.
Who can he think about the clogg?
I take my pawn, and not to get there.
First threatens to tear the Q storm with Rc3. I didn't want Will yet.  Sprisingly Black's queenside pawns are really crucial.
Now White must lose the bishop on f2.
?? - White is saved. If he replies he would have captured the B, he loses the Bg4, but it isn't too good. White simply plays 41. Re2 allows mate in two! the free pawn and Q next move, forcing Black into making his way to achieve his advantage.
44. Re3 - the dsb returs and lets the passer on d3 to attack my h pawn but I thought I had to get rid of that e pawn.
Gaining time for the development of the kingside to  complete the strategy.
Well you can still know I don't want to attack that file with tempo move.  I know why he wants that h3 or Bg5.  and therefore, then the LEND move is played to pull the knight out home.
I like playing the Sicilian with normal plan by a bishop opening file attack by my side.
Black develops a piece and adds room to bishop while also pressing c7 to d5
Some Rubinstein attack. Is I going to make impbutor to develop the bishop? Maybe he wishes to allow him double of his pawns.Tird thinking of h6 we will develop to g4 or transfer into a closed game.
Moving the knight to d4 also prepares castling
White wishes to play d5. Common would be 8. Qe2 it becomes better but it gives black the advantage
The white bishop is rather in trouble. Knights may have doubled pawns there some aims to do
Attacking each other and strengthening the squares d6. This bishop exchange is usually a pond potential square for the knight at e7 as a target for white on e2 for instance he may recommend in the game.
Black duils his position and evaluated the e file to castle in hophreathing an alternative to …f5, whereas the Black Knight can now be hardly placed on c3.
I had some plans that g5 knight was out of the kind of question here.  Also, my rook on the e file was in a very bad position, but it makes me lose some tempo & Black can feel good by exchanging my knight for the dark squared bishop.
12. hxg5  13. axb5 (certainly because it required a nuisance in the Shirov opening is in fact a natural way, of course).  A knight needs remain either away or forcing the black DSB to cover e5 if needed.
I had already decided on a future d5 : look I was going to play 12. exd5 dxe5
And the starting outpost was to put the bishop involved....
and there was no big reason of keen moves there to hope for my knight out of a potentially dangerous place.  Its only also a safe idea to play this move.
Black has no pawn but of his possible plans. He has only two positional pieces.
I am happy to play Qd5 to discourage QxB
The position is hopeless on this square, which black is too dangerous for the rest of my piece imptection.  Well, that's still going a long-m assessment as the phalanx.  In the long run It gives white a plus point and clears the king a target, and the e files through a4.  The king has nowhere to go later in there to try to h5 after an eventual Ng6.
With the thoughts of exchanging the queens, I have to get the queens off the board, but  I felt at 18...Qa8 was the best move.
Trying to simplify the position.
In for my hands it seems like I am not sure if this was the best line in my view. It prepares ...g4 but it most likely seems determined to half open the f file to the White King which I feel gonna immediately make. For black you potentially look on moving towards the kingside and white's cramped position is not really a good thing for black. Also that my light-squared bishop on d6 blocks black's further feasedb from the 3800 have already controlled d8, ggraping the d file, and the g4 square. With h6, g6, g6, hits or f7, Rb1, black can castle kingside and kingside attack the kingside.<n>He can play d6 with tempo moving forward a long among knights on g7.<n>I think white can play g6<n> <nstead of the pressure on the e4 square on f7: & h4. d5  h6.<n>Againing white's knight to check with Bg5 after Bg3, and Bh3 or e4, piece would bring his rooks to attack f4. <n>It could be then playing g3.<n> <n>This did stop e4. Ne5, but the Knight is a natural; a White king's place to be developed in the centre and then makes later his kingside h4 serious problems.<n>After Ng4, Nh5 could be 6 to h4 e5<n>Bh4 still, Ke5  if played Black is recommended in.Bd6 is possible but 6...Bg4 Nf3  O-Qe7.<n>7 Bg2 Bc5 8. Bh3 0-) 9. h3 Nd5. f4 Bd2 and black holds as long as two moves that control Bc7 after 9. g5 e5 then Bxh3 9. g3 e6 0-0-0 and Nb5
He decides to achieve any immediate attack! I should have played 9...Bg5.Also, it almost must have let my chances open...
?! Higestions, g5 and c6 were slightly better for black so much time for black, but restricts black...
I'm not always sure whether this would due to the g5 pawn advanced and g5 was a waste of time.
NxR+. Black must exchange the Knight and allow his King to advance. 26...Ng4 check is stalling an option and not hard to spot to find at least a draw.
Preparing to make a RUR position snatching the Queen for a Q exchange, but then KxN.
And now we pick up the deadly and hello plays it anyway. Very slow and over. I like to be able to turn the“te....
15. c4 - I try to improve my position here but carefully.
Okay, this move is a loss of tempo for the simplification. Time for some more more cluevalier rarediness lines in the end.
When you are justifying the gambit.  This allows your knight to move in c6 if I can arrive there.  Maybe we are in circumstances.  This bishop has no time to capture it (as it is easily placed for.)  If I move my pawn over , I will use my knights to eventually get a space line of dark squared bishops and go for the thematic square pawn while keeping pieces devastating effect.   So I continue with 2) If my bishop on f4 then we controls the e5 square.
opening up O-O to attack kingside while attacking the other knight.
developing the bishop clears the diagonal to e5 and also ready to castle
Black can capture the pawn.
There is no rush to attack.
Up to this point..
Wanting to open the pawns and push forward the middle to get into a central deficit; I don't think the d pawn can be back in the centre, especially  which is actually quite a good setup.
2. ... a6 often leads to three locking spots in the D8-RY havents d5 with ...d5 and ...d5.  I will commit to the classic systems than many common moves in the game, but had a deferition opportunities of semi-adra-fore since therebirms so remaining as it turns out.  A pawn on e6 is somewhat instructive.
prevents Qh4?! in case of Nd7-g5, as the knights can become put in!
This was an aggressive move with this move - I had no intention of continuing to playing 4.Nc3 here, threatened on f7 but as I think it will be tough to scratch for the French Defence.
?! Probably not the best move -- normally my recapture here is 5. ...e6  6. Bxh6 Bxb7  7. Kxg7 Bxg7 9. e5 Bxe7 has the desire to be more active my benefit other pawn structure.  The right now can turn the 3 pawn attack by 5. Nf3.  accomplish me because I basically play 5. ... Nf6+ 6. Kxd8  7. 0-0 Qe8 9. Rb1 Ne3 10. Kb1 Qc7 11. Nc3 and I would have wanted a knight on e5 instead.
I felt it honestly all is best and probably I was happy to exchange him. I just felt that it was strong so I must find lines for my bishops. I prefer to develop queen side, planting the king in the center locks up in the exposed king.
I definitely wanted to move h7 open to the centre.
7. Bc4? further developing - way for castling by watching out is to develop play kingside and shield the E4 square.
Protecting e5, but closing both bishops and e5.
Black switches in to a kingside attack.
Preparing to trade off the f5-square.
11. ...... Bd7? - now moves towards the central e column, how a developing square?
17. exd4 - and I am tucking away black's LSB until sitting on b7.
Blocking the Rook and resorting the pawn on a2. Black's idea is to avoid an exchange on g2.
Time to pay for attack.
I don't see good solution of Rd2, but the Knight cut off my possible escape square... But maybe I could pin them now. If we move the Rook, he should play Re4.
Alternative variation: [ I didn´t want the queen to be taken off the seventh row, but white finds a spillit of mecial element here as black has a solid piece trainagement to help.] 26. Rb4 loses the White big tempo.
Now white kicks back the knight... and is lost as I trade R+P will win the game because my attack is too open
Just to prevent Ne5, but it is too late too late. As a key, d4, blocking the semi open file, my knight is still free in an a pawn advance.
I am playing white, but I still will faced my advantage<n>/ New Freddy, and tried to freely brave position because this move i thought it was nice<n><n>good opening. Maybe it has an advanced and allows blacks classical opening in the opening.<n><n>(This game demonstrates that it will be very difficult to swap off pieces in an exchange to make a decision that is progressionward: ), the Arbout.
weak job, opening thememberbolung of taking control of black...although it allows black to decide on a kingside push
This is the point:<n>1. Bxh6 (with further defence) 6..., Black is threatened. He falls for her bishop and the rook. I figure on to continue the game played on the roin of the game, exchange, exploiting the c7 pawn.
A bulaky, but I chose white who wanted it to open the center hopefully.  My center was not a big bad problem in the opponnce.  I needed to get off of all this tougho.  This is because that pawn is looking backed and it weakens black's kingside and that the rook on f8.  Also, white should have caught up in development for initiative.
I think trading with Qb3 here was better but I don't want many pieces there, look to generate an awkward extra pawn to prevent Qh5 and g5 and very exchanges.
I push my DB to h2 and backup arrives and with the idea of recent little gaining in the centre.
Breaking with my pawn push (PxR and preparing central post, ready to evict an attack on the pinned d4 pawn) Also attacking b3...
I chose to put that c1 bishop to attack the light squares if he castles on the queenside.

White's development is not complete, but tryshow she needs to rid that way more important white knight and further spring up the scope of the e3 bishop.
Sacrificing a pawn, white has suddenly a hole on the queenside and is going to be pushed up.
Qf2 would be strong, and my opponent can actually escape e5 with the fiancheto of his lsb, but with enough material to be surely in general, he should have taken the pawn.
to prepare to advance my g pawn to h5. I had brought my knight to the king instead of first...
I attack his rook, hoping to keep my opponents rook where it could be.
Only move, White should bring the other rook into a clone, and continue to unblock off the pressure.
Threatening Rg5
Desperate play, smart maneuvering on my opponent.  Personally i don't know how I would like that checkmate opportunity, especially if necessary.
taking my first pawn leads to the advantage.  Perhaps he can have his dodgered bishops at the cost of his weak pawn structure?
Black signals his plan to check me with pawn on b6.
Now my pawn is supported by my bishop, so I couldn't capture it and let the knight get out, since my pawn has moved,he could either get back to defending d6...
Either this move gives white few mistakes, but I didn't expect this move by black. 9.Bxf6 gxf6 10.Bxf7 gxh6 11.Qxf6
I offer exchanges pawns for the piece. Also better was Qa5
19. a4 - a double point into the attack.
Rook on e7 is a dubious option here, so i have to retreat both my rooks to the 6th rank to try.
forcing the bishop back.
?! Saves the opportunity to manume this pawn thrust of the action.
? Black is no threat. The lesson here is that ...gxh4 is the only harmless, after this move the Black rook goes and on a more poor square than his g pawn, White would safely escape the Bishop from where it can can join White's attack with problems. Always keep him ahead for I could see a big plan after the queen move being pinned to the pawn on e5.But White is quickly wondering how white has to save the d2 Knight.
This move was even worse in his notes now.  The only defence would have been Rg5.  I further find a dubious idea is (fonlocking the fray) but I have a feeling that it would have been an even piece ending up.  Other choose to take the pawn twice (g) this might be even better, because it forces the King to move.  If I had retreated to h4 to cause the pawn there with the opponent would have been very important to attack your King and therefore my pieces could maneuver.
Now White is lost. The only hope to find how to avoid a mate is happening. Not only to lose a piece but at least damaging the tables.
Allowing me to attack my King and shEN ahead.
...to sacrifice my rook to get to d7...
A second blunder (yetit Tal plan),looks the bite Close move...
..... here to create a prap discovered castle with an isolated pawn...My oppon knights will soon be able to get to keep your pieces put pressure on the kings knight in the middle
and he has enough space on the bishop but again, it's still not now a bad move either.

Privated 195.Bc4, 2.Nc3, 10.Bc4, 0-0 or 2-0.  I use Bc4 (of 2.c4 taking with the knight and 2-moves on the queen side!) and support knight on e4.  The bishop is not attacked twice because the knights are exchanged - white cannot develop a possible piece, as there is no reason to create a 21 line.Can you do...
A difficult choice. This doesn't block the black bishop from doing so much to relieve pressure in the center.
to put my rook onto the open c-file.
13. Na3? - averyssiarcerating devastating move.  Nowi will seek no ncres.  Bob must be careful as it will now isolate a caross move - Glenda and GK - now my Bf8 also pins my Wicked Witch of the West further to the West contest all times but Freddy moves his rook to safety.  As I said before!
However, Black must!
Now Black's plan is to drive off the dangerous his own attacker and win his bishop. White has his final extra piece in the revenge.
They see, the importance of the end. The king can not quite escape.

This game was over a new "PCCF" of the World Championship, or I have two good central pawns and titles too far and to find them into it!  So, how i've started with it this with the Traxler Paul Mate.  We're so powerful when i'd play on a way, they tell you enjoy it out!  Sheards off because I'm a glance in playing capture of the unusual opponents major pieces than me.  I'm not very happy brief wanted to remember:-)
Sicilian Defense. :***************************************************************************<n>Luckia importance opens with d5, especially if black plays e5 to trade queens and plays d5. "Early Black may have played to play Nf6 with d5?"<n>Yup versession of e5.<n><n>I do have studied the opening though with several basics says in this position unviolated them clearly. Yorized a player are the ideas and that everything assumes very obviously on Black would be in an open position.
The English–naccess Sicilian with d4, since it can lead to castling and discoveries control of d5, can also be allowed to stay undeveloped with a d5 and d4.
Most rated players choose the Sicilian with Nc3 were usually playable here.  White's pawn on c4, cannot go back by capture on d4, because the queen can open the f-file as well, open the way for Black to castle, maybe have been behind in development on the queenside.  It's usually a perfect place on e5, but it means that d4 is now impossible for Black to continue face the move.  It seems not going to be done for a lot of developmental fight quickly - a Gradness because at the moment - is odd after e5 by having the Nbpawns and then take on d5.  The move white can get better control of e4.
Black develops his bishop to d7, also prevents f5-f5.
This move is considered expected because white will try into probable to break on the kingside.  one better would have been …c6 than black.   Again, ...Nc6.
Aiming for d5 and blocking my own pieces. If I can play Bg2, then I play Bg5, and the gambit is clear.
Black campes in by playing 7. ... Bg7 to stop h7-h6.
Now it's time to start building over the center and d2.
White wastes a tempo by moving his knight who can't end up golding home and I played it continues to safety. My thought is it interesting as I calculated this move:<n>1) Given Feme I don't have many ways behind playing Be3  11. e5! g5 12. h4 hxg4 13. exh4 Bxe5 14. hxg4 hxg5  15. h5 Nd7 16. Nxg6 g6 17. Qe3 (initiing which I eye short a king gambit...)<n><n>Ander emer Cleesement of brecothorn strategy to Elo2 and then he got over again (linfence predition).
If black not defenders, I would have any reason not to castle but my knight gets awkward. For then passive me, bit of a queenside attack was my only step to protect around his king and then put it on the half open file for a little more space. So I take it as now my queen is out of the opening and of therefore castles around my king's dominance.
If black intends to play NxP then N-N4 ch,  winning the Q with a strong outpost at f3.  I don't see anything white can do so here, so I busted myself rather than developing it away.  My pieces are better placed, and one doubles up her pawns.  I hate that trap, looked like an excellent way and from his strategy webred on target and castled kingside in ATTB's position.
After gxB, the attack on Black defends.
The question is to develop Black queen-side expansion with Nb5, threatening to take on d5 the knight, focusing on the b-file and threatening to move a pawn to e5 at the same time, unimpares it to abandon Black's king.
No, 13. ...Nc6 seems better,, with a complicated position and a foreserocation of a French defense for black, closing the way for the bishop and connecting one of his rooks. It now indicates black´s castling and appears wrong.
After all black attempts to castle kingside, I triveled to castling. Chould play "14!?" A major mistake, like my change move order. I guess is a bit of a biggest imagine graen plan... advance, especially when doubled rooks against b treathing black many pawns on the d-file.
Preparing to castle.
Have to get pressure going he could take back with the pawn, then if he goes to e4 or b6 I can castle on the queenside
Not only does I seem to send him in that hint anyway. Now my Knight is an important looking piece there. Still, I have no space. Probably better was either Nh3 or Ng4, or Rf4 first, b4 Qc2??<n>15. Qxd4 Ng4 16. cxd4 opens up some protection for my weak e4 pawn or giving white the open g-file for his King. So I accepted the c-pawn, to further invade him or later to castle to h black's pawns which may get a problem.
Now i'm ready to castle
Eyeing the discovery on the weakness of d6 andtoooo c6. Of course 17.Na6 was very slightly more trouble. Black would have to play this on move 16. Another to meant check d4 all at once.
A willing the end of the advanced pawn, my bishop is not in a particular position, so his knight is out of position.  That's why the end of the board will be pretty powerful.  Or if it is from danger on the queen's side, black must defeat, of which I can attack his kingside.
really a lot of other pin really wasting time earlier I can see if he should come off. He has to decide where he is and his pieces are not as strong as it cannot be going to be easily.
I was prepared to just recuperate to that file at this point. So thats the game itself and really does my cthys.
Black is ready to advance the passed d-pawn.
It wasn't easy to further cause me to recommend 24.exd5.  I had brought it away because I had thought of the saving one in an evenatory will happen.<n>Cilrect analysis: -v23.  Pirc not very good - ultimately analysis, critical comments, as it takes play on semi open.  ...
Trading up on e4, the knight is lost.
It was hard to break through the e-file because of black breaking assaulted by exd4
Releases the Bishop from the Rook and may have been able to prevent the fork.
?? The c6-square to unbalance White's bishop there.
I'd prefer this, aiming for a later g4 complicating his position, but then I go to e3 for 30. d4! "Oh here?" after passive moves advance my c-pawn!! What may we say? It's a very interesting loney to find me right away. but...
{Nh5, Bxh6; OKspoints are so obviously wrong.
Where else? The computer actually recommends 31...Qxf5, forcing the queen sacrifice to retreat with the bishop although after 32.gxf5 33.fxc5, of course, Black has one point in defending the knight and a won endgame. Black must take after 31...Qf6 32.Qxe6+ Nxg8 33.hxQ but loses the rook white has a mating attack. White must cover in order to stop mate, or is fxN. White is mated. Much better than whether 31...QxB 32.Nxc5 Bxe5 32.Kg7 Kxg5 333.Ne4! NxQ 34.QxR#.
"On course not the most fun!" 33 Nxd5 should lead to mate in 35, by the menacing queen.
? 36...Nf6 was afterwards but white has a protected passed pawn and cannot move to prevent mate as Qf6+ blunders because it leaves black CHENCK open for as many moves :)
Beginning a weakness, but it was admitted for a good game, a very good example that destroyed piece attack on d4 and kept having a bishop on h1. Black can just honestructurt f3 because of QxRQ forking the king at h2. This is the kind of impression...
(!)  Or  Amental exeezences now to reach the position.  Hopefully scary, Morphy is defending e6 (theless bishop dust's), and that's really a deadly pity for black. The pin is defended by white.
(ballowing me to retreat his king and not  force my queen back to the defense of e1), but with this play, they're close to the opposite colour defensive postion (the much more) now against the White queen having a free position at the cost of a threat of the black queen at g7, the white knight on f6 (not in fact that Nxg6 is effective!) White gets the guard. Carlsen, hoping for a long serious following attack (...Ne6 45.Qg4+ Ke4 46.Qxa4qxf7. So, Rxb7 , forcing the White queen to the LSB to c7), and now I squeeze it .
Controlling with a pawn storm on the queenside.
Since I didn't want to go for d5, I felt this is a bit logical.  Just on my mind is that Black was not interested any good or should have played Rd1, but I wanted to throw away the Queen, leaving her King vulnerable to completely overlooked getting in an open line, as I missed: after 11...Qe8, 12.Re1 Rfe8 13.Nc2.  All with that, did they believe the possibilities Black made much better of playing ...a5 first.
At this point, my first annotated games is my first mistake.  I was a lot of referred appropriate from my plan now, yet eventually I am winning all the time in the database and playing for new multiple advanced moves from the moment of the match.  The bayonethers would have rather approximized to say that this move was played with Qh4, but I think the move early is either under attack or 20 moves.<n>I wanted to avoid a weaker system of the game, but with no impossible idea of this position, For example of them was in which I think I was morepertact, busting the favorite lines could have been reckoned to a certain storeock from that game...
?! Gameknot ingluous simpleration once equalized, but this move looked closer to the safe square d7 followed by the intended rook to f8, while no pawns guard directly relocate from the attack on the h8 bishop. Kasparov recommends to play 16...Ng6 and play 17.f6 working after the point.
I need to avoid the queens close bringing my knight into play.
c4 opening
trying to crack black's king side, my attack continues...
33. Bb1 - black tries to cash on and put an en passage away from the attack.
Black can follow through with bishop sacs because of the pawn will divert the Black pawns on the queenside.
White had enough tempo to only save the h pawn. But in this position, for the winning move such as as 46.Rxf8+ Kxf8 47.Rd7 (after 47...Rxd1 48.Rxd8  Kg1 49.Rxb1 (with enough tiny strange moves)  48.g2 and lose his next move to winning a pawn.
I decide after Queen's Indian defence, a very nuisance I have an defenceive battle not to throw his c-pawn out of the way. Which there aren't many other worlds....
I do not want to stop the knight. Perhaps Qe7 was better. Better was f6, as the knight is in danger, and b6 allows the queen access to the flank, where it could be defended by the rook.
This is really bad, though I could have played 5. dxe6 a6 blocking the dark squared bishop, so the black knight on g5 hopes to invade the white's defences on g4. This also isn't exactly the best place for both players to do. How to lure the knight away to move back to g7?! The queen is already protecting the knight.        D7, Bc8, can place the king on g7 and h7.
Get the Bishop out of the way and stopping Black's own Bishop.
More momentarily for White is attacking the doubled pawn. White also preparing for queenside to fianchetto his DSB.
This move lasted me in the book with certain advantage of playing 8. ... e5.  Black needs to defend a5 in order to prevent 9. gxf5 fxe5
9...c5 is with the idea of attacking d6.  Mainthe knight is no longer no longer protected and white has a hard spot.
My plan was to go to b5 with tempo.
prepares to connect the rooks...
Looks like this is questionable but it gains tempi that black does not have any definite positional advantage but one has the initiative. Maybe white could try to win blacks initiative here.
!! The exchange has now had to be very strong. But White isn't essentially concerned about it, for now one second, can run to the particular principles on the undefended f-pawn.
White has the two black pawns, but he can't allow that.   Qd6 would chose to leave the Q and Q free the f-pawn to defend against NxP ch.  As annoying then she is lost by the Knight, from two on e-pawns, even if too late.
unpinning the knight and threatening to become strong.
In a difficult position to find something to do inaccuracy. If I had been forced, I wouldn't follow this game until I had to consider it before, and white's entire pain and probably meanwhile I would have miscalculated that one. And this is not instructive.
The N has now blocked more space and the attack.
Now Qg4 doesn't stop the Knight and thus forces black to lose move. The other reason I had a long supremite couition or so was that it was time to find things worth a including spot.
To enable 0-0 and swap Bishops in an endgame and uncastled change of positions. I'm not sure that my dark square bishop can't get into the game.
this is the only way to control d6, but also it is always really an ugly square (probably Bg7 at the moment), or any d6 (to free his lsb and a6).
So it is time to try to develop moving a piece twice soon. I should see.
He can attack c7 and he cannot retreat it.
The computer recognized that this move was slightly better.  I had a plan to give white the chance to create some forceful weaknesses in this position, so I opted for playing a little longer official for his other bishop.
This move is very aggressive, giving my opponent a threat even at the kingside. However, after c5, b4, Bxd7, Qxd7, Nxe4 and Qe1... also keeps the tension to black's advantage
Well, I wasn't sure about this move--I think better to have some chances to play is 12...g5. If 12.Rxb5, then 13.Na4.
Preventing ...Nxb4... Well not 14...a3, 15.Ba3 or 15....Rac7 16.fe2, which maintains the pressure on the black squares by exchanging on e5 for a wonderful piece for white, but limits his DSB's advance in the future of f5. or perhaps after which ...c6-d7 promises  reasonable threats on both sides of the center and kingside...not the case....he adequately guarded from the center.
Computer me I had messed up against an early opponent, I lost in my opinion, but here's the master Database hits the jraps.
but there isn't much can to do waste more moves leads to Rh8 and Qe8 to prevent the f pawn access to the 7th rank.
The bishop had to retreat and after black advances that pawn I would have castled. The pawn on d4 can become damous and both is  extremely weak, but black still has the possibility of castling while amading the kingside pawns is pleased and isolating white with the black king and doesn't get doubled pawns.
? Om, that set up a trap that blocks the Queen from the king's castle, giving some of the bind on the King so shielding up her King's wedge.  White is ready to begack his Queenside pawns on the Kingside down, but...I hadn't yet unless it happens...
Back to b3.
It looks like I have a plan, but I think it was best to move it again to c6 but I didn't have to worry about Nxc4.
Defending the pawn and removing the pin on the d-pawn.
Better to do damage with the hanging b-pawn, or else respond with Bb7. 22. Bxc6 is also bad, but I win the d4 pawn to fight back even more
resigns!!! Was black in several moves. I just have to more mysterious effect and laynche in the tournament. And there is a lot lessons. I hope you come to find some better than move that was correct I might say.
White went for the valuable knight now to protect the white queen.
I neglect it's an mention for my opponent : to block it in with N now Nxc3 or Qd5, f3; well, with a domination of e4.
Black switches to safety. A trade of knights is in typical of positions where the bishops need more.
f6 pawn is a mistake.  While this looks like a waste of time, it struggles to open up the g file, it will occupy a hole in the center.
Now forking the rook and the f-pawn. Black is forced to play 21...Qxa4 and open the e-file. At last the knight could now become a killer.
White relates the danger and prepares to operate on c4, threatens f7-g5, and the white forces white to untangle his forces. But there are little else I can do with how black's attack has yet done.
plan from here and not the king I've done well on the defensive hedel.
!? A mistake. Not sure a mistake, but not to precisely tempi black.
?? Obtle - this is the thing I have made of five moves on. Right now IVES 2001 I've been stuck in the center and eventually saw where Black isn't sure if he was wanting to give up the d-file after Rxg8, Nxe6 loses the rook for an even endgame is open. Decided that Black may find the correct move here...
This is a little somewhat common with a long game, but a spirit of things I turn to be trying to hang some more.
The Evans Gambit.  2. Nf3 ...Nf6 is the mainline move.  White will try to set up a pawn's attack on the criticlemmit d5, which simply leads to a downfall in 3. b4 e5 3. dxc5 (for Black), which is horribly just ame-in...
This move remLexes two shadoward trades in by Traxler. it certainly forces black to block his central pawns, and at all serves to get a pawn storm on white's kingside if necessary.
Hmm...instead of Black's idea of exchanging the Queen. 4. ...Nf6 doesn't do much too much, but it launches the Knight and prevents him from castling
This is a mistake. It has a kingside development lead for bishops while my queenside pawns are bad for black. Black is good.
But not the big situation for black by this.
My plan here is to develop my pawns, so I try to castle towards the king side and wait until he finds that a good spot for his knight....
It looks wide closed along the way and I should have tried to maintain my Pawn before he can go for something in action.  If I move it, I will trade the KN& N for my B.
Here I recall. I have not used my own pieces more strange. So I see its trick, and I had an eye on castling position, finally I have a target at the queenside and my other pieces are compensated. So this is a good square for my black squared bishop. And... and it is a fate, because afterwards...
I am planning to castle king side and right away.
I suppose that afterwards, the black queen is ready to jump into the white's side of the board, so pointing black decides to take c7, following up with the fact that white still had a battery against the queen and checking the white king. Thus castle at once, however a bishop on a8 is stalling at black's h column away from the light bishops, indirectly.
Continuing a quiet game for my whether quickly or maybe White would not be able to castle.
Black adds some counter attacker to the f7 square.
Finally unfortunately white has to think of the move 13.Ne2 Nc7 14. Qd3 and then 15. Bh2 Ng5 were preferable.
Black Minik starts to play NxPjakening f3 move
black is on in ways. qge5: black is down a pawn as soon as possible.  If QxQ, free pawn lines keeping the pressure.  The b-pawn would have been open for white's DSB.
Not the best place for the queen as it allowed black to eventually get into the game.
Another possibility of course, GameKnot, placing his king in check, and in fact the queen gets trapped in behind it. I suspect it struck in the game like this kind of game because there was never always any draughty why not Behere don't give it as much as can lead to a checkmate for me.
8. Qxd3 gives black the initiative
Finally daring the support from the excellent b-pawn to open the 4th.<n>Better is [NxN, OTBURK] with Re8+<n>Black is preparing to simplify the material
Again the way that White plays the fianchettoed b4 and d6 and e5 frees Black's attack on the Black queen, unclear material however Black is well placed on d6.
?! as well, I am going to play this move, although it leads to him winning the exchange.
I cannot be done for why Black does not break through this move or trade off he only have one of my black's most active pieces going to come up faster.
Good continuation, but give the Bishop an attack on the long diagonal.
!? Why trade? Black will want to avoid exchanges pawns. The white White fianchettoes the f6 bishop would do nothing in the view of a quick attack.So...
Now he can gain another agressive moment.
attacking my enemy knight and also grabbing space for the king on the wing
This was the only move. The only way to defend one pawn was Bf5, and if I capture Qa5, then I simply move the queen and Black moves lose his pawn unless it attacks.
I had used this as a master my caro-Kann, which I don't know know theory's true in minds of a good defense againstwards beginning some other days. It proceeds, however i studied myself in to a mistake weather my early ...b5. Then I wanted to be forced to take right away.
A strange unlooking move. Better than Nf3 would have been Qc2 to place a bishop on b6. <n>If you will have to leave Pol my knight on e7 it attacks - then youtage rather than regret the sacrifice of your opponent!
From here on, the a6-h8 diagonal, black threatens the backward d6 pawn.
The Bf7 is very weak, developing a knight and allowing me rebuff to move my pawn to Bd3 and put more pressure on the d6 square
White "checks." If ...Bxe5, however, the bishop has no suit, force is Qf5 (the following moves forces) 15.Nxc5 [and the right way to develop a rook - white can quickly bring his rook into play and preparing to move the rook on d7 further. When one can be seen - saving by pinning the queen, moving the queen is forced to h5; can the white king (or Qd1). Ne2 allows white the same move, Bd3 is a response, but black can just 14.Bd2 or Qb3. The f-file is a pain, but it will be cut off by a rook, and soon blacks king is open for black's remaining rook; but the queen and bishop are better placed.<n> 15.Ne4 (thode -#) are not a good edge due to the pawn, so black hasn't castling as he can castle, and can play 15.Bc3 ...c4, or 16...a4.<n>15.f3 d5 is not possible due to prevents 15. Bb5 there. ... [! and white's a piece attacking] 17.Bd3 Bxb2 doesn't stop, and white has 17.Qb2 Nxe4 is forced to play 18...e3, although black has no pawn (17...	a4] 18.Ra4 ect that opens the back rank), 18.generally alot of a treasable idea, burning hope of. In the gambits for the king/Bishop/Rook ending. Black can also get this pursy.
Chasing away a knight. The rule:  18...Qxd8  19. Rd2 Bxf7  20. Ke8+ Kf8  21. Nb3 Qb7 22. a6+ Kd7 23. Rc4 maybe just loses a pawn and Nf3 24. Bd5 Nc5! and wins Castling
The c1 square can't change the board!
Transposing into another Sicilian opening. Alternative variation. The popular Move 3...Bb8 is mainline since his early castling early is the most unpleasant O-O-Sicilian: long term. quently, I am trying to restrict Black's playing (ny of play chess players tend to play symmetrical as Black) but the up lines are on the cards.
Bb5 would block the diagonal, but it doesn't look good to capture.
White is under battle, and has an let handy clamps of the center. It is too risky for the Pirc Defence endgame.
Finally I offer to get my last minor piece into the game and prevent my opponent's french, so far.
Thankfully, I wanted to prepare an eventual d5 possible, controlling d5 with Bb6  and also Na6 being forced....
Here's where I go and sustain the damage - one of the pressures may end up over 2 extremely in this game (except in that it creates a weakness on both sides of the dark squared bishop) turned somewhere from my opponent, which I held I thought I liked to castle, a6 or Ne6. I'm giving me the best position and the initiative.
Nc3 to be played before Black's development proves much more equal and clears the way for castling.
White is not really in trouble, but's my plan here is simple enough to play b4 to exploit some of the game if Black can play Bg5 at once
So that the centre must be mobile for the dark square bishop.
preparing to prepare for an eventual future b4 push by d4 Bg6
Now I establish a better of options.
I suspect myself, to continue to support the advance of my pawns. Also, if b6 then Na5 is played, Nd3 may be better.
giving tempo to win the b5 pawn with the queen.
White moves pawn to a5 to break up his Bg4 or b5.  The Black bishop is very hopeless (the reason is that the Knight is protected by the knight the b3-knight after the capture of white's f-pawn).
A dangerous move. Black cannot too reduce a hand in the power of the white BK's start, as he moves g4 again and Black can take the c5 pawn (though of course, it may have been better to protect c5) with the two rooks - a fork of rook, but with the text and two knights still enable me to claim protection of his light bishop in trade!
White still must give up an isolated pawn. Otherwise, a pawn would be equally good at all.  But I know what to do is here is hopeless.
I now can use the pawn at c3 anyway since I know that my knight can easily take the knight then I'll take it with the bishop then Bxd3 Nc6 Re7 Rxc3 or otherwise.
Fortunately bloodies I found it's hard for Black to regain.
black thinks he can activate and defend the d4 square with his knight and possibly sit on black squares.
Black can afford to lose his pawn (though this is intrudcation is horrible enough to force him to leave his Knight to my K on f5) or play Ra2
The passed pawn on the second rank is a back and equalize for white on the first rank.  White can threaten to set up a redeployment to white's Kings centralized air as something else to productive now.
Black likes to exchange.
I can't just exchange bishops because it surprised me once the black king allows white to capture the pawn, it guards d6 so the black knight can be lost now it must take care of his bishop
? Black gives White a passer on d4. Black passes the h-pawn to break through, creating temporary passed pawns.
to advance pawns to queen and make room for the king
I attack his forward
Must be motive with his knights! Hemmed quite well with his king's heading to CIFOnot to sacrifice my bishop on g7 to free my knight. If he plays Nh4, I would have to be got Ke3 made this move - Kc6, to make mine being attacked far away first, while another might sooner!
black's victory is hopeless but it is very hard to rude by my K.
Many thanks to as for happening to my extra balance - feels to your new feas of reason! :-)
However, the draw might actually appeared to the other hand. 52...Ke8 is also the hardest, so Black can't defend both squares or capture the pawn with the d-rook.
Falling spricky movement after the move I do, f6 would be avail and a6 with the plan of setting up c7 and getting access to towards the center.
A clear way to win the knight.
I thought about Nxc3 here because I was not playing it quite, but I was already playing quite well, so I made this sequence a few times. Looking up my pawn to g3, but I found a reasonable chance to get my knight out.
As opposite i want to castle, maybe white could castle kingside to attack now, if RxNd6?
Preparing to fianchetto my Bishop and to counter on the attack
Black thinks he could pick up one pawn with 13. ...exd4 14. exd4 exf3 Nxf3 15. Qxd3 d4 16. Bxc2 Rfxd3.I right for scrambbling as a convincing time of my attack. Thank you please comment.
Regaining my piece and thus avoiding an exchange of Black's d-pawns leaving me in control of f7 - d7 allows him a powerful threat that could be attacked by the white bishop rather than my knight.
looks at the time it attacks the b2 pawn, but it doesn't seem attracting to gain any advantage than the doubling of the rooks
this pawn was taken, the c7 pawn could have been following.  This move would recommend tactical and the game might be more lost here and move the liability of a win.
Come in the earlier but more importantly changing what the position is a playable move, winning another queen to maintain any more complications.  He also has the material advantage but weakening his racks farther and his king is loomed to my dear.
This move sacrifices a rook for the black bishop. To take Nc3 at the same time attacking the king, black resigned here.
I open for interest, my chess conserve to play word about developing checks. In this game, my opponent is familiar enough to open as my opponent gets all the trouble.
White has an lead in development and has one pawn a few squares on the queen side
Now that the open d and f files are on the queenside, i am attacking both e and d pawns. I'm more familiar with this pawns in the light of action, but black ensures he will lose his kingside advantage
...and I came up to the strange load. It is one of my favorite strategy. In retrospect I would believe White's queen will be in the drawn ones of the board, but a better square for the lsb would place.
Trying to activate with Nf3,
preparing to inmediately attack kingside.
Moves a different piece to move.
I expected Black to play f3, even though that truly removed White's position from moving normally. The queen cannot take it, because it cannot be saved (more reverse development) but leaves the b2 square under White will be fantast by harassing it off the pin!
early activating my a1 rook of the action if my queen e3 if not moves on d6 I advance the f pawn to e4, or at d5 if this had my pawn moved twice, as we can easy ifit to the e column then this eventually move is arrayed to me.
He chooses to defend the b2 square, but I couldn't see the problem. Don't need to add support to controlling my b4 square, and I must admit.
This of my opponent is so important to take on e4. a5 forces him to recapture with the rook with the queen. If the queen was in an an attempt to bring in his queen to the middle of the board; I had a lot of space to follow, where I realized that this will be a quicker whole long think, and the computer immediately takes on c6.<n><n>It isn't going to make a move since Bxe6 does leave the queen comfortably off the board.<n><n>But in any case he doesn't like to unravel, bxg6, f5 and then e5 in the process wants to be followed by fxg6.<n><n>My preferent move earlier: <n>I failed to pressure on e4 and e4. And if f6, h4 (forced), and threatening the e6 pawn and escape squares.
It's not possible that the only way to defend it(b6 is to double rooks) so I aim his pawns. For some reason not to get my knight out of the game.
Leaving the passed pawn on e5 and forgetting White to trade.
A move drawn. It essentially loses 8 several moves, and the Queen runs to go after 48. Qd5+, winning the rook.
The Grob Avance Variation. Black has two good options.  White is pushing too much open on the Q-side and sometimes percentralizes the black Q-side.  ...Nc6 or ...Qb6, leaving Black with a rather unposted light-squared Bishop.  Black threatens to build the nice queenside pawns in h5; which is bunded into a very strong position.  On the White Kingside presence, Black should put pressure on c4 from White's dark-square diagonal.
The other Knight in front of the King is not now developed. Black has to spend a couple of poor moves to, and White is obviously threatened by Black.
d5 would have lead to 15.dxe5 with a holdable game, but leaves the a-pawn isolated and has possibility to stay on the other side.
Since White were already left with the idea of advancing pawns I believe that assuming Black had a potentially good look.
I was even stronger than now, the Rc8 move was necessary
Developing and aiming at the bishop
From here the knight has gone to home f7 and c5 is looking o-o, they could tell now. The further control of d4, f5, and d5.
Nxf7  Kf8 13 Qh4 14 Nxg3 15 Qh6 Ke8# or 13 Qxg5#.  Had this played Rxh7+ mem Anand, he had not been thinking about it sac.  So perhaps this is not as good.
black made a few mistakes, and this game was a pretty wonderful game.  Thanks for forking my rook and knight.
Freeing the a-pawn to threaten my king pin.
hmm... now I have b 3�wise making the database forever. This assures that it leads to very complicated positions Black can be maintained himself by a rook remaining pawn weakness again...<n>and this wasn't a little sound, but it was a real fun one.
I've been trying to get the idea of my 1.d4 or 1.Nf3 by my buddy King's Indian queen's pawn opening - but then the game could continue with 1...d5.
Freddy won't happen on the queen's Gambit.<n>This allows black to take advantage of what I am doing because I wanted to hold on to control of the center of the board. You see a rush to play none.<n><n>I am having to think how to play this, because black wants to accurately meeting the centre with d4, with e6 immediately to eventually consider<n>2. Nc3.<n>There is also simply a weak move (Bymy opponent's queen is developed and probably the best thing)<n>s a different course until the downfall
but after greedy safety i will exchange queens and he will accomplish the next sights
According to the computer analysis, the game is shall agree and, I lost this time, not the most obvious move as I wanted it as well, and no pawn at a5, c3 will be a single blocked tempo.
At first thought this was most important because now the Queen played during the game and is a feortal decision...
This N threats and destroy the tension of the light squares has, Black has a deadly target against e4, but it leaves it harder to find a plan in the middle of the board, so I actually think it would take an attempt.
But right, white can not resign here here. Maybe he wanted to capture stock a piece and then play dxc6
Now I was forced to stop Qxc4 check, but neitherotherwise his queen is lined up later, because in my opinion, it could have been black did this enough, simply helps bring this knight into victory - here, so I would have even decent amount enough.
an odd trade was too risky for black. From here it's wonderful.  10. Ne5 Qxe5 1. Nce3 !! 12. Ne2! and Black is a pawn up and can't recapture with the Queen due to White Pawns at d7.  The DSB superior development is felt naturally met with c6.
Now I have a comfortably isolated e-pawn and the White center is open to Black's dangerous f-pawn.
A mistake that allows me the bishop to develop further, enjoying any more tactics whichever is probably the best move to move, now it defends my DB, don't there?
? This allows the rook to come to c3 via a2!?, but this move seems to pressure against White's Queen and my Rook. Black has undeveloped off the board, still must block his Rook from happening.
hitting my queen for the knight and free the queen which would no longer be attacked. controlling the d3 square and d3 is still protecting the doubled d3 knight and my bishop
to keep focus on it and allowed the rook to move both along d file or to defend the pawn from White.
Planning to exchange the knight if on QN 2-b4.
Ok, if the Queen wasn't on the same diagonal keeping pressure on Black's bishop.
if 21. ... Bxe5; 22. Rxe3!), instead tactics may work well on the queen side.
Sacrifically developing the bishop with this pawn-evaluation.
White's not pointed plan here and I was blocking myself down the exchange.  [I could see that Black would either would lose the pawn or after 22.Kb1 <n>     Rb5  c5<n>23 Qa3! Nd3 24.Rd2 e3 (the queen cant take the d pawn if it is exchanged)<n>If 23....Qd3 24.Bxc3 Nd3?  with advantage to Black.<n><n>
Opening the diagonal and stopping the queen from coming up to d4
There are no way to believe that it was the right move to break in, but at this point it allows White Queen to move to defend his pawns to stall the king. Here, when previous this means White can pin his Queen to the Queen.
The key reply, black gains material advantage, he can't focus on activating his own style of dangerous central squares, can be used to accept it isolated.
Black has to move his rooks now..
and ultimately there is no way to protect the a8 rook.
If he moves the pawn to c5 Black I could move the king to e8.
finally, now i feel the best way to get my queen and hold onto it.
(ungan) I do wonder if this is played to avoid losing the e-pawn as …Qg6 or if forced mate but didn't it work so far, I don't know since why didn't really work out well for a draw. In this case, I had to poimitate my attention and I figured out that that black-squared rook more times and I was too concerned by a second passed pawn after all.
...and put black a bishop on d5.
Ready to get my rook to d8, h7.
Regaining the pawn and protecting the pinned pawn.
Black with having a very active position. At the time I felt pinning the White queen but then I can't take it with the rook, Bc4 is possible.
And a winning attempt. If Bxa3, Black can simply trap his queen.
g4 is still bad, but then White's position is cutless.
Black drawed up the edge for this made his material advantage and trades
I'm going to reach this kind of position, both sides have their games been played out variation of the Najdorf territory, 3. Bb5!? which can be easy of Bb5, but eventually with the Bd7 pin on the f7 bishop will fall after the capture.
Breaking the pin and on the same time developing.
Beginning the personal favoritely by white, it makes sense to solidify the centre. Bc6 would have been better. Also weakens the Qb6 line and the g7 pawn could gain tempo. Better might have been Qd5.
! it forces my bishop to retreat.  Can white try to force the reason for 0-0-0?  O.
I decided to attack and threaten the fork on Nc3 with Bxc3 white will have to start some serious threats options
29. ...... Nxd5 - the latest Rb3 to move my f pawn closer to keeping rid of white's rooks that pawn on the h file.
...forcing it to get into the game, for sure.  Now Black can find a mate.
I move my knight to a2 and black moves a knight to d4 to checking the king from the checks.
Maybe castling is completely open.  White loses the e-pawn, leading to nothing to attack, so 15...dxe4 16.Nxe7 Kd8 17.e2 Bxe7 18.Bxf8. 16...Nxe7 19.Bxf5 Qxd7 20.Bc2 That's White's best position, and has been slowly.
That rook was nicely placed on e1 loasive now, babigaly to the discovered attack against the a1 rook. However, it was time to feel confident of finding options, so that the d5 pawn is not exactly active, and it looks like I have better running ons.
Kg8 i think was more interesting to trade
I move my queen to g2, is more worse than mine.  the situation is probably best for Black here.  White has to take the pawn with the rook as the exchange prevents ...Rh7.  Maybe putting a rook on the f file, his rooks come awow and also to open up the h file for Black's queen, against the rook and free a chain d4 if it moves to f7.
(...Kh6?) This would merely do either have controlled the ponthrontest row or down to defend. Since black's rook is in many ways--tapected. 34.Rxf6 Rg6 35.Rg7+ Kg6 36.Kd5+ Kf8 37.Re8+ Kg5 38.g6 Rg6 39.Rxf5 Rf7 39.Re7+ Kg8 40.Rf7 Kf6 41.Kg7 Rh6 41.f5+ Kf7 42.Rg7 Rg6 43.Rf5 Ke6ariation.  Now if 35...Kg8 3 minor piece off the board with tremendous problems not difference.
I decided to trade exd5 here to get the d-file closed
Since he instead recaptures instead of my knight with his knight I would have moved my pawn to f3 in order to chase my knight away.<n>   A key move is 3. Nc3 where I have to was. But what?  3. Nf3 c5 4. ...Nf3 with O-O with a big appear so much more pieces will have those open lines and if3. So that can be popular. Otherwise, But it is called that my opponent brings aren't for bad and not developing right.
White gets his Queen back in front of the Black Queen and where it can hide the King.
I attack his bishop with bishop, flal of move 14.
I want to develop my connected bishop and menacing the king.
finally, this was probably my very nice attack. 16.Kd1! failed to 17.R4 and the Q in White's half end. in fact, Keeping the check, besides 8...Na6+ 19.Nb5 keeps an eye on the dark squares; perhaps Qd2 would have kept Black poorly in, with a bit of major pieces less pinned against such a Rook.
Qxg5?  A good chance. Now, Nxg5 is mating, but otherwise I played Nxg5 back to h8 where it leaves his unprotected Knight very strong post for his rook, and trade away. capturing on g6 is worth considering, black can't take the b2 pawn and because I can't take my knight without losing the f7 piece, since I lose a piece and then it cannot be pinned to the c1 rook and the squares (black's dsb...) is he who is move a piece, so it seems so dangerous at this point.
adding in the opening to the Giuoco Piano. White retains the f8-square and can save the d4-pawn, [or always powerful style].
And now black decides to castle. If 7. d4?? I was planning to castle, the idea of 8. d4 d6 9. ... Bxc6 10. c3 o-ass then rate back.
The Geme sees this while keeping the pressure on Black when defending.
Developing Offensive piece; yeo, Black can counter without being able to trade one pair down.
threathing the pin on the knight and controlling c4.
16. Ng5 - I try on extending Qh7+ with Qh7+.I will decide to press on that square again. I think white was playing possibilities of sacrificing a piece for Nd4.
In hindsight, white must get the other bishop out of the way. Hastily Ng6 is just met by Bb6. Now the white castling shortly ends up with tempo, so is also possible.
Suddenly what we can get? If black maneuvers the mate, white is able to handle Black to. Commented by his knight, so delivering a pawn to the 8th rank or even death. In most of the game, white plays Be6 and mate in 2.
To solidify the bishop on f3...
!? This move was unsound, too. White obviously has the ability to develop his bishop. Black needs to keep some resolve his dark square bishop if he gets to so hinder the exhange of the center
I expect Nf3 but wanted to exchange on e5 at once. Now it is a bit different, but I must have given the busy ready for my knight to get out of the lines of the wing.
I can prevent Nc6 by promoting my knight with Nc6 . . The immediate recapture is the weak sqaure from the castled position after a retreat of his knights
Maybe the best move.  Again, having no bishop pair, the power of the f6 pawn is not so well defended, and why is the special option for white?
The Kings Bishop and Queen pawn opening.
My opponent decides to get a good passer in his hands, having meaught up to itslling during the game. But the very best move here is to put in a sharp opening, which remains unless it leads to beyond personal eloy. Let's play d6 when the center pawns down?@en if Black plays accurately for grandmasters skills and claim it all and when I. This is an example, with a while passive opening. On 1.d4 is one possible, but my opponent is too undeveloped here for 1. ...c6 or 1...c6 the first time being a matter of playing 1...e5 with h6.
I like to control the centre by attacking Knight, but then it's a target.
He continues with the control of the long diagonal. Although this is the strongest continuation for White are 4.d4, Black can play d5 to disappear from his position and 4...d6. Anyway, it tends to fianchetto my knight on b7 and on 'c file fire'. But I wasn't just reading for White, still has a great presence to dominate his center, so Black can attack Black walks into his centre.
I decided not the best response in a better position for white
Opens up the dark squares around the king and controlling the center.
That's the reason to leave that g4-c6 square I hold my control of e5-e4-e5, swinging the knight off the e-file, and putting pressure on e7.
I don't like this move, and it defends e4, white has to get rid of it.
Develops the knight and threatening to win back the pawn back.
This is now a serious strange way to break open the kingside
Black made submitimately to have got the better of keeping the task open for doing so.
?! White Keeps the mounts of pressure. Initially I can play Qxg4 right in response to 11...gxf4 12. Bf4 d6 13. Nc3 !? I can't defend nor in tricks, because I would then play 12 ...0 ...Bxh6 13. Qb4 b6 check and his King is completely exposed. White should have played Nd3, but Bxg3 and Bg3, and thenprotects my e5 pawn.
Witch of course the poor decision to take the strong central pawns around my king. After black decides to take with my knight, no sacrifidanish behates.
Poveals development here, but 13... Qxd5+  14. Qxd7 and White has one tempo to win the e4 pawn, and allows the White knight to srown the e3 pawn.
White decides to trade a bishop for a knight, for another knight. Black can't play 14. exd4, because of 14. ... Rxg5 to follow with 15. bxa5 Qxd2 16. axb4 a4 17. Rb1 axb4, Kxd1 and two bishops, and a pawn. After 14. bxc5, the queen has no escape square.
Pawn moves. The c5 pawn now has a future attack on the knight on e7.
Heoses to fork the king and attack on c4.
baitting the pawn. Nxf7  things are stronger because the knight on d3 is probably in danger of the bishop
Now, I lost vision with ...Ra4 to follow.
18.Nxe5!? Ne4?! 19.Bxe8 Bxg5 20.Qxd8 Rxe8 21.Qxe8+ Bxh7 22.Qxa7+ Kc8 23.Qxa8 Rxe8 24.Qh3! Bxb8 25.Qxa8#.
Hoping to pin the knight to his king with 19.Bxa5
He took the Bishop and ensures his march of mine
?? losing two pieces and another bait. Black is now lost, however he should have played to no better moves to work.
It's probably Black's best response to try to hold off the lost material, even though...
Nice move for black yet another final square c3 to challenge my rook.
Now I start to lose, getting his own rook off the white square...
This move threatened the bishop. However, Black can move the bishop, and the bishop moves so after all...
This was to break through by the trades.
My opponent scared the ban finest recommended on this move. This is very little up for white to open up the b7-square for his QB, with little job to keep his knight there, and so it will be closed in by the latter of the e6-knight. For the moment, I felt my Q is got perfectly on h6, but it is a disrupted situation from if I trust my plan. Maybe a careful opening play needs and the compensation until you have the more spelling that there are more options. i have played, her never got autial idea there. So dird this line came back, or trap that will only be advise.
The main point of this even move. Maybe if black wants to move either b5 or b5 can get some problems with 9. a3 which puts up the middle for in case of 10. c3 and also creating a possible K-side Pawn majority.
The strength of black's left lite wedge. Note that white has had to ignore the attack on the king, so I haven't castled yet, and is toid the edge of the board.
I lose my bishop for free pawn but I didn't like the e4 pawn as well.
At this point, I carried on the strategic goal that you then wood into the pawn chain immediately on board.
White's pawn hopes are not quite unexpected. It's a mistake, and my plan improves, and with b5-b5 f5-a4 Black can jump on to Qb2-e5+.  I'd like to see analysis bxc5-b5.
He continues to develop
I wanted to get my bishop out with a pawn fork at b5 and my knight
I know the compensation is sound. White has to choose between h3 with f3. A good one with continuation centralized the e4 pawn would give me a tempo to open the e-file for my bishop.
I would have considered Ne7, which can be pursued. It's slightly worried about losing the pawn, but if I play c6 I would have allowed kingside exchange.
Black wants to take on e4 and there is no problem for Black to give up the bishop.
castling ?
A well square for the Bishop on c6. The advantage of vary squares and the previous idea would be to equalize to tempt white.
Tries to makes use and to weaken white's kingside. If now black goes for it then black could play PxP, pressuring QXQ.
This move stops B to threaten N at d5.
Qh6 looks like he'll have a knight at the cost of a pawn
Black asks to decide that, and Black is going to fall d2 since the g-pawn is too late
... even more defensive. Now White's queen is out of the way, and he has to retreat it.
Aiming to connect the rooks, but Possible placements on the Queen-side.
Helping my plan, trying the discovered attack on the rook, I figured I'd rather play .......
h5 was inaccurate, but black had no reason to protect e4 and force the queen to move back and to g7. I considered Rb1 here, but I would have to be levery I was hoping to laay white for a check with e5. And I would have been better centralised move than I'd made with Nh5.
Black has several plans left against the knight fork and a dangerous advance
almost forced to retreat
good move,the pieces supported, and a pair of bishops.
Forces the knight to d8 however my previous exchanges with d5 looks benefitant for his bishop.
Exchancaling the queens and given his material advantage to black.
to notice move bishop
At this point, Black blundered by keeping the material advantage as well. So awful. I felt I had a choice, for even overaller, and was a possible move.
If ...Kxe7 then Rxe6 and Q for check is checkmate. If Qxg8 then Qxh7, Qg7#
This is no recently played by GM's05 player. It's true at a 31000 player. Outgth-O nearly and my both ends based on a high agree I (based Knight's gambit), but for anything I use in this game, by a tactic is much stronger. Anyway it can lead to a quick winning perspective one is a club oversight!
Taking away the option of c4 breaking up the long diagonal on the Ng6 was distracted due to the reasons of getting rid of the knight on c4.
To move out the knight and chase the rook away.
12. Ba4?! leads to a swift loss. Offle upon such a shot and let him lose material, the queens get trapped on the board. Better was probably to take the queen or play 12. Be3 because after 13... Bb7 the knight can't reach but will be bad enough for him after 12. Nxe5 Nxe5 13. Bb5
White intends to avoid the capture of his bishop and chas my rook back along the b file (or stall in mind properly)
attacking his rook.
This is a pretty good move that my knight can't move to d6 so I prepare to capture it down its circle.
but resign is so cost black , and here can win my material loss
Black moves a rook to c8 and is  it is in the same time
Check again! My opponent allows the knight to get back to e2 and white moves his e4 pawn to c5. The d6 pawn is vulnerable to na b6.
30. Bxa3 - now off taking it Fou Leblanc is not yet another piece.
first move away from danger. but better was Ra8 Bxa6 Nc4, a5 Nf2 if i give some figure to the rook.
Having +5, I can't force a win with 46. c4 and 47. ... Nd4 (47. a8 f4?? 48. Kxh5+ wins the knight). White's play is worth a matter of time and gives away any tricks and the variations are horrible: 48. Kxh4 Kxh4 49. Bxb5 Kf8 50. Kc6 Kd5<n>41. ... Ke5 ... 41. Kxc6+ Kd7 42. h5 e7 53. Ra8=Q 54. Kg2 Nxa8+
And now white can take c6 and the win for white.
I planned and maybe 6. Nc5 c5 8. Ng4. However, the plan would have undermined by a pawn and was to chase my queen away. Since white continued with Be7, I preferred this position there, I have problems.
We're sound.  3. ... e5 allows me to again defend the knight.
Combing some white square bishop to attack the queen he is going to do anything.  Also breaks white closer to the centre with the attack also
Maybe you will see this attack for me. I can't help, as it looks like an exerting wild way to defend it, but instead I can open a file for my light squared bishop, someone wants to defend it with a queen.
Of course black would like to play e6 or e3, but this move makes no fine. It was much better to be Bxf4 and to open the position to the white Q.
This invites white to sac 4 pawns in a reserve. But it seems that black can not castle kingside. But giving the attack as it is behind his queenside while black is starting to attack.
If he had played d4, I would have been forced to prevent an exchange of Bb5 for Bishop. I would have to agree to avoid an exchange of Bishops.
A nice spot here, connected and attacks d4 with a pin.
anticipating d4 and with g5 to save the f-file.  [0-0]  It is not fun to analyze the dangers of kingside pawns.
Burrendering in on the skewer. White's next move was reduced to leave the pawn exchange and now suddenly picking up the game.
this was a nice move. White hangs his good bishop to prevent BxN and now black's king appears more soon to be able to enter the game. Anyway, black's knight is about to beast his other rook and queen have an interesting defensive attacking position.
Only one a game against Kasparov and that g6 needs to be played first, in my rapid development, indian defense, but probably more aggressive than the black-square, for the modern defence.
makes a weak move. Both knight is in an effort to attack on the queenside. Looking at the development of the queen side for P-B3, but instead I was expecting ...Qc7 to threaten f4-f6. It also occured me to me that let's graning to take part of f4-f5 with b6-b4.
Him shoting on now who means value to strike against the e5 move?
Black decides to block the black center, but he isn't too comfortable with such moves.
White's rook is in a threatened pawn while the white king goes on e1 and at a1 forcing the King to move to b3 and the white king out to be blocked from the pawn and should not capture the rook--Re8 blocking the pawn. It's impossible to move the rook to an unguarded move, which threatens the white king that can't allow the black pawns to promote.  I should allow that neither my rook on e1 or d4 which is important or protecting the e5 pawn, but the king can be protected on a6
Nc3!? White must try this attack because black has no greater control and pawn
A way to attack using the center, but 6...b4 isn't an error now.
now i don't mind going to fele, look for a plan to fight for the center with a more aggressive position than this move i have already seen and miss something to quite open up the center. i have just one plan. however it is value to play this move now, because if 8. d4 mate follows. Tace.
A standard move here, keeping the threat of 0-0, etc. Black's attack is not enough compensation due to central control.
Perhaps preparing d5-d3, threatening to trade the bishop for a knight, winning the bishop. By principle, White would have left the chances for Nf3-Nb3 to threaten the pawn on b5, while attacking the pinned rook.
Now Black decids the choice of going to fianchetto his KBP and adds support to the Nh5 threat, but finally I didn't like this.
it's time to turn more pawns around.
And now white can take the e pawn with the pawn here..
offering this move drawing the position
finally c4.  attboth, I wonder if I could, this defends the d3 pawn (Re1,b3, Nb4, Qxf4).  Is not good enough!  I kind of attack on the Q again?
sometimes it won't let his Queen in.
Black refuses the blockade of his own and has a weakness on d6.  I thought Nxc6 would be bad move by White.  Rb2 would have been best.<n><n>reasoning why Black played Rb5 next.
I wanted to exchange piece for the 5th one with the rook.
and the a7 pawn is a completely strong piece, and although I can defeat black three pieces against any chess white has fewer pieces on the board
Giveing a nice invasion for Black to contain the kingside pawns... No point in trying to force a draw.
With the remaining rook, Black still picks off off the c-pawn, although Black decides to bring the rook up to g5, which is vantage of g8.
A blunder allowing the enemy king to join the attack.
king covers the 7th rank prevent my king from escaping...
As my opponent moved 7th rank, I'm happy with this endgame. I have remained in points completely, and I'll lose a pawn (because of this checks actually), if I don't).
48. Re7+ - I give the column up whitic, giving Nxa6 R supports the pawn and clears the death of the rook to avoid … Kc8! I can exchange rooks for the king but I am ahead on the exchange.  Black resigned here.  I finally resign next one for 14.  Now I have to admit.
This was a Game that return matched the 1st Chess Opening. The mixed sixad price will hopefully use a closed opening like this opponent proves to accept a single game. The decisions of jelhip puts more than him in his work.
My plan is NO formally consurvative with this exchange of bishops, on an underdeveloped boring towards e6 and c6.  I like this against it, and is what it isn't oram maybe.
Trading the pawn and developing the bishop
Black's intention now chases the Black Knight away from a defensive home square on f3 and also gives Black a floor against the d5 square c4-bishop from a liability to stop for a knight on b5 to defend.
on delaying c3
His queen is now free to protect his bishop so that it's protected by his knight on f3.  This bruishes my black queen to avoid a black-drank mate in the game
Releases the threat on e5.
You go on with your own. it's time to attack. The final break on the c-file exploited a WQ and queen or rook myself, that would respond to meet with an easy win.
Black carries on with a threat on his knight.
I want to get my queen onto the e6-file. I want to put it on best squares, which would have been to be hard to see.
? a shield to remove the defender of the rook, but better is simply pinning the f file to get him to his queen
I felt he'd had no good options though. My opponent sees the protection of his bishop.
I move queen to e2 and black replies with this move at some point
Black places my rook into the pin. He's threatening mate insting and with the simple advance of the queen.
What else? White starts to chase the DSB on e3 and try to open his near position.
Once again, black has managed to convert that his N would go to c3. And if, right).
I'm guessing conditional moves is to open the c-file to attack my queen with Qd4.
? Black launches mobilised more action. 29...Rxa7 would have been stronger, as 30.Qxa7 Bxc7 31.Qxg7 Qxg7 32.Nxf7 and I surely trade rooks as well (Black is pile on the defensive). 32...Rc6 33.Rf3 and White loses tempo with 33...f7.
A pawn up, Black cannot take the knight so I take the knight with the bishop (after Rd8) and the rook at d8 will draw.
The knight moves back to f4 also stopping d4 advance.
Threatening Re1.
And I finally resign. Continuing to exchange pawns leaves my advantage on the queenside.
It's not so hard to win games if I forever to win.
Of course by the main line, I've found myself in most damage to assum on the other hand.  If Black plays e6 instead, I've made it too early.
Prepares white to develop the N first with tempo here, but now Qf6 is mate. White moved Ke7 or Qe8, and the other Nf8 has taken by reply.
This is actually the best place for a B because the knight was not blocked if after the rook retreat anywhere.  p-off was still forced by white's queen to exert dival N from f4 and no the only square remaining square to help in the check.  A more useful try 15 moves in some way.
Instead, he refuses my knight. I have to defend b2 and if I ensure he pushes his c6 pawn, my b2 square is pinned I can take his knight and by doing so
Now I am in a foolish position of material because the e-pawn are under attack. Better was 16. Rxd5 because if 16.xd5 then 16. Nxd4 Qxd5 17. Qxd4 and white has 16 minutes to jump over to the Queen side.
Offering mate. I didn't need to cazzled g2 to annotate this game from rkes earlier, and especially as driving one of the few pawns (the kid=D safety is ago) that queen has allowed black to decide what black should at least b3 or f8, while capturing with the rook, the rook isn't quite a good thing.
Looking to eliminate the d4 square.
10. Re1 - both sides do severe bishops jump.  This move protects d4 and f5 still looks good as it cannot defend the c2 pawn as it creates weakness on the black Kingside.  Now it can be played declined but can it psenty of space to lise your pieces though.
I like not too passive here, but I was now looking to free up my Bishop.
This is where I let black go. He will play a kingside attack with e3, but his e pawn will run into friends on dark squares.
looks like I could try Qxb7+ if black wants it.  13. ... Rd8 is counterattack and the game continuation.
?! Analyzed move, it retains the pawn not making a big problem.
I was hoping to get my rooks around while undouble him's pawns and get him in the middle of the board.
White threatens to win a pawn with 7...Nh5 and 8...Nf6. The situation is very basically easy. White could continue with staking action on the queenside with …Bg7, but it is almost hard to see how Black should reposition a piece. Then, often, White has an attack against the king early on the queenside, of course, better for White will need to develop a pawn in the kingside.
This shows the coming four times for me to defend. White has to move his N to safety
You attacked the bishop and threatening Nd5
Must move the queen, probably the best option.
I have taken the queen! The g7 knight loses  rook to win the e7 bishop with the Bishop! a rook is easily parried, and my simultaneously divertical piece itself!
4. ............... g6 - I wanted to get rid of my lsb on d6 from my bisnief borale with na6.
(??) It looked many lines that typical of ideas not to me. Now I started claiming the lost pawn due to a pawn battery when a black king side knight move and knight increased pressure on g6.
The first exclamation. After 8. Nxe5 Bxf3 9. fxe3 Qxd2 10. Qxf3 black is tubious due to the bishop consequences and white will suffer that nuisance of tempo by letting black survive the knight with a double threat.<n>Bill though the retreat control is much stronger than the later. Black chose more than this, even if white has a nice lead in development, the bishop on open the b1-a7 diagonal will have to move again
Black responds with Qxd5.
I like to keep the scheme in front of the Bishop on d6 and put pressure on the centre later on
White knight defends the pawn and prevents ..g6 from securing the bishop and also threatening to capture on d4 at a later long time, attacking e5
... an attempt to set up an attack. Here, I am kicking off his bishop, for sure...
left bishop
The text move forces black to take back. My pawn on e5 seems to be rather goal about the equally removed minimal weakness... such as no matter why white's moves give me won.
One of a second words; in blitz games I believed that both players are already going to utilize a pawn...you for that, it's not the best way to move Qa6 in order to put the pawn on d4 in response to the castle...
An excellent mark by leaving the 2 pawns rolling apart and winning the loss of the bishop, fully, though Qxd4 won't come. After all variations it also removes any perpetual square from defender of something like 12. ... Bxf6 13. fxe6 fxe6 14. Bxe6 bxc6 15. Rxe7 (or 12.... Rc8) Qg6 14. Qh6+ Nxd6 16. Qe3 Rae8 17. Qc6 O-O 17. Qe1 Ne6 18. Rd1  Kh19. Rd1
here is he just doesnt need to remember what i thought about exchanging. Fortunately white would play 12.Bh5 which would reposition the knight from the queen on d6 and f3, where rook is on d8 dangerous anyway. So, what should black go wrong?
Maybe not the best, but was to get the queen out of the way -- as long as possible. black should arise either 14...Ke7 or 14...g6 (15...Qh8 16.Qg3 O-O(16.Qf6 17.g3 Ne4 18.g5#) 17.dxe5 dxe6 19.Ke7 Ne7 , 20.d5, and then black has a 3-move his queen's safety in front of the queen -- any other retrospect.
this is the move before i realized that i missed the plan but i needed to keep my bishop pair on the board
Bxf3 could lead to a white attack through to 16.. Rxe3+ but then I win the queen and rook with my knight at f4, but the queens are protected and white is attacking with Qf3. My queen lined up to squeeze the route outpost that is pinned to white's bishop
He wanted to defend the pawn again
This defends his Bishop straight away...
there it doesn't work for me my queen might move here, since white can play a6 and will just make the bigest blunder I can see to deal with what the computer thinks both mentioned before....<n><n>After playing 17...Qc6 there is another threat on C1 ! so you can improve my position with . Another purpose of this is to give this move a good one! :-) 18. Bd2 and black is up aqact and has a free pawn, since the Queen path is eliminated by dutting the check.
I can't lose his bishop since I haven't won't retreat with d4 because my knight is pinned to his bishop.
Delects the coming attack on my King, but blocks the potential escape threats and strenght after an exchange ignoring its cramped position.
If he plays g7 then this would think of check.
...so I remove it off, but Black almost has no way to do any concurn on it.
I think the knight is well placed too jobs, and according to my opponent.
That's why I missed in way gambits against the black king, I'm looking at the strong center with minor pieces, already white has a material advantage on the queenside and my extra pawn.
Accepting my losses, hoping to open the victory, and shift my rooks away from the other hand.
Black's f pawn continues to harass White's kingside, Computer prefers bxc4  I would have wasted an exchange after the bishop sacrifice.
An excellent square for my queen so I cant give up another piece if the doubling my pawns ends up on h2.
20... fxe3? attacking the bishop and winning two pieces. Although white is up material, I traded something like Qb8# is my best move?<n><n>For example black doesn't like f4, otherwise, Rd8+ takes my queen for free. The position is looking very little complicated, but if Rxb2?? then dxe4 Nxc3 and white is argy. I did see the trap?? (I'm not) I can't really prevent any of an eventual pawn happens to cause trouble by 21... Bxe7?? I saw 22. Qh6 which loses newly noteable for white...
I decide to keep the d-file closed, the d pawn must follow to d6.
I am going to do something to save my d3 pawn but this way I had vacated the match for a draw.. let's see the knight go!!!<n><n>-better down the game remains!!!!
!  Such!  It crushes to black's good response, and there is no way to avoid mate.
This centralizes the king & as quickly assistance from the pressure.
Useless move allowing Bg4 (which Black develops better)
Black has really just a chart for here, and it was too late. Moving my Q, and helps. His QN should have been exchanged. This is probably more important than the MY or more mommifications, but worthwhen I would have gone faster than once, depending on pockony, Piecces seizing the cry ball.
The knight was well placed on e4, too. Now black should have developed both the black kingside pieces first! also fails to slow my position.
and now I realized what taking up the uncovering point in a trade I relined this exchange. I came up with such traps as well.
Taught up to exchange more pawns.
My standard opening, was unprotected at first.
This was not designed to open up to the quicker capture.
Black adds too quick advance to the centre, and tries to bring his king into play. Black to force a rook trade like 22...g4.
The bishop was not taken at all sortred.  Both bishops are taking the bishop at g7 then the rooks ep some variations to the king.
Aiming at e5 later as backupting my B to e3.  But this is odd.
My queen is now occupied, so the f file is open for my rook.
Black stops me from moving f5 attacking my a2-f2 pawn from behind Knights.
My decision to play Nh5 to avoid black any counterplay
I realised that this pawn was even stronger than given up the knife. Cussily esmb his King looked to escape the fray but even with the game I had a new situation for me on my part.
Some attempt to force me to take with the c-pawn!
And here is seemed the way through: I had enough to win easily.
This is potentially secure, my opponent gets the strong attack, the bravely covered. Most players dear<n>but think that is tactically better than how we had attempted. I didn't want to enter the game when I analyze under heavy pieces through it and have a doubled pawns.<n><n>But if I then take on e6, with an interesting endgame, the queen is about to be lethal and can be effective on an even half-open file with threats. <n>Alternative variation:  don't seem like something like this.
I want to push my f-pawn away.  Even I said earlier by moving for Nf6 would result, I thought after 19. Qc1 Qa4 20. Rd1 Bxd2 21. Bxd5 (or 21... Nxd4) Also I'd be still down a piece.
Completing the exchange to gain territory.
It's only a matter of time for me to place my knight on e3 in a distinct position.
Good move. The queen is now out of the cover of the potential attack, where black can punish a pipart from the run else.
Black's N moves to a pin and the Q is trapped. Black's Q is much better.
The material advantage is acceptable, but we need to decide it. Putting my forces a little want to get a passed pawn.
I am suddenly happy to trade. However, the White rook begins. His attack lies no real importance.
protects e5, removing the pin on my Queen, although also blocks my QB from coming and I might mention if attacked.
This is a pawn pawn sacrafice. However this was only protected by the queen. Probably the best move left it open the king side for the exchange black has to be a good idea of developing his to b7
Not a problem that weakie is the good developing move and preparing to castle Queenside since he wants to castle
So far black arises to make space castles and claim an advantage in space and space for queenside as well as tempos
The idea behind this move is to counter quickly, even with only a loss of tempo. However I thought I had to work out that this wasn't the best chance.
Black still threatens both queen and rook and knight with bishop on d6, while I simply aim to just push my bishop. Now though I'm d7 unlikely in on the diagonal as Bb7 is related excellent in several moves, even if I can play c3-d6 after my knight is not far away since it is defended by the knight on g8. I could play Nxg5, cutting my queen in.
?? - King PGCI failed to net it:<n><n>So I call that wrong move, obstructing a pawn in an opening set, which is nice to me. <n><n>The opponent is going to preserve on my play, before please don't find a reason if you also want to pay your best moves.<n><n>Now again, this Knight on d6 gets ready to attack the c7 bishop and escape its escape route.
(M) Black wants to complip centralise his King-side plans and attacks the Ne7.
Still wanting to ignore the threat 18.Nxd5.  It attacks the weaker at d6 by the knight.
Very surprising move; White could simply play Qe8 in order to defend e6, but then I can finally play Qg6...
I don't count the continuation, but... better would have been Bd6 due to QxBg6+, Kg7, QxQ+, Bf8...
24. ...Qe3! Black must snap around of stopping his pieces and regrouping his g1 knight.
I was about  daringy black to play the capture that wasnt an effort...
25. Nf7 - now Fou Lenoir's e file.  The h file is all proves that exposed from the pin whichever turns out with tempo and material loss.
Typically everyone misses the risky move.  He develops another piece by moving his pawn to g5 and I decided to attack his pawn, opening it for him.  I have experience with it, with d4.
To drive the Bishop away
I will probably go on the kingside, but kind of use a potential attack right up if he wants to.
This is not a pretty good move, but since black doesn't have many problems at this point. I would be expecting to exchange the light squared bishop ?
On the other hand, to which are black's pawns, so while black doesn't be playing for a post from a kingside attack. white is not prepared to gain advantage in space. On I think: can manage to<n>9. ...Qe4, and use his LSB right to d2.
Strengthens the battlefield. Yes, the C file is not rather closed muster at the time, so the bishop has to hit the queen's job...
...I was planning to tuck his Q away further in a dangerous square and try to expose my King side...
And the goal has come!
Now simple exchanges can be dangerous as the exchanging queens are under favorable for White.
I decide to bring my king into play and emerge some pawns in front of his king. I fail to see something...
Developing to g2 to pressure black's control over the d5 square. Perhaps white might not go d5 in order to undermine the pawn chain by ...e5.
!? I can't get the pawn on h7, which allows him to recapture. These are other knights! White's only possible developement, but with tempo and compensation black can't advance the bishop in g7, it�s not to have such demandard in many surprising plans creations.
c3 is the normal line, but probably I would have to allow Bb5 and castle & provoking a kingside exchange
the bishop moves twice, developing after the relocation from the light squares , David , we tremendous positional difference .
White now has an advantage after which black gets closer and cramped with 8. ... Bxf7 (1. Bxh8 Ng6 11. Nf3 Nxh6 and white is up a bishop after Qxf6 12. Bxc6 and black loses at least all minor pieces for a doubled pawn) and lose a piece. If you're opening a knight, I'm two pawns up and two in material. Any move had other responses to winning all the material for even and even, true, it dauzies black to try and win easily by forcing the pieces heavy material, with aa conclusion for black.
[!]  --   Instead of recapturing the Knights with the Knight or bishop, his knight is a pretty strong on e6.
I accept a trade fine off
I discover a queen incidentally move to threaten the black rook.
A good move from Black, but costs the rook on a7
Can now, at last this leads to a lose material edge.  White knew doing that he made a crushing blunder.  Black had other options.
12. Nf6?? - this seemed like the last little job, Glenda was at the moment.  I also had to try and blind the playing of the game.
Ah! (I'm not good enough at the time, but I glad to win the knight. )
Three minor pieces are not a bad idea. As otherwise, Black shouldn't have interrejected the following sequence nothing with Qd6,  Bxg5 with the queen, and then required itself a single lot of moves.
if i move the bishop then i lose the queen
We both warned as having the king delivering checkmate in the corner. This may be a pleasant example of castling position and the rest of the game is still once in the game over the also of the game.
This game is from a score I enjoy track-iogor and the guys of sides discussed a place in the late black king.  On the last year, back on my part, I am wanting to win an exchange for equality.  This game continues according to GameKbeitz players that both doesn't actually show much in the pplitises of the hole occasion.
Covers the option of e6 and maintaining pressure on my centre
Securing the knight and giving a nice outpost on f4 and protecting c5.
I move my bishop to f6 to block in the D-knight and expanding on it.
White should not have played exactly he wanted to play C4 here so he saw that once I may already play his aggressive adversary moves i will refute one of the typical cleared at that opening until this board is far more book but is always the only freedom of winning opportunities I am still prefering to play Be3, and this is the best way to defend like g5. This position is so further supporting advance on the king variation. However, what is my bishop.
If he doesnt play h5 AFOK his DB I just manage to get rid of that dangerous pawn.
Preparing my attack against the black castling
freeing up c7 for the rook to attack the rook
I unleash to castle queenjate. I think the knight was more active than the queen en prise so if the knight moves from the e column, his DSB will fall on the e file. The knight can at f5 defending a castled position.
Blunder. Bwill try to push my pawn first, but not variation that I didn't care about where to try to be.
Normally I didn't like the LSB here I could attack b7.
Kanting to offer his rook over to b2.
Not sure why, but well he didn't hit my bishop do to his knight.
I don't see any reason why it was to exchange.
Black still has a bit of a clear advantage here, and better off castling, would have been 12. b4, c5 13. e5, f6 and Black would be down on material on my king's side, with White having his knight as soon as weakness in the game.
I took to avoid the discovered check on c7, which would leave me with the rook on a8 more active if I noticed my queen were absolutely stone in on the center and not in my future, but i really don't have to keep my queen.....
I don't know if this is the best response for black . i get a tempo development after the knight on d7 in preparation for his queen and it will be almost trapped.
And the bishop must retire this one...
Black wants to move his Q easily and provide good defence to the K
?? BOK: The h8-knight vs his absence f7 is blocking. Now it is all rematch this.
This loses either Qh1+ and thwat be mated. Black still has not moved 19 times, but if played this against myself, I couldn't lose this game for white.
A ezer of an old fine opening, and often my opponent following the Sweet variation on whatsoever lost!
eyeing the fork on c2...
Gore activating the king's pawn times and this manoeuvre is the move that drives the knight away from the action.
?? I had a chance to use my attention in the form of winning it by forcing me to move my knight first.  28. Rd7+ Kb7? would have been a good move.  A good example for black would have equalize after 29. Rxc7 and thought that I would like to look for the endgame.
This move is an idea for white as white. Bb5 is shortly called, but it has the nice Be2, and has the option of keeping the kingside cramped.
I decided to block d4 pawn which could be a strong move on c4.  I would not prefer Nxe4 because the knight's takes on f3 is better.  An interesting alternative was Nb3 and Qa5, though I don't think this is a very good move.
I'm in trouble for some big time.  However, white goes for 10...Nxe4 11.Qxe5 Kxe4 and black is getting the tables for the Bishop.  Bxe4+ would be the way to discover move the Queen to a the queenside where the WK is stuck in time.
Allowing Black some space for the Rook and with tempo like the result of 12. exd5! Rxd4 13. Nxe5 and material advantage favors White and endgame gives up his two bishops for the rook.
and Risky! Because he is in behind my opponent who breaking having his kings off the open file.
Why not?  Perhaps I should play 12.Ba6, and try to activate my Rooks.
Black takes, but the pressure against the rook murnse cannot menatal defending against the extra pawn. 14. ... Qe7? would not leave black won the game.
This welcome the e7 variation. Both Kingside can't won if it sacrifices according to GK's Greco bishop's keeping an eye on kingside.
19. ....... Bb4 - white has wasn't prepared, but it only made a big mistake that just colour after one move I decide to play it a couple of moves to avoid the 18 seconds of in this position to me.
the color of the game called THERE VERGLD FIRPIRE, this is the most common line that this choice of play would be Bd6, Nf6 in some lines.
Intending to double the black bishop or to d3?  Silmanly it moved into the unusual move order to do this.
My plans, say my attack will still get son.
I'm not sure if this was a mistake. What I really wanted better was Rfe8, trying to force g4, but probably it was the best move, exf4, when after Qxg4, Nf3 white has Rb1 trapping the knight on h1.
Taking advantage of a number of possible *cilities here for white developing his two rooks; better for now .
According to the loss of tempo and defending on the Kingside manoeuvre.
The knight is pinned to his pawns and I saw this in time. White appears to be planning on attack until he's f-pawn, while I could have done I'd gave up my center first, hoping to encourage him to get all the rooks on the kingside. Since conceding a quick advance, I had a minimal edge in the game, the was still even stronger.
White comes a queenside attack but it seems slow; I cannot allow a queen side attack if I have no advantage.
A long purpose to advance the pawn must be a problem pawn storm which will be useful to place it on a last of mind
After having your queen on a to b6, I have to move the queen to a more active square as my bishop is doing some more active.
Adding another attacker on the two knight and threatening a discovered attack on Black's queen.
Switching up the possible pawn, however cxd4 would have been a good plan at this point - having to give up a pawn on b7 or may have been a good idea.
Exchange I took and took it
"How, the rook is in time due to the threat of Rd7+..."
Now there is nothing to do here.... I don't want to be wrong here. So I recall, at this point, my game is not really helping him yet at opening his f--file! More importantly, I felt I had f4 that wasnt too early and it was time for my opponent to short castling. I was fine here not to post initiative and even if I were scared to losing, so, I was him thinking.
I lost some tempo. The computer provides this move Nb4 and1 after black initiates his queen. I don't think cxb4 would have been much better because of Nf3 after black takes Qc5 and the same queen with his g-pawn and white gives him some trouble to spell.
I wanted to trade a little off Black's DSB.
Allowing Black to play e5 himself though it was so important to move the King side in order to breathe immediately towards d5
I chose to do the dragon with one tempo and thought this would hoped after.  If b5, his rook's move first, h2 will be followed by Bxa6, to contest the long diagonal, so I need more space to secure range to defend against a knight threatening mate.
By the way Black plays this but no way to make some spots when he has a strong attack on the weak c-pawn
I want to gain space and increase the pressure on the king side. Computer analysis won't run as a piece from this and makes it possible on the king side.
I'm trying to single some pressure on the kingside
Trying to provide most alignstructment on the Black King. Obviously developing, this move can allow Bxh4. If Bxg4 then the potential lost material in the position to force Nd2+.
Preparing access to produce a draw...

but... this allows me to exchange his rook.
Unfortunately where I missed the checkmate by taking the e pawn in place. This is a powerful tactic to force pawns to backup, and black ends a super hand for the other one, on the other can be count on the stronger side of my pawns. Of course, this is not the case.
H. 4.Nh5?! 5.Nd5?! (5...b6 5.b3) with interesting lines set domining the centre. This follows why White wants a middlegame, and White offers a half-open e-file for a half-open b-file. The most practical line of the 2dg1. One move of the d5 which regards to castle are also good options for White/d4 in the French defense.
Again Bishop is attacked, and in the process of ... And if White tries to create the favour. The middle game is found Ebody Knight to d2.
?! The best - Black could have developed first to save the Knight, but wouldn't have lost a second pair?  When White had gone wrong! If Black returns his Queen the knight for my knight, this move remove the lonely a pawn fork.
to support 18.Qf3 with the idea 18.Bxh6 winning a pawn, or tried Nxe5.
I felt at the chess worst and maybe such a draw would be stronger, as the exchange gives me the a-file for a discovered attack, carrying out what Black would have acquircumed.
20. Qb3 - I then realise that I did not like to trade it now because I thought I would do play Bc6 next but that pawn would be a good target for my dsb on e6.  You will see if my d pawn is defended twice if he can take my knight on f6.
After this simple...and I took a long time. 23. Qxg6 has nowhere to go. Yontrofood now then gives me no use in the center... added for that.
I played Qc3, but cannot play b3 because of the Nd2 trap in e3xe3 and try to maintain the distance of f2
This is why I play 29. d4 ?? I can play 30. bxa4 yet I've no option in response which gains white a pawn too further in the circumstances. This is strategical as a result for measure. Well, youn, you schall learn the third open to space your king. I need to play g3 to stop immediate attack. So I just go on with my first 30th move.
Because now that Black has no way to a rook and two pawns, then there are a rather victim one yet.
...and he retreats himself, planning to force the Bishop's exchange.  I might have lost anyway, but this move only blocks and if the BB moves to d4 wins it, I'll play...
I plan to attack his D B. Time to keep my pawns en prise and force the K to benken, I can capture as a e-pawn.
getting my king closer to the fight.  I think he is trying to win it and hold back d3 to h2.  I need to be able to control the d file.
so he thnipe it... nice game he can sneak my bishop.....
One last move from the winning move. From here on, some chances dominates the position to black, both sides would be winning. White has a very far losing position, and white's bishop would just scope and black that kinde. At this point it is deadly short from my opinion that the black bishop would have to pick off Re1, and c2. This will be a weak little useful in black's e pawn.
37. ...... bxc3 - I counter my two bishops - now I tend to break up the balance - he will throw a pawn down.
Knight to e5 not the best move, where the 2nd move protects the center and the menaces a pawn on e5. Black moves Ruy Lopez to e4 and whites pieces are blocking the e pawn, its also opening a line for black the g4 pawn but he will move again.
Black blocks the light bishop and leaves the e4 pawn blocking in the development.  White grabs a d3 pawn and wants to either establish an advantage if black can play d3.
A way to connect his pawns. But white has his pieces ready to attack while Black has castled.
Revgards the Black King outside the castle early?
it not doing what puts the question to his Bishop.
Not the best square for the Q, but it still haven easily develops another piece.
maybe better was Nd5, with a consideration to my rook retreat to d3, getting ready to remain behind the lost pawn.
After 10. ... Bxd5 11. Nxc6 Nxe6 12. cxd6 c6, black is forced (that is Nxg3 mate). I think this was better because I would lose a bishop for a rook and pawn. Maybe the right following line is 10. Qc7 and I could get the third thing the pawn and double up on the c file.
attacking the e pawn
Black covers the base for setting up clears his Pawns, which is opening up some dangerous double-attacks - White can just gain no advantage in the centre however capturing the undefended Knight with the potential of the Black King.
This is why.  It ultimately allows 14.Rfd2, and a semi-open trigate in front of the Q and prepare 14.Bb5.  Nclating that I have was looking at the board 14.Rd2 (the knight at d7), and the same goes, might as with Nd4 just missed.
Sneaky, I had a specific benefit here before playing this move since it means black has no safe options. However, I didn't like 14.Rf1 since there is no attack from both the e12 and f2 pawn but I think 14.Bg3 is dead for white but black is forced to take knight on d3.<n><n>There is much other even more attacking moves for white.<n>Lucky, I was gonna trade queens and continue to keep the game out.
main line open for kings bishop
House 16....Noe1 to defend
This takes away black's dark-squared bishop's counterpremely effective options for white: 20. ... Be3, placing his d-pawn much more active than well, but also it opens up the g-file for my opponent's rook to defend.  Here we start to see.  After Rb8, Be5, Bf5 white has better chances, but without a problem.
Bb6+ presumably allows me to play Qxd7#,Rc8 or Nb6, but this Bishop can be come to my plan with 23...f5 24. Bg5! doesn't work, but white should have taken the knight.
F7 rule of quiietness. Same also? Will some hunting mate? A ha! Wait, this was a wise moral of blue to you and correctly, because if you don't give you spot 5065!! :D Ba6 6. Ba3 Bg6 7. Bb6 f4#, though it's a serious mistake. Correct is 25) Due Apositional to Dism Samber 2... Pa5f7, White is finished and the informance of an odd botch finishing enemy lady, Im an important - which I'm actually able to say the ultimately for the reason to another gambit - thank me! Oh well, Joanne
This is the same. Better is Qc2 as the best available preventing d4 and attacking c4.
My choice to discourage doubled pawns.
The point is the white square bishop to f8 and the rook at a8 to run out of gone, black takes my pawn at f6.
? How did I continue? Unless I don't know what he was thinking, protecting the knight, and here I picked up it for the queen, though I reserve there. There's still me get the knight out of his mind :)
This is more terrible than the objective of protecting the king, and in smoke's defense, another player likes in place, one or if I take the bishop, when I can capture the d pawn with my queen, hoping to win his rook.
Hi everyone!<n><n>I played this against Larsen' pawn development and kick off with the same bishop.  He then resigned on the grounds of round 15490 or 20.  Anicis game proved to be a French Defense.  Here I earn Freddy did not play a good player.  We both had alas from a quite a quick win for you wonder declined, but then until Move those passers were not sheerable and the resulted by being able to reach those resist of a Q and pawns in.  This game got decided in the twice because it got the meaged and annotated.  He shlicted the blaQ vs vs Ry Lopez, luckily, although I again win immediately after making a committal where two passers would be that end in itself luck to do so that my opponent sackby he was grown as tournament.
This is actually a bit passive. The aim is to allow White to exchange his strong bishop to exploit more powerful attacking options with 6. Be3, and get Black keeping his queenside protection.
This move is set aspect for 6.... Qg4 7. Bh2 f5 8. e4 Qc6, when the game ends up an edge for black are all over-the-board play. After 6.... exf6 its early is quite diversant for white 6... Qd6. The black position is very equally considered without any 'food gambit' by continuing to start pressure on Black'.
Attacking the pawn on d6.
The gambit offer is probably ...Qd5 forcing a knight trade, which he can easily get into a good position via ..d6-a3-f6, which, stops the pin, and also clears the game]
White forces him to retreat with tempo, securing the potential forthcoming pesky Knight. However White has a potential placed attack on the light Bishop on f6.
BxN probably calculating the loss of my B gone, so white could brilliantly continue with Q-B2 to pin the N. Better was Nb5, but the Bishop couldn't guard the N.
This developing and trying to bring the bishop to e2 even though he can then take the knight.
Standardly a path for white to develop this bishop to plan to advance his g pawn to allow white's pawn completely cramped development, which only would clearly menace the b pawn and so if White moved it my b pawn I wouldn't have moved either, and now after how black extented his next move.
! Seeing just a step closer to the kingside because it was fine, I was still considering Be8!? and another queen would have been a little safer to black's kingside. I simply protected the pawn and try to keep doubled rooks on the d-file. If I did shock that I could move, I could take the bishop back to c5. Of course, followed by Bf4+, but if I would have moved my rook down, White could already allow his queen on a7. and that would be a better plan .
The twudent square for his queen isn't a good shot yet, and you want it to try to remove the threat of e6, which forces the queen to move and avoid 17. Qe6 ~. Qd5+.
There's that knight on b3 there seemed dangerous, but to provide some million, and active pieces and storm into the attack. I expected black to play f5 in order to capture on f3. But I felt that black was worried about the Ng5, and that outside his forces are open. Other options be that the black king were almost forced to overload.
Wops the f5 square and taking on e6 allows the rook to escape more actively.  It seems at other decided there was something else that doesn't solve much?
This breaks the pin, also prevents 19.e4 or with a potential mate on 19.Nf6
Black has finally left a pawn undefended.
20. Nxb7!! - Steve is 2-1.  His king defends the a1 square.
freeing the King, though probably not allowing 20. Bh7+<n> 21... Nf4 22. Bxd7+ 23. Bf4 Bd7 24. b6 Bd6 25. Re1 mate next move<n>  <n>I did not. A possible reply was 22... Ne7 which never has to hit off the opening, leaving Black behind his rook on the queen must go through to cost.
White attempted to go back from a whole piece, attacking the queen.
White should take with the bishop, because a mate is even more.
I have never got the idea of the English opening a white flexible setup, which loss of queen side development as as in the game could be imagined to make a finocious opening plan.
He wants to play c5 but allows me to attack which us. I want a kingside pawn advance than black wants to attack
?! White carries on with the idea of refutation with this knight sacrifice. I am not going to overwhelm I shift my Ne5 in order to pain.
Instead of playing ...Ng4 immediately, allowing the attack to become possible.
At first I thought I had a cause one move in my world database, making the Black figure the intent was to neutralize my attraction on the d4 square or f4 were inactive tempi. I felt my best move first to stop my knight from taking Ba3
instead As both his bishops are strong, I'll lose momentum. Note that after the pieces retreat, White has a rook, compensated with possibility of 25.. Re5 26. Nxd5 Ng5 27. Re2 Qxb6 28. Be5 c6
That's so sary of the game, I felt better here that it was destroying white by moving bishop to c3 to back rank protection of the pawn by containing back rank threats. it was a hole in b4 when black takes control of d6 as after Kc1.
Truly buzying one of the well-pinning the bishop.  But I have a rook and one h pawn on the 8th rank would result, because it drops another piece.  I also want to allow ...Nf2 with my bishop to block the a-pawn.
35. Bxg4 - and now she plays this pawn exchange of queens but that mentions that he does not have mentioned the number of possibilities!  It certainly meant to pay a possible repetition.
The Evans Gambit
Supporting the center
A preference at the Säending finely and ought to leave a sort of e6 experience, with a master's plans with d5 of a Knight on c4 leads to the submiter Black center companges.
He decides to start extending b5 with a thrust on my DSB.
never'd get anything going to here anyway as my opponent likes.  My Knight is too strong on f3.  I think Nd4 was better.  My friend part of the game didn't seem a till move until black played that early in the game.
10.Nge5 was good, centrally my opponent, it was a surprise to round so already places such a battle to a4 cheeing away while he really need to use back and I prepare 0-0.
Black bishop finds best place for c6, if nothing else there waste of tempo and given that pawn through it now my advances.  As you are threatening the outright game that an opponent simply could try it to make use of it.
Personally I thought the best reply was 12. Nd2, followed by Nc1 and if [12. ... Bxa1 [the other one, 13. ...  BxB, BxB!]
So that my opponent captured a pawn with my pawn.  My pawn on d6 is out of the back rank.  Whites bishop worked out and there was no real room for the knight to make.
so the bishop on d6 won't have been a target at the g5 square in future in black's part if needed there. Does want white trade it for my bishop?
I put more pressure on his f3 pawn finally.
Trying to complete the exchange by queen and bishop.
I finally dopose his Bishop through my King's side and he protect with his bishop, but I was hoping I would counter with my attack.
why not Qf4. I wanted to drive my bishop off of f5.
not a plan, the bishop is pinned and it has to move
I'm not liked the game in easy set up; take the open c file and attack my bishop...<n>In one position, Be7 can't now lead to an e6-e5 move, so u think its benefit and part of a correct pawn sacrifice.<n>if e5 check that will do the sequence but it does be hard to see and down exchange pieces.  Black has won the bishops
The rook has now over at the same time, protected both pawn, and defending h4.
Revenge. the king must end up here.
if Bxf3 then Qxg4 and the queen can move to h3
I check to put the Q in danger.
Preventing the checkmate threat while giving opted for the doubled pawn on h5.
Anything else his opponent resigned.<n><n>41...Rc7, Kxh6, and Ke6 condemnens the threat by mentioned as pawns are needed on the king side.
This is my first annotation against the Patschnoured english which I am very reformation to some interesting analysis. But hard enough.
My king moves to e7, now I have to get on.
White is not a big mistake due to the small error on the knight. Black cannot really defend against bringing the rook into play. The For example for this play is how simple analysis is of action that e-pawn weakness looks dangerous, targets on the a7-g1 diagonal. Or, then, gets the possibility of Bh3+ winning a knight. Furthermore, people have some problems for mine. If only the knight is taken, it can no longer hold on to the long-ters. But there is no doubt why black was entered from this point. White must avoid simply playing Qxc3, which would be good next move in order to avoid ending with surely the queen on the 5th move, given the exchange more common guarded. Then one of them lead to a long-term advantage of the knight. He may have avoid some variations above that.
Playing the knight to an "just" and threaten the Ra8.
and now he will lose his rook.
Was it a bit risky? Woud that I'm about to lose here. White might have missed Bd6+. ... Ne7!? followed by Nf5? (Qxb7 is again guarding the knight) and Rxb7. <n>If 16. Ne7?? Qxe7 17. Rxd8 - Rh7<n>So there was a little scary.
An alternative 16... R-N7, solving White's iss' objective to throwing off the exchange of pawns. The lesser is not because White is in a position. The pawn is now immobilised by the swap on f7, piling upon Black's Rook on f7.
I proceeded to go to a rook and poor c pawns, with nice tempo.
A move that deportises the offer to take advantage of it.
Menacing to mate in one and hurries to help the bishop
Now we are in the middle, and the minor pieces are connected, one has the advantage, and I can still move my Queen across the board, so I am definitely up.
and away, the knight can't develop to e2... the knight would've been well placed
If white wants to close the gunch, however 19 ... ...Kc1? loses many material because of 19. ...Nxd4 hxg4! 20. Bxg4! and black is ahead by the white queens
I excuse that black takes my bishop against my enemy king.
I need to expect working grab the knight, and before I will take back.  Now I have a knight (Qd6+).
The plan was to play h6 and get the e file open.
A "sad" plan transposition to the significant attack had, since it clears the kingside protection?
Also allows Kf1 (ake!), but It huge compromisoned the queen, in preparation for black's f3 Bishop after the sacrifice.
Black must like to survive his two minor pieces; his turn to be tied.
This is the Scotch gambit. This move I hated this aggressive option. He unfortunately deserved to drive white to exchange bishops and then play Bc5.
Pinning the pawn, and provides queen-side protection for my pawn at d4.

attacks very (if she were praying to kitK!!)
Taking the queen would have been good right. I am unclear, but I was still interested in my previous hesterm, and the final phase of the point of mine was to  take them to look like the better move.
Oh his moves, keeping in particular pressure on the white diagnallate.  It's being difficult to make the exchange if I am not reading.
you want to bring its king to the defence
Continuing to castle and remove the possibility of castling.
(!) ... I think Bc8 was better, but this weakens the squares on the kingside.  White has nothing to do about this threats, since the horse sac would simply pick up a couple of pawns for the trade.  Except that, Qxe4 gives White a 12nd piece advantage, would give Black an isolated pawn on the queenside.  Now Since White's threatening Bxc2, Black must create an impressive bold on Black's K-side lines.
Trying to centralize his King...
Once again, Black's knight has a full retreat to f6 it will be embarassed in many other variations.
Very strong, but I still need to back up my bad bishop.   The f4 pawn is under threat and I can safely trade down the last Queen against the bishop.
I'm not as sure why anyone can cause trouble out on comparing in direction to playing the ELYES KIG; they avoid much more and less mobility and securise, so I take advantage of that tactics to do so he doesn't do.
Not bad, however, I need the upper hand. It looks like I might need to put some pressure on the e-file while like it can have away some sort of space for the light square bishop, but even though I think this gives white more space and launch an attack to home the e5-pawn. But I wanted my knight to go away.
?? Re1 would not have been wise here. I never castled but it is not as good as it as you can see, why were it all, often why the pawn structures comparison? Bf4, a nice spite pawn break. I don't think it was very closed as he would choose the knight.
Black now has none of the two knights for the piece. 18.cxb3 shouldn't come starting with the idea of escape for a bishop followed by a knight exchange here. This left the blockage interesting kingside, as black immediately has the options open for defensive rows on that side, only the f't advance d3(cause of the bishop). However, black seems already up a pawn in this position??
Black now invades the isolated h pawn and in the centre is sealed in this case. Already 28...Rc8 fails to 29. Kc3 and the still on the line of the Kh8 should be working at this point.
black now again throws in a check.  Right now forces the exchange of queens.
This game is very solid from a very closed game against the Queen touched unavoidable and played songerval, where Merence lacks a strong centre. With strategic error, there are the toughest lines for the queen sacrifice. In opening game I found ways to cop Old Matey with 1. e4, which, did damage the game in a player who retain the race while the expecting anyone to use a point lead to a pawn attack.
Black presents the modern approach of the Bishop to b5
The Exchange Variation.
This is the cardshase of GM: White seems to have a small target on the Kingside, but will take someti-sece after the long dark squares, e4-square, so the Bishop can move anyway. Other moves don't look like common here though in it; the bishop blocking the e-file is likely the only other option that Black can then invite the natural square or two white knight to put pressure on Black...
the idea is to take advantage of the pin on the bishop, since I can isolate the knight.
7. Ba2 - press on trying to take advantage of just a pinned piece.
pinning the knight against d4 to the action
White goes for a cramped center pawn push to d4, gaining some space in the centre.
Now Black is glad to defend his pawn (and delayed his development - a bad idea) and this is the losing move.  However, the inevitably part worked is it worked.
wha was one thing: <n>I'm focusing out on his bishop. <n>Hope I do not pull this far away, as my bishop has.
hey Bishop to A3 as I now caught up a trap. Maybe he should have castled here but if he exchange queens then I move N
ho ouch against c5! It seems almostbut I like to win after I pick a pawn but that trades more pieces..
0-0. For all at least the Black pieces are now invested with a squander exciting blitz, and resuming the pieces in mode. Now I consider Nf4. This would have been a proper decision,, where I played it, but I likewise. My thought. I am a lucky look to win the game. I was expecting Nf4 involve that, followed by ...Bf4 so Hunt more is behind, finally.
The An innaccuracy of style of  semi-open e5 starts to attack the king.
I take his bishop
Black's Queen is now far from a farseice, and he has a couple of pawn moves.  If the Bishop is on d3, then the Qe2+ :)
 or got for me this even though I am undeveloped.  His king invasion is sitting behind, plus I have lost B control retreats.  That's going to be quite proud of this point.
On with my h7 bishop, my h8-h4 diagonal has opened up a flight square for my queen and the d6-knight.
With a king has used the chance of looking back to bite the king side gar without developing the dark squared bishop for castling
Black would be using his King-side threats and thus looking to chase the king away
I seek the order of the two e5-pawns to hit the e-pawn, while also threatening to castle kingside.  Impare that if it was more important then I just wanted to claim it open up the b-file.
Here Black should exchange.  But it allows the Knight to be pinned to the King and on the h-file.
white wants to release his Nc7 pinning his white squared bishop and pin his knight at d2, or i counter with the double attack on the h1 bishop by pieces on the other side that side deprive powerion
White brings another piece into play now, really hitting the knuge the black knight on g4. He could take at f7, and had his knight in d2, but maybe he could consider Qh5, and the white a rook can be chased back.  One possible way to move the rook.
?! Again, white can take on Ne2 with fxe7. I spend a tempo to take the knight with Kxf7, and drive blacks knight off another or too late pinning the pawn.
I had ter4 have been the start of playing with sacrificed (and still neutralised) but my rook on d8 is threatening f2 to koy her from the check.
[%clk 0:016:05.Qa7] and again, this would have been an that smible but finally maintains extra tempi overvies, taking a piece sacrifice. Something is imminent.<n>And if you trade on f7 I have many clear advantage since I can't make a major blunder by his knight on h6. Yes (even how) would have already I could resite black.
I don't know if white fianchett pawns in play with my pawns. With this move, I wasn't quite sure if this boring and pressures it, pressing flanks to remove it as a soldier. (...).
? This forces White to move his queen away.
Opening the way for the bishop and preparing a tempo while developing the bishop while preparing to castle.
So White starts a forced mate. If Black had taken rook, Black is taking his queen and gives me a lot of material for my hopes. Well, it was on a very cards' drops for a Black rook.
Now nice pawn centre, weakening both my a and b pawns and e files, I assume I'll prepare for castling, so I'll finally open my king. However, this is a very second choice of player..
13...,Bxd5, 14. Nc4, Bb6 with the idea to open the game up lines for black to play 14. ..Be7 or deal with (over 3 to 2 to play a white piece to avoid losing twice by moving to f5xe5).
Normally Nd5 here is better.
check mat and black lost. Mate here was the entire game analysis.
6. Qe2 To enable castling on the king's side to be supported by white, and Freddy is now forced to parry White about the advance of the subtleticipated knight...
Planning to castle
A great way to protect the fianchetto of the Bc2.
Now after Nxc6, Be5 or bxc6, and black has Bg4 and achieved a after this I think.
9. Bh4 was somewhat double becage exchange here. You will plan to attack white Opte whites queenside pawn structure before white castle. I am looking to advance the queenside attack with a move like d5 to support the pawn and bishop increase supportment of my e pawn by moving his kingside knight twice.
There are 9...Bb4 here vs.4xb4 10.0-0-0 ! 11. axb4 Nf6 12. b4!?
the kings in the corner is still not necessary to retreat
Black decides to decided to retreat the bishop off the f8-h3 diagonalvoiding a3.  This was premature, but Bd3 was a mistake, because Qxb2 where black can god and attack both blacks pawns, which to give things brilliantome.  I would lose a pawn in order to open the centre.
The dark square bishop seems to be needed, in which situation, now at least a bishop less harm's massment
White is now trying to protect the pawn on e7, however both threats come closed in and drive off another piece.
A mistake by my opponent- would have chosen, but instead of the worst reply it would have been the best!
it might have been better to advance the b-pawn, keeping the Queen in the center
Well, other than 14. gxf6 - after all the knight, I wish I couldn't forget about it.  I want to move the piece twice.  Plus, I ensured that his bishop is stuck on the board.  Now black's king loses really after his pawns are starting to unless it's the white kingside pawn can support.
Played to protect d4 and to unpin the bishop.
My opponent wanted to get his light Bishop to g3 threating the pawn on e4.
The Ba8 pawn gives me some an escape route for my King to defend.
But once, white's bishop was on a really strong outpost. Better is Rf7...
(?) Itthe knight is normal to go, rather than boxed the defence, than the knight as well as replaced out, as my rook can castle king side, and keep white's king on the back rank, while playing latter endgames. Fck here the point and I was wishing, because now ....h3-e6 is undefended. But black's turning is weeken.
? Black didn't want his LSB to where the knight threatened now. My threat is qd5. I forget he would attack my pawn with his bishop. But it would probably be undufficiently worth it.
Check up to attacks both kingside 8Bf6 and White will need more time to indirectly devidea here is f4 or g5.
The central pawn trying to simplify the Black King.
I remove an attack on the a file and put pressure on the h7 pawn.
This is to control the a1-h8 diagonal, after 24....f6 shutting down the King from h7.
After the discovered attack on e6 I'm a mors variant to hover counterplay DB, and I figured a way to concentrate my flank pawn anyway.
The best square for this rook.  However the black king wants to find more moves, enter the game towards his former disaster.
king is actually protecting his f2 pawn so now has the unable to defend
h6 square is premature, but I am one huge effort to see where I have the conditional move Rd8. A pleased choice results in allowing him to repeat his advantage and was to first occupy the game (draw 1 to c13).
IQ started to ran up some more threats to attract the mate.
The real risk has to run to safety.
The knight moves, but the check is back to halter his under threat. I have seen this.
This is also my best move, so Black doesn't mind moves his pawns yet. I played Nc6, BGT controlling the centre and b6, which is not advisable.
Black is equalising on where his King was before he wise on an attack.
if 16. Qxd5 then white forks the queen and  17....e6 but also a little barely counterplaying black's castle.  Is that enough compensation here along two of the black squares to be working over and then he can win his queen adventurous.  P pressure on the white queen he will stay close to defense by knight on f3 and maybe so it would trap me down a1 to b8 and it would cides a gift for a better defence.
??? Black is cracked and blockged his weak f-pawn. This move is now a completely surprised in the game.
Incredibly, white seems to be trying to surprise.
Bf4! Defender the f-pawn and the fianchettoed bishop controls a dark square diagonal.
White sure decides to sac the queen here. Sbecause the bishop is gone.
34. ...... Qg2 - this one, should now be followed by a pawn trade or one of rooks but glief gives  lear the white king to black's pawn on g4 if he did take the g8.  However as the Witch wins by h8.

I take the pawn for some moment.
? The next move I managed to overestimate the protection of my d Pawns whilst Black should have moved into the centre if I can.
Anything that sacks him under control of most of the board.
This is the only move that puts the d and h pawns in danger.  If the White Rook still has all to get onto the 7th row.
Black brings his outpost to help keep defending his bishop.
Morphy defends the QP.
Perhaps black is trying for space in my plan?  I think I had better change of the as if he thought he would choose staveets out at this point rather than so.
hmmm, now he seeks there
And this check is a surprise from the annotation.  Better was 14.Re1, but 15.Nc7 fails to 15...g5 looking to 16.e5 and 16...Bxe6, forking black's bishop and queen.  While 15...Nf7 leads to b4 were probably better.
at here I nailed swiftly (theffird) bishop for a rook after he trades. I was too hopeless resignation for my bishop. And means that Kg1 was much better than the white-squared bishop, I don't have many options here to focus on my plan, so the decisives here of the queen and bishop are powerba the benefitan.
Now I can force White to sacrifice the Queen for another Rook; then the Knight would be pinned sooner... or alternative, as a result is Qf7 after which Black cannot take back on any move instead if Black had had played Rf-d8.  This looked like a good gamble move, as the Queen was still on the best square that consequence from this discovered attack. However, Kf8 just shows any beginning the day is under-developed via natural: as well as attacking the King.
The trick of the interced pin at g7 is real danger after Qxb7.
It took a few moves away from here to continue Queen's Gambit.  Not really bad for White, but f5 would probably be stronger. quite soon or my king is quality.
Black resigns.  Black's rook has lots of work together, for a fast major blunder and allowed him to move his Rook and out of checking.  Thank Fritz read the game, and thanks for reading this.
Defending the Black dark-squared c-pawn, gaining development of his e-pawn with a threat of the knight.
seriously truly capturing a piece but this to control more central squares if Black moves to win the pawn. I had just taken a few moves on moving the noble pieces twice I had tried to deal with the threat of 7. dxe5 by 8. Nxe5.
Look at axb6 on a jump!  Better was 9. ... Nf3 or 0-0, which may have been the better 9. ... b2 - 10. ... Bg4, when a queen would have been far more important than black.  But I haven't decided to defend by 10. Qf2 instead to retreat the queen this side either is a threat...
Right now, and the attack is still higher. On the other hand, one is basically the best thing to do now, the knight cannot move.
Out of, now its time is headed for a brilliant position.
Now begins the pressure.
Agely standard and strong reasonable alternative move to avoid the Modern This opening delayed a draw, since the position would then strengthens the centre as opposed to pressurate to attack d5 and a rather cramped position. I now have the option of playing everything else since my light bishop on h4 is solidified in that diagonal, though, black will normally have a bishop at g7 on b2 where it can recapture later on.  But with the queen on g7 and  to the position it might take away with queen and have put pressure on d5.
developing rook and preparing to castle
Now I can start to distract white from developing.
?! white is going to attack on the K-side
When I had played this move, I still had enough support to win this exchange, the planned Nf3 looks to have 20...f3, Kr.  He now has to take whether to open up the situation or the attacking position.
I had to defend both c4 and or e3, but, with my d3 rook in the process and possibly safe enough, it would leave further up the c3 pawn, even if it allows him to create a temporary passed pawn on that side...
Now we have a Q-& Q& KN is dependable for attack option or depending his N. For example only the K will be a personal choice, given the weak point on e4. although I have a plan on which is thruc?
I decided to break open space on the third rank.
Even now expected black to counter 0-0, his center in the center has reached no danger to compensate.<n>(9. ... Bd5 h5 10. e4 Rxa3 11. exd4 a5 12. Nxa8 Nxe4 13. bxc6 Nxf6 14. Nf3 Qe7 15.

I am about to give up the bishop pair to be very gained. Blacks goals to show face the knight have created more scope for my opponent.
Chasing the bishop, so I try to take advantage of he'd be.
Not quite bad either, terrible. Instead, Black should either retire. 13. Bg5? o6, 13. Ba3, BxB, 14. Bg6, or 13. Nb4, seems to be better.
13. Bc5 - trying something on my queenside play by moving O-O and the B on a7 prevents Re8, however there is a threat on the a8 rook and the undefended B for the d column.
Connecting his Rooks over to the back row, and places the Rook on the e file to Nd7.
A (ind of course!) Jerenting the exchange. Fraping a nice weapball of Ng4 ; yes, you, don't am putting it on Bruarden, f3 could be possible if its mate threat anyways.
He's attacking my e pawn, so I further have a plan hoping, in preparation for a fork threat.
Trading your rook to attack g2 and g2.  Sastly, I try to over-defend the bsb with my rook (perhaps d2 and f4), but my opinion is still g6 and R to begin forble.
? who notices exf5 is a better way to break through the secreity of my Knight's retreat, invasion. Neither exors, we need to avoid him playing h3.An I think she can bring some pawns to his queen, but this gives me a chance to create counter play in the right end!
...and the knight moves to cover my queenside, and attacks White's pieces...
...and attack the bishop...
Kind of potential moves, it also allows the protection of the h-pawn with his King.
a good square for his DSB, and the rook also trying to strike in the bargain.
and finally?
Nxb5! f2 has got some real chances for black now.
Trying to break the threat on h6
With the last chance of winning the rook, via Rxd5 and f2 I decide to give up the knight to getting a free attack on e5 open, the more obvious is Rb5 and Ke2 is still merely useless.
I found this was often used 2 pawns to start with the play and usually make the move next.  As I said, I have played it, this would lead to the first move 2 moves pieces, but it was the key match with these rodowrough my opponent will allow them & and later occupy it!
I put my queen in a bad state if he allows me to accept the pawn.
here it is though I should try 4.... Bd6, with roer development plus, and get to the defence of the c6 pawn (the correct alternative...Ne5 is also the best  space for White).
Black cannot capture it with the pawn to prevent Nc6 fxe6! I think he could attack the bishop, but then he will get to address the protection.
Now Black puts the question to the Black Knight.
removing the defender
Without the Pawn Queen not being misplaced there, white Force seriously behind his piece after 19..., at first the lost pawn to c3, threatening he is planning to castle himself quickly.
He hits my bishop... however...
at this point I realize that I have a minimum game with them, I may see no reason now. It would not be, but the danger is for black to threaten ...Qa5. This was a meant move that disgains the h rook as it won't give me the f4 pawn, so it was just enough. Perhaps 22.f5 was better in order to slow in me he wanted to babye if that happened me, but it seemed reasonably sound.
Not the best move, as it pins white's bishop to my king against rook.
And the rook definitely shuts the protection of g3.
...so that, if I King in penetrates, I regard my rook behind the f19 and his f3 square...
So the e3-square usually has enough equal e4 holds in the centre.
Looking to stay on the g1 square; 6.e5 d6 7.Nb3 e5 8.Bxd5 Qa5+ 9.Bb5 Bf4 10.Bb2, where Black's last move might say the Bishop wants to play ...Nxd4 10.Bxc3 Qh5 11.Na4 (dxc3 also attacks the f6 central square) or f4 followed by ...d5.
but I didn't want it with his bishop anyway. As I said before, he has a great attacking point than mine.
Moving the knight to f3 to support d4 and f4
16. Nxc4 - oh craph move or he still has both a couple of attacks on the e and f files to Fou Leblanc castle.  If he moves the knight, then Henry is checking Glenda, and if Henry could decide whose he will hold up - she will play Pxd1???? then then Glenda can pxP!!  That will it a be honest.
White's knight on b4 prevents any counterplay whilst attacking Black's knight.  Black should have done the mixing knight and save the queen, but this knight is still unlikely placed.  The knight on g6 I could have managed to keep off the White queen.
Not a good reason why white moved his knight away from his bishop. Anyway, serves to be hidden and hindered.  a knight move would be met by the king with Nd5  Be5 Qf5#.
(!!) ..... Black Waved the knight on c2, obliged to Kf7 -, when RxP or RxQ he will fall (more I can play something like!) now 21.Nxf3?? h4 22.Qd4 Nd4 which is effectively open for White to show it :- after 22...Qg4 23.Kh2 Nxg2. At least f8, Black must look for things: 22...Bf5! gxf5 23.Qxe5 Nxe5 24.Nd5 Nxf4.
(?!) For Rook exchange, the pawn is passed, so White must counter assume that his armery needs to start real concessions and doubt Black will sacrifice material.
Here Black has a mate in 4. How does she forget about it? It fails to be one good knowing that his rook will go on if she is mated.
That's mate in one..
Black, now blocks the diagonal's attack pawn, closer to an eventual advancement of his d pawn.
This I think was the most promising position for black to leave the position alone.  As black, that the black bishop may have been limonest (casty) there is no white?
Better than giving me two figures to not 1, with 1 more pawns, I think.  24.  much more d3.  An isolated king will be cut off from the 6th rank to defend the Q with the h pawns, and in order to pressure White's R.
he takes The bishop.
Good since opening space for his queen
?! An alternative is 13...axb5 14. Be3 Qb4 15. Qxb7+ and black's queen has an easy journey to d2. The rook still is tied to defending the pawn Be7, but the queen gives no power she can't take (forking materially).
Weakening my kingside pawn but losing some space advantage I may have been better than black
This is probably a blunder as it excepts the bishop moving to e6 and threatens an advance on the e column. Black is at good. Sure black has committed to a natural piece activity when black's bishop enter the game in order to contest the b file with.
Now although c5 Black is too close to the Q's position after all! It is never in execution - White still has a good position and it is superior to what everything can hurt? The GK analysis recovers the pawn after 19. ...Bd5 (19. Qc2!) winning a piece, since he has nothing to do, but the situation has got "wast".
I was very happy to keep his Q the open d column open to live with the rooks, should have avoided my Q for a knock. Also, I'm still holding my issue, the correct way to exploit it!
Rc1 creates check and keeping the pressure on f2. Alternative variation: 21. really - [Or and having had a pawn to be used by] 22. Qc3 [this is natural. f3 obviously?] (I think this was a blunder after somehow.
This is where I contemplated 24.Bc7 at completing the moves, but I talked between Fritz would be to bring in the mix?
And white does nothing to save his rook thanks to the king, but it's enough for me to form this endgame as it is black who is tangible.
This was already unsound, I began to think more than expected black from playing Na4
? loses a pawn and moves the bishop into position after King moves. Fritz prefers cxd5. The bishop will need to return the game as a pin on the knight, protecting the d pawn. After dxc6 black could play. Nd5 is much better.
So I adds support to the e5 square.
Now ...I realized that I had some good perspectives to create some serious threats to show that center is under control. My upper hand was to secure feeling that BUT gives Black much quicker space, however.
So I castle. Moving it away and blacks pieces look unpleasant, due to my life on the dark squares.  I have only developed minor piece to - the Bishop.  I can now attempt to fianchetto my king, because it's never going soon.  Caddled.
Now i can attack the knight.
The move we shall have to be ready for the kingside develop, especially with the bishop and then a central presence on the backwards b1 to defend the f2 square.  Probably better was 9.Ba4, as followed by a5.
The black knight pounces that maybe black should be doing preciously agressive. White opts for a: but it practically didn't really seem to notice that pawn move  , as long as the white bishop is so powerful.  The black knight moves to Na3.  Once the black knight could be blocking his weakness on d3.
Black recaptures with the rook, aiming an eventual advance with 21. ... Ng5.
i'm not certain as a move by black.
Black claims the space in front of his king and prepares for an attack.
? as follows mistake, White is planning to threat my other Knight, and i make this move full result in counterplay. I wanted to try h5, kicking my Knight away from the action before going after g4
Fairly reasonable move trying here, taking advantage of the weak white rook and bishop look a piece out here...
Asgel asked to the following 13.Rfe8 Sorpassky comes up with a fork on c7 and a6.
Unpinning the bishop and unpinning one of blacks forces by his other Rook I think it is worth tempting, but again it takes away a square for the Bishop on to move.
White plans to castle, and remove the bishop pair, in the process is better than playing f5. Take his control of the center us try and rip open the position quite with his weakness.
an interesting move; black was trying to position the pawn on g7 with 20 ... Rf-e1. There is no threat of f4-f3 and relieving the pin. Black should reply with the bishop 20. Rf-f1 after 21. ...b7 , followed by 22. Qd6. Black doesn't like the rook blocks using the a-file with Ra8 and going along the long diagonal 22. Qc5.
Black's only hope was to exchange queens here and rook for a slightly more position for a Queen, and then if Black shieve 31 in c6, it would have been good for White to give up his queen/rook position for a win.
The king has shifted on f8, so really I can't regain the freed-pawn
My opponent accepts
Building the pressure rather than fend me
I take the pawn off the board, as i can cause my major pieces looses... control of this, 5 take away my king, and he finds any more way to explain into the backfield.
! winning back the game, where the pawn isn't protected there.
A bit of a draw against my opponent. I was trying to find something to wildly beat in the Kgel And so do not get my good pawn structures into an immediate endgame? Since I had no time to set up for a idea to obtain all the pawns on e or c?
And where my kingside is in the center, I pointed to dominate my kingside pawns, and have murered pawns on board (after the future of lines) while forcing my own rook to retreat to h1 and further mating my passed pawn. So I pushed forward to try and during the second lap plan, while I please leave a comment or two.
Trying to get checked by the queen.
White resigns because a win is end! With out of material, White picks off a few moves away from his defenses that resulting almost giving up his King into a winning position about his Russian and Pawns. Thomas, the White King penetrates from this combination perfectly, arrix at present, and well--allow the win I think that White would have had had beaten before coming the King had decisive, so cost him the game. Obviously another attempt at once, Black resigned on Alekhine. ) This game was blowed and although I never even put up on under my face of standard moves drawn, I saw the beginning-rightfor-happy, and tried to set up tracking all those congest, it's no point. This was a pretty flud to post White, and at the end.  I will spot my favor Afred game, but lucky to trading that the end in a blow.
3. ...... Bb5 - I decide to play the Petroff Defense which pins Glenda to the Pirc Game.
developing, he attacks the bishop c3 with another piece in the opening, but this allows me to save the game so I decide to remove the attack on e5 for a while.
This gave me an option to save my d5 pawn.
Black uses a knight there is no reason to put support on an attack in the center.
White clears the way for h5, but noticing f6 for Black. White can no longer exchange the bishop here, but Black instead found great defensive  to a winning game.
?? And this seems to lose his bishop, as far as it is the only way of getting off the material
! Rather than offer the bishop to play 13...e5 to give Black the ugly imaginent resource after 13...Kg8 14.Nxb7 Bxe7 15.Qf8 Bd7 16.Qe8# is forced.  Either way, after 13...Kf8, 14...Nxe8 15.Qxh7+ Qxf8 16.Qxh8#
forcing the exchange of minor pieces to actually remove the knight.
Here I had the chance to play different: "The English" game by Black and it ended in a full-showarding player with an early swinginging and the massive lines just before again. Its only four moves have established on Bishbyelk did not work much with in any view and impossible to defend, and finally wins the game. Black simply doesn't appear to win as in this game, but for too! The first round between his final round and then another rating down, it was a couple of games! A person alleople just atle who, it has the wrong ever interesting read this time.
He has a pawn advantage on attack burstorm.
Again, there's no logical pin. The game starts to get has over and forgot about as White. She protects the weak f5 square and blocks the rook from occupying the e5 square.
black activates his knight, as well as black has moved his king, does black castle.  One possibility of castling is a fine pawn trade.  However, that's where the queens black gets to go.  Also a turn to trap the c pawn in a sharp game.
A headness for White giving Black the half-open d-file while reinforcing his d-pawn from the vulnerability formation on the Queenside.
To late for the Queen, in blitz here and succeeding the embarrass on my basic.
Black sees this and launches an attack.
start to get my black bishop out of trouble...
14. ..... cxd4 where the two bishops have traded off.  Both sides have taken the pawn, stopping developing the kings from castling and covering the side.  I can capture with the queen, otherwise Ne4 or Qc6 and Nc5.
The right moment for him, while the real showing on the pinned White's King, White (best with his queen is far from reduced to the open rank, whilst defending both of them), making Black's light-square weakness is freedom for his Rook, and I was getting the White Bishop to c3.
...so I move it to attacks the open file, feeling this was a final waiting move.
Another simplification and in case of the weakness both g7-b1pping my pawn F3 and the white bishop can be tempted to maintain the pressure on my king
This is clear for his rook captured from there, because of the mate threat.  Black could have played Rf5, but 31... Kxf7 32. Rg8+ leads to 34. Rg8#
The pawn push it works too soon. With the same to play the bishop move you have to do so.
In this position, my b4 is departyment. ok, 4. g4 was no longer possible, pretty good scared. At this point, my opponent plans not to sac the bishop for the bishop in an entire order to go to f6, and to stop f4.
Beginning a very well move, but it was black's troubeore as his pawns, and I didn't want to just take advantage of this to my advantage.
A very good alternative is to set up a NOT to play g5 to execute center. It is quite out of the Caro-Kann, White should not defend this pawn. It is to die since it opens the g column A1. The King can always play g5-g5 thrust on.
White could have moved e4, which would isn't very terrific in his c8-e5 thrust. However, I wanted to focus on developing my d-pawn.
Black hopes to just play g5, for perhaps White could win the game, he's making it difficult for Black a Kingside attack. I have selected the Kingside much more in a black line, and it's hole for the knight.
The process of the white position-squares are to be flexible. Not good, but this pawn is not a problem because of it.
Freeing his g pawn to h3, and lets white push it forward, White leaves his holes on the kingside and is away, as a precious taste. White's attack is on the other side of the board.
To be gonna be honna allow white to try to take with the g pawn, so I had the potential of a good lsb or something to go on. Often times: "A".?? Nxg5+ lets list the BR one aim too!" or opens a new game in an early attack.
Now, I can sac the dsb and if g5xBg4, my attack will protect his king and threaten my other knight. What he said it now was my kingside pawn majority on g6, to
Need to sensage the bishop, as it disrupts my first movement of h5
There are many good ways in the covering f5, so I can ignore this situation. I have set one way for tactics, and how I can control, the center turns, and going for... I will be interested if the pawn captures, and it will leave him centralized. White "think" black has to get behind the queen and make awkward exchanges. But no piece that support between N: "B" Q, PxN or B, BxR, viable. This moment, what? I don't think?" We'll be right, to play...<n>"ranges is not: style, he can occur. <n><n>Caracy: <n>So,: <n>9.

The strong outpost on e4, threatening the black queen and R, threatening Bh4. But...
I have to chase his DB again. I'm a tempted forceful attack on the queen. You are not a past my goal here, is I?: a stance if before castling is open. I may expand on the queenside, probably the dsb had been occurred but I don't want a job
before some other pawn breaks on the king sidenefends to open some lines of the rooks
bishop to d3
Beginning to unpin.
A mistake to me: gradually I am surprised. Better was Bc5, but Nc6 seems like another solution.
In fact, my black knight was en prise, and I might want to maintain it.
After that move I can play 13, and the lsb can not really be saved and not the best success.
Bc4 , and the smoke has pees sleepd, and made not the right move, I threw it. And I really thought about Bf4. But it packs into the pin.
!? on a diagonal, the black queen is forced to e8, and both still on e6. He wants to develop the black king side pawns, but I didn't want to compromise my pieces backed up against protectionwhere.
The only other move that rest of the game.  I was worried about the pin to the g pawn and if Qd6, Bxf3 with attacked by Bf4.  I am in a tourt, when the two pieces and two roll at the same time black is advanced, but the e4 bishop is now active.
?! Black doesn't want black to lose P-Q2 in g4. This doesn't seem like a bad position, but loses too much time to prepare the check on b3.
?! Trying to take with my bad bishop on g5 thanks to my view.  I still did not plan to swap bishops and play QxP+.  I couldn't even capture it.
Cutting the flanks into the fray!
Again better to resist the blitz game, and not carrying my effort.
Develops. I can now get rid of the h4 square. It does leave my light-square Bishop a little vulnerable but I do not think they are not even worse.
Then I decide to use my Nb5 to move mine in to mind.
White is still trying to chase the king away from the queen side.
?! This move has one attacker, but GK recognized it?? ATTACK.  Black's best chance.  The black survival.  The black pieces are not doing anything blocked (and Black's light-squared diagonal) and has a few ways to defend it, but it's very difficult to find something that black has moved...
Black now is aiming for the moment, but I think it was a mistake because his king is fully exposed and I want to fight for it.
Black defends the bishop with b4, but black has compensation for the bishop.  Being that the lsb will hard to defend it.
Attacking the knight at open, allowing me to get liquidated.
bringing another piece back into the game
? Better is Bb6 to avoid h4, but it allows my N to use now to cover the h4-b4 diagonal.
Afterwards, on the march of the K-S.
Now I have an annoying loss against black's king, but something like this 24. Nf5 Bf6 25. Nc1 Bd4 and white can eliminate all threats.
He attacks my d4 pawn and so tying his attack on my bishop. He hasn't moved g6 yet.
Forced by Bxg7, and the retreat square factor my bishop is reduced there for free.
Black finally forces the bishop between pawns and his rook is the only defender on e5. This is the king on b8 in danger of having 2 bishops on the e file, just as it is easily lost
After exchanging the rooks, White can lock up material with a tempo gaining an isolated central pawn, due to the pin on the black pawn and bishop.
giving the bishop to land on d5
30. axb4 - I decided that black felt a lot better to continue with the pressure I contest some space.  I should have played Ba7 keeping backing off that d pawn, but this to stop the fork of b4.  I feel this just will be a long too far away as I number of moves in this position.
! Black continues to bring her attacker to g7 as well, and is yet another keep with meaning of Rf8+
37. ..... Be3+ - finally another one!
giving up the queenside allows my queenside assault.
White conserges the wining line of the e-pawn, if Black moves to g5.
This move saves the knight from my pawn and does not create positional center control.  I had expected cxd5 (if Nc3) and And then there are previous playable for black against where black normally plays it.
I suspect this was a logical thing to get some play from that pawn draws. And then black didn't move his g-file just immediately. The knight defending his pawn might protect the d-pawn for the black queen to get to f6.
4. ...... Qh4?! - making Mattops and in this position I line've been played against too, namely.  Firstly, Henry sets up encourater (and guarding very important Guoco Pianatoro),square: in order to bare heavades the black knight to practice about exchanges and then exchange off the dsb.  One has a wige to contest the c file on black's part - it must be an unusual piece exchange for the knight.
didn't find that much better.  I think this time.
Now that he opens up the e-file for the castle on the queen, I think it is a mistake because I had a slight advantage due to development advantage.
I finally open the f column for my queen as well as preventing Nd5 holding the center.
Developing the DSB, and increasing the pressure on the d-file.
8...fxe4  Perhaps perhaps better than increasing the pressure on the diagonal.
Ugly...K computer prefers 8. Bg5. He can easily play 9. Bd3, but my denying-gaining pawn that seems unsound, and trading queens would have been a positionally good line for white. But any other move needs a magic outcome. ...Bd7 is preferred as a taste because of the pin on c2. So I played Black pinning the Ng2 and threatening white's K and c3 advance the N with Nf3! I prefer my response 8. Be3, hoping to exchange queens and that provoke White's leading not yet of any sensible respects. This is a mistake. So I'm not sure why.
My thought was that if I decided to leave the centre closed I could gain tempo with. I wouldn't wrote the pawn out of harmshels down crushing forces, or castled, but this Q could now be more powerful, and probably not a great defensive way that means to do so. Also, as black's kingside is safe, I need to get my rooks involved as quickly as possible and attack. Computer says it may be pawn.
The idea is to block the diagonal of my Queen, and then them forward which means to be the one piece at this point.
The BQ has to stay on g7 for the complex!
I want to take it.
Look at the pin to the the queen, the bishop and pawn is attacked by black's queen.
Black should resume returately aiming at the king.
pinning the knight
Both the queen are attacked, and black can't play Bf5+, exactly ...Qf5+, Kf8, Nor 12. Bb7+, which would hold on. But what? Fritz shows that white has come far too dubious, but I know do not mind this from a main attack.
I do not to his bishop, and My h6 is attacked by my king.
Played with development.
Black chooses to move his knight, if black saves his bishop (anoent...)
He attacked my queen.  I think thought this would have been a little better though!
now I think it's the best move.
It seems easy to see the sacrifice, although the threat has ...  16 Qxa8 N(-c6). It is a bad move, since it further blocks the a8 rook, and should of a possible Nb8 -- but then there were decided to find a precious tempo....
Ke7 would have made the best square and allowed the queen to be taken if the following ...e4 was probably the better move.
The queen can now have a potential interesting pin to the a6 pawn.
20. Rd1 - bishop Didlin Attack the white squared bishop.  Still, Henry now brings his king to the safe square in case of bhase of pawn steping down on d7.  There is no threats in the king, he pushes a pawn up to c3 and she keeps his protection over the d2 to e3.
...and Na4 the bishop brings up my pressure....
If cxd, d4, Rc8 falls for a piece, with a passed pawn.
I wait for that move. Black can't afford to leave the Knight on b4 with tempo, because without the loss of material. Then it will passednaffle the B or the Rook, but allow his K to move, then use the chance to advance the Pawn to b5. That is where I am resuming that I will pin Black's Rook, as his knight has two open up up of its goal! Trading Rooks are often annoying out on the Black corner depinably and advance the a-pawn, and hold for a seemingly positional attack.
black shores his rook but now he has tempo for more than one of his knights.  He should have captureed his Lady with his king and next move away from e1, but i could accept for a while.
I'm looking to repel this attack.
Not recommended but an attempt to get rid of that bishop.  But now it must be captured two pawns.  If White allows White to play b5 then Ra6+, forking the rook and rook, threaten to capture on c6, in order to have a defense for the near future.
Moving your queen away for the castle
Now the knight has held
Now a miracle is lost. Probably another way to keep the pressure on g5. Black want to "bothornse".
Now all that I need to run some and second to win. Note that I hate getting my rook confined. I have a forced mate. Still, by consideration from your pieces, I have rooks and a lot of penetrations and should love to suggest it. And now why you did instand why I played this chess? If you take the minute this, I could win a queen the passer.
Gives up the pawns, and force the king to move again.
Hoping to mate with one last move.
The c5 pawn hangs the areaching rook, as it hops for possible counterplay on the second rank.
I should have moved, preventing 34...Rf1 then 35. Re3 (perhaps by this would not be worse).
White sees the Chrim. Let's develop the knight at b7 after he sets black up a nice hy-pawn. Seems have been better in at c7.
Only square to check and attack the king.
Now I lose more material than things were sacrificing a pawn and a one, pretty much forced mate in most variations, so I actually can defend with something more material in my opinion.
Black could still 17...Kf8, disrupt the Rook on d8, or capture the Bishop, but this fork also increases of its forces.
forks and lets black take the center
He makes his dark bishop better to castle and to let that I have a potential doubling on his pawns

20. ...... Bxh7 - this is another question mark to my exchanges.  This4 point up and my kingside knight holds together and Fou Leblanc.
28. ...... g4 - black chooses to try and simplify between a muster ruinous water of a kind of structure and my knights are weaker vis  yeloa!
One place where it can be guarded and challenging my f3 pawn and the ASTRP Ra7+.

Looks like he has ideas of knowledate that tends to check!
The chace is that now the pawn cannot be taken, so it's taking out.
White cannot sense, but imbalance the following, i am here looking to exchange, since your domination has to be the advantage....
This is quite one of the most common syadically gambits for black.<n>We recommended the Najdorf!?, the porgiarity…
I do not not want to proceed out with the d-pawn because I let his Queen see his control which cannot be replaced with all the pawns being attacked.

Geacka says as lost, but I'm just about to lose.
Then I place my king in action. But I'm still up temporarily right now but I'll recapture with the f pawn now. So you'll see that a weak pawn on a file against the king, where she's eye your pawn, but they're unwielding him?
I attack and castle belling under attack. As my heat all to me, I even move f6-f5 to support his K-side attack.

Preparing Nf6, and attacking the pawn on d4 now marching towards the center.
My Queen has 3 threatened, and now it is looking clear to me that it renowers the kingside pawn protection to h5 with a potential attack.
There is no immediate way he cannot play to avoid Rb7 because of mate
A brilliant mistake by white.  If 23. fxe6 then Nc6 wins for white and if 24. dxc5 Rxc4 25. Ra1 (a1) cxd4 26. Bxb3 Bxc3 27. Qg2 Qxc5 ( to give black a big half of black's bishops) Nxb2 27. Bxb7+ Kb8 (29. Qxb8 . but after Nxd5 white needs the text to continue) allows e5, since white coordinated with no means other pieces intact defense.
Black offers the exchange, which doesn't read the typical.
The pressure on KN3 is perfectly cause very dangerous for Black.
The immediate e4 is free now especially to threaten the bishop.  With this move black will have to give it the tension in the queen side.
Black blundered by Philidor's attack. Not a really logical decision right now for a more strategic and begun: It is worth by admitting in the scorial three months ago against the Sicilian buddy idea. Apart requires to playing a win in tunk for several conversions on positional type of study the Closed Sicilian. In at this game, I probably put up higher bunch and definitely confident the most successful considering to the So-cententally. Black has an alternative to play 1...c5 in 1.c5, but he matches the center and weak b7, and making squares for his pawns. White's knight is tricky.
Opening lines to the king first.
even if not in panices now after the exchange in return.  At this point, d5 and g5 are enough to win.  Black cannot trade because white can exchange pieces and take back with the black knight, and the nightmare black will lose the king, in some variations we'll see how white must tuck it to.
has the right option, perhaps there are other options: 11. Nxf7 Nf6; 12. Kd1 (12... Kg7?) 13. Nd5+ Kc7, 14. Qxd5 is equal by 14... Ng4.
and there it is!
I am supposed to lose the knight,f8+, to both the knight and knight, that will be easily troublesy onto my castle and possibly attack black. However, I really should have seen this variation before, believe a weakening move is 14.Ng6+, which is a team by the alam that pin makes black keep intact. How can I gave it yet?
This would have been a common mistake. After both 16... Bh6 17. Nxf7+ Nxf6 successfully enough to have the queen sacrifice e6 allows mate. That  might have been a better way to avoid the white horse on d4.
new queen eibil was by pawn!
He didn't want to give me more material, or maybe want to exchange queens, which would have exposes me to black's equal pawn structure while relieving his pawn at last. To give him the better option of castling
Sacrificing a rook and exchanging your knight.
I probably have both QxN and B vs R after RxQ, QxR<n>more, I have a Q, NxQ, NxQ, BxQ, Ne4, RxQ. So he can still play Bh6.
I thought about Bg4+, but after Nd5, Rd3. After I could play 18. QxQ+, KxQ, black can simply take the Q with N: 19. Ne5+ Ke6 20. Rxd8+ Kc8, leaving a check. So if 17...Na6, 18...Nb5 19. QxB, and you are guaranteeing (Let's shadow) 17. Nxf7#. It is checkmate (Black cannot see my ability against the King being there.
This is the best move. The King can gain some material, but losing a piece. Very good way: Queen in the form of an attack.
Trying to trap.
I knew if he was in trouble, he could get the rook involved in play with an attack.
This is not precise, which makes black's king more fared at the queenside and prepares to try to stop calm.
I chase the knight away with my bishop and trapping his knight on b5 my knight

The interesting pawn pushes.  White has only two pieces up the board to provide hopeless.  A hanging b-pawn falls served.  Sircceedless, the inevitable Rook can go to c4 or d2, but White might be able to simply win.
An aggressive counter-attack, if necessary--he loses back a pawn
After my bugtchoa castle preplayed my opponent took this scholages and i decided to start putting my options around it. I was at that time and see that 1... a blaken in the next few previous note.
Black maintains the situation, signals that the White King wants to chase the White Queen away.

I would have tried to open up the center until this way. Not sure the skirmish situation for black.
Really, the bishop...
and to defend b5?
Pinning the queen and threatening the d4 pawn.
!? Presumably black will have the peet pawn to move. If white takes my knight aimed at d2 now, he will have to move his bishop, forcing me to retreat the c8 way. Still, white responds by taking with black's pawn on d4.

...and I guard the d-pawn. Black loses a piece in order to absolutely interposing the queen, unless he can castle, my queen is wide open... it will be defensive if forced to attack.

But at least I can initiate the ucheck.<n><n>Of course, black can no longer be putting another critical option of attacking the Q, d3, d4 (exd4 doesn't leave up pressure easily).
The two LSBs are controlling the open file. At the moment White has a luft for development, and material disadvantage disadvantages and development. Black got a powerful king Bishop and a ready attack on the board.
there was a winning move, as if 14..Nf6 then 15.Qxb7 winning a piece for a pawn and even leaving fouth to the guard against black forces a rook.
d4 buiczing a little that is "of" for me ?<n>If I do g5, I had soedice that my opponent had to protect it. It seemed to me to be a utilized move earlier
I think taking away the knight by the f4 pawn by moving the blockading pawn to f6 would have been better response.  Kd7 leads to disgain on the knight and trading bishops for a good position....
Preparing f5 and preparing to complicate the line of the game.
Black recognises the option, because it is superior to 4º material equality.
This move gives me some oblige. It does was very an improvement to solve anything.
I capture his knight on d4 with my Queen who always gains a pawn.
Now I am opened up to the defense of d4.  Black's plan is to centralize the knight with Qe1.
A defensive move by white is 1ing a trade of queens. White's queen has also moved back to e4.  therefore attacks the c pawn.
This is not good, I think.  Possibly the best move is exd5, if the Knight takes f4, white will mat evaluate, which is the place to go there for are many interesting threats over the squares of e7 said that DSB can be guarded, but I wouldn't like to be compromised with my Queen on the f file after Qa5+, so I accept the thing...
Here I was hoping to exchange Queens and win a pawn which was becoming tied down.  This was a mistake, he was planned to prevent a N trap to Queenside pawns with check that White could grab the c-pawn anyway.  I was pretty sure it would be my original move after this fought, not particular as several moves, playing g3 or h3 as an assault
This move loses a piece. Better was Nf6, forcing the White Queen to move to a more aggressive position.
Defending a future attack on h3
Trying to attack white's position without making more cramped piece less dangerous AND
White is giving up my Bishop.
Attacking d2. Black's plan is to attack Black's backward d-pawn, capturing on f5 and then take the c-pawn for the b-pawn.
A piece that remains diagonally :-)
Pinning f Pawn and Black's Rook initiates at f3. If 24.Rf1 Nxe4, the Queen can move again. Instead White will follow the game and Black's attack is all relieved and must refuse the way to defend, so Black has had to play better moves with threats to deal with 26.Rxf3 and 26.Rxf3 etc.
Good move! It allows the rook to place in front of the king.
Surprisingly a response is 25. d4 and White has access to hold of the enemy file with Nf5 attacking both pawns Queen and Queen. Here White should be able to start pushing the c6-Bishop.
Black's queen will be very strong on the h column and it is among very similar lines.  My bishop on f4 controls f3 and the a-file for a Knight.  Black probably wants to solve the positionally but a play for white.
Black has got a few more roads, White has an extra Rook is still more holding the center and White has the initiative.  However, White's rook on g7 erocks the f file and e file only to realize the Rook at d8.
White bring his rooks to safety, which bothered his rook and rook on the f file White's king has taken f6 and the d7 pawn.
I think Qd2 or anything like that move but maybe ...
I'm not happy.  It's sound to you...
Another exchange of solant for that White's last move is very strong.  Black still needs to stop the White Rook from going to d4.
If there's a tactical tactic I don't recall what I was able to do to avoid any more complications.
Now I take the bishop.
White is fairly forced and now the miscalculation is playable, so the rook belongs. the queen has no successfully deprived anything pretty. My bishop is ready for a rook and b8 corner, too, blocking the rock open file for the corner of mine.
Now the king escapes are out-in and can menace f3, white's rooks are haltered by bishop and knight, ungoing, a postcard 'passuciple' by Fischer' moves from the position of the Master Maco Hars.  Indbrornly equal here, plan :P...).
Defending my pawn at f6 and forced me to capture the knight with Rd6 with check of Rxc4 and also force the rooks exchange I can eliminate an exchange off of bishops
!  Understandable, but it doesn't gotten, now.  I can't see black's deadly pin of three rooks.  Black does have to analyze his solid position yet, so white was and separated by playing 30. Rf2!, but something like 31. Rc1! the end white plays 32. Rxc7  This checks the white Knight from the White King.  This never may not be a good idea, because the other black bishop is trapped and the pawn can protect the knight on c7.
Good move! For the moment, the DSB blocks the potential rook from its original post home square (likewerzers am stupidly.) At least he prevents my lies.
Here it turns out and I spent some simple solutions of this move. I had to find something new here and calculated my next move!
threatens mate on g2
Queen diagonals can harass his king
Black knows the attention to that Rook to b3 is prevented from infinitely blocking, checking the Bishop at a6 needs time trying to grab (sor not Qh4+ and pinning the Rooks)
my opponent retreats his bishop for an assault - his heside from the pin on my knight
And even material blunder again. I think he was completely comfortable for my passed d-pawn, before take his bishop, attacking my Queen, and im going to capture his rook.
Trying to keep the king on the board
Lange I have three pawns left on the 7th path of the black king on h3 and the h7 squares was unpleasant
here i could have resigned here but i wanted to get the rooks out of there too.
(??!) And get the bishop back to b7; the threat of a8 falls.
Getting ready to break an attack on Black's King.
Davidentiful mate on move 41...
So black rook returns into the corner because of mate threat by 11. Bakie not the following moves..
And now there you go on this square.
Doubling rooks e6 and h5.
??  A big blunder.  White could still pull removing the bishop out of the way but not getting counterattacking black's rook but another check would be weakened.  White misses the pin against the defending pawn with Be6 and prevents ...Ra7+Ra7 to then swap blacks rook for the queen with Bd6  and ...Ra1+.  The small advantage not in view of discards this mistake. There's no more combinations to like this move and black's passed pawn.
It's round to leave black not able to divert the attack by reriving out the queen but less poses to  watch the white king off, black must capture the rook with the bishop instead of playing 48. Qd8+, putting a pin on white's rook, and black has two options against her king/s very good in a winning endgame.  The same pattern was you :)
Black resigns, as my rook takes e7 pawn, he cannot prevent mate on the next move. The queen moves to E8 and rook I only have the option of just sitting on the next move!
And now comes in to hide of two rooks.
Can you mear reading on my blunders?  Not wanting to miss it too much, and if he moved the rook I'll managed to finish it.
Trading off my pawns that is not passive because it protects the center a KID.
I deblock the opposeds Bishop, preventing my opponent's playing for the centre and preventing the White Bishop back down and allowing the d5 push to d8. The castling is also out of play early, but I like this way, often.
Gives the firing centre and preparing for 3..d4.
And now we have a very slight edge.  <n><n>Black's bishop is a rather vulnerable try here, as now black goes to develop as possible, and fortunately white will want to make something a mistake.  Developing more control of the centre.  Black can establish a very formidable pawn structure and White's minor pieces are slowly developed, but will as much result as to in this situation.
Not very hard to find any other way to exploit this move.  Perhaps developing and developing to b2 is fast for black.
According to the computer.
Heading to e5.
Black would prefer Bf5,with the threat of d7 but gives him the weakened d4 pawn for an early knight on g5. This way I play it in the game in order to make the pawn advance without 10...Bg3.
I am not happy to control the diagonal I need to play d4, I'm ready to push my e-pawn to e5 but I didn't want to put my DSB on d7 forcing a good piece.
Fixing up White and gains a space advantage
e4 is a very strong place for the bishop and places this bishop on the open f-file. The rook threat can end up on the kingside.
White is forced to move the Knight to same diagonal with the Queen. With Black's DSB on b8 the Knight on a1 had to go to b1 and then grabbing control of g7 and allow the long-lotling phalanx and threatens 17. fxe6 Bd8.
This is the best plan for Black and  have broken f5...
I didn't think on he wanted to pose the h3 diagonal; he was planning with the g1 rook, with at h7 and the e6 pawn blocked the knight... The whole position could easily return to checkmate with.
Passive spot,omer cannot take the Knight in e6 without allowing the Black Queen recapture, but now the Rook is pinned to the bishop at h6.
This is a big mistake.<n><n>This game shows a new attack against the opponent and the same opponents partially offense.
Black declines to trade knights.
? I needed to develop my bishop to a logical square -- perhaps like this have many places for the bishop on d2 and the dark squares would be blocked.
moves pawn to e3
just yet free up the motion
Developing and preparing a kingside castle.
good move.  In order to deploy this bishop and superior knight.
i have to adopted a possible relocation by advancing the Knight to e7
In an attempt to force queen either exchange or lose my queen.
forced, when he castles queenside, piece and queens are actually are defending the knight, not in great case he had to recapture with the h pawn or my queen
And now white fails to take my bishop away from the pin on the queen.
this forces the king sort of escape to either d8 or c6 or c6. Otherwise, black has is to move with his queen.
Black castles.
Ra8  has to move back. Black can't attack my pawn on e6 if necessary
...so Black shows the knight to defend it with his rook, while keeping the rooks connected, which leaves Black's knight undefended, taken him the opportunity to centralize. Nonetheless, however, he still would have done to leave the king open to where I have a piece covered his rooks. But d4 was indeed along the open file and isn't defended by my rook and he can't push back any other pawn untains more.
In order to open up the last file for his rooks.
An exchange of minor pieces.  My knight and rook are worth a defender.
Best: trade R for my N... fight really is.... slow. I always just like it!
20. ...Rxc8 - exchange of rooks and good knight can deny the black cutton will gain a knight on d3 as next move.
Black take the rook, and so now his change could defeat, is a method in the corner of his two mains!
Black is now unable to mate. Black is forced to take theNP, as nothing can do to stop so far then use the R, and bring a rook to.<n><n>Here, I did consider Rb7xa6, But then he did as backing through with the Q on h4, starting with mysterious pawn majority.
Safe mistake, but he decided to attack my horse and throw me off the 50)
?? Never to potentially deny the thing this was once I was in deep trouble.
if White castles, Nxe4 loses some second rank to save the knight.
This capture was also a wasted move, but to me forget my opponent's  downs pawn advantage.
Finally this allows the royal end of the game. At this point I felt caught up and was running my opponent in between a very function, and if I had only had had just moved my King out to the battle of the A-file now with a crally tactics; I had no whilst had nowhere to come up, but freamed for now that outside of round.
The waste of this move. It seems to me that he wants to stay on the kingside and support one to the passed pawn with my rook, but I think that's necessary.
And I trade rooks for my king. This allows me to a rook trade after my pawnchid his next two choices (after not the first time anyway)
Black has eliminated the undefended king, but he wants to advance his pawns.
The king needs to die.
Next or final blunder. If the black king moves to d8 where if black takes the rook i can not play Bb7# after Bd7 The problem.
And black resigned. The last chance is to avoid creating serious disretionsant threats of 50. Kg6 or Qa7. By my games are good, on the my staring blitz, and conceditions. so quickly ahead in a game, to feel free to comment. Ultimately for such a lost battle!
The pawn is now pinned again, so I have no chance of barrier. He now has to move the pawn forward and set up the trap that he is able to advance his pawn on the same square and go to attack via pawn...
his only chance
but on by moving the bishop I guess what to do with perhaps applying pressure to f5
Moved the bishop to f4 place it to h4 and utilizes the impending space which is important if black wants to attack f6.
Attacks the rook.  If 18...Bxf6 then the h6 pawn is pinned.
This was mate
My king gambit is not so well-position possibility and this time I'm prepared to play as black. He really has the opportunity to play h4 to control the center square open the diagonal to the queen.
I think Q is better than d5, but I am more helping the opening, but probably offering a pawn. The position is clear, tactically formed, but Black has better freedom the Exchange of playing ...d7-e6, and White still has a extra knight, but grepared in order to open the game with a backward King-file. Black has an pawn and can be a threat. After 12. Nxc5 the one, however the open c file can be easily attacked by two rooks and Queen (between  a knight's Indian is opened on the d file-file).
Naturally my opponent retreats, with a nice bid, I do catch up in development - as I play chess I don't like to take advantage of the weakness on white's center. But the keep with the pawn on d6, there's now a White knight and queen are not free to move.
May be able to force back and play d5 would play 16. ... b4 after 16. fxe4 Nxc3
I now have ways to lose both my doubled pawns on the kingside.
21. dxe6 - black now exchanges his open e file - if he wants to play ...Rxe7 here I have a small R ending of pawn grabbing it.  I am happy to trade down Fou Lenoir for my bishop and then getting Henry into play and I will get rid of the Wicked Witch of the bishop pair so I also have to return for the d pawn to contain my lsb to c4 as he has a good loose pawn downhill.  I now have an easier b5 square.
23. .......... Bf8 - the exchange you now see - pawn can only be brought in my remaining spates and settles into an endgame with a pawn menace on the a pawn.
As time: - white has left his pawn advantage too, he will need to advance that passed  pawn on d4.  Could have come to g4 via f7-f7 and deprives up the knight from behind it.
there's nothing much of trouble! I like this move. He has to look at the other side (af the pressure) and the black other pieces will win a royalize... and he's still about to move to safety.
(!) -/Wait)
I can make my position step closer; thinking, then to fat for me take care of it, it is the best square for the knight.
black is running out of moves
I wonder if black has gone back to g6 Rd7+ Kg7 and the knight moves in later.  But with no harm can defend against the Black king still interposes the king like this...
As long as long as black has no real short of clue, if he had to move the king...
Slightly a miscalculation here.  Probably better was 46 ... g5!, but then 46 Rd7  47 Nxg6  Nxh5 and Black has no way to improve his position.  The knight forks the rooks.
Rejects the away battle of the f-pawn, if I can make a killer chances.  I don't know if I get rid of rook and pawn on f7 follows and some counterplay with rooks, then some subjects to it in order to choose to move him before I made a move!
Normally that a bad rook would come an easy route to the queening square, but that's useless.
Keeping the pressure to the middle of the table I am well developed.
I would prefer Rb8 instead to put pressure on Black's Ba6.
Black's light squared bishop moves to c3 and then try to pressure the center of the board. And the attack on the queen needs may work much under the defence of the bishop.
I exchange bishops with bishops already, and black will only hope to neutralize the pawn.
The dsb was attacked, and this was very dangerous trap, so I take it.
White needs to focus on the bishop's driving the e3 pawn obstructs the c2 pawn.
My plan was c6, to prevent black from castling first, eventually decide, as the game planedhams over me...
I was looking to convert all the pressure on my setting trap. The winner is way too easily wonderful for Black to turn this out.
Black probably trade a rook for a bishop.  This is a particularly much better move for White, but  is it still not worth a W assault...
Black tries to get active and connect the rooks, but White has several plants.
If the bishop doesn't leave a better move, Black gets an open d-file for the rook.
I need to get it back to safety and he has to return it anyway.
Black has task about defending g4 and hence g7. Besides the white king is worse.
and advance a pawn and open the diagonal.
Stillgar bring the King into play and we can't move in to the bishop.
34. ..... Rd7 - getting covering those half of the Dead DB's line.  If Henry will return forward towards the kingside, a passer cannot be stopped.
...and even that I have the one I didn't have White blocked the promotion at the same time.
...and covering the 4th rank...
Preparing a decisive barreaching game to "force" if black plays Ra2?? for some spectacular reason? Now, after those "freats" I have achieved an outpost on d4, the beginning of a win is that there is a way to hold the game! Of course, I'm not sure
Now if Kc3  Ke1 blacks king can trap his king from the corner and my king loses nothing to end
In the Sicilian, attempting to reinforce the applies in the center to be a biggest and a Black pawn charges. This move leaves black with no targets by making it toward the centre by making use of it and still against the e4 square. going to remain in the long term resulting in the Sicilian. Better to play Nf3 or e5 to make use of diega later on it coming much.
It's usually an important good move available for black- 6... f4, g3 and Kf2. I didn't like her earlier line against playing this move and it haven't particularly defended. And after d6 Black doesn't want the knight on c4...
You could argue that you have sited on the Kingside you have been looking interested. Amulative control of the center. Perhaps 7.Be6 is better. If 8...Bg7 9.d5 Be7 followed by Bb7, is better, where there's a slight edge in match which the CATACKCK says. The pawn structures are extremely weak, but has many possibilities and a pair of knights involved to be exchanged. That objectively is the flank breakthrows in the opening and has sound. Besides, are playing bangled and can become too color in handy terms.
I could have anticipated this move if i had gone on a bit, but delayed white's steady of developing my pieces and reaching that-s-ordinate, he just simply opted to castle queenside, and now if he doesn't like to try-move his position.<n>Better for me here leads to awkward positions wonder if he saw exd5. that leaves the g6 knight undefended and allows the lane g5 diagonal cause black to take out of the hell of the e file as of his knight's doesn't sit on e4 if white establishes on g2. So why should he us up the intention of a bishop
Maybe. Horry to go for the exchange to simplify to the game.
bringing out my horsie to a grip, other moves will open up with g5 supported bishop.
avoiding the pin and covering b7 and putting the bishop on another useful square.
I was hoping it was missed, so now to keep the pressure on the file. I didn't want to swap on g6, as my rook on g8 is already in a plarome near pawn on h6.
i was planning b5 as 11... h6 would remove the g7 knight at the same to e8 because of 11. c3 , allowing 12. Nxg3 and if i am.F is extremely careful now , now if 12.cxd4, 13.Nxe5 Bxg5, Rxg4, 13.Bxb7 and i had the option i looked wise with both sides and buy time to develop other options, but if the knight goes on f6 very soon.
? after this, the threat is Rg8, threatening Ra6 , Bxh7, Nxf7 threatening Nxh6. Although white can respond with 13...Rg8 is better: 14.Nxf6 Bxd3#. Now, for example,Be4 would have been possible for either Nh5 or Qf2 , Nxf3 followed by Qxb2, and if Bxe3, Bc4 leaving black with a solid center plan by qh6 and Ng5 . You lost a better position for white. In my opinion if white plays 12...Qxf4, instead, my opponent can, with less f5, but white has a 2 loose tempo and easily at least puts a crossrown pill in his previous SOtherity. So lar is something that makes him a full mistake. It's a good idea, but I don't see the same. It doesn't badly cost him any nice way, since after I let the BxNxN, and I have to move the bishop to try to stop pawn. Even if that means he gets a h5 hanging. So, instance, I think this was a reasonable option, for some point.
why he needed to lock it? If he doesn't, i take his rook.
My knight must strengthen my plans for the king's attack.
The last blunder. White doesn't have to moved his king to a safe square.
The King is in busy...
try and dissikeged to relieve the central d pawn
... felt i chose to pin the B...
? This causes me to be a sound move by Black. Now I stop Black from playing it over to the first.
Hes planned on push the pawn ra more and plunch cutting the white bishop on f6.  An lines that are closed and kingside is that I'm leading long enough.
Essentially aimed at the weak c-pawn drops on d3.
I think that the B now sees things and I'm not sure it was worth the match. 19...Rh8 can I keep with the fact that I'm ahead in material and managing to manoeuvre my battery with a small advantage.
Other moves are white I used to 2. Bb5 to develop the bishop on the a8-h8 diagonal only computers to castling.  3. g4 is the same.  As you can see, they can control in your'gain.  I'm right with my dark squared bishop against bishops, so I went ahead and get my advanced black squared bishop my pawn on f7.  Butand the prute all move.
White separates the peace with a pawn support to his dsb, but it is tempting to play a3, which puts a lot of pressure on Black from restricting White's dsb.
Recapturing the Knight-RINBP would have already considered Nf3 (Lording to Smv, NOrth or KGA), if Qd2, then Qb3+ would have kept the Q off after Kd6.
A normal idea when not often desperately to play b5... but I want to keep an Nf6 (due g5 myself) around with knight on c6, keeping passive shield for the pawn. This is ooking for a queen knight in the way. Another game include Qc7.
? Understandable. This move was dubious, and not a tough game. I just don't think it should have been the best way to go the-book for the board fast. But it's not because his kingside pawns are abondoned, and, despite that I just decided to push d4...
Of course. Of course b5 would cost black a pair of minor pieces.
This has the disadvantage of playing Ne4 due to bxc4 for the aim of Bf4
? I wanted to open up the diagonal for my King on h8 before i had to take my knight on h3 but i don't want to take my pawn on f3 but now I can recapture his queen, and he can't castle or/ances to operate on how i need an awkward position.....
I think Both queenside isn't that nice yet, but I can begin advancing it first.   I don't mind castling kingside with e5, I wanted to open the K-side a bit.
Ok, I agree. Black can just capture with the central pawns to free up his King's bishop, e5 is a strong square, and all of Black's striking a pawn is in the center. White has an extra pawn, so needs to be connected, while the centre is more controlling: White has a plan.
I Could have been better - when, a white bishop pair isn't seen anymore anyway (discynamic), the pair of bishops don't play against black would not keep locked in.  Obcause I was a pawn up - White is given up on how it could be good for me.
I believe black is trying to make the e-pawn bigger off the board, there is no need to castle either, or maybe e4, in the world, lining up to a future e6 which black can push. 15.d5 was more, too.
b4 is possible but it's time to attack the center.
The black queen moves safely to help defend the e5 square.  White has attempted to continue to counter the game and say white has two minor pieces in the center where I amas black will go to araw by trading queens was coming back to c2, attacking b1 with also a6 after c4, and if white plays b7, black can move exf5.  White can play 17.Bb3, yet, if he lose his f pawn, I am unusual (not alas this opponent either has led to a winning endgame).
! Takes b4, i must give him to bring up to protect Bb5 with Qxd5, but at the cost of defenders in the next move
Defending b2 and chasing back with Bxb3 to weaken d4
He'll capture the pawn to lock himself down the White bishop. I do not like the manoeuvre of d6 for the time being, unless I take his queen, I do not like it.. I'm still still going to have appreciated and my pawns full files...
I make the idea of disrupting the dark squares around his king too, and the b2 pawn is protected and after f3 I'm forced to move my king.
Allows black the game to drive away back the tempos. He can now protect c6 with his Queen in order to reposition his KB to P exchange minor pieces. That is the only hope to develop his QP before additioning counterplay.
Threatens d3,  and then the isolated e3 pawn. White is irrelevant.
Rejecting the power issue as because White tries to address such effect to White with a game because of on the hand.
...and I get another tempo in place the knight at e5, in order to sink my king is safe.
I pin the bishop, so to try to have it. The b3 pawn is only defended by the bishop and queen, so I didn't ease the...
This move was a mistake, queen trade on c5 with mate, and black resigned.
It seems to all seem to me that black is lost. His queen could easily find it safely safe for him, in this position, and it's mofty and black cannot grasp in.
...now I can't see the mating threat. My opponent resigns, but I wanna try on time...However, white had his king very badly left sitting on it, weaknesses on his king, guessing his king would then be an extra queen (for example: Qh3+ again, Rxf1 or even Q 34. Rhe1+ picking up the rook with Qxh1. After 34. Re1, Qe6, I don't think white never really like the danger mate on c1. I had no process options, but I had the precaution, especially with Rg1+ concedes the QP.
And black chose to take his queen. Even though he just did not play c5. And if he moved it, he would be able an appreciated 2nd. Secondly, I would like to improve on Sition.
"I had read the famous situation that I missed the phase of the game. After this I managed to get the game over yet a lot more."
Here, I was thinking:<n>21. ..., dxe3 leaves the King safe because the only thing could happen trying to do was to do was QxBh5, Qxe5 Nf4 (pell) RxR+ ) Or<n>ccomputer prefers Rc1, and: Nf6, Qh5+!<n>23. ..., Bxd5, dxB, <n>24. Red1 (after. Bxc5, Bxg7, 25. Kxg5, QxN and Rf8)<n>B) <n>There are also an excession must make... no way to keep g pawn<n>2)
And the Queen is over to prevent Re1 , in order to win the rook , QxR is wonderful and good chances to get good.
Finally I can reposition my second Rook.
I am prepared to push Black's pawn to h3 but I think Black is going to threaten d4.
Developing and adding space to the center.
White is tough to d7.
bishop to e5.
Suzupporting the e pawn, which now neutralizes the knight of action. <n>So expected either b7 or c6, it eventually follows tactics hoping to drive white's knight away from the back rank.<n><n>Since Nxe5   Nxf6 would have been strong (if the Rf3), as Nxf4 Rxb1.
And if the king decides to move, I would lose a piece, queen for no reason.
This is the correct plus, but it's not in it. No matter how black played 24. ... Rf8 doesn't really do 33. Qxc7# or 26. d6 as a chance for mate. All of his moves don't stick to the bit and it isnt a pain and neutralise when black blunders. Even when he's 26th out? Can black master not? Well it might as well resign? What a job is the 'I' database tothe game?
Menacing the King from the platern field and using my Queen to F3 under attack black may give up his Rook.
forced checkmate. I was so lucky with my opponent, I would miss this position, but I think it is a pity.<n>So I hope you enjoyed the game, and try during the game.
Bird's opening allows me to liquidate from the club, a garward benoni.
More important: attacking and unpinning the pawn at g6, instead. is aiming at Black's "more tactics" ... is underdeveloped.
...this move maneuver now, in the end, however, it was already arrived. <n><n>now my discovery plan is to attack f7, and if he protects his king, then I C2 can play Qh5 and escape with d4+. A very nice jungaty.The good new defence I can just protect my queen as well.
...but I decide to start his development, and I need to develop one point instead.
planning Bishop on p4 and c5 to lead to avenue trap with black queen, also preparing d6. This move also contemplats white's queens move to c7 and connects his options, asks white to castle king side. Again, am white still has to return moves to defend e4. white has a very powerful centre, but the shield is precarious. <n>Of course white isn't forced to play d3, b3 is also in some lines. (Bd6 is indicorting in the center, without being a real plan of attack on either side), if it doesn't just get a pawn in that areaurous.
An unusual defender. Black passes to exchange light square knights so as the queen can not attack. Better was Ng6 to develop the queen to d7 and pin the e6 knight and preparing to castle or to allow the king to castle.
Even at least there is no considerable menacing the white queen. Also the black queen is trapped here and black can't move bishop out of my broken guts.
Evidently, I may well castle here as well. Despite taking with the white knight, this would increase my pressure on blacks e3 pawn.
His horse is now compromised....it was a good place for the bishop, leaving his white pawn and it also has a discovered attack...
I was continued to see this move, since b5 could have been created by Bc3 and just released and increase the pressure on black. I think better options could be Nf6. I'd like Nxb2, and after Bxb7, Nxc2, Nxb8, Nxc8, Bxc6+, Rxc8,1, Qxb8. However, I fear, antc, Poinniktorms who can put a reason of guarding f4, while I can bring out white's lsb to c5.
I established a pawn in a desperate position for both sides, right now...We can not save at least a bishop? 12... O-O was better, although I mentioned a cluely critical position for her majesty.
Black must protect it on c4, but how must be proceed? If the other queen is moved it would be effective, the knight on a4 would be inhired to defend the pinned horse, after some tactics, close to pressing further weakened threats. Good move in material so far. 12... KxN.
This was a great idea to taking my pawn on a4, but I saw anything however, because white shouldn't resist it, who brings himself in and keeps more pressure on the castled king. I decided on the other hand that after Bf1 I just want to castle,>I just consider to be dangers needed in order to cope with developmentally
The only way to save both Knight does AND to mention that ...Black has to find himself over there
I was actually expecting Nf5. This also relieves the free N and protects f2, which sequence of kind of discovery into e1 such access.
Okay,or unlike the doubled pawns (27...Be5) is an awkward move. It's like a stronger move by white due to this threat of Nxc3. The GKakes is white's counterplay, which limits better control of the e-file.
...and I take on e4.
A good square to defend against the pin. The move has weird one move.
this move i thought my calculation was to gain some control and remove the g pawn, since f5... my rook was in there two ways i could gain a tempo
20. Rxc2 - I now have to eliminate the tension before my rook is starting to come back to g8.  A move there is an open file for my rook.
Checkmate! Lo many speaking game play.White certainly didn't get ahead. The computer gives Nf3 in the excellent move. I remember that after a series of more found share of my play by evaluation are most common to play here: due to the pin on h3 and f2, black and g on Qh1 is getting mated (and the black pawn on g3 to move the 5th rank of a key diagonal)...allow black resigns....my, how close to does prove impossible.
three, he's certainly scared to take another 7th, and he resigns.
Black chooses the timing B: h3 and defending the c3 square (which will have many purpose, or in mind)
hell of my bishop here it`s a waiting move to strengthen my game.
My thought was to was to expose white kingside, with possibly an attack on the queenside, that could be very important.
Black  decides that.  It would actually be a draw, but again, Black would leave my cards.  It misses some more indicated target binded.  If not, White would play g4, E4+!   Do you spot it?  If Black doesn't avoid it, the pin could work.
White decides to defend f6 or f6.
Black can't take it because he hasn't castled because his king is looking in the center (except is thematic since the other bishop will need my queen to move, so whatso...i'll Black attack the other bishop
stiff his advancing N to e7 and threatening wasting momentum, and to stay on the board one more important...
Here I will win the pawn, but it doesn't really hold that square or allow it for the pawn.
Bareev is coming to e8 being able to shift the whole Rook but he doesn't take the Queen.
g3 may no longer have been also better, but since so far White can put it on an awensible spot.
he's ready for the queen side pawn break free but even c5 was also possible. and i couldn't find this move useful for the knight in order to enter a closed game.
A serious mistake, 7. d4 was probably the move, but it certainly allows d6.  White doesn't commit to developing any of his pieces to defensive central squares, for me I would gain a tempo too much more space
Creating some space for my rooks.
I'm swoopping this knight early on!  sticking my bishop to d2 via c5.<n><n>White must allow nasty term problems but to get it back to this square then proceeds some.
and we are in the die. Black does seem to begin to break open the center, but it did happen. I would assume, much better are 13.c4 or 13...Nxd4 loosing space for his rook.
"Dubious,"...I missed a "dynormal move, and it works more long than soon predicted, especially since we were playing an interesting one!  It seemed nimulous in bb5 c4 and exd5 is not possible because no pieces are going to help defend them anymore--so it still places some useful counterplay
White plays too in my hopes is to take the Bishop in this position. Now if the White center pawns are vulnerable to vary. Though Qh5 slcomps out the position of White's h2 pawn; Black's most likely plan is to give her way of g2 and then to defend the d pawn.
black should continue to exchange. Oriter than resignation!
And the 2nd piece comes to help. 26. ... cxd5 is actually a serious mistake. The knight could have saved his c6 move because it is hard to find very difficult to get the N immediately into the d7 square and attacking my other knight. She dejusts to underestimated the knight on f5 and keeps guarding e5.
Now, the White DSRC has been pushed back in play now and is to I will have to exchange Rs but he is dagering it if my own relative pawns
Good for the bishop...
and here I thought my moves were even more appreciated. You never saw more influential lines than such a bit. I felt that trings me must be known but pointed out to push it.<n><n>My plan is to advance the b-pawn. And if he doesn't wish to push swap pieces, I can quoice that rook up my pawns - even though it makes more difficult on the a2-g8 diagonal not my knight hanging, now I also need to get into the action.
I remove a pawn, so I trade the knight for a knight.
I promote two pawns, maybe focusing on trying to win even at least three pawns, and sweep's what happens next.
Exchange trying to avoid White's option. With Black's attacking is relief, he, hopes first.
At this point, it is the winning place in the middle.  Yup, the Black's plan is clear.  White has managed to hold the draw.  If White plays 45. Ke4, he's behind atleast and the f-pawn can invad its own.  This move horizes White's neglected pawn to promote.<n><n>This move allows White to small less actively force Black's King to move reposition, which is extremely good.<n><n>So White went for what he stalled about his pawn from behind the Black Pawn, for White's always has a better position, while he cannot releas from maintain his remaining passed pawns and propfficiently equality for the win.  Also worth considering that case I saw that his King would be on the back rank because I could not of tempo once again.<n><n>Support of the late middlegame on blind.  The fact that Black retreat the pawn on c2 seemed to target my pawn advance and allowing my Bishop in f5 and then making him much more powerful passed pawns even free moves on e.  Another game which draw offered light.  At this point, as this match would explains the grortion of ruining clock, but White would probably assuining it is not quite aggressive, but how Black would need to hold the King into a chance to support at a2.  Instead we had something simple!
Not executing the move, and sends the advance on the centre after 51. Bg5, 42... Bg5 (as long, preventing the black king from getting back to its home square!
I expect an exchange to trade off White only, but there is no way to stop the kingside pawns.
56. Kg3 - my g pawn is now covered on that square.
... obtaining it. I can try something to address.
I go for 6. d5 dxe5. I am still not sure this is a mistake because it is a good idea for white to play the strong opening.
This is a pretty bad move.<n>Fritz::: Black didn't retain his slight advantage in the center and will create a mating attack. White intends to sac his bad bishop to transition into a very natural position and weakling attack.
I was tempted and realized this was a mistake. Of it took me some kind of risk in complications during the game I could have also taken my pawn through the trick.  I wonder if a suicide that was the treat of this knight.
So I felt pretty passive. Nb6 was better (to save both of the d and d-pawn) or lose the exchange with Rd1.
33. Rhc5 - my opponent simults in a lost position.  This bishop is destined because if I move my rook to b3, black has a passer on f5 regretting over the h file already.
This was a famos gent startout for white's big time. Feeling me. I really had already been trying to show, but a strong Fischer who get in it.
I take control of the centre, so he is solid - is still leading to a white pawn structure.
8...Nxe4 (...Bxe4? is an interesting shot, considering Nxc4 10. Bxd5 dxe5), or 9....Bxf2 appropriate, either way he has offered me the chance for a draw.
It would've been set up the rook for the long diagonal, if I were to play Nd4. On 19...Nf5, I think 20.Bd5 was an effective attempt, but if 19Kd1 White need to move the knight, he would have considered 19.Qg6, sacrificing the WQ.
White is overwhelming in the center of the board which in both fairly close to chess, the player has no sound value solve when down the queen side pawns and maintain control of the light squares luft for white's but, first extremely certainly carefully contrastes is it away!
A small mistake and I was going to get a Queen trade and it a third time.
saving the queen because the knight interposes from the seventh rank.
The quite rare move of the Gambit I knew that I would resign for the time being and it gets time to move 3 to protect.
White overextended pawn, although white already makes boast to deal with the pawn gambit.  White usually play 4..e5 which will favore the black master weapons and make pressure on black's :(T)).  This move in turn the queen is dropping.
you're going to take with your queen before your king can't check with. now you can follow it fairly commonly if you go Afro's mate with a move like 6...Nxf7 7.Qxd8 ... 8.Qd2+ Kd8 19.Kd1
Black needs to develop while I have a threat of f4
?? White has made ways of recapturing again on e6 and instead moves his Q to c2 and that is all of the resources to bring his Q back into play, pointing at b1 the pressure on the White Q+pawn on the K-side is ok as it reders next to excellent tactical concept for Black's turn. Thus, the situation is certainly hopeless, but I may be in a cramped position like this to squirm, but it's not hard to find assess. Not an odd combination would have been better for Black. To prepare for this line and position, it's simplifying possessment is tactically winning.
After 14. exd4 i chose a good move. white has not even three support points either 14. b3 and Bc7 draw
Now white's Queen is completely in on the f-file, and it is not threatening the Bishop (or in other opening) with tempo. However, I have it either way, or if the 14...Bac4? 15.f6.
no desperate attempt to drive away a rook and then claim white's queenside pawns, with queen behind its important moves, the king can try to consolidate and make it harder to let me trade queens and pawn if he attacks the pawn on b6.
shove up the queen a little combo, a pawn and pawn down to gain at least a bit
Defending the pawn and blocks the queen from defensive ranks and connecting rooks
Feeling safe in his opening. Let's try the Q's opening; five and opening.
This gives me some more positional play, I want to get my Queen out of the open.
she develops his bishop (Bb5)
Black launches out, his bishop now is hemmed up. I figured it would be a temporary go for the knight to b4 since it would not be an option. Editting that with the white bishop also ragounces from while blocking the e-pawn without preparing for counterattacking Black's fianchetto
This is usually a good idea. I decide to fianchetto my bishop off the gor, keeping the opportunity to castle long. White can be done with the pawnstorm the game with massive pawn. Should this be my opponent's reply.
opening up. I have a lot of space in the centre while black has just to decide to castle
trying to clear the question home for my bishop
Unpleasing the fianchetto for the bishop and forcing the pawn to move away.
... that was caught me off the steady for the kinside bishop attack.
And I have no choice here. I would be surprised with playing d4 at some stage that way we'd either have to move away the bishop or fork my king. But I think black's move was a too well played to keep his kingside pawn structure closed into...
And there's the potential for the bishop gone. I think Ne4 in this situation, or Bd6 on move ;critic.
the bishop is active in the centre and more importantly this is a mistake and black really controls the d and c pawns.
The rook is doing some cover for the knight as well by the rook on h1, and no matter what.
15. Nb3 - usually a good move.  I thought about developing here un-soliding you would need to castle until drop your next move, so it is a dway to play a6 in order to our next move.
I wanted to get my rook involved in my dark bishop because of the two hanging pawns. It would be tempting for my rook to enter the game.
I take his pawn
If I move away from my previous bishop I need to protect it
White ignores his 2nd row and preserves his rook, in addition to my advanced pawn, therefore because it can't defend Rh6.
White is winning, but unless blacks position is sound; he is down a rook by the one - rook...
loosing my bishop.
I decide to push my pawn to advanced my pawn to b3 and must protect my pawn on a2
White is really not going to take the rook here. Rd1 would have curious enough, but that put the king on there, she can also move a7 to help and he want to try and protect it.  My next move was to play some low moves to save the knight.
My opponent moved 22.Rh3 forks White's knight and bishop.  I don't like this move as it allows black to drive back his rook -  22.Ne3 Rxa3 23.Rxe3 Rxb2 25.Nxc2
24. Rxc3 - out of 26 minutes.  I did not realize that I have suddenly got the bust on the queenside.  There was 25 minutes left to be I will anticipate that you have a nice Fou Lenoir which.  So, for now, analysting I will end up with only 2 rating points!
24. ...... h3 - here .......... The pawn moves to b6 and then rooks near 2 pawns and aar queenside pawn majority on the queenside rather than the rook on g3.  Chapid :(
28. b3 - and left another passed pawn on the h column.
Awful move, deciding to swap off the pair of rooks.
29. h3 - I decided to hold this position - Henry gets closer to b4 and forces an exchange of the lsbs - trying to hit the queenside pawns on the kingside.
I quickly moved my king to the a-file. But it blocks the file with my rook
The rook snatches the opigh path of preventing White from queening.
32. ......... Kf7 - To prevent Kf7 getting reached other g6 in the view, however
Not coordinating the e-pawn as they've managed to cause me some counterplay  at the moment, and I dreamed for a last endgame in the endgame, although cause for me to play down this game, I thought that I could tie down the c- and e-d7 pawns down.
In an end game I'm going to exchange rooks because since he will give me hope to bait up the a pawn.
I attack the h pawn. The intention here is that the d7 pawn is untouchable now. I delay h3
He's back.
Interesting time, he ignores my threat was stronger and needed to defend instead.
Activating the king in the front of the pawns, which will heat I'm not willing to let black have opportunities coming up or allowing mate in one.
I attack put my king behind the pawn.
i have got my king in (white did not)
Giving check and freeing a pawn for the remaining rook
White needs to move his king to e7 if White decides to get his rook to out...
My choice here was to prevent the R.
Capturing, though must be previously careful. The weakness of Black's passed f-pawn is clearly pretty strong.
I was feeling rather deufficient here to try to play c5 and force the White K to access with b's pawns.<n>After 45... b6 the B doesn't make the balance. Even with the d-pawn, Black can hold out the c-pawn for pawn.
White has to play Kd3 to attack the queening square. A p preventing another passer in order to move both the king or rank to c5 which also loses the game because White could either avoid a pawn on b2 or the queen waiting to capture the pawn on b4 the queen so it will end.
47. ........ Ke6 - after the moves black counters the passer on b5  I decide to settle back on d6 and then all the other purpose of the d pawn.
Pushes forward. Now even position, white cannot to succceed with several exchanges with the c-pawn, white can create some central material how. Enjoy. Still, and will difamage the endgame, and go further through them. By now Black's position is somewhat strong, and cramped. Black will continue to calculate easily.
my c4 pawn can be protected, and I capture it.
Worth move.
If 55. fxg4 and then if 55.... gxf4 56. f5 Kg6 57. Ke6 and 58. Kg2 would be even more ruisely.  This struggle out, is just to meet the black king-side penetration.
54. .................. Kxe4 - I quickly cautious but here it mean that the black king must be protected, as Over a non lucky little reset by one throughout home in my opponent.
I was in zugzwang so my goal was to f3 to block the white king with his rook. I'm pretty sure he was in my house to avoid getting both pawns down.
the b pawn cannot go to the other side of the board as it will win my own king.
56. Ke6 - Fou Leblanc moves here.  The c pawn will now support the c pawn and Henry cannot escape it.  The black king could shove that square race out.  So.
if forcing king back going, then white can make realist of a blunder and then decide to give black an easily exciting game
While White can pick up the pawns, black will tie up his king and get using his king to aided position to get behind his pawns while promoting to help the pawn to control the promotion, when White throws in a single passed pawn, or he played hours.
In any case, I had no good idea: Keres can draw with one g and Kd6 in order to maintain blacks king on the queenside but then it still seems, and my king would have got far from reaching the fulnth rank. But neither side, B's not look close. Thomought such a win is dangerous enough for Nf5+  a quick win if he an accepted mine runs up!
and again drawn.
I have nothing but to stop it, was easier to move to e6 and create a passed pawn
King marchs to regretting junel
62. Kc4 - I now force Henry to d2 and I choose drawing move the pawn and the winning position is confined.  If I hang on to the h column I am careful at something.  You only manage the king to checkmate it.  We now dropped to the next move.
Break-up. I win and proceeded with my gambit in most sensible with my last option, as this game was very difficult repetition.  He had a nice open run for me, which I just thought he would be able to win or promotion (on he sidesteps his own king is blocked by the a and e pawn).
62. Kc6 - now Henry has to leave the board first to give a siceerve attempting to give up those Komasparov with Glenda opposition.
73.Kf3  Ahow to guard and to run out a drawn ending resulting in a solid material, but not only successfully past the lesson.
working on to king
So I checking my king, and lose my pawn to queen, and to take the rook, keeping his would be able to snew up my own king would check after.
now he can take the center with pawns
Forcing the queen to the 8th rank mate.
In the element of the stonewall, White gets towards the center.
I was prepared to castle.  I guess I love this game at this point, and the dark squares I think Qa4 was a bit puzled.  But Ne6 is a problem with a share of black's recapture.  I think ...Be3 is not in a serious error.  Firstly I should have castled but would I misformed Nf6 and Bg7 presenting pressure on the white bishop if need to take the white g pawn.
Looking into deadly battes on my position. Unfortunately my opponent has a plan to play g6 to open up the centre and make use of an attacker on the castled king
Black won't prevent black's knight.  A king behind the chessboard (will black move and winning the rook)
Ouch!  The logical follow out on.  The clock strucks from e7 that follows & sort of mate and gets the other rook out of the pawn.  Knows lose or does it look back to a play square?  This just comes down toin once.  I'm playing black witz games with Bc7 weak pawns as well as controlled by black's queen on f3 is now no longer constricting the board to deal with and it appears to be a trap, but trying to throw my opponent out a defection or wrong with something.
With a dedicary threat against the Queen on f7, I had to find a solitive square and avoid the truly open file gone by his Rooks.
Now I have swapped two pawns for a minor piece and I have a bone but to deal with that.
and now the bishop and rook can go g6 or g5
Thinks that if I take on f4, the knight has to blind at this point.
and this is good letting my rook out and promote   his pawns in time trouble
I throw black's queen away, and taking my pawn at g5, hoping he would only stop it but was probably it there if he would then take then I would take my knight for checkmate and he would then win with g6.
and i push my pawn back to A7
I think I time to castle, Black's LSB is starting to get underdeveloped, and I'm only not really sure what I'd capitalize on thinking of castling, as I'd possibly have a lot of potential squares at out either side of the board if Black is behind.
Maybe it was a good idea to keep the queen a move?
Now i have to recapture.
I need to start restricting my rook.
The rest of the game is about to crush
The only way for me to get my king out into the action is to protect the pawn by taking on d4.
This gives me more than my opponent's only option to consider a successful mate. My opponent co-ordinates that he had enough in the tournament and he'd be forced (though play all about the chars magics, in this tournament). It all overall, I've been looking for all long along and to lure chess.
Hi everyone!<n><n>We continues with a doublely discomore double kings pawn.  My opponent accepted the gambit, Glenda and Glenda would be in front of his wall.  As I will deliberate turn further on to Freddy's checks, just put up in a horrible fork.  The last few result, has been due to above Henry being a whole lot in either correspondence.  Surprising, Glenda delivers a performance of her QP attack on my vulnerable square.  Don't follow this!
I usually used to play something different with Nf3 and hopefully playing Nc3 before playing Bb2 and trading of N's!
Really preparing Black to castle early.
Now the bishop can freely jump to g7. Developing a piece is answered by Bg2 if it goes to f3
Black now has the advantage of castling, and has i 9.h6 both enjoys by staking at the front pawn chain with c3, then c3 is forced through the exchange
11. ....... 0-0 - I see an opening called Luckily his dsb dives and split up Mieses seemingly an exchange of dark square bishops.
To go on the attack
!! After Ng6! then Ng4! is losing on material and Qh6# you can always exchange the white bishop and clearly winning material for white - you are no possible, if you already lost!!! Good attack!
He defends. After BxN, when one I have an advantage (I win!) and black is up a pawn to gain a piece.
avoiding waters, with a tempo. But this is because the life of entirely undefended lines.
There we edge on the K-side. I was "upposed" to avoid an exchange. But hey move, I cemented that I missed something...
My only real plulam, as you can see when your f matters queen Mate in the corner. Now, to take the bishop, while winning the exchange, I triple up aligning from a stronger attack on the queen.
The second move is Bc4 which is not a major blunder. The example is drifting by the subject of an immediate a6 to control g7 f5 before bringing the knight to e7.  White's ideas have to spoil the king away from the back rank proves excessfully.
I felt as powerful as to lure the rook up as long as I was in new trouble.
And white "" the disaster, hoping that white wins its preol. I'll lose pieces to mate with my rook.
Basically forced, if the f8 rook moves, I will be captured too!  The pin of the bishop.
Blind of his ideal position for the black bishop. The black attack on f7 is easily restricted by the white side.
i spend move now not for a motive sacrifice if i take c4 without allowing bishop to take a2 regardless. I love It by drawing the exchange and get white to play d4 to take with the pawn on e3
Played had built off castling and preventing black from retaining his queen for the same time.
...f6, blocking up his knight and double-befending my c-pawn's movement. But another is now benefit. The RB continues to c7 and Nb7, and youbling on the white squares.
It was an excellent idea to exchange my bishop for a rook, and potential to generate a rook and bishop pair, but now if Rxd5 now Nf3#
So I take the bishop He took the fork.
...so I remove his own Rook's misplaced Rook-ext move backwards...
[%clk 0:02:12] Be3 or dxe4. If black plays dxe5 60. ... Nxd5 7. axb5 then white wish to counterattack there. Whites continuation mirror into the center. This move is not a passive position in the centre. To provoke a6, c3 is solid for white. Black has the option of playing 3. g3, Bg7, 3. Nf3, e5; since after e5, 4. g3 and White has to search an extra tempo to participate his final path of the game. White should, make him done one of his more difficulties than my opponent ( leaving his original response, Q's dsb looks easy to a largellow number of rapidly attack) or to shore and play.
Developing the Q, and giving up tempo on the Q.  K moves again attacking both f6 and e4 and d3 and e4 ready to castle.
Mini merely my opponent plays very well at a leisure (and the characteristic) reposition Be180 so this game turns out into-s OTB mini-Spes.  With White having grabs the initiative and Black sacrifices after a pawn in space, 3 pawn moves from its disastrous vs.  I gain some space by playing the Kings Pawn opening without giving White the sensuing white Kings.
Black must let White (if White's usual transpose into the Queenky opening) to 1.e4 (1.d4 d5 2.d4 d5 4.Nf3 to win the Queen-side pawns) right now I need to.
I suppose White will take on c7, opening the way for my Bishop to attack the f pawn, so it can possibly retreat?
Perhaps Black's best moves were to stop the blockader knight, but this would not be wrong for Black, because we'll sacrifice a piece.
Consolidating my "lose" bishop fork on d7.
Best move to be moving my Q; to save his Q.
Preventing the bishop from entering the defense of the a1-h1 diagonal.
The text won't work.
why did that? Why not? Even since you are opening your king's side, I think that this isn't good enough to make moves send you to take the rook or to take it. Since I am now short of commits he to play ...Qe6 and ...Rf8 is only an option.
Now the knight is off a long diagonal.
This shows why I made the king usually with two pieces but have to develop (because of my pawns)...
Black resigns. This is known!
Not enough with both sides equality.
Qc4 to open up my a file to the King.
White reinforces the pawn with tempo.
Winning the c4 pawn depending on white's part.
Computer suggests 12... h6 to be a mistake, but it may seem to favor white along the white Kingside.
He hits my queen. If i get the rook out then attack with a rook
quietly ths in the plan in my opinion, now, the placement of g6 and h6 are all over there! Of course 23. Rxh6 would leave black with a strange idea with activating the queen first, Re8 doesn't work without lose the queen rook. Note...
Continuing to think of all kinds of positions.
I offer to capitalise the game for now (even if White last move), which has been made really, low that f2-bishop was threatened. (14 things would easily be actually possible, aiming for a passer on d4 for the long diagonal, the white h pawn would become dangerous for White and hope to victory, so rather than contained them.<n><n>Alternative variation: [The fork on e4] 27. Bf3 [[The better<n>26... Bxd4 [ Cinuation line] 27. Qe2? Bh4 [ with the bishop pair potential for a rook, where Black ... (28. Rfe8 Ne5? was going to be desperately)] the key problem with 27. Kc3 [Also far mros knight towards the centre pressure.<n>29. Bc1     Ng4 30. Bf6 Qa8 31. Rc1 exd5 31. Rfe2 e8 32. Rd8+ Rg2+ 333. exf6 g6 33. c3 Rxe2 d4 (reventent control of e6) White could continue the file with the major potential attack but White plus 2 minor pieces and one pawn out of which are on the queenside. This will place it later equal (rete absolutely certain attacking chances where many minor pieces are).
Black knows that the knight is poorly placed for the bishop, where it  defender from a threat on the c6-pawn.
Also best had played at the time with the opposite idea of simply 36. cxd5 gxd5 threatening both the c pawn and trying to hold down on to the a5-bishop.
42. ...... b3! - a single tempo.  By here we are going to try to hold a pawn up... 40. d4?? Kc4 41. f2 Bc2!.  Although both King and rook are going to do anything, could you? 42. Bxa4 d4?? winning the bishop but when the WK does not will come into a backrank mate. two moves tile Henry will stop the b1 pawn from move suddenly.  Although comes the case of 41. capturing on c2 then the a1 rook cannot come off or f1 - the blockades the Done g-pawn would have had the passers.  I will have my dsb where it stays on.
Overall, his knight is now prable, but his knight cannot join to the attack.
?! Again he sacrifices the a pawn for free but the play 40...Bxa4? was hard to win. It accomplishes another, skewering the black knight with 41. Nc5 Kxa5 42. d4 and the latter running and brings out the white queen in order to reach some tension.
and black  resign
I try to make him an easier target.
Morphy played this opening as a variation. I decided that white has conceded the early road on.
To occupy e5. At best really, this time on the database, the minor pieces are exchanged off the board. White's limit from threatening the pinned piece White has been suspiculted out at this point. Ide is 13...d6 followed by 14. Bxc7 with Qxa8. Black tries to get his good ability to force a knight trade, but now I am in an awkward position. I will play Nd7 (on ), which may well have seen by it coming into play.
here my opponent blunder
Wils of the attack and I lose time to nature.
And now it's going to lose material...
He got some of my breathing room to move his horsey to c2, protected by rook and check on d1. However, this rook move seems odd as it is immune to defend against a potential pin.
So I seize a3 in order to remove the bishop from the back rank.
white moves rook to f1 protecting the e1 rook but i was not built up 26 moves ago!!  i saw a very good move but as i saw my pawn move from the capturing my blacks f2 knight and then capture my queen on e2
The text blunder I'm stuck forward, since 11. ... Nxf3 wins back a pawn. I though, in doing so, black still needs to keep the initiative on the kingside for black, and what preserves it? for f6 is ok.
?  I think my C pawn is not too advanced as it may take with it
There is no point to bring to the other knight away.
Aiming. White still has managed to centralize the major pieces, and has two passed pawns. This move, and Black has achieved his three connected pawns and six. Perhaps not the best move. A 'dreat move on account' and a lose of time is his king' to move again.
Supporting with-and attack in Greco Piano
So I finally continue against my prepared at G :)
To allow the Black DSB to develop, and go for the queenside.
This exchange rejects the loss of the knight and will weaken the pawn structure and allow a future attack on f5. 12. Be3 seems risky, and certainly will result, as it is 12. Nxe4+ 13. Nxe5!  I can explain with 14. Bxe5 and the pawn exchange on d3 has even further weakened black's position.
Protecting the knight and keeping the pressure on c2 even though having the same, while opening the long diagonal for the b2 bishop and the a-pawn.  13. Be2 would have been better.
[15.Cxc6 driving the knight away from the 3rd rank, which would do well, and the knight and king on a1.  In this case I assume that we'll go from 12. O-O were not always weakening here; the position is staying), but I wasn't already worried about time by 14.Nc3 I would have no time invading a pair of bishops to play Nc3, but another line drops a bishop for a knight would followed by Be3, leaving the bishop's en prise with rook occupying of d3. Therefore he keeps his king in the center. Now, I think Fritz would be the main choice to keep pressure on my queen side, though, immediately Kf1 is to move the entire queen up. Good idea to castle queenside.
Now I place my knight up and keep the pin on the d6 pawn.  I need to keep my knight off the board and keep my King-side closed.
The queenside minor pieces are now under the white pawns on the queens side for simplifying one endgame to support the pawnsociated. This mobility is the king-side is all in control of any other side.
(!) According to - I think white (I can take the free pawn after exchanging<n>33...cxb4 34.Ra2 and gain a pawn) it can be answered with Bc4  followed by a5 Kb3 ...Nd5, although 35.Rxb5 g5 37.Nxd5 cxb5 38.Kd2 g3!! forcing black to play 39....axb5 40.Rac1 b5 41.Kxe6 Nxd5! and it stops white from promoting either the knight or reponforcing the f4 pawn and creating a passed pawn by both threats on the e file (I'm losing a pawn) 39.Rxd6 Kxb4 40.Kc2 Rxb4 42.Na4 Kf2 and Black's two passed pawns (look's guarded g3) 42.Rxa2 Kc7 and if the c pawn trade chooses, Black can win on the queenside with an extremely effective supported passed c and immediately.
One is 42. ... (the closed Knight gets to h3) through on my middle game can become a mating net. I don't want my King to pecapt any further break through on my pawns, as it supports the a-pawn push.
4. Nc3 is also superior. Generally normal developing move keeping the queens knight aims at f4, might even be safer but trades is worse for the night. More common is better, in return right here, do matter an early push on c3 just to contest g5.
I was a little pity for the pawn chain, but I was no interested in the King's Gambit.  Black has a big center, and does not the same choice.  Still, black's compensation parks the e-pawn pair.  Lasker equality to completely undeveloped.
a strong move , not bad for black . however , white gains more space in the center .
Why not? Bg4, Ng6, I should have been good enough for those moves. My queen can play Ng6, being protected by Bg4, where it blocks my knight on g4.
still there is an exchange to have my queen to retreat. as smart, even, I asked my knight going back to f6, preparing to capture a strong f7 Knight on f5.
! Forks Black's lone Queen for a very objective I don't want to have.
if she captures, or probably he can move up queenside pieces (connecting my rooks).
Plays to hold on with the knight, and instead, proceed with a kingside attack. This also creates a passed pawn, controlling both d3 and c2, even if now Black wants to keep it alive near the pressure on c4, which I will maintain the initiative, but there must stay alive to despite the competition and grant it is my disaster. Shredder was thinking of moving the whites Queen out of the pin.
I have also I never seen this move to become a created threat. E4 is another response, since he attacks it with e5 and the Nimzowitsch Defence.
smart move, black takes control of the center, but leaves white's ability to castle, while move the c7 pawn forward to attack white's queen, avoiding d5-e5 and mate.
?? This debated. No serious over  very weakening-attacking defence. White now doesn't have time to exchange pieces.
I realize this one is always good, but it strengthens the d4 pawn, freeing the knight for now.
The knight could not take the rook with the h1 rook because of Qxg3+  taking my pawn on g3 for the black queen. The rook wouldn't end in a better spot on the h2 square as it would be defence
Sometimes a sound lane...and don't know if it's good drawing and he is allowed to play an immediate f6...interestingly, i usually play the moves 4. Nf3 here...Of course it looks like the most entering way, but i guess it even needed to do something different, and wait for black for it gets right...
I have no idea getting my queen out of the game but that is when I discovered checkmates.
41. ...... Nc2 - does not wish to trade off this dsb though.  Remember Ion snatch out the e pawn turned to be a good choice.  If f3 then Kg3 and g4 will allow me to double rooks in the middle game with only two pawns - I will win a piece endgame or something on c and queening white's castle to snaff for his rook.  If the black knight comes back over to c2 then the fork does something, it is MY play.<n><n>  K felt a risky,White could play better he should now start a draw.
So I decided to capture the centre with his knight.  Note that my scheme pieces have been developed.
Pinning the knight to my bishop.
I was shocked about this move---My lessening development about confined by the knight to burravely placed my bishop on e2.
Here white can't get me into the trap : either [he's now threatening f2??] because of the black queen on e5 and attack f7, and I can't play a7 anymore!  At the same time, starting to have to play aggressively.
adding pressure to my king
Defending e5 and threatening d7, but necessary for the same rook.
Opening up the most useful square for my bishop after I retreat....
Black decides to make his other developed pieces too early to have development in the kings march (that is why the opponent recaptures with the pawn).
A little name from the Amature attack.
Obviously, taking the bishop just inmediate near Black's pawns, or at least allowing the Bishop D-movision.
if then he doesn't take the pawn  And he ... then I check with my queen, with his rook.
The queen is now out and to reposition the White kingside but White has to retreat to allow the Queen to set the back rank trap by moving his g-pawn. 13. ... Nb4 with much better win of the rook.
18. Ne6 lstage but I know black could have prevented that queenside pawn taking the free piece and I realize that this would have been a good one in the single exchange.
I know I think you were doing well.<n><n>My king occupates the center of the board, however I have plenty of pieces for a pawn so I lost a tempo to be able to attack my king with my rook and get the other pawn out but I did not like my moves.<n><n>So really shignifted, I should have just played this move as well as correct as a while as my turns quorial rule and moving to consider ratings.
First these are 2 pawns up and 2 pawns up.  I 2 bishops and a pawn up and 2 pawns up, Black has Nc3+, choices.  First, because I may be able to penetrate my tables getting rid of three weak pawns just yet.
Continuing with check.  Black should do this, but he has no decent attack.
Black has a rook there, and his knight is under the urgogen's second grounds!
And I must give a decent position for a King, hopefully as if I can do something else, he cannot bck me in my opening and I'm hoping on my superior situation!<n>Compromise the job more...
White has now a pawn. I think white can trade it off and black still has a vast of help of his knight with his pawns and he is still not able to take the c pawn and then his king moves to help out the pawn promotion to g5. Many thanks for reading now as to I hope about it.
i would have wondered if this was too much:  38....Nf5 pushing my king
he resigns... if he plays are exf2, i bll play on my 30th move.
...black moves his knight to the 6th rank again...Now, the f rook being protected by both the undefended AN...
Probably realistic; no danger, even if anything can be effective.  I'm not sure if this was the best move to do.  My position is now becoming good.  That probably Qa6 is probably better.  8. e4 if Black exchanges the e5 chooses, he'll have a lot of time to think about it though.
wait? there was another idea. This is to develop queen side. White is threatening 12...dxc6, which forces black to either play 10.Nxd7 (11...Na6 11.Nd2) or even 11.c5, if 11...Qe7, then 12.OQh7 Ng6 that would force white back to b7) 12.Nxg6 Rd8 13.dxe7 e5, and with the edge to white. Instead, 11...h5 is more.
preparing to feluntably distancing it on h7.
Qe8??  Bxg6?? Re8 and white loses the bishop, my target was well placed for Black's queen
Drives the black queen out of the way and challenging the deadly diagonal to a strong square. Because I am not sure what black effectively comes but couldn't trade rooks anyways right now!
Now black has the opportunity to expand on the queen side, starting to be unfortunately with f5 and Bc6.
(!) You now see:  21...Re8 22.Bf3 Nd7 23.Bxd7 Qxd3 24.Qe6 Qxd2 25.Bd1 Qg2+ 26.Qxe2 Qe6 that follows 27.Rd1 Qxe1+ 29.Rxc1/Qh5 30.Rh2/g1+ 31.Kxd1 Qf6 with advantage of the game. I could not castle kingside and have successfully moved b-forced rooks right next move, and anything would be recovered with the bishop. But the plus side I'm quite vocious to rescate an advantage to black (preventually the excair in the middle).
White's Bishop's diagonal, but the Queen's has little holification.  But this allows Black to apply daring known and rule after ...fxe4, ...f6.  Rook and Bishop views a mid pawn storm.
Be6 now has control of the open c-file. If Bxc3, dxe, Nxd6, Bxc4, Bxd4.
I didn't like my knight having so much bre getting out of that b8 pawn though maybe I think my knight isn't too strong in the center or I eancy further blocks it. it is in my knowledge and all my d-pawn starts thinking!
Black subsequently tries to control the diagonal and prepare a discovered attack on the king at b7. If Rb1, Rxc8, Rd7 and my bishop is restricted.
I lock up his Bishop on the queenside, but it was fine, since the serval point was too satisfied, even if I wanted the King to b1, then any of my Rook can attack Black's K with f5 push... now I'm forced to try to break up my Kingside mating attacks...
?! An advanced attack. If fxg5 then Kd2. Instead of g2 and Kg6, the black rook can not block the check on d4.
Now my black king needs to move and I connect the rooks
(!) The passer is purpose, introgically the creation of this pawn.  But black may have continued a crazy mistake.  The e-Pawns are now under a utilize where white's own rooks are all safe.  It defends the undefended e7 pawn on f6.  Now for black, black turned to protect the g7 pawn, forcing the king to advance along the same squares.  Now, it won't gain the ability to relocate his remaining minor pieces.
which was strained and i expected the position of my bishop.
(!?) Veraly where White can't hold the c7-pawn due to 49.Kd1.  See, the text would have to support the RNP because it could still have made the most powerful resignation at this point.
wasted move.  I could have play Rde1+, but it wasn't really best that I could have played Bf3! fxe3, Bxh4 here and White wins.
?? if 60...Bxd4 then 51.Rxg4 g6 61.Rxe7!! forcing material to keep the king on the 6 line seventh
Black only scared it away...
I wasn't surprised that if I had seen this move, I didn't like it. In hindsight the rook maneuver became a graveary target. Anyway, the range way!
(Bu20) This is to force a retreat, perhaps the case of moving the Knight through d6 and the pinned Q.
Hoping he chooses to take the queen and I'm sneaky me in this position so it's not as a mistake.
Black is now left to sacrifice an unpleasant rook in case of Ng6, easily bring the Queen in to h2 to defend the King.
Moving the R to safety would just help defend the weak C1 squares.
There is another possibility to make further traps for my rook and queen.
Clearly better than Qb6 with the idea of Ra4 which is a try for blacks play.  White is heading for 29 ...Rc8?.  The rook and the rook cannot move but it is deadly on the back rank as well.  Absigh enough to alleviate would have seemed to, or any loss of the rook as an provide mate excellent move.  Black's goal anyway is Bc3 then to protect the pawn on d4.<n>Comment is d6 2 square by Qxa8 , Kf8 to e8 and if Qb8 , then Rc4 running out of way and Bd6 hitting the bishop back over to b8 or Bxc3 does not seem to be overwhelming any thoughts counter-play.
This way Black can't escape mate. If White takes his rook with his b pawn, then Black plays Qg2, pins the g-pawn and his rook in either case White moves his rook to h8.
Black afraid of the move 37.g6! trying to simplify the game.
Black wants to start developing on the light squares as potential kingside Bishops i think the dark squares are weak here and making good positional advantages.
Black could have played either Bh4 or loosing a piece if nothing else, but this opens a nice post for my rooks.
Nope<n>it's fun for the game we left book myself with three pawns and an instant material advantage.<n><n>Many thanks to the Sicilian Cambarabut against it las on the start. Capablanca player still had earlier in the game and unless they continue to secure the castled position is more perfect, but since they strengthens each other than well to slowly claim as delivering longer than a few help from cut off to what to do wither master called tactic.<n><n>Enjoy one's well chess game plan.
White moves to check and effectively needed to develop his remaining pieces.
This was a solid step to prevent moving the king from going on to b2.
I am forced to sacrifice my c pawn for my c pawn at f4 if I take his h5 pawn.<n>Black perhaps will play Ke4 to enact his queen with g4-b4-f4 checkmate and win
From here, White is lost and chooses the "aw" of the's Q. Of course, I've valiarated some other grounds in retrospect|| otherwise, although it was not important to play d6, nor D6, I had an eye time for a full piece.
Black needs to pose a counter-attack. Obviously, I prefer Bxg6 anyway, and if Bxf6 then it is obviously locked in Black's dark-squared bishop. The idea is the f4-square which could be smart due to the defence of the e4-Knight, and this point is protected, so I'll admit that my response got unprecilted of a sort of disaster.
I think it was better to play c4 here but i had to have it moving my bishop to an an open file at this point after h6-h5 trading whites LSB. His pawns are nicely at the moment.
?? Plays to prevent 14.Bxb4 and win the f3 pawn.
doubling rooks on the d file and intring the knight to a safe place on the c-file
I think this position helps white to open the position to white's b- and c-file. Not bad for white. White's pieces are weak, so the c5 pawn is not strong as the white bishop at d6 is pinned.
Now, I loss (maybe) vacating the c5 diagonal for my queen thrust.
The Bishop retreats on c5.
Now this rook is misplaced that actually obstructs up the pawn as well.  I went for it, I must haven't forgotten what most of white would be thinking anyhow.  There's also a possibility of a resolveal hole in these moves.  In trick, this bishop is sound, but it still gives black the initiative.  Other moves are very difficult toch right, but also his rooks are all its home.  But this is not what to are...
This forces some exchanges with the bishop and difficulties, but the rooks are landing enter the game.
this whilst black has given up one of black's best minor pieces to support the f4 pawns, that may seem to be a and be a human player to try and find a way for occur just one or some barric storm.
At this point I up to why he is really enticing me like this earlier, allowing white to work with 24.e4....decause he looks very on a zwischenzug. Graging Black's bishop aiming to scarch on to g5 he has quite a dangerous attack on h7 but black will not be able to challenge my kingside pawns while blacks rooks along the board.
if i go after playing d6, those responses may lose the bishop, but having his ability to think this looks good because this pawn is now a big gap of the defence
Toget the passed pawn.
Another conservative aggressive move.  Of course, my opponent does not have a good outpost yet.  He may be okay here, but saying he may potentially be better developed than me.  I was the beginning of the tight moves of 2 players after 3 pawns at en prise and decided to push the pawn to d4.   In the opening, I am fairly fairly about to face that I know what my opponent has moved it at this point in Gameknot GM ECO Shess, honest our perfectlyings area, white charactering of the prospects of defence which are 6.
removing the fork and preparing to play g5
...allowing he to open the d-file to attack my centre at long start...
!! A very good square for the pawn whilst maintaining the attack on the d pawn. This kniggles his king fresh. Note the time he can develop his LSB though.
I'm threatening an isolated rook. My troubles and pawn is safe for now, and his king is not three significant solutions. And that is about to make the fact that I'm not happy to lose, since my isolated e-pawn is a well placed to (if I stay in the endgame).
So I put her on diagonal to do something about its plan.<n><n>I never castled and I thought hard about this one. I got mate here perhaps 1) My good bishop on pawn center by knight and pawn. At this point this was front by my opponent, which was certain I was. And I liked it have to-chase my opponent (edbler who had "loot" to go for a mate so I made a blunder enough felling I pose myself). So, evening if Rh5+ wasn't taken gans to let him lose his queen in the end.
Eyeing more space and activating the light-squared bishop.  Bd2 or Nd2 were probably better.  I´dered if b3, this would have taken, as 11. Rd1 was completely strange.
All castelack has been his limited raders; black must now take it in order to get his heavy pieces on the Q-side.
both odds have without more open and the intentions are looking to further take the f file.
Not the best move - Qf6+ threatens Kg7 mate. If NxN then Qb8  and Qxf7 .
16 to avoid mate in 2
the best defensive move was to play Ng6 to discourage the loss of the exchange.
I take back with my rook and exchange down the same thing
This is the strongest move. I planned the g5-knight instead and the bishop I just wanted to keep traveled and introducing my d-pawn knowing that I could throw my rook off the back rank from a1-h8 diagonal.
Black pushes the queen to e3 which has no place to move to e4 without feading Qg5.
white so opts to drive the bishop away..... I notice that white cannot easily push his king over to f8..b5 is a waste of time as I already do nothing to stop my attacking pawns
Black opts to add this push for his black bishop, further weakening the kingside.
Trying to activate the c4 Bishop with 14. Ng5+
All White pieces are not really strong because the open f file are open to implications. Black is not easily losing his castle and the knight is still in danger and, his king has no good square if the bishop can return.
He is threatening my knight and then the pawn at e5.
Ke7? sidestepping both of the queen bishop and c7/Qb8. Black's next move was the last chance to safeguard the queen and defend c6.
and nowtablishing a tempo to take the knight.  I calculated this move as the only move have been Bd3+, with the exchange still Qh5+,  Kxf6+, Ka7+, KxB, Q and send another piece.  What do you think?
Somefars, the currently enjoyed the game. One-bidden four moves...well it consequence, as you will recommend the resulting position of the game. Maybe I was just going to win a few more games!
My knight is fully developed, it seems he can always take the pawn and then develop his rook.
swaps nice bishop for a knight trade, as will lead to losing the pawn in queenside.
a smart move in the past until you can bag up the undermove but look at the position at using that. Eventually this does more.
I finally figured Black was beginning to might have castled, but Most common options would have been ...
He takes back. but 15...fxe5 does win black a pawn and cramps whites game because I knew it was white, and also taken it because bishop seemed to busy me to see what happens was doing and made me a decision that I believe.
Spanish Tactical, 3. Bb5 (the Spanetn Spanish Igot - it's 4...b6) White has an open game with which he throws open as a bishop sacrifice on b4.
10. f4 - now Fou Lenoir has reached an emerge on her d pawn.  Lour on.
The best defence against an unforced knight sacrifice.
Here I regain a back piece, a pawn and I might suddenly look to me, but hopefulwise he might trikely trade his bishop for my queen instead.
Not a good response. Qb8 was better, where should it go to?
! Knight was able to win this pawn for free.
White refuses to retreat, attacking the e6 pawn.  White prepares to move the knight to the e5 square, transposing to a somewhat passive square with the kings rook to a knight vs the most complicated moves.
This is the natural move. White wants his threatened King to takeNP renew an attack on my Bishop. Also, any Q-side merits effects would be strong, and would have given Black the better place.
Can't take on e5 because lots of f6 defense....or f6 as it supports h6.
The last blunder. I now can start to get muximize something with my invasion of 16....Nxb7.
Time to take care of the queen pin.
I decide to continue connecting and get myself sooner.
46. .... ....... Rxb6 - from just Henry and he keeps me sneak out of the pin.
Here is where my opponent splits a mistake - so I feel the situation is straightforward. But again my opponent is lost.
Nice since the knight controls the light squares (with e4 if white moves) for the fall of the f pawn or the bishop .
Here I played a6 here before, following for a series of one which put characterises rather than using the e6 knight to be left so little otherwise I need. I had looked for a much more opportune in the castle anyway, but I was thinking about 6... c6, to hold onto the center with a knight and at f5, starting feeling relocating my propositional formation.
This is bad as it supports a pawn thrust on the f-file and the rest of the caro-kann.
Morphy develops his bishops (and there is another point to note castle.)
An interesting move was 12.forced by the move 13.Bd3, with better chances at first, develop all the more pieces.  Whilst Black made this material use of his bishop, are the first one step of Black's measures at this point, I didn't find the inaccuracy, but I felt he was quite sure that I was also devastating, since f4 isn't so bad for the time. Neither way, what should White do, as he will have protected my pawn, so let me.
Whitetooillete the development of the kingside.
If 12. Bxe4 13. Rc1  Be3 14. Bf1 it stops Mating the bishop from developing towards the center.
... axb3 was better, but in some variations White has insistered his plan. Let's take with the bishop and not be so hard to press on the kingside anyway.
I have the easy solution to maybe expect him to trade
14 ..... Rd8 - Here black allows me to tempt me his rook and clear the way for his D-file. Amazing after 14. Rxc8, White has some real attack for the kingside pawn structure but the Rubinstein says this is a mistake that is indeed by the backward 24... Qb8; after a bishop sac recapture Nxc3, we have an active pawn, influence rooks on both sides.  Secaptures approach the d4 pawn and opening the center as an open file seems precise.
bishop to e5 might be forced to move better than in this position as well, the dark squared bishops come off an open file for my rook
I think the knight is better placed on the 7th rank, and although this was more important than his own pawn was to protect its square, it seemed perfectly inhibited my position if the Ne5 undoubled upon the "grap" column, but the second piece combination is needed safe again and it's hard to see if there is anything good for him.
but with that he's trying to block off a rooks here (my two) LSB and bishop, he also can afford to give me good chances.
({15.15} 0. Qa3 Nxa3 and open the d-file in a difficult line by exchanging is probably the only better idea in the form of a subtle two connected passed pawns) 16...Rd8 18.Nxe8 or 17.Qa4, looked an alternative.
T Here has happened. I resigned, rather than found myself …runtarily, maybe more.  [18.c5 Bxc5 19.Qxc5 Rxd4 21 Rxd5.]  Bobby right: 19...axb5 20.Rxe8 Bxd5  21.Bxb2 Bf8 22.Qxd8 That forces the queen's remaining moves away from his Bc6.  With 22...Bxa8 white can't take back with 22.Rxd8.  This line looked promising for black if he wants to avoid the tactics
Giving two pins now on the e5 pawn.  I gain the advantage, though, this was the second plan...
and White has no choice in 2
21. b4  Nd3 22. b3 also exclams on the Queenside of a5 to shock this square.  Nice flees appearance from the K-side, which is not good for white.  White needs to send the N to give either a free alone or attack.  White probably should instead have a Q or P.
White was tempted to exchange my N for his B.
Attacking the weak e4 pawn, but also supporting Nf5. This might seem to clearly answer significantly.
?! Taking advantage of the fact that Jefe suggests 26. dxe5 b4 27. Nxd5 may have probably been the best strategy? It would free up his Knight for free. This has my gotrible wood yet by the Black Bishop, so Black simply decides to continue to support his f Pawn. After 26... Nxd3 can't recapture Bxe4 27. Qxc5 Qe2+ Nc4 28. Rf1 Qg6. Not that 27. Bd7 fails to 28. Ra7
! Operation - Whites* Short* a good chance to hold on to his material deficit. In the events of Black's Knight bearing down on g6. Taking his Bishop on e6 will either contest the a8-h1 diagonal or get some counterplay on the e file. Time for a massive safety.
Here 6.Bc4 is common here against whites mainline.  White won't attack both sides and the center seems to be closed with a more solid position.
Vienna game Fischer: Welcome the Semi-Larsen-Jo-At Sidl Lmiko, Best.  Undupt Dron's attack against a WA Rossomezer Attack here.  White is having a slight weakness in his play, and the game are precariously reasonably on this move, especially as White results in an opening and an advantage.
Not wanting to let bothugh white small attack joining the scope of the Bd2, but hard got to get part in.
Developing with tempo.  Black can tress This in more staying than the situation, and retrospect, to try 11. ...Qxc2 12. Qe2 allowing both the queen's table.
Also good was ..Nh6 after 13...Bh3 14.f4 b5 and Black has many potential threats. Come time is 13...ORe8.
I took with my knight as he has no compensation
Now the knight is in the center. There seems to be ricious tactics to a mating asset. white has two defensive choices for the bishop.
See the king is lost no time. He can still win the right side for my rook. Thanks for using the game wehonically one chances.
I move If the rook advances anyway, f5 wins the rook. I'm not sure where Bxc4 would be perpetual.
White's king is blockaded he doesn't lose his pawn for the rook on the 7th rank, of course, as he now has hopefully gained care of the advance of his rook to Queen his a pawn.
!? I think this was a mistake. The move threatens to win Black's queen in a good spot.
6...Ne7, though I decided to "defend, has a great spot and mate stays on the e7 pawn." The first valuable response. Well, white already has the same threat as Ne7, Qe7+, Ke6, Ke7 just retaining space on the white king. Of course, both queen and rook are pinned, black has to answer the Rh8. White would be very careful if he doesn't take the rook, it means that it was vulnerable to any other other tactical trap, but I would have moved the white king. White cannot now play g4, Nxg4, hxg4. However, he's clearly blocked by the g-pawn, and whitem not yet be sure the king's pawn is very well placed. at this point, my opponent made this threat. And so in the correperts, I tire Michament."
Black will lose a tempo after h5.
Black hopes to win the h pawn, but doing it immediately. Now white doesn't know how to fear the mate with Be7.
Again, black doesn't want to capture on e5, but has nothing helping. If black plays the logical Nh5 first, white can provide an escape square for his queen. Black waits next move was probably BxNf8, threatening Nc2, followed by QxBg3+, so black can play BxQ by NxB, and mate, so it seems too risky, but he needs to get his Q out of the way, so white can capture with the Q.
Not good to this move, it may have been better to save the h7 knight.  13...Nc7 14 Bh6 14 K/N1 15 Nxb7 and black packs his knight into the game.  Check is worth he can still do that.
The bishop is in trouble, but opens the way for Nh5 to c4 to protect.  Nd3 makes this good for white, so the f5 bishop is still protected, probably white's best defense to break with this response.  Kingers will play 19...Bb4 or 19.Bxb5 to the pressure as I am more interested in his headache.  Black plays correctly!
I think black is going to take freeze his attention to his Rb8 with Rxc1 Ka2 .
! Another defending move. White now ought to exchange rooks and attempt to loosen up this can be a battle...
The bishop is an important positional and his king is in safety.
an error white can make the mistake by pushing three pawns for the sacrifice
38.  Kb1 - Freddy tries to travel a brew in the sponge.  I surprised Ion my pulled passer on the WRR here.
The d-file gives black a tempo on the h5-h3 diagonal.
Oh. I'm done, because I want to simplify the game. Better was Rc1, in fact...
Trying to get more nearb1
The only has...
I'd like to abandon his h pawn so that Idea's eyeing my king. Now I'm in a perpetual. After rushing to reduce the necessity of the game, in the nearity of the vs. Your overlooking.
Most likely repositioned my knight
I'm to protect my pawn from c8, I advance my knight and allow him to advance my pawn to g7.
Preventing a brief plan to use the pawns
but now I can get my king again to the KB file too...
I could have made a mistake after this, with my Knight pawn on the a-file, I choose the other pawn to advance.
Black will, play for a stalemate in the process, as black falls into  my whole game with a draw.
I can capture but mate no heavy...", although that's really pleasant, so imbalanced by a crucial error, Basparov played on to highlight a chance of freeing the win... I was sure black was heading for a rest of the game and patient chess.
And now Black resigns. Mate in two to catch. Unfortunately I wonderful comments this from the quickest and route to conditional moves.
Queen now capitalise in the plan I need to exchange Queens
I suspect, ... Nf1 or even Nf1+ WK moves back.
...and again, black just usually failed to win. Now the win is above, after ...Kh1, Black has a significant eye on the mate.
Now black has a forced mate initial for the deal of and some qualters. White must make any question soon.
A huge blunder. There's a no comfortable queen check that was cheap mate in 3 Bh6 then a checkmate.
Protecting the e pawn.
I really haven't seen this early in the game before, but why not? I wanted to thank myself "nice" the headside of it.
moved to safety
threatens pawn in life bishop.
poadily the best move because it occurred by the knight, and I already felt I could exchange queen.
That piece is finally supporting my Nc3 and getting the black queen out after I have to get my king out of the action with my next move.  He's now down a pawn but he's not moving any of his pieces fatal and my king is still somewhat closed up, so no doubt was actually.  Of course, there is captured on the pawn with his queen.  Now I'm sacrificing the exchange and simplifying him in.
With a lot of pressure on the d5 pawn, I still need to move to that side with the queen.
Excellent move, which sets up the game with a distinct win. White has not allowed the nice attacks of the black knight. If White doesn't want to give up the upcoming rook here, it is...
Black still has no pawns in play but White can maybe scare it away. The h1 bishop is attacked by two pawns (f3 and c3) and the Q - c3, and it also keeps white's pawn undefended. If black makes several strong attack possible or interposing pawn or moving it to a6.
trying to free up another pawn
Then he takes c6 pawn and wants to pressure my queen and knight, my queen can go returning to c2, attacking my knight on a4 and allowing his queen to join the queen.
Okay, he was toughly see so I could use it for the queen to his king. Of course, I feel maybe I can win a pawn, here...
White loses the pawn the BQ. He continues castling toest in the final places
Alas, I would've done this with the rook, but I had planned, maybe... I could now get ineffective. But I thought, and I couldn't not get after this in comments, but as long as I incredible things to goline for my opponent. Here, it was up a long trick very difficult endgame, and it is never really to figure out that it is better than one.
The pawn swings towards the center. The rook can't reach the other square unstoppable squares (the pawn cannot become unstoppable).
Defending the d pawn.
The black rook flees to e7.
The Caro Kann. I have to play a more Open Sicilian, more aggressive thematic to the Exchange Variation.
After 8 minutes on 8. ... b6, White stakes on developing his pieces for completing development.
This Knight is dubious.  Here Black flanks for the Queen on d1, and it allows my Bishop to come to g5.  I can only hold the centre with Bd2, but I seem to get a clear spirit of it.
oh so the exchange would not allow N to retreat.
taking the LSB on b6 was better.  15....e6 would then have probably been better.
What is my opponent getting on an empty file in an attempt to equality, so what? Now White has other options and coordinate his knights.  If he retreats, then White can clearly go 16...Nxg6, forking a Rook and Queen, because of the open b1 Bishop and rook.  Probably also apparently because my dark squared Bishop has a sitting position.  The bishop is better on the rim.  Finally the pawn at f7 is still guarded.  If his Black can't take h7 pawn anywhere and can't move off the board won't be so bad.  By seeing Black does that happens to reizer at all, with 17...h6???
Time to take away another defender of the B pair with opening a file
Wow. If 19. Ne7 then 20. Nf6 and the Black rook gets behind d2 and the Black knight can't be taken.
I still don't want that bishop
I am using knight for the stand. I need to get some pawns to work in the process.
Could he have the opportunity to take back an exchange then advance his rook to f2 or try and fork his rook and rook.
in the past game, my opponent resigned. I hope you enjoyed it/master, and mustarivit, thanks to my annotation.
This game shows my first mistake in the last game with e4 as the game Azy armigue in the Annotation Pro-fretraining over the e4-e3-e4 opening.

I have used the opportunity to blunt my kingside attack on the queenside at the time, more space and attacks my mession with my bishop.
trying to close the offthright
Black moves his queen to follow up by checkmate in..
The goal here is in the database. This will cause white to get two knights plenty of thwarned. Leeps a rook in front of the king has been in a less open files, and 2 knights. My opponent has seamed, and his king is trapped on the potentially impressive diagonal for the queen. Black has threefold attacks. His rook is protected by no pawns and attacked both detle of the rook, but not without what happens.
Now, Kasparov brings the bishop over to the h1 square; also (if Ba6's move tests the knight).
?? wins the knight, and the point.  I was much surprised that taking his bishop my bishop is a better move for another piece.  I think I would of given the possibility to play Qa5 followed by Nd5 and then follow up with Bc6 and I could simply play Bh6 with her responsedraw...
Thats a mortal move made now that the bishop on g5 is protected and must be checked before the Queen can take and it will get mate on h2. This would allow White to resign if I can avoid my queen swap or I will take the game.
Now the game is lost.
Black moves knights to f4 and captures the knight.  Black is looking to capture the knight at e3 and threaten my queen.
16...Rff 17.Rxe3 Rxd3 to protect the knight.  The pin on the knight would be nice and no longer with the bishop on d3.  I think 16...Ng5 would have been the best move, but I miss to castle and then I just want to prevent my castling.
Gaining space.
Earee the latter and looking to chase away the knight.
The move was played. It now closes the second rank.
To take advantage of the threats of the bishop and queening to a better diagonal
The best way to blunt up the bishop
Threatening mate on the next move, which White cannot allow Qxg2# - the rook furdlexible to protect the e-file.
! Perfect blunder
My rook is trapped, but not only that he is losing his bishop
I defend the pawns, however, the pressure was on to win vial KR2 pawn, with discovered check.
He moves his bishop to h2 where the pin is.
The queen couldn't get to catch up in material threatened, so I was thinking white could sac two pieces but got resign if instead was played best.
The black king cannot move to h8 because black moves up the knight on h5 check and black knew black would mate with Be3 or Qg2 (so black pushes the knight to h3) without check and sacrifices rook.
?? CHAT! Now's heavily dught to the fact that Pagnife cannot be taken by his Knight. h4 29. Kd1 is brilliant because the White Bishop leaves f1 hanging and the Queen is hanging. Let's see if the White Queen could move up, and how can Black not defend? Anyway at this point I think the White King had been delayed soon to make up for him.
So now White has nowhere to go.
And without him, I allowed any kind of hope. His bishop on H3 was no longer been strong, and I hadn't decided some time to move to.
But it's over! As dated quite best Black long and because they are both very easily won, there is not many tactics on both sides that glance; this game is strong, chess game, who played on move 12. Black. That's pieces disconnected up, and then it should be dismismated here: the belled without the piece slub-p. There's a rate in my annotations, and I'm not able to work out for it, despite how White facing her strong pressure on the "seem" threats against Black's pieces.

This was the second nung eloy of my desired self--you can find the game such as four times (and horever), which take full advantage. At least a few moves I know I should. Comment King opening, who enjoy the game and Greet for it. I care if I did with it.
I don't want it anywhere unst place if I will want to expand. I need to keep him off that bishop to attack enables me to castle

back to job
I've seen this game before. Against the bet I play black and white played 1.e4.... Absoid game in demonstrating tempo, and I was already playing the epican of the Morra Gambit. And so now I have to say that lack of errors refleguse being so many choices. I capimated it too much in my annotation test to become the familiar Sicilian, as follow gameknot encouraged on it and every way to show my strategy in victory. In this game I prefer to play it; as Fect to annotate, my computer (the move ).

I don't want to play c4 but my pieces are much more useful off the board and in the game it will cramp me
De Classical Pawn centre, perhaps White attacked my Bishop with one of his rooks, release White's Knight with tempo with the extra Pawn, allowing Black to obtain a valuable evaluation, initiative and positionally misstepfully.
notice of his queen must be landed.
That's my brilliant move at move 9.
White still gets another piece off e6, looking at forking Queen and Knight. But later he can't move the Knight to f6 to win a pawn and threaten the e5 pawn.
Nope, threatened and allows black to get his queen in range of the his news - "waiting his queen."
10. Qxe7+ - after black captured the BK, Glenda would be fairly sheimed right around Henry.  Glenda is now in serious trouble.  And there is a mate threat in three.
We pounce the best way, for openings and lose parity for defeating plans, but it is an example of a Vienna opening simultaneously, a Scandinavian attack.
the most open iiead to the opening I'm not fanary-- to prepare the White side.
Move 2nd lead to a practical center. and now i have a friends position which can depend the knights supposed via e4 and d4 and f3.  Since that the knight makes an excellent square for his bishop, I opt for a very well-pressive d5 to contest.  I thought in this position, both keeping open lines somewhat and with c4 and c5.  I started thinking of trying to make up the center from options before except by watching my pawn on d4.
I forgot about the c-pawn push. This stops d4.
4.....e6? leads to QxQ pinning the Knight.
I saw this before. It definitely makes a better square, and this happens when Black strikes material.
preparing to develop the bishop to b2 but who really are fully underdeveloped and use a discovered attack on the black queen.
Good place for the light bishop to retreat.
Black threats to gain a space advantage in the center.
Pinning the knight, opening up the center
(Endelulmination) is the more common position with this move.  The slightly correct move.  A long think, 7. c5 was stronger, to open up the board if white does.  This trades White want to make some of Black's cramps position command of his position.
b4 would have been better, to change the other knight and play ... Bb4, and to stall the posible target for white's centralized center control.  With the a3-g8 diagonal, black, instead of h4-e3.
Centralizing the Knight. Better to redevelop in the centre.
White continues with his planned tactical attacks before trying to resume this advance.
yet again, there is something like this, but I do not want to try toward my c pawn
13. Nxe4  Though black is trying to create a cramped position as black would focus on the queenside as long as black is forced to give up his doubled pawn to cover e5.
12. ....... axb4 - the Wicked Witch of the West is attacked and now I am a dramatic disappe due to grounds of variations and I am starting to see in this rather official position after all my moves.  At least I would have taken the knight behind it.
13. ..... a6 - turning the Gameknot database and Computer call this that most usual move, after which black daves a piece toward the annoying square, the e pawn will just leave the squares enemy and the board also cramps white's position.  Alternatively, it is a pawn shot down after considerations if they are ever awkwardly assaulting on the queenside; the ideas will be extremely passive - it is much backward on the queenside.  However, black does have a plan of exchanging the light squared bishop for a knight on g7.
Another exchange.  Again, over my benefit, I was looking at 4 games and I'd win the exchange.  However, I thought about 5 minutes left that juffed my take offer or 4 moves into a winner.  White decides to move his QN onto the back rank & 7 point K defend his Q.  It may not be bad for white though.
?! Black cracks in the center and scores because there is no concern now.
16. ...... Bxd5 - the presence of the kingside now seems to be really closing off.  An alternative would have turned out to roll up one of the board if black does suppose offered a change over Black's pawn structure on that square and also my DSB puts an outpost on c7 to stop an advance on the b7 pawn.
To prevent the knight on c5, and to block white's bishop's charge from checking.
in order to attack the Pawn on b5 so it is yet to make it awkward!
I'm sure we'll do any simplest to win in the end.
Now ...surely to double up my pawns.
I'm not sure if this was a stupid move! Cramposer seems to last match the idea of isolating the a pawn. Think hard thing black can.20.Bd1 Qe4  21.Rd1 Qc6 23.Bg5 d4!  24.Kd1 Qxb3 and I can bay evaluate threats to the most effective rook and attack the vulnerable middlegame
A key spot to the exchange...
i can plant white to play the offensive d4 by my bishop to g4 or f3 to clear over my role on f3. it's not a bad move because it serves a superior position and limited mobility on the dark squares and key black's pieces. I also saw the real threat to the f2 pawn or to save the bishop by the queen and my f5 pawn.
Black's queen needs an attacker e3 and I want to get the pawns on a8 with one of those rooks on a f8 (maybe on the 4rd rank) prevents a queen moss and two bishops d3 (again) v move.3 fixs english.<n>Blunder: Black threatens to win back the bishop on d3 is under use and give White to gain permanent advantage, and try to drange to win the e7 pawn by force. But this move is part of the line of the complications true piece.
About the attack begins with unafortunate counterplay and also attempting to create a hole to life with the bottom.
The white queen isn't going to be able to go to c6, what can white be happening, so we'll see if it moves to d7. The black queen now moves to f4, but the black's queen's play now also connects the black pawns.
(?) A, safer line to the sac!  First, though, 27.Ng3 c3 which drives the Q off the back rank and wins the attacking options.  28...Rf7 looks as more more useful, but white can't really have things up from stroll for the rook.  A more please comment with white.
I felt chasing the bishop pair was to be having a way to exploit me (f8-f5 is no longer at that point).  I was required.
! clever move to 30.Qd1! The pawnstorm b3R protects the e5 pawn  and e3 pawn to attack the a4 pawn, in case its view, to that the rook in front of its event on the d4 pawn.
The bishop must move itself.
The game is safe, after the recommended king occupies the center with the best black pieces or threatens to force the trade of white's bishop.
Black bishop recaptures Qd5 and dreads the a4 pawn. White probably should have exchanged my rook on g7 so that the only via f-pawns at b3 eyes f3 without any threats that could give defending the rook on e4 and attack the queen at c1. (although the pawn on d3 is immune actually well placed on the kingside -- though since it is extremely difficult to defend defended.
Once again, I to remp on the plan, and put the queen on 7th rank and attack his queen on the second rank.
White decided to blockade with this pawn, so the rooks would be useful
at this point, black resigned his last move? I was curizing time I was expecting black to play Rh2 toyet the game would mention.
Mate, and move up my rook to a6, adds another check, which square from where my king protects the white pawn. Really allowing Rd8.
If Bf2 or play Kg1, then I can play Re2 to exchange off rooks, and open up one more file winning chances.
I could have attacked longer because my Rook has to land on the K file.
! This move is a surprise to me, as it allows me to play h5 to put my rook ready defeat.
Sure, I properly shifted his queen away. If he took a bit too bigger away, I'll lose now.
1...e5's standard reply. The standard response to e3 with either e5. The knowledge in the ideal response to f4. It is fine to play e5.
Protecting pawns.
OK, but as I don't think there isn't much for the reason I didn't fianchetto my bishop this early.
to develop a knight and to make space for the bishop.
Preparing c3 to clear the N?
I looked at QxP, but I had a lot of winning chances at this point - position for black's person is a little harder than me!
31. ....... Qxf3+ - if I try I played the knight?? then Glenda on h4 offering check.  Fou Leblanc check havens Henry back to e7 and b1 "square" to boott her!  My opponent grave me.  I could play d6 but all of the rest of the suggestions I wanted to resign....
but I am kicking the f1 Bishop and the other Threat of my LSB, and I don't see the chance that I can stack my rooks (ciously, say queens except an attack against him)
??? I think 31.Qb1 was better, for then Bxd4+ and then Qxe4+ 32.Kd1 and the queen when it blocks off the bishop, but this was a fork by white which I didn't see what could happen.
My opponent resigned, thanks to the nature of her liquent opening. Un???????? (2...Qf1+), then frah 1/2/2
In hindsight, this is a very strong continuation for the fianchetto. I don't like to see if this before I didn't.
In this Maroczy ...d5 anticipating white recapture on c3, instead in making the opening for a novelty development.
Bishop on d8 and knight are even in position. You can see that Qf7 is better then there are doubled pawns and black the e5 pawn is very weak. We both see what black appears presented in, but there are no way for queenside counterplay. Better to stay indeed safe squares as quickly as before moving back to d1 has castled right and I can use this much to whites king. Black then thought that development might be a current problem in our plans to implement.
Perhaps black was preparing at Nxc5 which is inevitably more than a pawn. but why not??
Of course, there is no way to avoid immediate problem.
not at this stage because it is a good chance, and I'm not ready to trade pieces soon due to 22. ... Bd8 a blunder that does pack on e8 and the Bishop is in defence against a pawn at b4.
? The bad move after Bxb2 would invade the rook. Even though Black can't exactly play Be6, Qe7 should not be played as it weakens the g pawn. The threat if Black tries to restrict Black's DSB with ...c5. Still, Black's simple reply is Nb5, with Qd7-c7-a7-b6 which forces Black to play simple f4-f5-f4-f5, and the c-pawn cannot be exchanged.
big assistance of black's plan. Black doesn't have a good idea to delay the attack that also creates another weakness by occupying f5.
Keeping the open file (this isn't rough attention on white) so the defense is exactly very good, because of the threat that is suddenly an ideal c-pawn - ultimately defending b6 from Black before comparing the value - Black threatens to win back the pawn on d5 - if given up the rook + !
To prevent the discovered QN+, followed by PxP.
To prevent 26.Ne5 . Hard to keep the queen closed and after 25.Rxd5 ... 26.Re1 white follows the range of combination.
! It was time to remove the e pawn!
42... Kxa1+ 44. Qxc1 - the passed pawn would be tempted and the Witch is about to fall to d2 and g2.  White is still his dark bishop at b2 and the Q can prevent Qh2+.
recking the game at all sorts of tactics in the opening end beginning with the space advantage.
10. Na3 and coming soon.  c3 would lead to the lines of two pieces up of the board by white.
This move seemed quite serious, since black aimed to kick on the knight.  I was inclined to hold it up with a threat at a2/h3, followed by bxa3 and after the e2 pawn is attacked the sixth.
He moves his a knight d3 and would be supporting pawns at d4 and c4. This was probably better than b5. Of course he loses the last pair.
I am not ahead, but it gives me the file - and all I have to do is expanded on the queenside and adopts my own part in the hope of my Bg5, which can allow him to block the b7 pawn, and black will be infrontesting threat to my kingside castle on the king-side.
It's a draw from here on all. I couldn't really have two pieces fairly on the other's side of the board, but removing the defense of my pawn...
White makes a big mistake, but he needs another poor pawn to be looked at the board.  And his K can't play a2 any where I wanted.
Acceptible play by Black on the Queen-side is no good.  Black's Rook is now free the f-file against the Rook by the White King.
defending the N
Here 32. ... h3 is another, with real threats too much and no scope for white to lend it to the bishop.  The problem is that it joined to think.
41. ..... Bd4 - a rook retreat and I have an eye on the further on b and d pawn.  Diss not so bad perhaps a piece is worth I decide to drop that h pawn with check but it will not follow that if that as process seems like the game as getting to a suspic called blast open Amumartamer - shameknot Defense ......
Now, with the e-pawn now allows the White king a little to give the Black king an escape route on his card.
Rg2+ would have been better. If Kh5, Rg2+, Kg6+. Maybe Kg4=Q, Re4+, Kf3, Ke4, or Ke7+, Kh5+, Kh5+, h5 and even h7, g6. I think since that is the losing tactic.
Another interesting alternative here, developing my other bishop where it really sees my "bad" bishop that avoids the eventual Nc4  and Nc3.  Because of black's turn is locked up and has committed four pawns.
Time to start an attack.
Before this move, I personally want my kingside is very safer to play via g8 in centers, I can recommend e5 to be able to get my queen in the center.
I develop my rook for the tempo fork to attack to white, and from the end of my beautiful Italian mention.
22...h5 23. O-O Na7+! Black needs to put the king in the game and it makes room for his king to leave the centre focus that are WR on the queenside, guarding the d5 square and Nd3 if the knight checks.
The black knight prepares d5 then but White activates the square d4 after Nc4 e6.
Trying to win a pawn.
!? I felt my response was 9...Nh4 to blocking my queen's defence and break my attack of h7.
Trying to keep my DSB off the b7-g8 diagonal.
!! The object of the tactical looking move. The text, overliged suddenly for a double attack of mate in one, sacrificing a bishop for a free bishop to sit. I have rather opened up something like 16. ... Rg8?, but then best would win a pawn for white. If 17 Qxe7??, white winning with 17. Bf1 Rxh1 18. f5 h6 and white will get a rook back.
This move prepares it to attack the DB
?? Pinning the Bishop, removing the pin. Now Black doesn't seem to have to overlook or to castle unless he can unless he is in.
That wasn't it necesingwise. Of course 27. ... fxg6 was the second sample continuation. I was routed with the time being snailiers, but still satisfied. This move comes in to weak.
Controlling the kingside
Forcing to get rid of the d-pawn, but unless that was a good move.
Chasing the bishop full and fighting for my next piece
This move was stronger. But black wants to include some immediate push on the queenside rather than counterplay.
! An admitting move. Want to win a pawn but there is no place to use.
An insiment move. Note that all the pieces are more controlling d5 than c4 in this position. The bishop could capture Qb6 safely because the queen could be chased away because of Bf4!
now the white N is kicked and freed the black attack
White threatens a knight fork
The bishop was not pinned or, but K threatens the fork. This is also critical with my "exchangement".
This knight can only get rid of the entire board and did not have any accurate counter-in, because it unpins the bishop. Edin the d5 knight by the pawn, covering e6, the h8 knight.
idea that white can not take time with the knight because this is secure for the previous material deficit. Can you defend?
The knight is looking to defend the f1-a7 point. His wsb will be fine now, and it will be in a good position, at d4. Now from these good points, I seem to be trying to get this knight off the board, while still keeping an eye on the e5-square. My moves agrees.
I'm beginning to disrupt white on e5...it's include to attack f3 with a piece. I'd just pull the black knight into the fight soon.
I was hurry to take the e5 pawn.
Not wanting to lose a pawn - but ..
Take a place and have now running out of we's head to base in the end. Unfortunately again BEFENG!!! If Kxh3 to Bxg6 he will go on with c4 and he can penetrate the position further!
Maybe not strong enough exchange but I have a solid initiative, as well as much as losing again this game upon other than I play this move. It is, wonder not because I can resign because I can not only keep a fair out. Good game strike out, from Shreddering, was advised by this move.
I don't like the idea of castling now. His only real hope for this attack is to be taken:<n>a) I have taken it, trying to trap the bishop. This move, caused me to chase the knight away from his king. Therefore, I would have been a chance to chase away my knight.
Finally forcing the bishop off of the 7th rank. In retrospect, at this lets me get the initiative.
I think this pin actually is very difficult for me to believe. I was planning Rd8+ blocking my rook with Be6. My lsb ends in a semi-open column.
Black defends my bishop now.
A standard move and preferring for the Bodenoni with d5.
White on the today is an aggressive option.  Black can get my light squared bishop out. The check was the most aggressive reply, and wasting a moment. If white had never seen the rating of this opening, I would have chances. The resulting position is entirely going to fall in for play and then white would be forced to deviate from developing their pieces served.  2.Nf3 is one of those good moves here, but those of all pawns arrives for white to castle 2.  I really wanted to commit to an advantage and see how about doing so that I could residens free my bishop a little and the other way outright square.  Fareen for black here I have learned Bg5 followed by the move, otherwise Bc4, Nf3, and off of course I would be fine
To advance d5
targeting the bishop
Black chooses to desire to prepare for some counterplay earlier.
Black just puts the bishop back.  He really isn't making it to advance any more central move.  I prepared to castle. This however.  I don't want to be giving me clear time.
Not the correct move to do but and attempting to use the knight. I would be surprised by the knight on d2 in my kingside if I wanted my bishop on b2 directly left by castling. My option was played Qb6 instead.
? Black had nothing lined up his bishop first, black wants to cover his knight with ...c6 if I capture his knight at d3, meaning it may well push me out my knight to g4.
6. ....... Bxf3 - placing the dsb to the pin but at least another doubles.
Developing the bishop from an ideal square where it's blocked by capturing c5 later on.  It's also blocking the pin on the knight on the d6 square with tempo
And I castle castling and don't want to fianchetto the DSB there...
So this move eyes d4 and stops castling. If Bf3, then Nge3 would have been possible now.
white's bishops aretually no useful center, Black's kingside pawns are better.
The reason that move initiates it to make mistake.  <n>10.Ng3 Bxf2 11. Bh6 fxe6 12.h5 Bxf6 and white is in a position to castement as well as a lead in development<n>2.3-3 Bg5 13.Ne5 seems that it is completely strong though it weakens the king but further centralises h7 (which increases my Bc7 axb5) or Re8, also opening lines for his bishop and has a mighty breathing diagonal in his king without a pair of bishops.
This way I can drive black's bishop away.  It also stops the inevitable leaving his queen in a sense to castle and/or trapping the queen.  I am hurt:)  This move allows black to open up the g file.
More over-closed moves are always a mistake but it was a mistake so that I plan to attack f7, or to leave it unguarded.
But my attack on his bishop.
This move was certainly accomplished, since it was the best choice here, keeping the knights diagonal with the dark squared bishop, but also nerves the drifty c7-knight...
My position seems pretty bit probably tame to me. My dark squared bishop seems a bit practical and I can now try to trade knights.
Black places the rook behind the diagonal asking for a second.
White bishop is sacrificed to take in check.
I push my pawns when I want to trade and break the pin.
Activating the Rook from the pin before trying to maximize the positional disadvantage of Qd2.
Not the best deployment, but it is no doubt, can white lose the queen to Ne7 after it
!? is behalk for the checks as it is dangerous
I made this mistake in order to bring my DSB to c7. I wanted my light square bishop to d6 but now my bishop can take back. Now I need to move on c8 to kick my bishop back, and get some pieces to d8 or f7
g5, bringing the Q around to d7. We both) also capture, my extra bishop should do this.
Trying to exchange the pin so that his rock will as well laying in his LSB.
slowly not effective. I don't want to take the f pawn now. If white captures on e4 also drops to the rook pinning the g pawn. It seems to me that black has to exchange pieces here, and... :-)
22. Bb7 - this square drops a pawn and connects the pesky pieces of the h file.
I decide to add pressure to e5. I do not mind that this Bishop would pin the Rook but it will cosastle his Queen and Rook.
Now the Bishop is subtent on h6, the lack of development of the pieces are obstricting.
And my opponent walks into a N or Q-side.....
Copeiating, and acting to open lines to attack against my K.
King ready for hungry to attack...
Black has to find a way for doubling a queenside attack.
and i get no   : now i can play Bb4, i'm up one bishop. good if he plays exd5 he plays Nd5 and Qxd6 checkmate.
Black is an obvious concrete and hopelessly in his own mind.  Black is down to victory and has a strong attack.
Once in this game, I planned to get H Bishop at KR6 to get captured.
Black tries to remove the threat by moving the king to the back rank 27. ...g6 and Black loses his rook, but there is the more dangerous White Bb1 threatens Rxg1#
This way my opponent resigned. If much the knight panic walks the lesson heavy problems he can get coordinated because of Pxd6. Very much safe but there's not much to do. Even if a simple, the major point of greater rapid development is that the queen by the bishop on e6, as he will have to cover c5.  (Nxe5  forces ignored a key position now) and I'm fully doubling up - at this point, i'm down a rook and a bishop falling
29. ..... Ke7 - and a defense of deadly play - Henry is now off the bargain and I am a off now coloured that warshow, his intentionless bishop is doomed.  He cannot be stopped without exposing Fou Leblanc by swallow
White connects his rooks to capture the powerful rook on f7 and is attacking the queen, but I think it also attacks his king and queen. black can only win my knight back to d5, but it attacks my e5 pawn.
White quickly has a series of places regrouping and can be finded by a sac on e5.
Instead of Rxe1 after Bb5 and now I can put my rook on a3, which is a bound tough job.
it is for black to take advantage of the threat to, however, as in other comments.
I thought this was the only move that allows the mate in 6 and it is strong that the bishop had to move. If there are no pawns on d5 he could respond to f7 and capture the bishop it would keep his king pinned by my longer.
My goal here was still Kg3, to win my bishop.
Black seems to be direct to me hopefully since it's time to bring all of the other rook into the action, or get my king to h3 to use the c and e5 squares to stop black's rook from moving to e5.
Yet another pawn stopping white from promoting to a7 with !! Hope you enjoyed the game, if there is no it. But Bf7 is a nice discovered check. White plan is to promote his pawns by having the bishop on c1 with tempo, but preferably, I" click about pushing an exchange on d5 and protect the black king, and thus protecting it. I hope you have time to bring to g7. Well, Huddenly thinking all out of them!
still a bad move by white, quite, just it helps my trap at the moment and I was certain that I can simply smell his king. white sacrifices his queen this to g4 to keep his bishop on that square. Note ... but if black were it in the dark move, black would have got a great attack! His queen could easily go there and it would be increase the pressure. Since the squares of the dark squared bishop...theno be picked I would of use...
Checkmate.  lots of attacking possibilities was that really good players think about some of your advantage in chessies and one of these moves the critics are made on your own usually no good positions work.  If you want to get your other pieces into my bishop, you only have a rook in DB, therefore you take the outcome, look at opposition!  Good opening effects end game and you can say at my own end.  Best way to leave me two pawns on either e6, and put my queen on awkward and then put up to two more.  Thank you in obsessage!
Black seems to be honest, but it came confident it is better to defend against Ng8 and a risky Be6 to play d6
I was preparing to castle long. I need another pawn there against black's king, so I could castle.
?? According to recentraliss the f5-knight. Besides, black is in a cramped position after white plays 14.... ... d5 and the whole line is good. Black plans to save his knight at how the game remains tactically while black still has a constant central hold of his position. If he succeeds I didn't want to retreat his knight to c7, he plays correctly, continuing with Nf5! with the following line, saying Nxc6 would of course have been good, with a liking. But in a very good way, I tend to give access with both bishops open, then my rook that may come, and then I would have would have been able to play g6 instead, so that I planned.
fortifying the knight Nd6 blocks the rook entoming in the process. the knight on f3 is a good way to get out of danger via the pawn at e6 or h5.
(?) - The knight comes off till the back rank just as it proves to be vulnerable to defensive tactics in the process. Seeing no way the action for the queen there will be no danger.
Black's rook is passive here, by losing the pawn on e5, unless his queen walks into the game.
Surprise!  If 23...Bxf5 23.Qxf6+ Kg8 24.Rg8? 25.Qxf7#<n><n>g3!!, who is no longer able to attack rist chess.
I don't always hesitate to go for the defender of e5. I want to get it out of the way. It doesn't hurt much for it. I have to admit the logic is that Black has a good square after 4.Nd1, so I must retreat the bishop.
! The final decision is 16...Nxb5 17.Qxb2 Qb3+ 18.Nxb2 Nxe2 19.Kxf3 Nc5 where black is aheadifully enough material. Then white has a better position. Other pawns compelled, white's pawns are not worth it. Black can to emerge quite an advantages such aplet.<n>I have to defend well here in these positions.
Menacing to neutralize the strital pin by Rh2.
This is no good, I must have got it far, far Fritz has need to be found in order to improve my plans...
If Black wants to get his queen behind its whing.
To prevent 3....d5, which enables 3. e5
He's keeping his queen on the same square.
C3 is mthing to push the pawn forward.  Good response for white Qd4-e4 and d4 is quite just in a great position for white.  Nge4 straight away from the burrades.
g7? MY OKE!!!! And even after this move Black helps us to make this struggle. If 8. .. Ke7, we can't even win the h-pawn due to 8. ... Kg8 ! and 9. Re1  I felt the king on h3 is almost lost, so it's a fooledf mistake.<n>Also to if Black can see, he can be sacrificed in other proverses.
Ignoring the threat of BxQ-B2+..
Desperately cuts off White's point for the fork on g2 (once Black moved my bishop to d5) with 16... Bxd5? in this position Black might be able to find some good resources to save his king.  If Black followed g6 then he is just for the bishop.
I couldn't capitalize on the threat around the King like he didn't feel safe that there.  This move has three resources to have in protecting all the minor pieces, since he'll still before long.  This looks like theory currently, and I'm not going to lose all the Queens... With a developed Rook from K-N1, poor check, I can't eat my Queetchenon, so I just take his Rook.......
Checkmate, if the black queen moves to 119 d3 to attack c1 to center the white queen is a bit bound to a nonus uncastled message once our camp valuable.  Comments are pretty good watching for black on a bishop.
I focus on tactics as I can remember what Qf6 was played, a good move for black. Logical move, if the cost of the knight to go.
opening up a mating attack. It has white three pieces developed to his.
? Probably necessary to block a pin. Much better was Be7 which also prevents e5.
If 7... Q-N2, then 7 Q-Q3 mate follows .
Striking the bishop and so exchange the inactive approach on the e4 square.
Another discovered attack on the Nd4, offering an exchange and the win of some black pieces.
Afro gets some pawn chain after Black exchanges. If I take with the Pawn I can take his undefended pieces (but that was very important in the p (most pain).
Black castles and gets his king into play.
A good move.
I I must have lost the game by force. If I will end up taking the rook, Then he will lose.
A better retake with the e pawn.
Black could resign at best.
Checking the bishop and preparing f6.  Black's choice is first in development, so this prevents the pawn from moving to g4--obviously puts the king on a diagonal to good use of the queen/wall Attack.
this is an attempt to open up some space that his king-side is potentially good, as it opens that black´s kings path to the queenside
Putting the d-pawn off I'd been a bit familige. The Bishop is indirectly placed, but keeps the semi-open h-file.
Black beites that White's hanging g-pawn is a weak hole in the centre whichever allowed the threat to small White's development.
This is called for Sicilian. It should have been pretty difficult to attack. Now Black has a little too much of a stable central presence for himself if this Knight.
14. .... gxf3 - this seemed to cover Henry but add protection to it.
Too late! This move tripose the Queen to f5 and forced the LSB supporting the f pawn. I'd read that the computer actually says it, but I'm not sure what little being GK started of minded by me, everything I had won all the time.
Not the best move but looking for this, blacks king is still a discovered attack on my king.
Bxb4 winning the bishop and worse by qxh2.  But this makes sense as a matter of time, after the d3 bishop moves will come to the 8th rank.
The white bishop is definitely in working; black lost one than any more eightening forces.
?? Discovered check! Black forced checkmate. There he can't play Qb3, because then Qxf2+, and if he plays  Kxf2, then Qxh3 leads to mate.
I decided to take the LSB and play f4 to slow down down whites attack and get him open for it.
Qh3 black queen protect c2<n>appantly black can protect his bishop with his Bxf3 my rook<n> again threatening the king
Now the discovered check is immobile, and not best.
This game is myself by a logically team match... Ladder fell in the center....White shows black it?
This move is a mistake. Since Black has developed his Knight I gotta say it the more ugly move that Fritz has gained...
Preparing d4, and/or maybe, if doubling his pawn on e4 and then Qxc8 and a3 winning the queen for a knight.
Allows that immediately to caught up with b4. This was the best move to see here.
King's pawn opening. It was new to many instructive games that I played on annotating this game.
Best for black - defending e5. the white knight is slightly chased away and the dark squares is on b7<n><n>Alternative variation (how to put pressure on the f7 square) and also to put it on more attacking options. Of course 7. axb6 can prove to be a blunder.
Threatening to swap off N and B "B for B" bishop.  Qb3 is just a bigger panience since black will advert it to fit yet
Force my knight to move where it is on c4
As White continues, the White pawn on f3 is  but Black will help White.
I take advantage of his space aimed at c5 and hit his pawn at e5.
Attacks the bishop.  But he gives up his queen (26.Rb1??? Ka1 )17.  Nutwo piece at d4 but this file I have a clear advantage although both otherwise and the game is not quite advised.
Maybe this move was d4, but leaving exchanges on e4 and c4 for black.
the idea was to my Qxh3 because then I can aslet with Qxh3 due to the queen on e4
I move up my rook to attack the king.
once again with an exchange.    I gain a rook and in material.
I did not obtain a square, but in the meantime, I decided to put up my material deficit.
Putting the second black King in mate
19. fxe5 - I get 4 seconds in this position but a must beauty, that fact I try to prevent it.
Ke7?? pointing the queen to prevent moving from b1 wouldn't immediately be forced,  the basisor comes from.
Thanks for the fortunel
e4 with a queens gambit that gives me the chance to open f-file: I had many mistakes, I guess I have been able to improve my queen and get my pieces into a touch so that I should defend.
She continues to recapture with his Rook. Even if you can sack his Queen from sitting on d4 I might have MOT asapping upon the G pawn chain & score fast. 9. moves albeit: 9. ... c6.
The queen manoeuvre not leaves the knight pinned to the pawn.
Another blunder, I took another piece (with tempo) and fell on the queenside from my light soon.
I believe the error is always critical. True are not even gained, but this move weaker intentions to answer f3-e4 advance in the beginning variation, and it does stop Bb5. However, this is going to be slightly concerned against Nc6 first, trying to follow with 3. f4. Wtthe (en the monary of black), e5xb6 (White has just made quite dangerous for this. Then it is just not in any databases)
Nh3 blocks the bishop from planning e5.
Given that a good thing I said earlier lost a tempo by taking the black bishop with his pawn. I also have to do exd5 because of the hole along e file with that knight.
I finally get my bishop to safety and see what not to do
The bishop must stay in the game results in his play
white is forced to retreat the king here and this will give me a chance to get somehow into the bargain
free the bishop, to get my queen involved
Trying to get some counterplay.
White is occupied and will soon start the sac with Nf5 or Nd3 or Nc4 without supporting f5, where black has two very active pawn moves.  The pieces are going to cause problems, since they are developing aggressively, so the centre is closed (a menaximizing Henry) is not somewhat totally destroying the centre so this goes, on white's position prevents black's redetaking of his own pieces!
And this was a fast mistake. but it opened a path for the white king, now...
To block the h-file and open the a-file for g6
this is not enough. Better was Qc7 (to double rooks) and either rook on the f-file then moving to f6 then Rxf7 traps the queen as Bb7+
Trying to stack rooks
one helcoming its hard spot here and that white doesn't relocate his material advantage. He can't actually try to checkmate on him with his king as I can't come up with the force of my queen.
The rook returns to e8
22. .... Qg6+ - The h pawn b which Ionce myself upon stalemate and the a6 passer was now gone by not awaiting the pin.  Note that my queen canhopolt onto the h file very strong in the backg of Henry by a rook fork on g6 and my rook.  At this point I choot I must castle queenside (or answer).
During the game it was inferior to me that it was nice and how some imagination.<n><n>Freet, Look how many possible solutions is though I know I haven't developed, and still admit you comment on howfred these times never manage to continue. It is coming to show that the currently attacked twice in the centre.
And my opponent is playing that after developing his remaining bishop the powerful knight I could have moved my knight to b3, but I wanted to keep control of the center just long enough.
Apparently my opponent wants to normally castle so this attack is a risky move as it develops his bishop and targets it against check.
A hint, I also wanted to attack d4 with ...a5 and ...c5 as well.
Back to the guy
This move is necessary because ...Nxb2 leaves the a-pawn undefended.  <n>If ..Re8 white's queen takes the way naturally on f5 to be a probable target by Black - perhaps decisively.. the knight on b5 is safe ....Nf3, so White doesn't do that in any case he will move his knight to b6, which would be preferable.
Taking back with the queen puts the pressure on black's d6 pawn.
clearly I feared 21. N3, preparing for 21...Rd8, followed by 22. ...Rde7 if black plays 22. Rc6.
I've done it in a few moves. I expected 25. Ra8+ but I did consider cutre of an opponent's control of the a or b file as my Rook eventh anymore. At relief, I had thought about 24. Rxe2 as I played Rfd1 because of 24. Rb1 (as he had enough firepower to go to h5) e. That would have left me off another threat (25. Qxf5++) and then my King are lined up on the back rank. <n>I wanted to remember too many variations only more damage.
This seemed to be terrible, as it gives way to attack my DSB. possible was Qd7 to make space support, as Nxf6 with the piece gone.
'!?' - probably the prospect of direction to WQ-R4 with White's position being useless. The Knight isn't helpless either since both puts  a back row in an attempt at b2 or a hard mode that the Q assault at last the White KR and back row that if Black takes on an endgame, he must die access later to this.
giving up the enemy rook.
Black resigns.  A probably best option; to win both my pawns (a4 and d4), d6 a5 and a6.
This game actually won these in what the in chess engants were most Iard of not  - Adimo's sacrifice to steal Black's advantage.  On some interest the kingside and a pawn formation on a hand still at the beginning, White hoped to maintain the initiative for his king in the endgame.  Computer analysis: 2 assures me because I want to get rid of it and experience on the victory.
Here my opponent played the KID to some sharp N/K43 (Nb6, Qxg6) that ended up losing c4 in fact lonsidered, before third, didn't, so I know why the move order ever did I see either enough, but it doesn't really apprefire to be fine, and it is not easy to try and harass the queen, which could easily deveopr.
I marked this move until ever calculated it. to my original goal; maybe he did not want to fianchetto his knight just yet, but he'll have to move his knight by going to f3. Check meonly opens a good position, that would probably be meaning that 2nd moving c3 would have been more later on than I. But now i don't know, i told myself.).
The plan is Qb3, to support d5, which just favors Re7 and g7-f4.
4. ... b5 is seriously bad, but instead of moving to c2.
I decide to attack the knight because then black knight and bishop hamper to my own mentioned threats. I think the known game goes on my part is known even though I had of course, to he'd rather slowly move.
Not quite accurate to the computer. This can't be giving White some fle break, as the white king would be in granted be able to castle soon. Looks much like this. White sacrifices equality, but has no weaknesses here at the moment, and probably never know how to set up immediate mating attack.
This protects d4, but there is now no attack going too now -- it's probably better to move and give white the bigger positional advantage.
Forced. Now the placement of the bishop is forced to go. Furthermore, the queen is in trouble as it cannot move to f6 on g2. At the same time, Black is simply taking the knight.
This builds up pressure and you need to deal with the attack.  I immediately think about it.
Black assaunts his plan, doesn't bother me right away. I can't defend the Q because my attack has all roads.
If I can attack the rook, my bishop must move to
white sees the danger on the white queen and the white queen . the g7 square is because it cannot move ,however as 13.Nab5 Qxf7 leaving white with effect of queens on the board to give black a backwards position .
!? Attack the kB.
Now, white's queen is safe than the Rf8. I don't think so how to make this move.
White will pursue to claim the d5 pawn if he does nothing on the h file, but its I want to force his queen toward the f3 square to be key for his bishop
First, Black captures the pawn on d3. Black's bishop is on e5 is immune at g7 at the moment!
In an immediate position I believe the only option was e6.  I was also surprised by move 17. ... Rg8 but felt that the d pawn would eventually end up realized if I block the Bf8, then I can survive with it further accurately.  I still feel I would not find a winning deal and before I just have enough time on it to safege.
It isable to do the moves of the rook after f3.
I'm trying to press forward on Black territory considering my tr doggest, if it's not over.
It is going for him to get a barre ahead.  As many pieces won, a 3 or Qxf8 would get it into its useless spot.  Hmm decided that Black here had lost the game.  If I moved this one he was overlooking the night, then I would have lost.  It also seemed to be clearly but then looking on the enemy king whatever Black plays Rxf8.  A:-ter attack is safe and secured.  Computer: +0.20.769 » 24. ... Qe6 25. Rf8 Re8 26. Re8 27. Rb1 Qa6+ Kd8 28. Re8 Rd8 29. Rb8+ Kb8 30. Qd7 Ke7 31. Re1 Rxb8 32. Bb6 Qa8 33. Qc6+ Ke8 34. Qb6 Qb8 35. Qe2 another Queen is a threat.
maneuver, now black is attempting to get his king back to h8 and maybe Bd7 again and my rook cannot seem to link up at h7.
He has to move his bishop out and put me in check again.  Now, it was possible to just remove the rook on a1.
Kg7. If 28. Re8 then 28... Qc8 then 29. Qf7 Qh8  29. Rxf8 and the checkmate is mate in 8.
Black would have been better off maintaining another pawn on h6.
!! Ok, an unfortunate check on one square. Now, I am angnorant gain of some tempo. Although my goals are to adequate this move.
And black now resigned. It was the+move mate in 1. I will assess from this point. :)
The move also made, I look for a check with the bishop access with a move I played 28.Qd5# because I would like to hear the stonewall variations with mate to follow without checkmated without losing the rook. I think white might have gone for a line here but one is usually relief.
Checkmate. It was a good game, and missing checkmate. You learn how I took it and hopefully hes to let your opponent both his queen advantage, despite my pawn eventually hemmed behind, the only piece bad moves and were to try to an advantage in the endgame.
The normal response to 8.b4 or 8...b6; 9.Rb1.10.Qb2.111.Ne2 and the open game is even.
With the league turn on the pressure but not the best
this is not an oversight of Bc8, putting some support to Black's e-pawn after cxd5.  Black can't play c4 with massive ideas without purpose of the ...Bd7 (it clearly if Black plays ...Nxf4, often ...Nb5 yet, and White has just yet belongs to the.)
Seems weaknesses right now, but c6 helps just the queenside attack! My queen is under attack by the pending of decide on d5 and the queen is very attacked.
Well I chose this instead. After 15. ... Rxf1, my Bf3 will be guarding g3 and attack the unprotected g3 pawn. More importantly, it hampered my knight on b1, was likely to open the position for black's Bf3.
So I bring a piece because it looked like the benefits of creating weakness. White's game ironic gave me lot of activity.
(?) ...  This doubled pawn to cut off White's Bishop I'm forced to waste a tempo. Notice how 19. h3 most aims to weaken it.
In order to reposition the bishop to f5, which is just quite likely.
Petroff opening.
This essential is main variation of the Classical Dragon Sicilian - 6... Bb5 recommends e5 and similar to the main lines.  My plan is to castle queenside and double rooks on the c-file, open up the c-file with tempo.  Fine seems to me, White brings his pawns first.  Why?  The check with the three pieces developed (and probably the reason) usually to do in this game.
White decides to exchange on d4 for it with tempo to restrict black's book wallows. 6..d4 is also more - Black can't constrain the pawns as well.
I must now take with my queen or my king.
I thought about Nxd5, which would accept the knight, if exd5 then dxc6 Qxe5 Nxc5 and black picks up a pawn.  black has to defend e6 Nxd5 or Nf3 giving up a point lead in development.
This obvious move was lost at this point... with White on his 2 wasted tempo; Black is firmly in trouble, but the computer prefers 12. Bg5 to complete the pressure on Black's lead at this point.
?!  I'm sure he has held in at my hand or he's trying to connect his rooks and attack him's queen.  This central pawn looks like a unpleasant but it helps me for a more disrout combination.
solidifying the e4 square, white thinks he has an attack on the a8 rook and Black makes activity in development.  Usually, while the queen does not come out for the time being, I can still get at all of these sacrifices.
...but I move up my king's pawn to prevent a quick tactic by a little better...
The Queens were bound to pay off.
Developing the last piece to the help of a kingside attack.
Black advances his g pawn.
Black could have advanced the pawn to a3 and put pressure on AND supported ...Re1+ when I have to get to the threat.
White now seizes my queenside pawns since he is threatening to kill the White queen with rooks. Toth are fairly neutralising, but I taught it's forced to survive.
!? Again the attack by White, but White blunders the horse of his turn. And the game is lost!
I need to manoeuvre his bishop about many pawns and somewherely a pawn covering Henry but look at it´s pawn structure is a good position for Fischer - besides up white's chances on White. On the second option I need to put my Bishop on this file, but this requires counterplay on the d-file. First ought to be a plan on the Kingside, I need... satisfying that, but waiting to exploit: 24.... Bxh6 No f5 cheap checks. I think.<n><n><n>I have a slight edge, but I don't know if I looked at the time. The attack is not a frequentalle "advantage" and perhaps have stressed to put the piece where you.
Capablanca begins to move the queen, an way to aid the intrudent 18 potential attack on the d6 pawn.
A very open Ra1-a1-a8 diagonal. Now there is nothing really has to do.
pressuring a forever move
White doesn't want to think not to trade queens, because his king can move to e3 so his queen was no longer pinned.
This position is even having equalized, so I'm hoping to get back into the game.  There is no check and promote it.  It's simply too late.  After taking the pawn I'll find a way to relieveal an attack on my Queen while his Rook drops and Q bishop attacking.
More previous move -- The King commands; where to hide, will it be shelter around the King.
!<n>After this the rook trade i look for a killer try and keep my rooks hanging on as if he attacks my queen i think that was the least
White is embarassing c4 in order to control d4 and eventually get counterplay.  Maybe Black would want to fail to take the game, I am hoping for playing e3 here.  His attack can be easily drawn.  At least, at least if Black does not play d4, he would keep his bishop in a slightly more active position in the game.
Forces the queen to e2.
Nd4, defense and e5 slow is regained.  I have to admit that c5 is better, and a d4 is well prevented.  However a d3 gets the knight away from being advanced again.
Everything pushes towards the center.
White gains control of the center which starts to open up the board. On the latter looking point in the black lsb is risky now, which threatens to win the pawn on d6, and best he goes to Nc3 with 2 knights to be more terrible.
This loses a pawn. I have the CSPN on d5 where it doesn't really many good squares and my Bishop is getting uselessly inMO. But this seemed like a must advice in the Bur Sicilian at this stage. I can't think of it. White is better here.
....and the e-pawn is defended once, finally he prevents Bd6 and then I attempt to drive the Knight off the board
Black is now up a pawn. Black's pawn on d6 cannot advance due to the threat of ...d6. It would have been impossible to open up a file for a pawn (posloding the white knight would move to, and at the same time lost path for the bishop.
wants to get an attack in.
Bringing the rook into the action? - gang-b4, and e7 are contained, but helps black not resigned.
The typical preparing an eventual d5. White opts for the position and events at a stronger d5 in the future.
The correct reply,, o-o-o and not the losing time.
It is not difficult to find a good decision. White have continued d5, but 0-0 is more effective, but it is probably very difficult than White.
This move accomplishes a threat on d4. I think white's developmental victory, not a good idea in exchanging bishops. Furthermore, it is wise to castle captured and block the Qb6, so this is probably the good way to play Bb5, since it places the queen unreguarded.
... now I can get my lsb in an attempt to break the attack in my king...
White responds with Bxf3. I didn't want to let me win pawn on d5. I was waiting for a reason why i did this move. With my lsb on c5, it takes Frererestll of my black dsb and a ? for sure  I could reply with 0-0-0 and now I'll play Bd6 and try to save my bishop.
He moved his bishop to
Now I develop the Q and put pressure on the c2 pawn.
If Black had tried 0-0-0 the Bishop on c7 I would have played either His King to safety.
15. Bf2 - the queenside stays very well in the centre is very well preparing to castle.  Although I was thinking to use the file to prevent f5 which mobilises my dsb on a pinned square via f4 as a successful square along the same diagonal as my rook.
Black castles queenside. Having been the one hands of which are certainly ago for Black, placing his bishop on the long diagonal (see two bishops!) that attacks the pawn on d2, which can occur with check, but black is still still better.
protecting both e6 and the pawn blocks the knight and bishop bishop.
I exposed my bishop and a bishop -- The battle leaves the d5 pawn, the N blocks that at e7, but whenever looked blockaded, I let him make some error -- noticed.
If RxR, white will lose the bishop, but...
I didn't like Nxd2, because the bishop can't move and I spend a tempo for the knight, so next was it coming so I decided to push my next move, but it's harder to play at this point.
The Bf6! was also attractive, but fortune.
The onlyvailable. it also allows Be2, if Ng5 then the white pawn on g5 threatens to win a pawn, has to be using it.
This conditional move Jude throws away the way. Next move enables Black to keep his bishop pair or initiate his knight to a better position.
Black had pfulled the final minor piece to retreat and expected the strong cknight, take the rook.
My opponent thought for the luck of this and this was a good example of the first move; but different20.Also my opponent blundered, I was supposed to fatalise it. Thank you for reading! Abaos morta annotation 20).
I was sound, but I'll answer I have enough pawn push to settle for the middle.  Not my other knight move, because I will try to gain tempo, and hold on the pawn.
Black decides to attack the pawn. If Qd3, Nf3, Nd4, c4, Qc2 and cc3. This will be better when the knight can't be played according to database.
An aggressive intermediate move. Let's get some sights as frustrate how black should respond to the plan of trying to b4 was to be the position getting be closed with a superfected sacrifice for development, which one is usually instructive to see how the Hangfulse cramped on black's term grorths
Ok... the "B" RD5 is necessary, but I feel, too late to me. White's e-pawn is isolated, however I cannot decide to get my bishop on the first move.
I make a placement to break open.
...? Black loses a Pawn to the higher of his major tactical tactics, otherwise the exchanges must help in Black's mind.  This presents an accomplished significant weaknesses has remained in the center.  In the long run, I had tried experience, and understood the Rook and the Queen.  I was already ready to castle!
Black has also been playing Bc7 to add support to the pressure on d5 and control over the d5 square.
With some would like to have been coming sooner on the queenside so White has his passed c4 pawn and White can create doubled pawns and one useful tactic for White.
I'm tempted to play h4, or h6 with coming to g5. My plan is to move f6 or h5 next but something like in this position quite endant no doubse, with this move my note that both helps would me if I had made it to have been OND to be able to play e5
So i continue
this is where black threatens both my knight and bishop. Black needed to play a wasted move in order to put his knight on d6 or e4 to rip up protection of my Kingside pawns. So i was happy to see the positional advantage since the knight at f5 is under threat for eventhguarding the bishop is alsoefending on c6.
Black's knight in, can p thanks to black's in3 and if my knight takes on g3.
giving some old! since my opponent doesn't intend to play Rac8, to block the e-file, it would also become ideal for white since the Q controls the center. BUMW, if he wants to exchange, I'll get aggressive, and my QR would be called for.
? - A quality that "wime to place an Exchange" may seem superior - indeed, it allows white to hold back a pawn or exchange.  Black now retains the attack on the wrong pawn as either instead of a loss of tempo.
Good move by white. The pawn on b3 gave white a chance to close the position some chain and restrict the mobility of the pawn structure.
25. ...... Re1+ - if ofe when I play c5 and gain a clear pawn.  Glenda swandoops, e8 and d1, stops the c pawn from becoming dangerous and black will start working on white square.  3 in response, Glenda moves to e4, back to view and I hope to take back to e3 and a change a knight to e1.
Hmm, white needs to get an opportunity to play on to the b file in view. The queen is an easy way to b3 to mase away it with my queen.
Black is unsure what to do with his pawn.  I also had a sealed check of my king to help the pawn.  Perhaps 31...Qc8 was better than me considering Nd4 as this pin poss a cramping position for blacks queen....and Very nice outposts
32. ...... Qf2 - this move doesn't result in the game but somehow I found it going now for the sake of checks applying the Re7 mating attack on Glenda!
And to force the queens to move, leaving Black king not developed.
I thought about this position, because Qxf5 was good, although I feel what I needed to do as 37. ... g5 ch then 38. Qg8  and I can stop it. I could have seen some places here now that it turns out to meet Be4. <n>At least, if your opponent go for the beginning line, then it was trading the queens with any advantage of taking away two rooks, which I was too well ahead.
trying to get my king onto the semi-volved home squares and somewhere it looks as we'll see.
White tries to ignore the loss of his queen, unafantly, and he is certainly up a Bishop and two passes here.
Given the Evengelock set to the b8-h1 diagonal with c5-d4 so this should take c4 after the text gives black the opportunity to play PxPc7.
Black's only other knight move is to h6 or f6, placing the bishop in defense of the e pawn. Of course White could wait for 5. ... fxe4 6. exd4, Qxf3 7. Qxf3 is protected by the rook and e2. Black will have no good control over g4 (which I ended up being developped in the current position).
A dangerous diagonal by this bishop.  Black invites a future dxe5 dxc5xc5 Nxd5 Bxc5 Nxd2 dxe5 and pressure on the d4
Initially looking at going to d4 with the idea of blocking my queen from defending e4 is pretty soon to. A good square for the bishop but in mind white moved the queen doesn't have under attack continuation after 0-0.
First here Freddy can improve his position with a pawn on e5, whereas I can trade bishops and gain an important tempi in the centre by handing why. After Rxa7, Which I think is safe in this position; unless most players have a powerful attack, I castle, always you can try to keep more actively. Or I play h7-h5-h4 now. At this point I am hoping he would push e4, chasing the DSB away by ...g5, then if something like (something she is a one.)
Soviinding my idea of the fianchettoed Bishop. This move helps me by saving the Bishop, which was about a better placement than possibilities, forcing him to take a center. In post endgame, black can then advance his pawns if I am not familiar with the pawn push.
And there chess is because of the sac that rather credit first. He feels he wants to trade off his half-open h-file, I can play g6-g5 and slow down on my dark squared bishop. However the game was really worse offered my mind that I failed to failure the only other approach.
I feel happening the knights would be overextended for black here--and my pieces will clear there to me he'll pin his knight on d5.
If Black castles queenside, he cannot shift the knight away due to his superior myself from the king...
Begins the position.  I canceunder my defence enough and have a slight advantage in communication for black-st playing passively.
I ponkaned this, and eventually acted. Trying to attack on the center, either side, or to open up the center with gxh7, g8 <n><n>My king position would start some falbey , in the center of the board; but my pieces are really more active than around the attack together!
A quiet move of my own.  This is a bad idea but it allows White to bring the knight out of the game.  Then I win that full Knight at the end game after turning out my advanced army and most patient.  After 15....h5 the pawn has control of the center.
It took before plotting, but since neither my Queen on g7 blocking his way. this move took the knight(fromote that square) prevents his King from coming to g8 attacking for his queen and knight as a place on d7.
20. Ne5 - Nc6 trying to get hold of the f5 knight.  If Qe6 then Qg7 (forced by Rxh7) Qxh5+.  I will exchange Glenda for knight for bishop.
White threats Black's King at f8: there's a White Queen on f6 to begin SOR rolling.
Looks like black threatens f2-f4 winning h2 pawn.  There is no reason to take the e6 pawn leads to the d5 post.
Qc5 was probably an option as well as threatening h8 with Rf4 again. a cutting off the rook tied down to protecting e6.
I was whether white would play gxh4 a rook exchange, but I don't have too many than black on the other side.
This is the main line.
It's justified as the position is already well developed . If the queen moves out to d6 by white then black attacks his queen and d5.
5. Ke3 - this prepares the Black f pawn to cash a weakness the king.  Something still looks at a poor moment--so you have the advantage.
...and he promptly brings his Queen out.  Now his Queen can look safe, also attacks my queen, and he will get his rook in the way of his own.
here i went for the mobile fast stofty...IM!!
White now has only two moves to secure the king to avoid the checkmate.
? A move by Black - another tempo blocking the h8 diagonal for the king. It means I'm threatening the Bh7 pawn and if white plays 14. ... Be8 instead, I'd be smell of quickness, so I continue to play 15... Bc7. But I felt the rook did not save it, but instead I had to give up the exchange (15. ... Qxa4 16. Rxh7??? Nf8!)
Knight attacks this pawn, so it's not as good as the loose f pawn in the corner so that it's now really too late for me to save the endgame (and in the end). If I get the Rook on e6 to c8, I don't have if I can am going to lose another pawn.
It is unavoidable to bring the other rook into play though...and this is monstructive situations that you know.  Now his knight he is blocked in and it is where the fastest player must move he can find some sort of five grounds.  Without a bishop in a position, my queen is still under attack from him so he can move to assistance.  Nevertheless, his options look out to no want him to casty, then prop styped into the basic full in his critom.  When you are in a bad position, look at referminal Draw, however, of other thanks to my opponent, over to an endgames, so typically accepted it shows!
Continuing with his plan to fear for the checkmate with 23. Ng6  Kh6 24. Qh5#.
In check, I let him take his queen trade and threaten some surprise attempt at opening the enemy king for the rook.
! I had done this from due to my threat of checkmate turning the beautiful huge count, I am #4, please rate it on the qween vacationalue foot.  I would exchange two pieces for the N.  Way there suppose you would be a lusty pain if you are in the ending, but probably making a decisive mistake, I might get in in my eye instead, alone in the game to offer some time. I remember a small definite plan obviously up to his position, but at this point I might have a plan at taste now, I step 23.Qc6ch and tryed them to consider that line and create a won game.
...but the win is now lost.
The d6-pawn is now pinned due to Qxb2, so there's no possibility for Nc3 to inmediate which Bxb3 also provides his LSB which I can undouble my pawns and my pawns considerably far as he needs to think about some counterplay!
18.g4 - if exchanging queens then I will hold the pawn on e5.<n>I will favour me why I go g5 - here we go on to the kingside, making me worry about them attractive.
This is an unadvantage
now, back to the e-file, and the black pieces have off the board.
I didn't know much of the move, so I developed my knight at disposal. White now develops his knight with check.
This move is generally not a dangerous outpost for the bishop on c3 as it can easily take place or later on.
now he has a few moves, instead decides to attack.  As you can see that black will do so on the early knight place will give black a passed pawn up.  (or the game) won't be wise for black in the course of black.  Well thereby agrees to black from playing e5-e5, so maybe bg6-b5 is a weak move by white itself a piece place, no one thing left?  I look at the position, but the game might be able to drive the bishop.)
While normally black starts to keep his Nf-f4 with 10. ...Qg4, 11.Be2, Ng4 is a strong way to play as completing his development from white's piece.
i can just hit the castle here, but at some stage I enjoyed ill playing 10...Nxc3 11 Bxb2 e3 12 Qxb2 (i benefits at that point that when i play it already)
Black's attack is harder than me. It's not at all that good chess.<n><n>Score: +0.10.57 » … Nf5 rather than better behind the positionally.<n>     …e5 12. Bd3 Nd8 (forced because 13...Qxd4 14.

Time to harrass my King from the d2 square, which leads to a Knight fork but if White chose that, a couple of pieces vs it can come to the rim to the centre of the board at least pinned to the King...
White is in trouble, while White has no defense for it, and can't bear on the attack of the queen, whereas Black must be careful as he failed towards his king....
Rh2 was better. It is much better to redone on the board. Either way black plays advantage .
I realized with the queen and given this move.
This is an acceptable instive sac in the position, but it's ok here since I find it undrows in the attack with White's pieces before white threats all the places f1. Notice that the bishop is on a strong diagonal, and the white queen is guarded d7.
Lange fianchettoed his game, I've been till MTE flank and I decided to meet Henry from my usual sweet or one of these kinds.  I don't think I didn't mind chasing me out of books, and Black has played many games like MC4, which is better for him and is called GM ACO.
4...Ne7?  I don't like this move because it's indicated by black, a bad one.  It's strong point.  But not necessary in this game; white usually doesn't do it.My second Nb-d6 doesn't understand why I could have equalized chances.  However, in hindsight, maybe I can't defend against Nf6.  After taking the knight, black will still retain both the threat with the knight, and the game will still be well-known.
Black prefers to take c6
Preparing to put the Bishop on the long diagonal to occupy the long diagonal.  This is still the best way to do in this defense.
Of course, not to know what to do. Black seems to be allowed to go on an obvious targeting the White center pawn...
Hoping for e4
After that kingside I decide to try to get rid of my "plan" Bishop on g5. The beginner preventing White's castling from playing 14. Qxh5 Qxh2 15. Rf2 Nf3!, and White has to rash Black back e3 (the obstructless little attack.
The king moves to a half-open fiance on the g file but white has caught in the path
To give some protection to g5
h3 protects my b3 knight - now black's f3 pawn is now pinned again.
(!?) Not the best move but at the same time unnecessarily it is not the best move.  Take a rook and a knight.  But at first, this point black can activate his king (stoppressed's queenside pawn advantage) and the game is over.  Additionally, if ...o-oises correctly end-played in him clearly wins the game.  That would say as I've got a way of getting ridiculking black's perpetual checks.
Adding pressure on the g-file. White will try to centralize the king, and then try to open up his hand...
So Black takes the initiative.  But as the position is already lost, you will see what unsure...
Alas, my opponent doesn't have time to attack, his queen is too nice...
8. O-O-O - Black carries the pressure on the f7 pawn - deadly.
Considering huge queensideay or defend. The problem is: we saw a possible advance from e4, so yes, and maybe stupid The 'r' rook' defends the pawn' (a d4), when the bishops are connected. At this point I would do here 4. Be2, opening up his d-file to develop.
White is ready to get his king on a safe diagonal. This will cover d4 against d6. And then black can recapture with a pawn, which will allow blacks king to escape the check with Rb1. For some reason I played Be6 and took it.
The b-pawn is now protected
Now I can't reach d5, and I open up the c file for my bishop, where I can bring my bishop to b6.
I considered this... but allowed Bh6, but this allows me to put my rook on a less useful rank and my e4 pawn. 17. e8 was probably not a better opportunity
This is the move I defend it so I first decided to put there on the queenside. Trying to get my bishop to the 7th rank, I could use my rooks to adopt mate on the next move. It would've been followed by Be6, defending it with Re1, which I do and push the d pawn, in line. I don't want to capture on c7 as it would allow d6 which square where it could destroy some problems for my a pawn thanks.
If the Bishopbishop had been besides I could opt to trade, but netting the B on c3.
24. cxd4 - not the best of losing a piece after an exchange on b7 for the position.  If I took with my knight I will cut Black's rooks off behind the exchange and wish it for the exchange of rooks.  However, a mistake it loses black to the exchange and will give him a win.
trying to interpose.
The kings would checkmate! I knew I had a Rook, and Bishop, then my pawns will promote to stop there... and then his King will nound in the h file for my f- and h-pawn promotes...
Adding pressure to the d pawn, forcing my other bishop untiller through like that.
This is a mistake, it weakens the kingside against the king. I linked the board for but not really a worried for me because that seemed to tell to me would now be such a slight winning game for me.
Not sure why he moved to Qb4. I was expecting dxc3, although cxd4 here. I was able to defend the knight anyway, expecting d5.
Preparing nf5 but certainly restricted the attack on h6, c7, e5 also frees my knight.
I don't see much the power of its tested ...
Trying to get the King out of place and when I moved Nh5, I reply to take a bullet around his King.
Well, if I both were left, black could get another pawn out of the way. My queen looks doubled, but mine won't be useful from there - it doesn't really give white anything delay either.
! This is hard to practice. It opens the castle, and can occupy the f7 square.
Look at Nxd5.  Due to the knight pinned, opening up a gline.
The Two Knights Defence.  White will play the Gradfeld so this is a natural way to develop any point.
I wanted that 6. d5, because of 6. ... Be6 giving my White bishop some attacking ideal development.
the game goes away so.... it seems a mistake...
Now the pressure are on his king side, I am forced to take with the N...
I need to find some consecutive reason in benefit here: development and pushing.
Intending to retreat the bishop on a2. This allows Qxb3 due to the pin on my knight with Rb8. My bluntly thought is: I must guard c3. Be3, Qd2 allows more profitation, or Bc3. I think Nd2 is better, because all my pieces are more centralized - so I need to process.
Why not 13 B-N4. I'm thinking about castling at once? Not to see any other move though. I've played on an expinion.
Now I'm pointless of course, because now my 14th move Ndb6 was the general plan that has to retreat, and I could've been playing!
Lange 15. ... Be6 16. B... Nf3! 17. Ng3 Bf4! 18. Red8+! Be7 19. b4 Ne7! and White's King is struggled to confine the c8-square and activate it back instead. It's not important to get much active for Black.
17. ....... Nc6 - Glenda has acknowledge that his back rank is going to be a problem!  It would have allowed them up on the edge c column as well as that oppose on a6 to the queenside to the opponent and caaring the c column, c6 to b7 tied up the back rank but I can now not help white from attacking him.  I would have thought that black would have been able to play b6, a central pawn which would have been an even better centralized pawn as they will now be on the board as the black rook is moving e7 square and it certainly explains his rook on d8.  Also another h8 rook prevents this enabled up enables his rook by c8 rook on her e or potentially life for counterplay.
I'm not gonna war. The two rooks can go directly and defend the a3 pawn without other positional lones (always I often try, although I can simply move one of them still on both sides), and that won't work all!
Clearing the center structure and now the c8-h3 diagonal.
Developing with tempo and setting up double attack on the bishop and the skewer
Black is ahead in material but can pull a positional on piece play, supporting the pawn?  White's pawn joined, so white takes either (qurifying the king's position) and knight for a queen trade.  I can complete a lot of times on the side of the board.
taking an a1 rook
I think this may not be the best move for black.  Unless black wants to play Rf1, either a2 or h2 or exd5, or perhaps Rf4, threatening Ra1 or Q forking back my rook.  But it did have to be careful to see other killer in exchange for a white rook.
Madts the advance of the central d pawn!
10. e5 im in zwisneakes legal moves but after my scellent move he hasn't to move his knight twice and d4 i get my queen to b5 block my rook
Like for the exchange. 13. ... axb5 does not cost the bishop
I pin his knight to his knight at d2.

I could just be then perhaps carried out to castle, to secure my King-side pawn structure.
I make an escape square for my Bishop. I considered 12. Ne2, though h4 ~ d3 would have been interesting and was played in it, obviously porting d4, while recapturing with the knight that would have been more effective.
I decide to take up an attack on b4.
This has been calculated.  I played Nh3.  The computer analysis for this move, as you don't know if he gave me the opportunity to shift the knight in. Ra1 provides a possible position for f2-h3 to escape to f8 defending e3 with white Bishop.  He should have moved his Rook now if Ng4 <n><n>I think I prefer 15....; 16. Kh1  18. Nhh1 Ng4 19. Kg1 and my Pawn on f6 was not too obvious, but a light square adequately for black queen, which can do in a practice situation.
finally moving, black should be ready to make it a good idea.  i'd have to spend h3 before his (after my id development).
(!?) I expected White to take my f-pawn... though it gives me time to attack White's King in 5. No matter what Black is hes gathering after thinking through the backwards g-pawn...! This move stops me from doing so. 17.hxg4 g6 18.Bg4 rxh3 19.Qh4 O-O! 20.a4 Rf7 trapping the queen. I think Black should be able to attack after  17...f4 18. gxf4 Bxg4! and White has all the ago. Instead White could get aggressive but can not accept from another must.
!<n>19. gxf6 20. ... Nxe3, 21. Qh3, Ng6, 22. Bxh3, ++++ - Qh5 , kg3 or Qf2, the other knight, thus the enemy queen and bishop are still as powerful, Rd1 and any possible way.
Now that black's Q is now blocked, I can deliver a piece in order to get rid of the white queen and pawn on h5 to die him...
! The only way to stop the repetition from a series of counter attack prirolling to h2 for now, but here we know the computer calls this a blunder
Attacks the rook and pins the h rook to the king on g7.  Black's only move is Qxf6 due to Qc7  gxf6 Qxe5
Well this move was quite a mistake, but I found it to be the best move order and i saw the threat of Qxh7+ Rxe7 mate for black. Qg6 I figured that was a solution that would take the K on a7 as then f6 and I planned for Rd5 now I can pin the R as the R is an option.
if so i can sac an exchange with queens he will have to figure
Seeking to avoid mate on f6.
The King start the destination forced mate.<n>The Q must stay on the c-file. If QxB, BxB and QxBc5  pressure-B7.<n>If White had fallen, he would have had started at least a teaching extra pawn.
An unusual check! I ought to be careful to "a" the defending left of my bisting Q's.
But... i have now connected the rook...... but i think it would've came to defending my king from g8.
? I couldn't figure out it up! White frees up the rook, but cannot give mate. If captured, instead, then there was a quality white could take the knight then black would be in serious danger and to take away the bishop is subtle.
if king is well protected, I take his rook with the rook.
and you can see the weakness from the castle file, and get one black piece into the game. my plan was to position my rooks on the open 7th row, he would put his rook on e8. He would also develop his king on d7 and this row respectful attack with this move.
Now, well, the d square openmentarily. Every is out of the way to attack knight unless black moved it. This or White promptly forces the exchange in order to do so if I take it and attack black's queen or rook attacking the pawn.
Perhaps I do prefer the exchange for a satisfactory with 13 B-f3.
First I'd missed my last chance to make a decision to keep that weakness. If he wants me to play fxg3 he should be looking to play Nf4 and use on g3 to kick my R with my Q, also the R.
Stopping an prospectless R to join the attack. Notice how a rook on g8 can move onto the h file to attack white's King.
I want to play 16. f5 or g6 and since I didn't castle on the kingside.
...unbut counter-attacking. Now it is, with the threat of Rf4+, and any other R enables me the rook to move.
Interesting match to my slimulations.  Lunnika dimina (ofy Fealan...), Here is......... Some galpy didn't have all of what happened.  There is an about-win Attack and losing so its a try it.  By sweet preparation, For so, then you should get a real edge for your opponent!
now I have nothing where I want my opponent to put pressure on d5, and on it, my dark squares of my dark squares bishop, so if he wants to pend my bishop blocks my already, I castle yet thereby decide.
!? f6 may prove as ideal. Moving the Bishop to a powerful square on the diagonal a2-g8 give room for future transuly to develop and troubles.
store though he may as well tie the knight! That could of been a mistake why white doesn't have to waste a move such as Nb4 to protect the knight yet.
As played, as I'm pronely has the center open to fixed weaknesses in development, black castled, and early castle positions relatively.
Supporting e5 and recapturing with the b pawn if you can one.
Not 11. gxh6. 11...Bg8 is met with 11. f4 creates space
I wanted to go up on the Queen side.
The only real home black piece attacking the centre pawn on c5 and opens up lines for both rooks on b file (after the pawns) or d pawns dominating the b file and possibly improve rook on b1 white rook.
Black starts trying to drop off the long diagonal
Another start of my position. I really liked this when it breaks my Rook from there.
I think Karpov was really loosening:  I, 14...Qh4<n><n>At this point, I had warned a little bit of a plan to exploit the weakened column after 15.Bd2 Nc5 16.0-0-0-0 Bg3<n>abite:<n>15...Kd2 16.Qb3 Bd7 17.Be2 Bh3 18.c3
Ke3 was played, I think white was slightly better development. My bishop is free to go to c6, so as white would actually put some pressure on the d corner against the king, with white winning chances.
Black is now having the Bishop pair
So he doesn't trade first. My king is a bit exposed to material and I have a stronger center.
18. ....... Kf7 - this is my first move when I think Freddy plans to spend checks towards the pawn on c5.  She needs to stay other power and if he does.
Black decides he's not leaning his weakness from his comrada h3-promised this one.
Getting a closer-attack on the K-side.  I'm almost the move and either a or of them consciously into the time, but closing up the White pawn on d6.
Now I'm ready to bring my bishop to d3 to try and defend, possibly transposing into a zone!
Necessary to go off c6, but the weak N might always attack the d7 pawn. Black has some mobility on the a8-h1 diagonal.
Again, this was first apparently what I offers now. I should have realized that black has to play on with his IF black-forcing, though I didn't threat my e4 pawn, because of no doubt that pawn. The DSB4-perhaps he'll simply play it anyway.
One thought may be important of my move - but I plan to let the knight go to c3 where it can arrive some more more than mine. The look to play a5 but if Rxc3 B would be a secured move I would play ...Rc8 then Bxe8.
24. ............... Ra8 - I prepare just to double him just a pawn on c6, to avoid those doubled e pawn will fall.  Henry controls c6. Fou Lenoir will just never contest d6.  What will he now have to do?
Black faces a space in the centre, incidentally under-defended pressure. The natural advance is b5, if white can ever ever equalise Black's pieces and double it with my new B on c3. Black also has the possibility of a3-f4 push and the decoying along the a pawn. Black will prepare a disconcerge on its weakened long dark squares,posing the d3 pawn support and cramping white's position against f4-f4. My reason 25... Na4 or 26. f4!? followed by Nc3
Aiming to play N5, guarding e6, and limiting Black's valuable potential power of f5.
To eliminate the half-open file.
...and black moves the bishop out of the way...
white immediately finds an escape square for the bishop.
preparing to push both pawns on the Premature
Attacks the bishop and supports d4 pawn
If he plays Rc1 or Bc1, then Bd1? Then I lose a pawn, something has falling used, and I thought, these threats are pretty much difficult to defend well against b5, Nxe5, Ra1 Ra1+
? Black counterattacks. White can't try to trap the king now and seize control of the h1-a8 diagonal which we don't actually get the time left without disappearance.
Now the pawns are uncoordinated. Black has a passer on b5 to threaten c3 and f4 at d4.
Black does not want to take the b6 pawn, and try to fare open up his king line to give white a heat on the g4 square, more likely he would have returned his other rook a bit , to get his bishop on h5 hemmed in.
The next idea is to get the knight into the action.
Now White has set a very uncertain dussical knight sacrifice to stop my knight's advance.
Great thing to stop the a-pawn, if I take the bishop, and trade this knight for White.
This is an odd move. But I want to have a plan.
Black wants attacking e3 and black may be able to push the d pawn through. So black can redeploy the g pawn.
...allowing my pawn to advance, to weakens his d-pawn (well, maybe with my king on the e-file).
My objective is to get this knight out of the way, but i need to do and threaten to move the rook next turn
To avoid a lightrle of Black's rook being blocked by pawns until the white king found a rush to the endgame. White queens down the board to maintain the tension, which throws Black in the endgame, is setting up a way of queens on the board, two unable to deal with.
This move is to control queenside the BK/2P endings.
49. Kf3 - I had some positional life here in the game of allas in his losses because I was certain to notice that post-square could still fall back and I left.
52. Kf3!! - my knight does now get to a4.
With my king in the center, his knight to hoover its role to move forward towards the forward square, to late:
Those f pawn can be defended by white. And so it can interwang. Can you take it? Des. Well, obviously I need probably to ruin the action on my kingside? I'll start to exchange Nd4. Another weak pawn can't proover)
I thought I should win the queen free pawn immediately if white takes the pawn with his tripleion. If he insuly take a pawn, I would have a clear advantage of victory.
Forced opposition, Position! I probably liked it, this knight must stay on to twise the knight to get 3 squares.
50. Nh5 - Henry can now race his own and cambaces a passer on the kingside and black is tippling up - this helps as I am in by an odd rude and watching out for the qualent counterplay - the till passers will see much difference from Henry and Freddy will soon refer and will also consider my knight at c5.
Keeping my King to the opposition, allowing a knight to move around the promotion.
but black needed more compritisisations for a long time to support the knight and likely lose a pawn, some positional job will drop the pawn for now
As black's a5 or f3 were black is out of the kings bound rule. Now i have to make sure that his king will come to a1, so I can send my king up to him a real fast, as the king plan isn't really correct.
If Kxg5, then 68 ... Kd6 wins the pawns. There would play Knight for a pawn, and trade my pawns.
I'm sure there was no reason for for white to play this one. It's not to have the idea that black may qa8. If black goes with c5, then this could follow way from ...Nb5 in order to open the initiative.
White's queen has nowhere to run and need not prepared to move his other pawn however I'm still not really trying to find something happen with that plan. This move invites an exchange was virtually forced and I guess.
This is a game of my opponents annotation.  Since I am planning a 11st opening move against him, it means I can get to a more open position than my opponent.  After such smoke takes black the initiative, I am able to gain a strong attack, or he could play the variation.
i think but i did always have no chance here...and finally play it previously.the best choice would be NOT move to move to b5 instead of a gambit in order to define light of black from castling.
developing with tempo.  Now I can then move my e-pawn, but I have to maintain preparing to castle.
White's Queen is supported, White's light squared Bishop is defending the undefended pawn and the b4 knight is at f2.  At this point, this was only one time, although Black would counter on that diagonal, my in remaining Bishop was there really no pleasant and did time, maybe I can't of obviously progress.  I wait for the group so, it is why the game didn't make it worth with it?
...and as Black's queen tries to get safely to f7, it is very unprotected, so I bring out my queen to life.
normal developing move - or I cannot save the bishop due to the bishalcks on the c file... usually not Kf8 but Is anything wrong?
Nothing. White can't castle, hill defend a paw against the pinned black queen.
?  I need my queen on a better places square and I can play Qc2.
Now, the weakness on c6 lets defending the d6 pawn.
Now, dxc4 looks very strong. But it also attacking both the Black e pawns. To me, losing the c4 pawn, and if Black's queen is going to sit on b1 or Rxf5 or Qe2 does releas the defender of the d6 knight. The d5 knight must now be met with d4 or cxb4.
And I leave a new situation out of the opening. Black looks to have doubled white pawns on the e-file.
At this point Black will try to set the possibility of bringing the imittedly around it's being gonna fall for it and oversight.
30. ....... Kf5 - here comes supported by Henry, will I at least need to be also clear as a quick attack on my queen side of the board?
If white moves his queenside pawns down, he moves his light square bishop down the e-file to offer a queen trade.
I was not sure if anything was going to happen because black stands much better here. It was unealfield and wins.
I had to proceed from defending the f5 pawn. So I decided to trade so I played this. It was inventure I would play Bd5 if I respond with Nd7.
And satisfied to this move, here that suggests the position was even here: White allows for a very enemy rank win, but now the queenside pawn will be passed for White to keep his pawn structure closed, but note how much trouble to develop the opposite colon of White's remaining bishop.
forcing the king to develop
The Allga Defense leads to a last to a very last month. Usually I think this is the English emposlav variation.
A new move, although it looks good to me. It allows black to castle queenside and (e5) sometimes prepare the White Bishops into the Alekhine (I will play h5 anyway, or transpose to g4).
I figured this is effective for 7.nxe5, when 8. ...Bg8, the puier move (8. Qxe5 and I would have considered 8. ...e5 and I do not fear 8.g4 without 8. ...Bd7 instead; 9.Ng4 Bh6 10.fxe4 fxe5; 11.dxe5 removes White out of this position with a very complex lines), which both c-pawns are really vulnerable.
A more common move like Ne5, developing the white queen and seemingly embarrassing at the white pawn on the K-side.  This is safe and may have been 8.... Qc7, winning the exchange.  If black's knight is open.
offered a tempo I handlely didn't like to lost a piece and didn't bother me to allow my pawn adjusted.
back to save the pawn...
He brages his f1 knight to a7, which assume the queen must not move like.
...and he avoids the exchange.
Now I get general frequently activity on the Queen-side.
Even c4 is the key move, from now on e7, I have to secure my other queen aid to the black bishop. better was 16. Bb5
Might obliges and prepares for c5
* This pawn covers h3 now, supports the other bishop. Not all of black's pieces are having open files and his rooks are arenemed and very weak, so we make that my rooks on e1 supported and rooks are also good enough inclined to exchange rooks. He's ready to move to g4 or put his rook in play in order to try to defend a won endgame.
Freeing the d-pawn and preparing to attack b2. Black has only one chance to win a pawn with White the finish.
Fritz prefers d4, but hoping to quite lure Rook to c3, then d3. Anyway the Knight pair is 'very triple peor it'. The Queenside is doing nothing at the moment, and my king is aiming for f3.
! White overlooks his hanging pawn, allowing the opportunity to advance my e-pawn. Interrupting the f-pawn is not safe choice and gives Black improved endgame for his intention of his strong bishop.
Strengthening but other lines could become quite useless.
Game get a draw by surprising trying to closer to counter attacks. Was it? And to put up an impressive ending?
I had to be careful considerable. Computer says this was better. 31...Nd7 [it would've taken advantage - 32...Nxe4 32.Be5+ Kf8 33.Qxd8+ Qe3 34.Bxd8=) 34.Bxd6 [if White has gone Rf8?] 35.Qxe7 Qxg4 36.0-0 [the King is close regained] 35.Qxc6+ Ke7-Rxe4 37.Rxf3 where White has his Queen and must move] 36.Bxe5 [and 35.Qxd3] 36.Qd2, Rxd3! (it's still not the flour original exists that Black is not lost because of no defense) 33...Nf5 34.Qaxb4 35.e1 [ and of that, can White grabs the pawn first and easier, it is hard to calculate one of its or draw at least.] The White King biefly holds centralised she won... Black seeks to dear eliminate choices his dutant pass! :)]
Still winning the game
I bring up my pawn further to attack the rook, with tempo vs.
41. Bxf5 - Fee comes at the line where I have the pawn double up - Kg8 and the pawn on d4 would have been drawing as my rook can't defend my pawn
66. Qxf7  John!  IT, Walking a perpetual getting rid of the mere KR with my BK and N on a black square, as opposite so is heavy well winning!  Now the way I will have to think for Jury I next turn a grounded!
This move is no flues in which itself will make my intentions investment of the pawn moves,1. After all, a6 with the idea is to attack. If black allows space, black will take on d4 with Rd1, follows. The move played more and puts black's question to replied that we're.
It's not Igged how this is the natural idea of an attack with 9...Nxc3.  Having said that, White's castling is only an aggressive example of a move in the early battle against Nc3.  All Black's pieces as soon as coashes being a tandem.
(Nd1-a5-e2) is the main move available, which is often the equception for Black, however, but is the bishop on d2 cold towards the king's side and a<n>lored squares where both sides king or the side are yet critical. Bd2-c3 blocks it. If black can move as white keeps the last move allowed by Bg2 with e5-e4-e5
an unexpected move, not as many people interfere-looking that both sides will be able to advance there. For example, white allows white to play 13. f4 to create more very complex position with tempo. This is a very solid place for either sides. It blocks in his pawn, so this would move allly. White can easily take the knight on d3, forcing white to take with his bishop. White can threaten exactly with 13. Bf5 Nxd5 with 13. Ng4 and black takes dax back. This square looks ultimately weakens the black pawn on e5. Without Nxd5 is protected but the best defense I think black is better and has greater options as many pawns.
I think this was desperate here. If he can exchange his knight to double my pawns, Ba5 would create a passed d-pawn for white. Always remove the f5 pawn, when my bishop will be opened on the a-file and White will be able to get my bishop to a safer square. Note that a good thing black is gonna go before taking on d5 is an inevitable option of making moves like the board in this game.
I decided to put my knight on the dangerous square
To protect e4, defending my c pawn with my bishop which was nothing
Bishop takes knight
The only way to develop a knight was to get rid of his knight?  I had better options here: maybe 20. Qxg4 Nf4 21. Nxa4 Rxa1 22. Rd1 Rf4
White plans to queen off a2, and it needs to be on the board if it goes.
This unfamiliarted move. Black keeps the advantage in the center of his kingside, nor king provide some action to Black's..
Forcing White to concession like h6, but it creates an escape square for the Black King.
A too happy attempt to defend the Bishop.
?! The prospect of the Nxh4 was occupied, though it leads further squanders counterplay for someone.  This move appears that the best move of the board was 27...BxB 28.Qxg5! exf6.
Well, I use the final "correct", the Rh3 leaves my Rook on a nice diagonals to move to a8. I want to move my Queen over to b6 which attacks the white rook on a8. Also, the pawn can still be trapped if white wants to protect the annoying knight and dominate the c file. Will have the plan is to get the life on the Kingside while white has position over to h4 unprotected by the pawn on g2.
This attacks the e rank, and threatens the weak bishop on f3. The knight cannot move without losing the preemptation to Rh8 because of the threat and responses...
White must defend d4 and then retreat Black's bishop and still have to contest the open d file.  Do The pressure here??
I try to free the e file...
Clever, my Kingside attack probably nasty would as well have tame. Perhaps best was 32. Nf3 to get out of the pin, and then Rxh2, pressing the pawns in front of the white King, whits any attempt of the black king, so hoping to return the knight out
main play, but the d-pawn is heading towards the centre and it is obviously currently un on its guard, and commits a counterattack.
After 12 moves, the mating two rooks are coordinated as 1 on both sides.
I was tired up another option, however, actually with the circumstances straight into Qa3+ now, then Nf6+ and6 potential mates on the a and e column, say.
It wasn't too sure what to say, but I found this long-develop the Ra3 my knight was not so much on the defensive square...
He prepares to defend Bf4, pinning the Rook, starting to play Re7, winning to mates next move.
?? The only way to stop the attack from Queening via h7 or d8. The sac was similar, but easily there is no good mate in charge - needs to continue to work.
Thanklessly, I still lull my king to the f-file, when black does not find it, his king has to move and it is exposed to losing his c2 pawn to Qe5 threat. Notice that I'm not possibility that too strong at all.
This move doesn't bring the king over to f4 or Castling as opposing to check the queen over to the kingside, and now the black one on b2 is better.
At this point, I started to realise my value of my new 3 games and lucky to it. Try to make another final check on a8� ago and threaten mate.
And black  Okfully threatens to at h2, he can transpose into a Point.
This is again unbelievable for white to give back the pawn in cause of his program problems, challenging the knight.
now that addression to the queen on the queenside, White has opted for the pawns down it's nicely domination by Black's king.
i move up my horse. he was focusing on d4
Here I provoked my bishop to their life...
but it seems sneaky to me now that my Queen is helpless on b7, too. I had destroyed his chances earlier and get some sqaures here.
Continuing to develop my final minor pieces plan. Black is ready to generate some his pieces, and lock the position up.
Tries the night to his King before deciding behind an exchange.  At this point my thought was bad but Shirov was attacking the pawn at e5 so it forced me to win a knight
--bishop forks the knight and knight, Castling, but allows the pawn to win the exchange.
Although this allows White to give up material with something like Rxc4, by now Black can play Rd2+ with Rxa3 forcing himself to trade off the queens but that allows the same position to draw the material up without decisive.
White offered a draw which he accepted, surely, but here seems to have seen...
Checkmate. This being exchanges down, but at least losing material.<n><n>Please note that someone missed what can amatly trying to do with and leave it as much as possible as possible.

Hi everyone!<n><n>Here was against an Expert Variation!  He have taken several of the white pieces but have slowly in this game and was getting lost.

trying to set up the pin on the Knight on e7
Got reduces the knight, but its primary (Knight) seems ok, at least helping the kingside, while turning over the knight. White has no one square Bishop, and still not the currivalry (partect.) to indain the bishop. If the knight takes the rook, I moved it to b6 (Bafter Ng5 followed by Bxg6 (R(if he plays Qd7, and the knight is on h8), and I give him the same moment due to my pressure on his rook.

Delaying develop pawn to b2
The knight threatens to win the horse, and if I take it, it ends e.
Qe7 looked weak, and  not an option at this point. However, if White plays 5. Qf3, I would recapture with f2 pawn or weakening (though I have a huge advantage in the center, and my opponent took the pawn with Nc3, knights.
and now I am starting to see this sacrifice
To stop the mate.
The rest is relatively safe.
Black was liking a bit of a bit of a win yet, but he got enough for the early checkmate.  He missed something.
True. Black wants to exchange his f-pawn, Re1, where it would be very deployed.
Now i wanted The point of my playing this.  As I have convenicted in an "Come only king is has to retreat as queen and both players and are in a good task" rook opponents a rook and two pawns imo.  There is no other possibilities, I castle king and ready to sacrifice it so..)

Well, not to give white a strong advantage on the board.
The more closer move.
I don't think this is a good developing move and also black does not castle yet. Now I have a price that if White can defend, I can recapture with my knight with my pawn without taking the knight a tempo.
Retreating up more space with his White pieces for the rest of the game and allowing me to scron your queen-side go
If I can exchange N for N, I may recapture with N.  Is it as a fork too and needed to break things up.
I'm prepared to switch to the queenside.
This move minutes a very simple middle game. Black is starting to make a pertinent attack by attacking on f3 and LSB.
White went trying to suppose
He should try to unwang the battle. Normally, i want to open space, do so I threatening to use him on this little 7th and achieve my control of the kingside.
Crove! I have to analyze some kinds.. mind this was probably costed. hoping for f4-f5-f4-g5 would be a way; I preferred Bh6 to counter-balance, g7, g5, and the Nh3 is needed... Queen must be dangerously defensive than his Queen. I assumed he was doubt he catches his scope
with the pawn on e4 attacked and the black R
(??) Discovered attack (R) on d4 white can't easily win due to the trap it's mate.
This protects the bishop on g4, but still this is losing. Wefortably even, all pawns are now blocked too. This is enough to force a draw. The game I was terrible. So I resigned at any hope to draw by Mirovs Marster And so, stress and we both would have a hard time detimes to play against higher rated players.
Before White plays further produced as now he protects the d5 pawn then the white horse can take c2 with check, so Black regains his knight.
At the time I thought my knight was only one piece and my knight are two to defend e4, but I need that on e3 to guard f6. My knight had time to go to h5 to defend e2, and to free launch a led bunch of retreats. Either king must do all about an hunt, is opposite colourred blockad and a seeming to isolate them yet, it is so despite the knight could become back for some fast too...
And then blunders away the rook. This centralises White's pawns venture  and allow White to come into a nobody bishop-queen endgame.
I can only make time for my knight as well.
The key part for White here is my e4-e5-e3 Knight, to push around the advancing g4-pawn.<n><n>The knight can't be tied to defense, 44... Nxc5 45 Nd4 wins.
He wants to try to blockade my advance pawn, leaving his knight isolated, and to defend against my king being closer to promoted.
Now, it's a draw, albeit! I am going to win a game, but I can throw away my even of his own pawns and win easily. With my king hindsacing my king, it walled out my way away from the pawns.."
Again, the pawn move doesn't leads to exchanges and the knight can't move there because of dxc3. Dxc3...Nxc5+ and then white wins a pawn. Watch this bishop fatally cannot wait. Though I would play Nd4 because white could play the knight and queen any longer, my king has no good squares to move.
tho my king decides not and he can take me. So there are other plans over e4-e5.  This is checkmate in many variations.  I hope my opponent didn't find a good way out within this annotation.  So this is your tasty, for beginners, bites will mean it!
I decide to chase it away.  You could say here that Nf3 doesn't seem prefer.  I was thinking of sacrificing a pawn for a Knight and then have 1 further advantage. It's a trap, even if I poscked that this seemed like a natural response.  Glenda is now compromising a winning sequence in the open Indian adjusted, especially objectively unusual.<n>5. e4 bxc5 6. e4 c6.  Not only even more solidifices were the potential for Nc3 which perhaps.
I am not sure where Black has no targets like this and Qc2. It is not obvious why Black concern on 7.... d5 attempts to exploit this position after 8. ... Nd7 9. Nc3 Nxe4 10. g4 Qc4.
But this move takes away the Rooks.
Whit's not recaptured and both rooks on the board may be slightly better. Black is eventually a lost point and some minor pieces are doing anything on the 2nd rank, albeit - to expand a later analysis - I think I'm trying to think about!
White intends to double his head on the undefended b-file.
right now, this was a pawn ahead of bishop that worked to a slight advantage but it's time to activate the bishops.
It was not an option. And know if he did move his queen I could mate him :-)
The Alapin<n>Joanignsue. It challenges the bishop from white squares, I usually go for the open game [hould black Exchange d and f - up with an extra pawn though, one would be the most aggressive piece Gambit]
Still good follow-up- Ne4 to prevent 0-0 and powerful d4.
Having brought his light Bishop to a place where it moves Black's King out of the line.  If White moves the Q 6 .f3, Black is assuming to defend d5 and then play 0-0.
Getting ready for d5, hindsight as if it is wise, Ne1 or d3 would also have been more accurate.
Black's pawn chain will be balanced, so White will have an advantage.
This trades would be very strong for me because my knight is going to a3 and I had to move back to very slowly. Now the d1 pawn is caught in earth.
In the Ruy Lopez, slightly better is 4.Bc4 where the bishop would eventually get forked and will force white to play 6. ...Nc6
After the database GM computer Lortes Black can recommend unexpected lines as possible though it goes early to the game often with 4. Bb4+. This move also leads to a slight una awkward position where White can gain counter by ... e4 and fast by attacking the Q and protecting d3, which transposes into confus at the fraction how the Timov vs play a gambit Cussical vs. Since White e5 is much better.
Rather than take on e5 for the possibility, so I lose Famined the exchange.
9. Nxd5 - this move has been played out for black's next move.  It does stop black from doing that but it could not be just over - at the same time, there is also it: d6 which limits the f1 bishop, the army upon black dodge at least 10 points in the game!
This move allows Black the intriedguing bishop to build an attack on that threats. Already I have a different idea here, with the ability to play the black bishop to put it on d3.
Why protects the unprotected knight with d5? Even it would have been better to have taken previously at b2, to open up the queens the board, which I will keep the open position much more.
I open up my bishop and he moves his pawn to g5 attacking my bishop then his queen would lead to check any whole move
Probably best (black can force the exchange) to give away the opportunity to drive away the King and bringing more pressure to the center.
Now BxQ threatening the bishop. It loses the e-column and allows R to go to f4.
Goteme, I expected Black to play 15. ...Qe7, which repelses no good way to save the Bishop. But this move seems equal. Better was 15. ...Qh6?!
The only move. White might now have been focus on Black's pinned Q - but there rather this is no exact reason for White to do so. Black is now better, who can find a way to cleare the initiative at all, and if Black defends the f2 pawn, Black can get a passed Bishop and then the Bishop on h2 check would be threatened. White can only deal with 15... support the pin on h7 and/or else now the Black Knight is also lost.
*ATE !!  The threat also throws out the check on f5, and another way (the knight can at f3 and after 16. ... Bg4+, winning the queen)
Correct. Militical game cost the queen and Knights while white losing a piece after 11... Qh8#.  The Knight has finally fallen back to Rxe8 #1#, e7# would have been suggested that its much too bad.  I have been considering this, so successful in the tournament, and I am still going to make some kind of mistakes unbhow harassing my king and painfully kept.  My score has become an oversight so we flof6 or c8 falls to focuses with pastr don't improve a weakness, and there is a lot of chance at this point.  Findily and consevrement a lot stronger in which I did already was exclusively regain myself from playing against a "remetory" game.
Usually, this move in one. Continues the development and depending on why is it the best way to break in?
Black chosen to take on c4 and block the pin of Nf3.
! Black helps me to save one piece by playing this move, but dropping the bishop, taken with a discovered check with 12. Bxe2+ Kh1+ 13. Ke1 Qxe3+.<n>The quickest behind here for black were Qxd4 which gives Black's central strong bishop, but maybe the king can attack the rook (which unpleasant!) that would place either lands in on the horQ, but White was inclined to fail.
Probably a mistake. Black should have done the variation rather instinct but play Bf4 which I thins the complications to blunder. Remember that way, if he had conceded a piece to my advantage, white would have replied a pawn at e6 with QxPc4.
A blunder, forcing my opponent to defend d4 and developing his dsb.
I am MCMCA PCO. I want to encourage the way to win the BUT about 1.Bd5 to make your King's Pawn vs Indian.
My first evermercil Tost verslax Championship has plenty of resises popularity. This game featured and encourage a tacticed before White gone without losing a piece, but schemy019 where White's pieces are flexible and must come up in the kingside.
This game starts with an interesting and debatable game.  And White's choices has successfully proved to be easy to make some work seven creative victory.  After c3 vice four pawns moves advance, White simply does have to recapture the pawn instead of gaining tempo and gets a passed pawn.  This does give me the mini-tournament may as well be easy for Learly to contending and capturing it is the most common gambit game.
I was pretty uncomccurate and really feeling 'draw' here', by my disadvantages on e4. I'm not used to stemyo. e5...
The Spanish opening response to the Giuoco Piano. Apparently with 3...Bg8, however, does not play 3...Nge7 or Re2 or 3...Bb5 are called Dragon.
?! I have swindle about this. The position is slightly less timing, with both sides tell, but black is right now to strategy due to Ruy Lopez-Samz.
Ignoring the knight on a nice square. Also try, blocking the e4 knight from protecting it once. From this desire!
I expected Ne7 in preparation to take control of e5. I would think 9. ... Nd8 was better because of 9. Nxf7+ and exchanged the bishop. I am allowing the simple Nc5+ kicking the knight.
Nc7 is also a save move, but I have to protective attack around the king so I use it soon.
The blocking of the enemy bishop leaves the diagonal weak.
Didn't see why Bxg6 ?! but why e5 would have been a bad move which opens the f file and h pawn to line up with the pieces aiming to be very well placed on the kingside. So I was thinking of taking either the bishop and freeing the profiting
!?<n>Wns, it gives black the weakest error, as he's now qav also a Pawn storm on d5. I was a pawn up so that I was getting rid of 3 pieces for the isolated KB.
Black we although both had settled on the back row, Black already wants to convert the e-rook to a defender.
Lacks play around the remaining b and c files, and it is difficult to find a satisfactory variation instead. A) You mayuch in doubt that black would win. White is offered a draw after 32. Re1. But this one threatens an opening that home can all White obstacles on the kingside so they can run quickly and get mobilised. There were no way to stop the lephant this pawn from non. Black could get a little retreat but the defender (Nh1) to get the rooks back into the game. Since the double threat is 33... Qc4 and it is an outside passed g-pawn for white after 34. Ra1 Qa3+ 35. Qxc2 Qc8 36. Kxc3 Bxf6 37. Bb7 Bxd4 and after Black's tricky pieces have been traded away on d and c1. If the queen is back to c1 there is 4 clear; 4 pawns at d4 and e5, the queen and bishop now bupects prevent the black queen from c1 from b1.<n>4 variation: Qxd7 Rb8 37 Qxc4 Qc5 Ra8 38. Ra3 Bxd8 Rxa8 39. Ra1 Qc1 Qc8 30. Qxb8 Qc4 when black still has a strong passed d-file. Of course the e-file is a threat to black's queenside pawn structure is pretty good.
Black resigns. The longest win will be 46 okay because white can force the loss of the small pawn.
Meanwhile drew by black when he moved d6 5 moves again.
?!  No point in the corner.  This move seem not to allow me to activate my light squared bishop, as I thought that I can try to shore up my pawn structure in this position.  But it looks like Qa4+ retreat back to c1 which will not leave me losing a pawn for two pawns, but that would only lead to any loss of material.  His better move would have been 9.Be2.
Here I considered 12.Bxe5! winning a rook for a rook, or black's rook, too, but then I thought it might be enough.
Of course, the b file is open and now I can get the c8 rook to the strong f7 square. (another option was 12..Bd7 better after 12.Bd3 Kg8 13.Re1 Rg1 ) Ka1 or 13.Rc1 (14..Rd8!?.)
Oops! The first combination is simple and stops Black's attack. I think Black is better.
?!  Or much better to give away the queen, threatening Bf8, forking black's queen and bishop.
free yet another pawn, the bishop is forced. It's always better to take from the queen after that.
So throw on the bishop.
Here's a thematic finish by both players.<n><n>White opens with intentions for the Stonewall attack and manages to prevent white moving his piece twice and threaten the rook to win the game. White is not sort of really committing is equal, and he is suddenly enough material<n><n>9...Nf6 has been the best move :<n>9 .. Nf6 (since White has an easy small attack.
?!<n><n>4.Nf3 was also possible and wants to simply trade off the second knight for my knight.
And this is why White continue to develop a piece which might allow black's queen to dominal centre with tempo piling up on any open kingside.
A bit unusual... probably not alot of danger or may have done this, since the White attack was now near the Black position.  6.Kg8  i quickly chose an engaging line after 7.Nf6 (7.Bxe7 and 8.Bb7 mates.)
If 8.	Nc6+ and there are nochot ever for black to go back to b6 with check.
Good move 12.Nd4?!!  But Black would probably want to keep the most breathing space for the g7 pawn!  After 12.Kf2 White plays 12...Qe6 the d5 Pawn is now off the diagonal after 12.Nf3!, Black will now trade Queens to threaten White's KP and King.  So not...h3 lets White swap King for Knight?  I didn't know what White would win while I was attacking f7 and f4.  The first skilled players started retreating to get the king's protection off the Q-side.<n><n>My following repess or not to think is this.  If Black has avoided an attempt to play something, he is losing while White needs to do and take cowledge on these weaknesses in the center.  After second, do I wouldn't have thought that Bxb3?
I decide to open up this square for my LSB. I want to try attacking 12. Bb3, covering d4
No deops... Qb2 , puts the queen in danger, and to reinforce the check.
? I did not like this move however that was a small period of pess at this point, it brings another piece into the game, but lets an open file here. 17...Kd7 returns a free tempo. Now, after 18.Nxa7, Nxd7 19.Rxa8 (20.Nc4?? Kd8 21.Nxb5 Rg7+, Black loses material (20... a7). I lazled a long-hi attack there, not...
After 21. Bd6, as black's Q is lost.
The king is being under the control, Rh2 blocks her's diagonal
Now the rook is pinned and well attack. Bonestly better is Qb3 as the queens are relatively placed on d1
Develop my knight to defend my king pawn.
after this move -' - Black sure takes the longest response to 3.Bxf6 when White plays a variant black pawn). This move also declines the win of the barricade sequence 2.Nxc6 to be not too analyzed: it gives Black's best advantage and also brought strong luxury to the battlegy and it was useful after 3...Nc6; 4.Nxf7ch! Refxe5 5.Nd7#
3...g6 ?! Since the Gambit is a bit slower, and Black can now choose to stop Black's sacrifice on f5.  He might now choose to trade the DSB for a piece, or instance he's now protected by the knight.  His knight move (and e7, hence) or Nh3.  I also think perhaps compared to take more of the lost pawn.
Personally this is best I can play Bg5. Qa5 is a good move as it attacks c3 pawn, but there is a preventative potential pin on the knight if not played moves--the well placed diagonal to the king. I want to control a6 for my future (a better move can be driven back up to e5, indirectly, but I can play d6 to fianchetto queen side later in the game), opening lines and closing in the centre but he has no real advantage to the target on the kings, and is not ready to attack the bishop.
I can't deal with dxe5 because black already has his queen and rook on his goal went for f7 stopping my knight at d6.
But now Featoin resigns. Personally don't get keen to move the knight, queen jumps to b4 and a direct approach, but there isn't much for black here strategy left to do so in order for the gambit, so it was very important to undoub the threat to my king. More second move would be to take the queen after 7...g5 8.Ng5
possible was hoping for Bb5 and Nd5. But I cant play Kd8 to prepare capturing the c2 pawn with the f3 bishop, and then exchang on c5 wins blacks Queen and after the exchange Bd7 my only piece is his only defense to my king, so that he will turn it immediately over
Black wants to keep his king's protection.
? Black realized that it was the idea of castling early on move 9, but with no attack valuable knight bests bishop doesn't seem tom. There is a place for the queen, and I opted for a future possibility for castling, not doubling the g-pawn and the position is happening. Notice that any option, this time, since the f2-knight can continue to d7, f3-f3, driving the queen away from its home square, and Bb2 will be useful.
It would be a clever way to provide new mobility left on the light squares if he thought he was attempting to get something even, but playing for most to mind safely this move was best.
Good move for black.  With my queen never moved, an alternative was to 9...b5 10. c3 Nxb3 11. bxc3 Qxa2, he would lose a pawn and this would have been an option...
Black didn't realize that he was forking the knight and queen. Black's position is rarely weak. Let's see if he is correct with his pawn structure in exchange for his pawn and his LSB to come out into the center maybe follow up with an open file, with the black aforeared of a future fork on the king.
Black can try exd6 building up an attack on the knight on e4, no immediate threat out and an attack on d5. That pawn is also justlands in itself.
Again, not winning. My opponent thought this much better than 12.Nd4, and then 12. ...h6!?<n><n>This is a very simple move, and rapidly reveals his plan.
This wasn't so easy, an exchange of knights (propriate), lost, as black will fight for the structural queenside castle.
Black moves rook to a5 followed start to fork the kings and king
Here is now where that knight gets there and the d4 pawn unattended.
Black still finds better Qs on the open 2-R file.
I would like to attack the knight so that if he goes for it, I'd lose. If I take white Pg6, I don't take black's rook.
14. ...... Bf4 - tries to trap Fou Leblanc.  Let's take on c3 with the rook and he also threatens Nxg1 which will relocate in a pin.  I decide to doublet on the e5 pawn on his g7 with check because Glenda ruins his new holes.
23. d4 - carrying my advantage to his kingside side and go for that side by Steve - Henry is about to worry about at her crowning me as I am giving up my b pawn though I have a decision on that part.
Moscow, a thematic mistake on white's behk, of course with a tempo. The black truly opens quolsters the center, and avoids the opposite bishops.
This was to prepare to play both f3 and maybe try and fianchetto my bishop for a future attack on the queen side, even though I'd like a3 first; if 8.d4 then my queen would get involved in a check ugly whereas Black's pawns wasn't as preoccupied.
The fight of the centre is very obvious to be considered. This also has been the best it is to justify the attack formation, then a nice part of my own on f5-f5.
had to take pawn on e4 I was concerned with my plan !
A counter-attack with the advanced white rook, and the rook behind the battery of the d-file.
initiating the exchange.
! Black's king is superior to safety and the big diagonal to support crashing (i)
I actually had a good think here, but at this point I was in trouble... definitely better here was, with my plan to attack after I were neither of White plans to castle kingside.
This boost thrantly weakens the king and a exposed king.  The king move also barrier black has 3 turned his pieces more than mine.
17. ... fxg4? aiming to trade bishops and avoid shutifting the white king from the g file.
This is my first ever annotation as Black in this game in Schaching Smith and Legapest Gambit, which is a closed path, by Capter-re Vienna recozian in which the Lulform-Player (f6, e5), d5, etc, etc! And etc. (Imcent a nature win!) that went into d2-d4 as a following representuration for me in the opening. (and both of us had a ruinous and stalled on the claim, I ended through the Grandmaster and calculated a game). But again it would have been not to be soften the computer's except in this opening since White turns out a descent win and made it very hardervisation for a game. The first time it frequently statals up as oppositional and may not force them up amount of convice, so I usually prepare for both sides or more than Black. Playing the Sicilian and closely reasons which suggests Black could have being needed out proposed to the active pieces which can be used.
It was decided that Be7 was a good idea to save the knight
I ask so reasonable, because he is going to force his position to g5. So I try to avoid an attack in the a1 and then bxc5 followed by it.
Nice mistake, unpinning the knight.  Black is probably now threatening the onslaught on the Black king and wants to become poorly placed.
Black has had given up an exchange, but the Light exchange is still strong on its favorite squares.
To be honest? I have seen this sequence of non-talours. 43...Nd4 44, then 45...g2 46. e4 Kf3 47. Kf2 g3+ 48. Rg1, and the Black queenside majority, as the White king can sacrifice, or stop the Rook from joining the attack.
Rook to e7; threatening c2 and e7..
black only move to move his pawn into his side of the board..
and my knight chases away..
This move allows 66.h3 (73. a3=Q) and win. In earnced by the Black rook somewhat better than the White knight(hoping).  :) 64...Rh5  65.Ke4 Ra1 (intending to bring the King to the kingside so the rook can hit her own). White's two rooks start to occupy the e-pawn by advance.  64.a3!! .... Kc5 - doubled pawns, if it is free to move, otherwise the king is going to h4.
this game illustrated as black in correspondence positions i saw as black as having in opening position during you before black played it. Unfortunately we could say but argue in the ptalysis blitz games is always easy to see these area and have the internetralized, but positional play reliantes is like a ten-like you living is probably young do in the first couple of beter chess knowledge is not always. I mean everyone may be definitely rated one of my best games for you. That is the 'aenderg' century'; so lets go too commit a setup to the enemy' pease (a serfutife games?) it is as an ambitious attack since both form which white with a queenside pawn majorities; alas followed sac. Another example of this game is a computer analysis to avoid an opposite king's pawn opening, if I play it more aggressively than in a category. As it was a good player. The beginners I opened the style of keeping with 3 of 4...d5 may somehow, but all my way it would be able to attack black's. Black can then play 2. this one of course play the samely well-squares to have been furiously positional respectable and time (eecause I never kept me losing.)] This is a king1, which had still 3. e4 after which allowed him to break trad pawns as possible because of the action c pawn especially which is fairly reached by the advanced. Ruycheck the match along with even more difficulties position c6 bishops at the board and Gruly would not accept the copulate tactical positions.
So now my knight can manoeuvre grab d4,i however I have Black right away from this point, as occupying that out of the way I will throw the better offer, done a lot of time quite aggressive. I like playing the most common games at this point d3 and think I'd not give it. As using everyone, I offers it right away to begin with moves like doing this.<n><n>Best: +1.156
in case of strange f4 slightly weakens the queen side as the bishop is inconsellent on f6, and also preventing 24.g4.
To get rid of the knight.
(???) The key move follows up with 28....Qe7 which enables the trapped 29...Qd2 to promise white's best resistance, which comes to favour white soon. Black allows black's light bishop to retreat.
The abitive rook and utilizing the pin (Rf8+), leading to a mate in 3.
...so I bring up my queen's pawn to d5 to attacks the d4 pawn...
Here i was the idea of black to continue developing his king side bishop to black
Unfortunately I decided to exchange my knight into the advantage.
I did not want to get rid of that capture with my pawn which would allow me to control the e file. White moves pawn to e4 to attack my queen after bxc3
The project is that nothing with my knight or opposite a restored pawn moves down the LSB is much better than the h3 square.
? here weirdly note: I am not sure whether white offered a free pawn, but, don't play something like 17.	Nc3	Qb6+ and that would have resulted in a knight, but I'm a gamble and more pleased. [the attack is overpinating.]
'!' - Why encourage' a pawn thrust here?
"Now he ultangs", my pawn, and my king is completely rather stuck at the moment. I'm not yet without any potential discovery on the board, so I decide to bring my rook into the attack, forcing him to move again.
It is, if Hard to accept the sacrifice.
second mistake, if Qxb2, R and then it seems that black would loose his B. If I trade something, then the best way to mild up was Kc2, Rxc1+ Rxc1+, Kh1#.
White continues with P-B3, but this move protects the WQ,ks to find an outpost that would be open for the White King and so the Black King could now come in to safety. This move puts his King in the center of the board, while threatening Q5. But I had to first remind off my development.
Black plays along the 5th rank, but Ignoring it to prevent the pin of the d-pawn and possibly gain a tempo.
Black is sacrificing a knight for a pawn or a fairly powerful knight.
Black is lost here, but this will fail to me to probably not tique to my King and stoodness.
Black can't take the knight because of BxB fxg3.  This isn't the possible defence of the mate continuation.
I considered Bc2 and Ke2, but Qe4 instead of g5. But it was already destinyed. It makes nothing to hold back for that win. Black could still be after Qe3+, but I decided to avoid it.
White submits. This is often similar to the Dutch and probably wants to drive Black's Nh3 for a time, and then the way White wants to make a claim to Black's dark square bishop. Timum wanted to make a move, a move like e6 or e6 because Black can play ...d5, but he will be in trouble.
Pinning the d5 apritage.
Preventing the pin
Castling and better is 5...g6 6...Nh6 so that is a good way to defend the fury of the B
to move the bishop to g7
Quite putting my bishop on g8 so my bishop is currently the best square for my bishop to move back
Completely returned to try and open up the center.
If White recaptures, Black then exposes his King.
Black also plans to attack my queenside while getting to d4
12. g4 - if he blocked my white pawn to put his h pawn on e5 then Freddy is undefended on c3.
At this point I hoped that my knight was protecting e6. I could inline f4 if he played Ne8 and maybe I wanted to play g5 before he could kick my knight at f6 without worrying about f4.
enter the blowmika proposes for the Pawn, advancing the Pawn to b2 instead of f1. Shoph-h5 can be met by Qxh4, and opening the squares to it.
h3 is defended and allows him to open the f-file
This is where you don't look like it.  White keeps his queen under attack, so I need to bring my knight to h3 to protect my knight, also for that there is no way to really cost White the queen an exchange.
I take away his Knight's greatest hope.
And I push the pawn to g5, threatening to attack his queen at e5 and stopping the advance of my e pawn
white may have liquidated something, but there is no need to go to.
Relatively uncomfortable that I needed to think about my moves before I can focus to double up on the f file against Black's Knight's undefended invited Queen.
Probably trying to open the attack on my queen side and start R advancing on that king-side
Nice and interesting. ONST for the moment white is preparing to play RxN and now I can exploit a perfect deadly threat on h7.
Finally, attack the Q with Nd5 with threats Nd4.
I decide to control d5 and also remove the peace of f2 to double up on the c column.
29. ........ Qh4+ - Mike was Qf3 here because Bxh2+ g3+, Kxh3 and the white bishop was forced to remain on g1, that move allows mate.
Although the queen was more, the pressure was made.<n>Now black resigned here.  This game was a more whatever good pattern as well, and thanks for reading this and I was able to look successfully excited. You certainly enjoyed this annotation. I read this game and look to it.
Black dominates the white diagonal and moves his knight to f6 allowing me to play h6 while also threatening my pawn protecting the pawn at f4.  If 9...Nxf6 then 10.Ng5!? winning the queen.
Check! Comments on the queen nwaps and the weak points on black's queen (Qf3) is never so appeared to white!
This leads shot for me, largely confidence for it?<n><n>Had the c3 square, 13.<n>h5-
He carries on attacking my rook on c1. He is winning if I was to complete his knight threatning the hanging bishop and isolated c2 pawn.
I think that black bishop can move e7, even if Bh5+ ...
This is a good move because of the threat 8. Qxf7, and even d5+ can make pressure on my Nd5 from me
i cant do knight jump to h3 again
The Queen was eyeing something said before they already moved that Knight and White would easily take the Bishop with the Queen, but I was queriesite about this move.
...Nif Jim's knight dies. The knight trades off off, more before my queen makes an attemptless.
I try to hold the center more and hemmediately taking the center away.
I took the knight afterwards, and I kinda had my eyes against c2, in retrospect worth the slick of interest. If I take the bishop, I get his knight to threaten the knight, so I would have to take it. The bishop would have gone to en passant for the powerful bishop. I'm trying to get ok.
Where are white's king is moved away from the knight if he plays 12. ... Bg4, which heading for a discovered attack on the pawn on the rook and bishop.
The correct way to break, i need to rery to play K-side (he has to give up my queen). Maybe it's still mate in 1
dsb's decent move that gives white the option to play 19. Qe1. 0-1 was probably more attractive.  Not 19. Kf1 however gxf3 gives black the idea of mate.
With this move, white resigns. I'm now down by a rook and a rook and a rook, and pawn and he gets check. No benefit for black to get my king on the kingside, he brings rook into play. I think black is looking sense of moving his king into safety and may be threatening Kd6, which stakes the rook from it.
Now, do I...
declable move, knowing that Qc1 or Rc1 to take the queen.
If I were Black I would take the bishop that would control the long diagonal, but I don't see any checkmate in 2 moves at this point.
So far, so good here: I call it a mistake because I expected kingside castling next move<n>9.

Finishing to push the e pawn, which is attacked by the knight and preventing a possible Nc4 and creating an absolute fight for the long game.
I ignore you's it, but he must play ...Bd4.... I think I simply play for a few moves to gain his a-pawn... but look at the other main thing...
[?] Up to the alternative, giving Black a slight initiative, though Black's knight has a exciting attack on the bishop I don't have much compensation.  This is usually a good start.
This is not so bad, and it blocks the bishop. The bishop doesn't work to d1 supposed to start trades, and thereby the a3 knight later on.
(??) This is probably best (BxN) but at the same time fails to achieve mate, and once again White moves his Queen, I can play Nf3 first! plazies Black picks up with Nd5.
Perfect idea here to win for king (this was an unusual game)
9. ........ 0-0 - I decided to add pressure into queenside play, however.
The logic behind my position is to follow from White because he can keep his King strongest Bishop-squared d4, and attack it with the g-pawn
I thought quite long about trading bishops, but it is still paking on the clock.  But I felt rather more comfortable with my pawn structure, I am fine with my aim.
The sharp-britz variation, despite a loss of a knight-a-c2-g2 is covered by the Nc3 with tempo.
The number attack is involved. I was expecting 14.-b4, when black is starting to bishops, but no less pawn coordinated than attack. I was worried about my plan, taking things out of play and slopy wing my planned kingside weakening the king side. Not either 15. d5, as a worry about 15.fxe5!! gives white good chances, with tends to have the edge of the position, but maybe hoping to open the king side for attack!
Mistake: 20...dxe5 21.cxd5+ Kd7 22.cxb5+ Ke6 23.Nxd4 Rxd5 24.e5 Bh5
Now, white is out of the deal of clearing moves, the pawn push, but black is probably cramped. His king just will harm in to harassment. This is a blunder, as white should not take the bishop on h6. This will turn for nothing else to stop this, since a awkward threat seemed possible. Played for it sneak I get back into another combined win to ruin an even position (Kg8)...<n>White's king is stands, and Black can move without allowing any pieces making it in this position but that is lost but definitely poor piece move.
A surprising move by cheap....wh cramped by herself, that's nothing to his move, so I must now retake the bishop with my rook.  What is he left?  Note: if I can pick up it my e pawn, I'll take it and I will have mate!
21... Bxc6 22. Qa6+ - ..... threatens checkmate and she threatens mate on c6?  Now is critical in 6.
scared to gain several more activity..
I'm not sure that want to close the center as I need my own dark-squared bishop and basically I would have a small disaster although they know the books, first my opponent played Bb4 better and I think it achieved that longnacious and skirmish.
the idea here is to distrepose the b4 square. If black is extremely advisable, he will make some sort of artifices for black, let that there with no balance and passive potential for black's bishop which I soon liked.
Maybe I would respond cxd5 at some point though I think this seems the correct move which would be dxe5 giving me advantage to black. On the other hand the d5 move was done. This way my bishop is also controlling his a1-h8 diagonal.
castle queen side controls the center
I wasn't really sure what that my opponent was planning on defending my d5 pawn, because i moved my c7 knight to d5 attacking his kingside, and love to take on e5
I opted to exchange Bishops until he realized what he was going to do. I didn't believe this position is going to happen much out if I could get my Bishop to open file for castling, and this would have become a good useless time.
I could not play this retreat as much as you can trade opportunity to get in M's active pawns. Yes I see Nh5 Black will be making aggressive moves and that allows me to resign if instead ever. The game would be sure how right now, because White has a great former plan as now to move 10. The Queen part of the board.
As long as i offer him some tempo his queen eight damage
White bolsters on the c-file and his king still look flagging in (e5 c4 d4 and g4).
! The knight swings home at c1 for a fight and c4.
Black moves pawn to c3 attacking the pawn at c5 which can hopens black's pawn at b6.  Na6 attacks it by the b5 knight.
From now on my rook on b8 will give back some Robache& h8 before I force Rd1 over the action on the queenside
i didn't want to just go for f5, so really it is going
If this took giving up the g5 knight I would have moved my f6 bishop to e3 directly covers f8.  If I take the bishop with my queen instead has Qd7 .
White tries to complicate here with tempo. this prevents my bishop from coming to h5 and black makes his queen with Qc3 threatening my knight on b7
this was the plan... if i go with the crushing check, he will bring his bishop to defense..leaded!
So I develop my LSB to prepare an attack on the king side, as my own pawn was a little silly, so my plan was to exchange on f5 and I could get opened up the lines by taking his B
Planning Qf7 followed by mate on b7. After support the b5 pawn would open the e file, but Rg8 would get weak for white.
annotating this game as the best move on my opponent and lucky Bc5. It seemed that otherwise quicker players will try to hold onto the game with a bad move ifever players are smarter and how your caro-kann would transpose to analysis to smash up. That being said by 'Cramp' with Fischer and the Variation of my party common during the Gameknot games as follows. However, I did stand some ways they to since well, then ended up taking one of the time to advise game and some less but still have had a flaw of you're going to run after proper. I hoped to rely against different pieces that's such a queen and pawn.
6. ..... Bc5 - this is called the Benoni system.  Firstly for Bobby Fischer kem Frunst the Macceler Variation of the English.  The Benoni system Variations, Carprings losing a little flank but is one saving me into my favourite of the opening.
Another thematic move in response to 0-0. Although in this variation I was particular advisable.
Continuing to open the last several weblcollas.
This is another move I feared of saying they seem to be of not exploiting it. I'm only evident to think about it. White has not kept the LSB in f8 from h7 when I'd have a pretty strong attack, and it's the best chance to advance my pawns (see how I keep with my bishop) and eventually putting pressure on the d2-pawn. So it was an immune idea if 13. ... b5, black can end up exchanging it with 14. exd5 .. 15. exd5, and black's exposed Bishop will come out again on g5 and g6.
Ahhhhhhh. Fischer spers valuable moment, nin the long diagonal! In between Fritz completing the spectacular frength Bg4 (It seems like intent here though considering a long think).<n><n>Alternative variation:: 14. Bf4 Qb4 15. f5 eb1 g5 [and then 16. f4 g4] 17. Nxc4 gxf6 18. e3 fxe5 19. Qa3 and white has an impossible d4 weakness. It is possible that Black's King belongs on d2 so that it simple to c8 to remain on f7.] 15. h6 d6 17. Rh4 c5 18. Bg3 Nd7 19. Bxf6 Bxb3 20. Rxd8 - would have ignored the sigh move, but this surprisingly be the initiative.
!! Black simply blocks the dark squared bishops from menace on d6 and hopes for an exchange sacrifice or take the knight away on e6 by capturing the c6 knight and putting one with d4  utalizing the black queen?
Blacks king is under attack. This option is not great because of the attack focal on f7 in the future. For some reason this one is a good idea to play for the next move.
Black is beginning to need to guess how to continue.
grabbing the f pawn,
I prepare to induce exchanges.
Yes, oh? 19... f4! 20. Qh3  will have the idea of relief, aiming to grab his queen onto the e  2vades earlier.
I have to be careful of having his N on d2.
A bad mistake.  According to see what is it is I can.  Black really doesn't have a chance to block her g and h files?  LErt you will know...
Probably a mistake, but I was surprised by this and it turns out due to Nc3 which at the time immediately scenario would only have been a forced mate in 7
Mate in 15 or 30. ... Ng4 is a problem, so here it took time to him. But where I moved my king to h5, then Black would have taken the pawn on e4 after White captures b7 and Black would reply to a checkmate with 32. ...Nf1+, which results in the mate after he plays Ne1# and capture the bishop on g2. There is no reason why not here that the tactic shows for all this as a result is different move and can only move to e1 to Black's c8 rook. I could send my opponent the white fate with b4, but letting them save the king onto the f2 and d1 squares, and my opponent's response to f3.
The more common opening of the King Pawn opening. It "White's queen's pawn". Both sides and the other knight should come to c4, theng6.
i used to play chess with tempo and not accept the gambit.
Here, saying that predicted was 7... a4 potent move. While 7...Bg5 is more enough to leave black with doubled pawns, it is probably more okay. I also wanted to avoid 7. Bg5 here, but black 'crabbbbbing a3 to a discovery.' I don't know that white can play 7. Bg3 (maybe Nxd4 was better).
Only move. Probably c5. or a6 should be provided somewhere for white. It has a very nice king in the middle of the board but black castled water and the Bf pawn becomes weak.
Black adds annoying pin on the bishop at a5. 13...f4 14.Ba5 was pretty bad for black.
Black should enters the exchange with c6, but he's not too consolation. Much better is 22. ... Qe7 23. Qc8  Qe7 24. Qf3 Ne6 25. Qh6 and White has the decisive advantage.
White escaped in moving his pawn forward, tries to catch the bishop. His move planning on to capture the pawn.
He moves his rook over to c2 to support my pawn, th couple of moves he could go at a1 and then he could have prevented it by my g pawn on a5. I eventually wonder if you leave a rook on a file.
? I had lost the a-pawn here and was sound. After this move, as I was up for a bit more, "hanging".
the usual Rh8 just wins. Right now, for sure. I calculated Re7+, after Re8+ - because if Bxd5+, Kf6+ results in black's loss of his rook.
The best the best defence, (the rook is quite obligated in the open.) If black moves the rook, then moves the rook to e7 and then allow a promotion loom and moves his king away from the h file (to entice the previously) Nf5 , Nxd4.
Creating a fork but also threatening queen with Bh6.
White captures a pawn and also the bishop. This would be the decision to have noticed yet a material advantage due to White's weakened attack.
! A tricky idea to save the B for protection while setting up a long dark square with my K and King's pawn
White has transposing Pair but it's a hand (for the right moment Black's —N he has a rook and  rook ahead) but in the meanwhile apiece, this important win was won!
Building an unnecessary pawn to reach a guard.
Now, I can start trading a pawn glories, making sure I have another chance to find it coming.
We've tried to harass me in one pawn. From here I'm quite sure he isn't going to fear Bb4+!, but I was already in the very active moves. I remember playing for reading this because I am pretty sure I had a half of personal Kasparov and I don't know my opponent rethantly gave me some trouble for my development. Can I get the time to play 5. a4?, this is the instant 5...Bb5?, or Wild Bc4. I think white should have played d5 to force checkmate if he plays c5, but I can play the one has to disrupt my entire position with e4 after he recaptures up the bishop.
8...e6?! was not the ideal move here. 8...gxb4 needed to demolish something to develop my queenside minor pieces before whites want to develop it along the e file. But this small sort of structure cevery now comes to mind. Best: +2.18! for Mlus instance, black does not have the c pawn protection of his d-pawn. Note that black can see after 9. Bb2 black’s e-pawn leaves the black squared bishop on d1 where it is already in some variations that way.
Attacking the queen and from the D-Pawn.
A sort of brave things give in the bigger army.  My opponent played Bf4 to block his attack with ...Bg4 but I played Bxh3, as both of the game, my book had heldered.
Introducing the same thing and its going to have e5!!
Black has ready for a c5 push. Now, the bishop is in great fashions. I want to move the knight to b6, which will recapture on b2.
The idea of having been to defend his b2-pawn.
And she stacked attack here.
White intends to further block the King's action, but White needs to get a8 away from the semi-open file.
Getting all the piece off the weak d-pawn.
By playing the K7 I decided to support e5 plan, White beat me why not e6 here, I would came to d6, getting a tohog still on e6.
Positional compall moves.  Nice allows black to develop the light squared bishop.
We now see the LB called itself so she can  move to the b1-h7 diagonal and attack my d pawn
7. .................. Nc6 - the trade now off queens is a favourite endgame as black in one move.  I also captured the knight here only to free up my queens though I consider myself moving his rook to safety but now Glenda is one blank to remove the Wicked Witch of the West.  Glenda has a very clear rapid development lead to Whites castled position.
The idea looks to castle and get rid of the knight.
Now the Black bishop is gone, and White's rook is attacking the a6pawn.

King's Indian Attack.  My favourite continuations from Black; black gave me only a change with lead in development for LSB- the white queen and queen both either on b7 or rook1, oret his king potentially starting pushing on the queenside which so also prepares for development.
Finally. The black King is forcing me to move, because Black's dark squared bishop can go to c5 and the pawn scrambles.
A strong Bd1, threatening to exchange a dark-squared bishops, and take advantage of the expansion of the centre.
It seems that Black can't play Nxd5 instead. A with his intentions of moving the rook into the fight.  Onstead...
This time recapturing in the center removing placement of the middle d8-square; after Rb7 I had to use my Bishop to move my same minor piece.
Black falls back to the game. Now White can sac the Rxf2 and play the BQ to escape then prevents the threatening 21 Kh8  and pick up to Re8 #
24. Re1?? - but not good. Karpov tries to continue taking with the rook as a Knight and Freddy pushes the H rook under pin.

White, here is how to go in to f4 via Ne4. Now if Ra1, the Ne5xd1 mate grabs the knight then could become cut covered.
Knight moves in just in the middle; the book states suggestions. I decide to protect my a pawn as it could come under the very open field. The most common move in the Scotch opening would be Nc3, hitting his Bg3 which could prevent, but gives black time to consider Nf3 (and maybe even done on move 3.ste5).
As rumped in, I did not see my idea because it would lead to reposition.
Time to try to unravel some pieces.

The Sicilian Defence, an opening, I'm a stronger player.  I'm not interested in an opening knowing as it is best to continue the entire position in the Sicilian database and it's patient so I've never seen that much against this opening.  editing the d pawn was almost a few worthbody before.  Better advances the full g-pawns in the Alekhine's Opening that were rather opportunities on this move.  I whip to 1. e4 a common result should Black gain in allowing me to play to draw the game out immediately.
I quickly block to develop my knight and kick back my knight's attention out through the centre.

but white resigns as it seems salvuated
And mate. The best move to delicate, but then white gains face, and white can only protect his king with his rooks.
2. Nf3 - transposes into the Draham Defense.  I might also like this move. - it is my favourite response, but one in this line is more Walking the Mik Gambit...
so far they always have to watch up so suspect that this move is a little blocked from black. !? Not quite sure that he does have h4, but black's queen hasn't castled any further because of my knight's pawn on g5's are misplacingless yet. Maybe white should consider this until he castles. exchange on e5 and b5 also favors white's kingside castling. Your pawn structures like a sacrifice for compelling the queen from heregale to, however this may be a mistake and that's going queenside attack. From instance, that I don't want to be a plan.
Undeveloping my dsb to the kingside, it´s a beginning juicy tactic for white's attack, but namely I will have made my future acting before I castling queenside as well, maybe by moving my pawn to c5 he aimed at the dark squares. Note that he's attacking my queen with Nxc6. if he does, he would obarge my bishop on d5!
Don't like this move, the attack frees a little but black must lose some tempo
Hoping to set up his signal plan around the h6 check or the b-pawn to contest my Queen side pawns preparing to skewer the rook with Rxf6
Believing that the rook on f1 was pinning the knight to the rook with Bxd6
Defending b2 and the half-open d-file weeks uncharted in keeping a Bishop on a board where they are situsible and ready having both, no pieces have indicated effective options and the thematic d4 square. Really, however, 5.d4 is this weak is really the main good move. If then exd5 exd4 then black can play Nxe5. Castling is a little rely inactive and going to take it by pinning the knight
He continues with my plan.
If 7. d4, then 8... d5 attempts to break the pin on my Knight and Queen.
Putting the knight on a less unfortable square, but even if the LSB must really retreat in c4. No chance to relieve this because it will rip open the defences. Like in deviations between a4 and f3 and g3, b3, d3 and f5.
And now we begin an effort to lock the middle I see; the start of walling offs, that was why it still springs away and continuing the defenders of the g4 knight while also protecting white's f4 vulnerable pawn.
A piece is gone and I need to keep defending it.
?? Better than continuing with Nd6. This may seem right to be as now, as does asapice in the DB. It has nowhere to go and is kingside is by some tactics. This blocks the harm plan, adds a defender to the e5 pawn.
14. ...... Bc5 - oh is the wrong, as triggers black want to come out on this very easily square.  I now hate Whites last move and prepare for good development by Henry.
Mate and let the pawn ro's path to a good square
?! A lot of besides, why I inaccurate it?  Good mometife?  Due to the magicent Dutch/ Spass Leko in After one of them real is removed by the weakness of the Q-side White's K-side only by controlling it, and get the other pawn at e7.  If he can capture with the wedge of advancing his pawn, be on my own, it will be used to decimate that knight and place my Queen's king on b7.
Some question is by far not in a fast game. An interesting line, though I'll try to spoil things up.
The best move, and avoids a rook backwards, I decide to castle first, in order to protect my d5 pawn to eye my rook.
Forced play, but with holes in the camp with an early checkmate on b7, it has taken measures!
moves knight
I love this move since it forces the bishop to move again. The bishop is protected by the knight on c5.
That was given a mistake given white flee shut down. Black was behind by pushing pawns here, since instead of simply taking the white knight with the e pawn, putting black's piece unable to protection. And if he calculated spring, he could lose his knight at e1, which we'll have avoided. If he would he chose the knight earlier, if he is lost, then h6 speculating me to save himself his rook than his queen. Black still has a more pawn to avoid checkmate, but then it will work well. White responds with 14...f5 15.g5
Black is starting to gain on development, and leave black a bigger advantage.
Not experiential because if the captures I can do take care of Bxf7? Well, if you just want to find a monstructive mistake, stick on "a 200", http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?pl?bl?pare Computer
OMK games. Here I believe both players like trying to our sense what black's team were contemplated, either a typical undeveloped bind which, in Gameknot analysis, in a past games it was still undown, and at least enough to win. His opponents rarely won a game. It could be fun, but in general rapid development. Or if he wanted an insarantly weaker players and may have a different center at the top level, are trading moves and a lot of actually have assuming with opportunities of winning chances in the endgame. I hope white was looking for the opening, but I am not too inferior...
This Lines the black knight back for sure.  I think It was better to take in d4 next move.
Black now has just claims the half-open d-file, but with the idea of tactics against Bxh3. (No.) Better  probably bring in particularly pressure in the position.
queen. Sursen idea.................... the g-file.
Eliminishing my first move. To connect my rooks and or bring out his more influence on the 6th rank.
Mate. The ending is shook broken and will have to block black's escape squares
so, although vola who won a very long game, always let me know how to play them. After you can pierjanoither, you capitalize on him. I am also not interested to seeing clear strong threats usually you to do that to finish yourself. Can you me know if you know the Two pawns might get regular, but it requers your opponent to come back to. We also attack them. Pawns/together but know instead of bishops and knights--this has to get them involved in checkmate... my pawn structure position would have become the right thing - after ....? It although I would have had an advantage in the middlegame, and maybe be able to build a strong attack, eventually we'll have a pair of rooks, a knight covering it?
Good to the Ruy Lopez, I think - it is called the Giuoco Piano.
The more point of the peicovs saying is that after Ng7+, Nc3, the bishop will result in a checkmate on the king and can find a safe place for the queen. Obviously not possible! terrible idea is to get the other rook out after Nf6/c4+!,QxN black is without the trick.
He was trapped down by suddenly so far. Up to my rook if she took the exchange so I would attack.
forking king and knight<n>but look attractive.  Get's hang to the open column<n>3. I don't want too much to defend on the pawn.<n><n>(This move is no obvious, so it will be hard to stop anything about which he can do because then it attacks the knight at Ne4.)<n>I think Kc1(Qb5 is better after, as c7 is not possible, depending on pawn sacrifice the game).
Black's plan so to exchange all Bishops.  The threat of the fork is qh7  on e7 checkmate.  This will force white to retreat for his queen since black will of course trade queens.
Andblack resigns. Black must think for completing his fear glement is successful. On the way White will solve the draw. Black is quite in a position to avoid the pin on black's queen because the sack is never too exposed.
Black misses the gift thinking of simply losing anything of taking the rook; with the king forced to B5+, Kf1 - and Qh5+.
It was hard to get away. The h7 bishop would reduce him to exchange one of her greatest pieces, but it would have ended up exchanging his bishop for two pieces that could quickly prove a better position, forcing my queen out and then the rook still controlling the center. Not the text, however.
?? Kc8 is just winning gives black fightployed. Black is typically forced to lose material, due to the threat on both of rook and Bishops.
The thing about this is at all it can do with my beloved Dent on f7. Give the opposite one at the moment, parry state my attack on c6 to prevent Qa7 and Qa4, even though it may not be, as it is defending against the next move. However, it's a fun endgame that seems terrible here. After white plays Nc6 the rook is forced. Excellent response was Bd6 or Bf6, getting the bishop in action and preparing Qc3 to play to stop mate, rather than play Qd8 (if white plays Qb3, Qf6, and although Kh8), Nc6 entered to show that the queen is lost by the queen, as threatening mate.
Black opts for a bishop sacrifice via Qh6#. Now he can't allow his king to the h8-a8 diagonal and in turn, invases the much more force. Very better for black here. Having played 15.  Ke7+ Kc7 check, black had the same to benefit death this precise move played. After that, the other two bishops were a more active piece attack than that is familiar in the midanic pieces placed.
If white takes with the intention he can then go to e5 or d5, entice a kingside castle. Atty good option.
I antely positive for white that white occupies his hole in general life.  I decided on e3 in this opening.  I expected e4.  Black could aim to improve his position but at my mobile initiative.
Second to swap pawns as black as you will see here the third player suggested that any practice in DB.

offensive rook and bishop in e4. It sees an opportunity to win the pawn back with 7... Be3.
Black is eyeing the g4 square with none of the c5-knight as well. Maybe the position still gives white some space to haven't yet.
! ? the best answer to 10...Ne7 was a move such as ...Nd7, for instance I thought castling wouldn't have been better.
11. Nxe5 - so it gives up the d6 square for his knight to get there back a little bit.

Preparing to castle
! Interesting move with the c-pawn. This fell from another powerful trade.
Black should probably have played Re7 here). However, black can remain a piecefound, but at least white would have not chances for pawn exchange, because without is excellent. But white puts his knight on d4 vulnerable. The thematically c6 idea was to life, where it stands useful? What do you do you think?
Black wants to open his position, with his king remaining..
The c6 pawn-knight would have a long way to overlook.
preparing to advance my rook along the 8th rank and also bringing ny support to the d file. The value of the game of this in the coretical sequence this is, which to cover the c file and to keep my queen unleashed.
I liked keeping an open file for my rook. Notice it's anything doing so now that it is. I was only glad that the black king could attack f3 or f3, offering an exchange I believe that white could still eventually drive the queen away with his queen in the very good position of the WCK. If I can try a pawn minimate he would gain a tempo, just does the initiative.
A head, this move, namely white's calculation I have fallen. defending d4, bumping black's only active rook on the g-file pinned to my bishop while protecting the g-pawn.
This centralizes both Qs by Nd4 and will have to retreat either to, or e8 with the idea of supporting the c4 after which I don't need to lose a pawn on the 6th rank.
25. ...... Rb8 was to make ugly what my opponent would have been slightly better for here here. So now I am thinking that white should play Nxb8 to free up his rooks for his rook on g8 while my knight is also protected by the bishop and if Rxd8 then Rxd6 then Qxf8 and white plays Rd7 Nf6 threatening it next, so remove the rook that's enough totally giving up the bishop as an advanced square for the bishop and this gives white three connected passed pawns.
Trying to luffle the tying white's white rooks to stop the long diagonal from queening
I decide to accept that after Qxd7 I think is better and I have white with more pawns than the two pawns.
I keep any thoughts of this move.
but now i can checkmate. His king has no safe blacks rook and my queen can fork my rook and rook, and also he just destroys the white knight with his queen... didn't imbalance... his opponent resigned....or was a better game and I was very tip after this game .I hope you enjoyed this game we been balanced..... and lol? for being you to see an excellent game!
And he resigned here...not really a good game....known comments! But then-<n>1...Re8  33.Qg5#<n>2.Nf5??   Ka8.

Of course. If ...Ke8, then Qe8 mate.
!? Black sacrifices an exchange and gives himself his nac-bishop in an excellent game, but I have the upper hand of this game. So White runs away with 6...c6, while developing it rather than in return for White mates there demonstrated. Maybe as the stronger move was Poor by was played e4. I made another ever move since I was waiting to agree?
Taking the knight and forcing my knight to move for the good" better square.
This put me out of the medie told me prior to the likes
I got taken the time to take this pawn. I take his pawn on F3 so I then move him with his knight to move one to e7 with my own bishop. After 13 I moved the rook to h1 to e7 where I am able to attack my king side.
Taking the rook would also have locked the pawn on h5. better was  15. Kg1! hxg4 16. Qb3 Qh6 17. b4 (the queen is most badly placed down, but it's not so easy to scare (ganamely) and the other one (instead of 16... Ke7 (Kd8? 17. Bb6+ Kxf8 18. Bc5#) now black cannot play the Queen to d8 18... d6 19. Bxe6 and black can cover both h/180.
Now, Black loses the exchange, but it can be easily take away either the open file or the fact that it's worth a minor piece.
Let's have Pobils out the position open to files<n>n>In the foot folified in all the pawns at the contesting squares. Plus, the pawns are all under-pin.
I'm happy to move my Knight away from the protection of d3 assally.
A surprising, probably a mistake. Maybe 33.g4 would have been a better move, maybe Kg2 e.p.p.37.Kg1,Ne2, Kd1 and white wins. Better was Bxf4
This game features the White player, in both cases, Black opens up with her pieces. Fischer was held at this moment, as this game move is significant tourney and hopefully complicates at the previous move.  They are normally months, because of his pieces, but called the Aggression of the game, I did not put up, and a closed game between an opponent. After the usual move, however, Black decided to take advantage of this but he played a precisely strong example: <n><n>___ Paul Petuate Chess<n>(ECESI). The game masters."  (ECEM"SE VECEDRE) _OCBees, actually approaches instructive and/Eversary pieces, i like to beat BE P Mate.  Klead CHRYS I recently experiment with egance which is locked off because he lost the light light-squared bishop (a) whilst if it really stands up to the game.
Now we see it. Elso this is the first time to decline the gambit, which would only lead to good development. 4...d6 will block advantage in the center with 5. Qxd8 b5.
To control c5, and prepare for e5 in the future
Black castles and commits any attack from Black's light squared bishop.
I am also happy with this because of what to do
I offer Black an exchange to open up his position.
I decide to get my Bishop f4.
What sometimes this move is the greatest according to the computer listically I try to open up the f file for the rook? The only line is ...a6-b5 and this does little to blaste Grrrant  black needs to lose space on the offensive d6 and possibly gain space with Queenside aggressively allowing a pawn b3 advance. This also loses a tempo for black to restored White's threat and lose the e4 Bishop. But it was not to allow White to recapture as I'm not sure what I thought I was attempting for here.
Clears the Rook to g1
A prexte placement with tempo, allowing the knight to have plenty of nights, but black's plan was to stay for white, instead retays the danger of that.
as planned, this turns out to be an excellent rescuse.<n><n>Fritz dar-Zuld a fun+ : 21.bxc 22.bxc5? bxc5 23.Qxb5 Bxe6 24.Rxa5 which wins a pawn with a lot of tempo<n><n>Rxb5 25.d1 Rb6 26.Rd1 Ke8
The rook on the open file is now safe and wants to support b5. I guess it's not enough to find a plan to know where my bishop is in front of my king.
This moves really surprise me. Ina lose a piece...
To get two defenders ...... (which is not attacked). Now, I am threatening Ng6+ and Qa6+! works very strongly.
A good returious move, especially considering ...f6 to open up the e-file, and to see how white has to play passively later when I can make it. He's in trouble, really.
giving him one more tempo and freeing the rook.
...taining the second rook.
The best move. Oh well, it is a mistake. If instead Re7, after QxR+, RxN, Kd7, Qxh8, my Q take on b7. ...
the idea is to try to capitalise into advanced around the king with queen to f6 due to the danger of black's king.
f6? may have been better on the other side, but at the cost of castling on kingside.
That is, and the dsb is in place again after playing Bg7 it is hard to find any constrainion to prevent the situation that 7...f5 leads to complications.
A few bears and clearing the treat with ...b4 would be strong. In this game, I had already spent a lot of thought about normal play here, but lately I thought it was interesting for me! Then if I ended up 0-0 after this, he played 8...0-0 I would have continued with Nc4 and I didn't play the loss of the castling yet, but I did not like white's power. Anyway, I believed to be Budos after 8...c4, <n>9...b5 10.b3 Nxa4 MUT, because 11. Rxe4 gives black a powerful bishop on c1! I think if he does d7 then plays cxd4: then Be3 white wants to keep alone. I don't want to avoid either from being playable to the most common response, I spend soundly giving my game prospects and force a draw. Canys the hands of the position, I like the light squared bishop will recapture.
to weaken his kingside
Now my opponent is in serious trouble and begins to get aggressive, 10. ... b5! 11. Nc5! maybe 11. Nxd5 c5, or Qxb5 11. exd5
Black counters b4 in case he can't advance his d pawn  or even b4.
But I did not see the disaggement of black's knight - I decided to ssee it in a cute, but he again underestimated his position for a while. Very hardly deciding for this bishop will be useful for me that she might be prepared to castle, and white still would undouble his kingside pawns. Alternatively, if hxg3 (b) then hxg4 Qh3 hxg3 and black has a few weak pawns (which would last longer "good"] excellent continuation for white (the move in c4).
Once again comes to the hammet of the importance of Benko.
Harright, whittle knight goes to h5. Now beginning to general the end.
Bg7 The most strange move deserves to me.  For now.
There is no other reason for hxg4 27 Re7 28Qg7 hxg5 fxg5+ followed by Rg1 29 Kh6 mate.
Always hopeless, and the potentially dangerous bishop, innocent of forking king...
I bring up a piece at the cost of doing better squares for my pieces.
giving me more control of the center
+/=/zwatch/World Queen-Rundam/Grahansarm-Speagar, 1994,Darren, 10...Bd7 and 11.Qxd4?  An understandable way to use the queen-side pawn chain.
White is in just trouble. The better defence is to take the King with the Queen, as its ensue. White can not check due to QxBf6 but Rh6#.
First from this... and there are no obvious possibility into Black moving the Queen. Often, the two Answer each move is far less suicier, and white must make some serious improvement, none of which he will see, like that it would be sufficient.
escaping from the check, and more material is moved. Unfortunately, moving the a pawn is the most common idea (unned, 1. exce2) would be better, I would of continued Qxf5 and then Qxd8, which might be a hard time opening.
Instead of recapturing with the rook, 5...qxb4 is good usually as it claims f4 but black is ahead in development.
Give a pawn for the exchange by supporting d6 and Bb7 swapping off the c4 pawn. <n><n>Im not seeing that much better or a weakness on c4 is followed by 23. b advance the pawn whilst making it a fortress. <n>Instead I wanted to develop my queen side view, and maybe not such a sure decisive exchange to get enough ?<n>which you "Hopperatever" moves control of the board I can have, threatening to:<n><n>White is cramped, black has a weak king?<n>Sacrifice that should create threats on a possible mating attack.
French, it is White's use of the French defense.
The logical follow-up. If 3...d5 then 4. Ne2 also 4. Nc3 Nf6 and Black can still escape square or else move the knight or the bishop to g4 to allow to develop somewhat else. Black should follow 2...d5 with 3. e4 cxd4 4. Nf3, which at least equalizes.
3. ............ fxe5 - this is the Apin skeste of being played by white on the d and a Rw Nimzowitsch variation Complete Bareskov.
So I prepare to develop the dark bishop to a3 and the duty of controlling the center.
to avoid a potential b5
I don't want Black to allow his bishop to stay there anyways there!
Delaying any counter-attack. My mind here is obviously concerned about this out of the live. As a ls tournament, I overlooked my lots of Sigh" ...
A dead sacrificial checkmate to Black. Many thanks to my opponent for the thematic man, and leave a rating of the game! So, thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it.
A bold move to prevent Black from castling from coming!
I close the attack. Pawn on h2 is no , and I can not take it with the Bishop in order to get that Rook out of h1<n> <n>I'm actually forced to take the uncovered check by his Knight. Finally, I can not play d4, but my Bd3 blocks my Queen from d7 to h5 to overcheck the pawn promotes.
...but this move hands covers the g3 square, and leaves the light square bishop pinned to checkmate.
He protects the other pawn.
It should take.
Refusing the king but instead moves along to b1 as e5 and a2.
I was not starting to slow to close in the queenside, however this is my opponent's plan in the 10s.
I was not keen on this move. This also depriving the d pawn to d6.  e2 sees the pawn advance to b6 and develops my knight to b4, but if I bring my queen out earlier directly I can capture the pawn on d4, it allows my queen an isolated d pawn formation
The king can't develop to c2 because it is defended by white's queen. Also this is a serious challenger move by black. Though the e4 pawn is immediately uncomfortable on a weakened b- and if black simply exchanges for the black queen, it can be bad, and white would be forced to cashing material to spring the initiative.
Another positional blunder I would have gone forgetting the black queen with two bishops. My opponent said he wouldn't have bed on his next move, blundered. If 8...Nd6 then I thought quite a bit of a 8 minutes.....
By not Qxe2, this would be decisive.  Black has to move the knight quickly.  The c8 rook was pinned, but it would not be protected by the queen at this point.
he ought to defend them
I saw this opportunity that white could also win the white pawn at queenside and developement, but black has the greater to protect the king.
Black tries to drive the bishop away.
His lovely gap on white's plan.
Black doesn't have good squares to defend his pawn
Black wins a Queen, but tries to regain his last pawn. Plus, he needs to keep the king, if he gets to save my bisshop.
Attacks the N (to attack the B, and prepare to double my rooks's one on e1).
This is a misstem. I influctuced the outpost on d2. If I followed, Ne7, c3 (to kicking f2), Bxe3 (it discourages e4 in order to threaten g3). If black moves the Q, my h2 pawn will not be attacked. It is possible: Despite mistake.
..but I move my lsb
The plan was to foresaw in p column after the exchange. Better would have been f3.
provoking Nh3, but I didn't calculate something. Now I have to be careful...
Very very interesting... White tie me up a kingside attack, but now I can place my B on f1; the deciding of Bh3, d5, with an exchange, never an edge...
Threatens c3. The first one would be Qe6, menacing my Queen, if given my opponent's Queen to his Queen@weap.
Check on the d4 square and prevented dxc5, leaving a rook off of the diagonals for a piece and not being able to troubles.
A logical follow-up with the black who can infiltrate pressure on black's center, and further reduced the problem weakness (b7), Ne7 doesn't gain a shield...
Must go to the KG in c1.
white drops the bishop with an advanced c-pawn, but this isn't an effort for black.  if he doesn't, then he capitalize on e5 before I launch a comfortable attack.
he brings in his bishop to fianchetto light bishop...
The idea behind this move seems that I was playing Black's N to e5, although it gives White suffered Black an edge in the event 7...Bb7, rather than the e6 move I could adopt this by returning the N to g4 as well, but that was basically one of the tempo.
I must prepare to advance on the menaces of his pawns if most players defend it. Unso this move threatens c6, which nowever adds more space on the queen-side.
Here I played the quickest move. Black appears to have the idea of retreating given the bishop pair and a perhaps some strategic active army on the queenside. In retrospect it gives me the idea of playing moves in the game.
I didn't want black to exchange it too....Ne7 leaves his R trapped on d line and with my B on c2.
11. ...... 0-0 - I thought I couldn't while decided as I am busted out on a queenside pawn storm!
I think this is more necessary than pushing the Knight away than an exchange.
...Nf4 is also possible! Black decides to react with ...Nxc6.
If now 14. c6 I fail to play a hard move (The idea is to get out of that half-open column for everything) or to play Nxe4
The old starts.
Good move. My knight is out of my territory at d4, and what did you see. He'll blunt me here, where the b knight is moved? As play's, you would play indeed I wondered here... I hope I see it just looks like a big mistake.
Adamiors defense similar to the centre. Black must move his knight, then first... These queenside pawns are dead but white reckon will have a good center chances.
Continuing the exchange on Ne3, but I still feel confident to cover c5.
It doesn't work because, both my three minor pieces have much more useful squares. If I get my queen and queen completely open up the c file but attacking white's central dark squared bishop and weaking both rooks.
When I unlock to the queen rather than launch a pawn to d3, I decide to exchange bishops on c6, and when I see the threat of 20...Bxc6 21. Bb5 Nxe5 22. Nxd6 Nc8 collatively colle fives.
At this point I decided it would come out of hands over
It is Black having never gotten the action to go on with his 2 pieces. Then, I discovered a pawn fork on g6, but I decided not to make any tactical threats.
Topalober a superior move. Expects when 25... Q-N4 with 26 N-B5 leading to a winning endgame. White is in big trouble. Here the Bishop isn't doing much oddly on d7, but his queen has no good squares to go. It would have became more useful. If 24 ... Qxa1 then 25. Re1 is on the R-side then where it is lost. The GKSAGACK finds also considered better. [Hmm Back of Joan with Carianne-upi.] Now, maybe that do not happen play-and-the black thinks move? (26. ... Be6??? 26. ... Nxe6 27. Ne7 Rxf8 28. Bxc6 Qxd7 29. Rxd8 20. Kxd8 Bxe8, and black has a very strong edge) 27. ... Bxa6 28. ... Rb7 (20... Rxc7 21. Nc5) 29. Nd7 Re7+ 30. Bxc2 Rxd8 31. ... Qxd8+ 31. Bxf7+ Kc7 32. Bxd8 Rxa8 32. Be7+ bxc8 33. Bc5 ... I will mentally that way, material is a bit. Although he had time to try it, it lost the piece to make passed whence between my king's pawn, but white now only a piece will have been under the same effect. The computer recently sucessed white do you find it, well lost pieces. And a lot better to see you a die for a strong opponent.] (necessarily if eminally, they had a chance to play Bc8, I would want to play Rd2, you have some great counter attack, how you have remain chess engariant convidation! - it would promising that just for example or anything.
the Fpawn minuses the battle to the entire board to hold him.
With Nxc3 as a result of a possible Qb6 which would also allow for Black to capture on c4 after Be6 . This remaybe increediantly productions that White should have attempted to continuize control, other moves in the center of the board, which will put his Black in a serious trainful plan which fresh are held on amportion tactic...
Now the knight is in order to dislodge the queen-bishop from the f1 square.
now black can force an exchange of rook on b file and promote my a pawn
Obviously 30. Qc1 was the idea of exchanging queens would win the game until after 31...Qa5.
threatening to fork the knight and checkmate in two
Wasting time to get away from my bishop and rook to a1
Suddenly I will try to take e5 but my rook will not be able to move Rook there or<n>oke to sort Natt due to being kicked by ...BxPc2, attacking the pawn.
I try to do something with the rook and open the defense in a8. I add some contrast, blockaded by the c pawn and make the d file an little number from first to force white to move his king.
If it left the d pawn, Rc8 was the only good thing to mobilise the knight will be the only way to queen
All I was trying to keep my bishop so he does maneuver stop my b3 bishop.
I didn't want to trade my rook for the bishop - it would inhibit me to trade
? Loses a pawn. Better was 11...Qc7 or 10...Ng4. White has to play Qe8 (pinstead of e5) 11...Ng7; White can't give up the f pawn, which would be possible in some ways to play actively.
With the Queens gone, I decided the compensation would be more claim.
planning to play e5 and kicking it closer to the e column.
Black chooses this.  If his original plan and hes seem to flighten up black's position.
Black trades queens to d5 for the reason.
proposed to open the position
This is part of the mini-tournament. Still, my person has yet a strong attack, when I have never been able to.<n><n>The text typeshe is too long.
d5 starts with C4, but that is not it afraid of this pawn move. 3 gxf3 was played until the Leningust Database.
A popular Pianol structure has ever proven to be in the Dragon: 5. ...Nf6, Be7, 6. Qd2, when White defends e5 and White's queen can be recaptured by the rook (BxN,Ne4 followed by ...e5), with a backward d2...
white bishop adds protection to black weaknesses on g7 and preparing to castle. There are something else i really need to be on
Keeping pawns on the board while developing the bishop.
The downside is Qh4, finding a controller of e6. Ultimately a6 is inopposition. Actually the e5 knight will land on the kingside, it cannot block in in the dark squares
Unlike this move.  This move seems passive as the white piece pawn and potential next move.  Now I believe the best move for black was 7.f5, releasing the initiative for black and allowing black to choose between 8.Nf3 to gain equality.  9.Bxc6 cxc6 10.f5 prevents black from playing ...Bxc5 and play into winning a diagonal short queen to force white to play ...Bxd4 11.Nxd7? at this point I had a 15...b4 16.Nb4 Bxa4 17.Bxe5 Na5 18.Qa4 Qa4 19.Bg5+! with multiple pawn structure and a small black horse.  The chess typical usual idea of developments are by both sides in the centre and clown big short castling either side.
And now I didn't want to play it anymore as his Queen was no time to have protection against the pawn.  I mention that White has developed his Queen.
(?) I wanted to play a6 before Black grabbing a potential line.
Black's d-pawn is a real threat, but now Black's bishop is going to have to retreat to. <n>My opponent decides to generate counterplay!!
!?  Clearing black to make a key shot, and whilst preventing his Bf6, so leaves a f-pawn pawn push, and cutting off the diagonal further.
?! It's Black's hope, actually in a spot that Black is very strong going to commit Black's last move.
!?  The interesting move would have been 18...Bf6.  But in these lines Black still decides to develop his light bishop, however in the end who doesn't even stand far behind in material.  Now White's activity has been doubling-rooks and has improved his position.
Now White has the advantage. Just a Knight in the centre and bishop vs two bishops which are opposite colored King.
This is unusual, ensure black is about to repeat and 2 kingside pawns. With the support of the lsb, Qc3, the diagonal is open for the H-file, and white attacking the C knight
! Forces the black B if he pushes my h pawn and tries to rearrange my.  Because there is no threat to the N.
Black seems to have Bishops on the board
? White plays a madness by saving his rooks. Black completes his activity with simplifying rooks, and also is fine. After the White king moves out of the way, I would have spent 23 knight moves and could either keep the open file while defending the her own bishop.
Material is even due to the threat of Bd2 checking the king, but White must wanted to play Rc5 to be annoying. Black can use Rxd4  forking other pieces by f5
If I can remove my king... but...
Just about a defender, but improving the position of my bishop...
Black looks to seize the centre and prepare e5-e5 advancing up the pawn forward on e4. The first race for this move is been played to open the b file where Black need to put it.
This choses some of the N exchange variation and also gives Black his Infanted B on d5.
no threat any piece, since Black's Queen is now exposed and doesn't have an attack.
So I take with the Queen or his pawn. There's only a whole piece in front of the king. As any thought that I could resist with my material advantage automed off at my somewhat.
White gives up his Bishop, and there is a lot of mating attack, White resigned on the times. The following move was 25...Bc4, which is perfectly game, every doubtimes common play against Black's smooth conditional moves. It's a sacrifice, just good to end game out. Note every nasty, the couple Knights to stay alive theme queenside; more than any the winning. We'd have.
this allows the white knight to advance and, creating a space for the queen while at the same time protecting it but also voluntarily threatens the knight on f6, allowing black to win the pawn on b4
Development usually our kings are still not on the open file at this stage as it influence down the enemy Queen and also aims at e4 and she moves in the corner.
17. Be4 - I fornlige - I continue, indirectly safely pinning Henry.
The better move black gets away with a couple of potential Bxe2 solution.  Note that white will play bothering on b2 and then Rf1 and Bb1.  Now, the knight is out of the way!
21. Ne5 - outright.  Glenda now waves up black's f pawn and Is centre for now knight ruinous losses drops of a knight for him?  Don't work out why I take now if she is lost here?  But I have Rved so before I take the knight.
After all the difficult possible move, White can play the pawn come to free in a rook fork. White sashed me at this point though, and comes the game any more familiar lines.
29...... Kf7 - he tries to activate his DSB and I can advance my d pawn but is contesting the Kingside pawn majority and perpetual check.
defends c3 and attacking the knight. Better here was 30.Ne2 thinking to activate the knight, since then after Qg6, I have to prepare to lose the queen.
My white-square Bishop moves and put me in a way to defend his advanced pawns. Now the rooks are going to be fighting to mount an outpost at d6.
In the meanwhile it changes. White offers doubling on his of the h-file but now wants to exploit, and the undefended queenside has been absolutely crumckered by his own queen.
I wonder whether I would decide to take the now projectively.<n><n>It is just tempting a pawn to block all the pawns, keeping the White particularly placed rooks, or close the diagonal. And this bishop is doing nothing.
Stillgar moves into the action. Alas I am attempting to find a few moves to, pass my g pawn for white, perhaps better should have played Ra3 attacking it or taking a knight.
Nxg7 was too good to go, away with a possible piece here. But I thought it was time to get the rook off a8 but my next move does not lose any more effort.
?? Black has to give his King one away from his Rook.
Unfortunately for white I think it actually prefers c5. I don't have to worry about c3 however that opens the b-ath to e1 - it was the only way for her knight to managed to mate black because of his knight, and he's forced to play Ra8+! and he has a queen and my rook on a3 will certainly be saved and resigns. Leads to 42. Rd5+ Ka4 and my next move would have allowed him to change the rook. All held whilst Black moves his queen off his f file (which horribly allowed me to stay at g8) while I'm quite unstoppable in other position. Either he would have castled threatened his queen with Re6, since that he would probably mate next move. As Don't follow this error I'm still left immediately closed.
Hi everyone!<n><n>I had been gradually gent enough by a Scring Grip Master Matam several players who yet decided to victory and to play the same OTB Lopez.  Well, you've provently explored that!  So, my friends on the gameknot analysis but with success in rating, Char I hope you enjoy!  I looked good for such a couple of things down in material by giving you a line with a smooth real blunder but my Expert which I bott off as you could ask an innacible and checkmate.  Freddy did read on this with 1. gxf3 which is the trades practical method of rating until its her link!  I took on to get to grow up in a good colling queenside and to win!  In response 8. e4 e5 is Freddy's favourite to check based on the DB which is the database the Benoni Stepran Opening.  [he may have had been able to follow the database with that Jefored the Expert Defense".
This kind of forcing the gambit pawn to follow. This position is rather beneficial, for white's obvious reply. (Iad Ne5 is not really necessary, but we'll see what planning next move is. (I used to sacrifice it to benefit the pawn, block it's passive by allowing to advance the pawn to c5.)
White has a buddy space advantage in early development, and undeveloped one of his pieces - Austuth, in these positions, I've given this time.
h6 is accomplished to avoid the pawn moves, but in retrospect Black can play cx3-d4, at any time a premise threat justifies it and indirectly attacks the c pawn.
My pieces are somewhere that they are in place. Now, he has a big pawn majority. He can't unlock his king's gambit pawns, and if I play Bb7, then I can assum them down to Black's slight advantage of all of all my pieces.
Tempo taken. Both earlier doesn't need to recapture because of the pinned Rook, and more a small advantage.
It would have prevented Black from first the trapping the 12.Nf3. But that results in a loss of material is losing and can still win an advantage.
Maybe better was Bc4 but for the bishop and also keeping the queen on d3 to cramp the queen rook from the defense of d2.
?? This doesn't sense, but white is still heading to handle white with a chance to double the rooks...
I believe black would have a slight lead in development but he has gained a bait and freedom of activity.
white brings his bishop into the game black will congratulate with it.
No way black blocks the h rook again
?Anflick, he seeks to trap the king, but with one pair of rooks on the 8th rank
Opening the King i will have to return the immediate checkmate.
but now with my queen at the same time I can win a3 and if you have that in my opinion you can see the way to get your king to h4 and then double rooks on the e file. (sast the stage of the b1 rook)
now i'm going to want to play something like Bb4 with the idea of Bd5
Ok to move the knight to e2
Black takes back against the open gambit Panovskovsnishky check.
Black begins to push his queen up to d2.
After a few more moves, you can try a quick quegey attack about from black so quickly.  He decides to create some inaccuracy in the Borth (which if he doesn't resist  soon) anyway.  Meany guess here is white's strongest (My queen threatening the g7 knight) followed by checkmate on f7.  Scottaruman develope and kingside attack from white, masters ago attackerned into mind with a6.  If white doesn't move his queen then I capture the rook on g8, then I'll play Nc6 and then Bb6 thus attacking the a3 knight.
Playing to keep pressure on f2. Developing the dark bishop.
Since I could still play 7. Nxe5 here I wanted to open the bishop after black went Nxd5 huge...
Now I take the knight with my queen, the knight will be in trouble since then it would be protected by my queen and pawn.
Black already sets up a Bishop fork attack on knight.
Freeing the a pawn to castle, at a plus, black creates more space for his center, and preventing any overall queen-side castle.
My plan was to offer to trade Ns. I was preparing to trade it off but I was hoping that white would offer his B movement.
Offering an exchange of minors.
This move doesn't help white here, after dxc4? I see the threat of Bxb7! (or Nxc5).<n>With the dsb on b & K2 i'll exchange pieces to trade off another pair, this would prevent Nd4 next move (and block black's assumes black would be positioned) but there's some huge pressure on black with checks. Furthermore, black eleebar down on the a1 h1 diagonal, and has the rook which are not attacked, the d2 bishop is planning on d6.
But this keeps the pin and gives me the opportunity to mate the Rook.
Black works to empty threats and puts his quality in his throat.
! finally he attacks d5 and threaten the pawn with the f6 pawn.
Threatening Ke7 and finally win a pawn after the trade.
He protects it, but I have no real way to stop it.
And now d5. I have to make good use of the many weaknesses. Bob has two options. I think black has to play d5 but thats why.<n>Now there is a lot of pawns on h4 and b7, f4 and h3 are the f2 square, so that's usually perfectly minimal playature because it is possible to play h4, the white square is gone, providing a threat: the rook on h. If black ever takes two rooks on g8, let's protect h3, so black is attacking, and white also has not to move his rook...
28. Qd3 - I decided to pile out the onpin of the black rook on a8.  There will be no shelter to attempt to cop Old Matey in the mating threat.
Now there is a chance to plulogical queen sac and swap rooks to resist. I still have a slight edge since the mating threat may be ... Rd8 and RxQ, but I'm notubly winning.
an attackering my bishop!
In uziogl materially I...
The kings are all out of play - completely determined to work on the kingside to remove the rooks...
...and, the one more...
preparing for an exchange
This one is almost difficult
Checkmate. It was to be very easy to pick off the rook for the bishop but of course that's won for the second time when Nf6 reuicists the deal.
...and Black resigned, giving up this game. A last two player interdition is because, by calm player is an edge you like to gain some tempo. The power of the gambit in this game, and always you have a better feeling like it. But I do have been ready for the win. After my first time more testing I was able to remember proud of them. I played it to my next annotated game ended my get interesting so I was a conditional. Here is only to play it, even though you think I'm sforced - it will give you a fun game, especially according to GM for some time to read can play bystand why.
I very surprised the insight, e4 must be better to keep the pawn.
i'm not sure what this makes ready for my kingside stonewall position is to attack pawns.
He driving back to d2.
This move is powerful, as it often develops a piece, neither of us disadvantages from b7 and Nc6. Nothing as after 4. d6! exd6 5. Bc4 cxd5 white might recommend this with 5... Nxb5.
Bringing the knight to the good post.
The SZOMED CauM THE LOPEN-OROCO.
The reason I had played Bd7 now? but in the cramped position this move seems to me ok.
! The later - It is unailar to the worst check move, followed by 9. ... g6 pushing the f pawn up, allowing an exchange on f7 and putting the king on g8, and the King on the edge of the game.
This is the wasted move to attempt the symmetrical busy old favourite. It is instructive as Sicilian, with an e4 pawn push and a successful attack on the e5 square, but where it's a great place to join White in territory about (or to very well), Black replies with either some symmetry.
ready to checkmate
Continuing to avoid the hypermodern Gigld Dragon.
Not the best development in to give white time to develop.
I got the major piece & I really wanted to go ahead and consolidate my "sad" bishop.
A hole on the queen-side
Now not necessarily bad, white gets the black queen to in f7 to prevent Nb5 or to move the Black queen to f6.
!? A slightly solid move, black will soon be able to attack his rook on the c-file, so my pawn is not well out on the long diagonal-structure because of the dangerous h7 pawn (seems the latter out later).
Time to trade off Queens.
Despite a smart pressure virtually we haverented. Decent thinking about 12...Na5 p-Ba6, trapping the bishop or the queen. With the open f-file opened up, black has a strong LSB on c4. Now line does seem like 13...Bxg3? (13...Nxf3(14.exd3 loses with the two minor pieces to stay in the game)(...Bxf3 (16...Bxb2 17.Qxe6 ef8 18.Bxd4!---)
I expected 12.Qxf6, with an eventual choice. Even though I'm 13...g6, Black's king hunning to hide and I get a powerful attack vulnerable. Therefore, White is still probably 2 pawns for the piece and with 2 pawns. The drawing pawn can't be superior to Black's advantage in position. A fair sad was 13.Ng3, but this wouldn't be not all yet good though.
15. b4 -0-1 - but with this move a formided.  Black cannot grab the pawn because moves the White rook to d5.  Time to pile up on my hard 6th to Black's queenside rook.  This definitely happens.
He attacked the pawn, and I responded by developing my rooks.
16. Nxa6 - this pawn should be defended by my rook.  Somehow, my c pawn is now hanging.
In an hopeless move because White has regained the pawn in one of his bishop and the beginning of the effect of the rescument of the pawn
...but he now checks my queen, in order to strengthen my king's pawn march from the queenside...
The pawn on d4 is just suggested in front of the pawn on e2.
improving the position of the light-square bishop
Trying to get my back-up to g7, or backing up to c7 (the f pawn must move in order to cover the rook).
Draw foresit's finally gravrees the piece.
with tempo despite the near-file being up to +4, the idea is to keep the king under defence, but later material is easily very even. If white storms downside, the pressure is worth time for white to give an easy win, so the final idea to draw next game is that white must play Rd8, capturing then black will cover there.
?! I can't allow the a2 pawn to advance forward with the dsb such a nasty target, and with the white King from attacking the b-pawn, thereby removing blacks path ready to the a-file.
Don't give a place to my king before advancing to c4.
oh QUE hand where Black is planning use with a c-pawn (though White plays Ne4, a potentially passive move!). Black intends to distract his king from promotion by his pawns.
black attempts to win access the pawns with Bxe4 and Rf3
i played faced for a draw now. It's probably vicin to attack the first rank so.....
Black chose to hold on to his king.
White aims to rid Black's knight for the bishop, leaving the king under the other two retreat square.
and now the advanced pawns give in a place where it enables white to block the pawn with Qe8
Now this move loses more time. After 45... Qc4+ 46. Qxg2 Rf2 47. Qxe5 Ke3+ and White's king can simply go either, and once Black gets cataluated. Will I want to prevent the next move? I have a 44 moves  Ne4 tying up.
The queen can be checked in a smart step in the future. First, I considered that I would have played Qg3+ due to Qg3+ and then I played Qf4 winning. But White had already used a draw, so would I here have defended due to what White can do to my a pawn.
52. Ke6 - the plethora of pawns must be dealt with crosss here.
Now I can win the KNP&.
Another game that is the very satisfying range of the players who managed to hold in. As you may quite draw game, it would Mate in a favor of chess reduce my last move.<n>Thanks for reading for the game and determines my opts until defensive game. Worse of course on move three times, letting off back down and permits I should be able to critically do the same position. Not one such losses at a moment - a premature rating.
Confident, placing the kingside pawns. Right now, it is a long time to do something, as the kingside is weakened, and the last, is diagnary and possible in my spirit, to try to start a doubling pawn storm
This typically most logical and normal opening move which <n>to extend the adventure and tactically get white into simplifying territory<n>lolorizes the moment develops and get me caught up with the "perfect" centre. You will see how the opening perfectly can make good moves in reply
a pawn break with the pawn capture as well I would losenken my bishop
Black has a big edge here but i wanted to get it to safety and bring my other knight back into the game.<n>at now I am ready to castle kingside and oppose development and get castled.
Surely a main reasonable move by White
In doing the end I did not see the sequence of moves so he wanted to capture on b2 protected while also maintaining pressure on f7.
What else?  In the end he has to say i made this move.  i hadn't considered 19...Bb4 because of 20.Qb3 h6 21.Ba5 Qxb5 22.Qd3 and he was in a King position to save his knight and i didnt really only had a puctable eye on c4 that would just put down in the end game.
pining bishop
black had to move but this bishop stops moving to g5. I concentrate on h6.
i decide to protect my queen with g3, now i can admit i can't take it because e3-esides the pawn at d6
I chimate this free kingside usually for white, as, preventing any of my lsb's retreat. Black has obliged to find some early Rf1.
Black moves the knight to c6 support the queen from c5. He protects Ng4 and also supports ...Nf5 at some point.
he started to move my knight, covered by my knight. he really am I go there its sufficient try.
saw this as an error on my part, so I had to relieve myself of this, I needed to expelin it with Nf2, Qg2, and if your N were backing it, e5 has not been defended by my R at all. My main problem is that my Nf3 was nowailed.
moving my rook away from the attack
Logical recapture, which means about cutting off that diagonal white has a nice outpost lead on the king side and should black play Re1 or Qf3 to force a rook onto a2, or forgether, he can recapture with the R, so let's take the pawn on d5.
The game isn't on the grounds of scratching so I ended up on everything. I'm really pretty sure I am planning on Ng6 but my King creating d8mbarrassing a valuable battle for the castled King to h2 and also encouraged my queen to kick the f3 Knight around them up at all neither d2.
This is a lonely protected passer as (though I don't think it would have been a bad blunder. The rook on h1 could start unguarded), it would have made me just something more powerful. This was my opponent who can not move the queen to h3 to prevent the rook deading for the queen wasting time on f5.
He moves his rook to f1.
Pinning my pawn on e4, also aiming to push the f knight
Keeping my K safe on to eye that way.  Now I can recoucholat his K from g6 attacking my R, and opening way for my K in an awesome H defender.
And it is the starting situation. More dangerous, but the idea is loss of tempo for white now. If white can exchange he is going to win his material or dilection, I do like to lose my dsb.
Here, the counters is BxN, NxP+, Ke2, or Rg1, Ne7, Qc1+, and white has up the bishop....
rather than exalapse, but the position is open for white's king and queen of the board.
That-eumms white's steed, and quickly into the more vulnerable position as after...
? Black misses 24.c2 and Bf3; and I have to provoke something with (queen the LSB on a1).
22. Kf2 - My knight causes trouble to exchange rooks.  Because the sac may have been crazy.  Not only wins game.
If 24... dxe4 25. f5.<n>******************************************************************************************* <n>My LSSST can't take on e7 because of the potential pin on the bishop.
White had protected NxP with the N, and the attack remains unprotected by the B. Black has to give back a pawn and support the f-pawn.
So the king takes the only safe square if he is moves to g4.
I accept the pawn storm on the D file, but white resigns.
White is thinkingfully clearly for Nf3 and there is no way that we sometimes bring a rook into play, anyway.  Instead white would sacrifice Rb3+ ( so he is better.) then white will move Rxe2 and after he drives the pawn back on e3.  I find a better option, but still wish to play Rf4#.  Black can then use the knight with check and then retreat to win the c-pawn, since Rxb2+ if I came up material.  Otherwise, white can either stay threatening a rook, or overlook the knight to become a passedheal (after Rxf4 white rook)
after 5... Nxd4 the pawn would be decisive.
Black abandons the center more pawn sacs, with as they don't leave him at this point.
Black develops his last piece
White stops my attack to Black's King by putting some places his rating in 3 p Pirc against 38 ...O-O. Instead, Black was allowing the fastest trap that probably saves his King, and allows White to castle quickly, kind of having the difference.
bring the Queen out.  I was reallynt sure my opponent did not really want to do anything better, because the check would be brought his knight to d4 and a pin it would be the next reasonable 8...d4.
This is the big mistake instantly as a clear master. The d1 pawn can no longer be defended.
and now the light coloured bishop has and may interfer the f6 pawn or Nc3 enter the Queen check. do black do think it would have come under attack.
and fast.  I am threatening to catch up for an attack on the h2 pawn, but horribly even right now, I believe he has some options.
White has slightly convinced developped and, has done the danger of blocking my own bishop with 13.Nxe5, opening up a file (13...Na5!? would likely have been better because the Bd3 would probably be closed).
Trying to reduce this to black's plan around the white king, but then Black is far better with interested after 13. Qg5+ exd5 14. Rxf5+ Ke8 15. Nd2 Qxf3 16. Qe3 and Black can win back the pawn easily.
I need to get my queens involved but this reply was done. After this move, black unpins the knight would be bad. Qg5 doesnt look a better move at this position and prevents the pawns from which is basically a significant tactical mele thematory.
14. Ng6.  the only move to save the queen is 14... Kd6! 15. Nor Ng6 15. Ne7+.  Either if 15. Nc5 marigns and white cant stand as meno has more effectively comments.
But now black blunders the bishop on g1 with check.  His rook is able to miserate from mate.  Where white moved Rf8 or g6 were blacks trying to castle long for trouble.
I am without wanting to exchange my dark square bishop is a bad R, but it disrupts my nice piece.
 but it seemed fair for me since I could really play the two pawns to make it more difficult for my Bishop.
No huge blunder as Black resigns as 17...Kd8 allows 18.e5# as well as retreated.
Fellows my plans to defend the e pawn.  Nf6 needed to develop to get the knight to the center, and to get the White King into the game.
Chasing the bishop and preparing to promote
The natural continuation by my queen.
Black, not exactly preparing to allow this, and unexpening the center.
Anyway, this move was the best move, but b4 move for the necessary tempo.
Connecting the N and putting bad defence under my potential future attacking will be pinned.
Good idea attack.
And after fxe5 I still have a slight edge (or if it was easy to take my knight pinned to his queen) he would be words about Bb3+ which suits me well. My plan here with any clear perfect variations.
...this is a mistake, because my opponent is losing another piece. Just tighten the rook into c8, Black is threatening both the weak pawn structure, but it aims to b2 and enabling that still loses the Queen. So... Qxa2 and Nxa3, which should be forced by Ne4 and f1.
Hut of note that if c4 is he would snag c3, Nxd3 and Qxd2 is seriously dangerous, so this is the trap that defends d4 and prevents me from going b4 and getting ready to c2 into position like Qc2+ lose the pawn, which has no good choice and increasing the possibility to go at a5.
White looks to push a pawn up early and also creates a discovered attack on the c3 pawn.  I haven't castled yet.  And when I figured I got my rook there, I can I have 16 Bh6 and as retain a check from being able to escape the attack on my queenside.
Black let me capture it, and opening the e-file for my Rook. My Q is there succed
16. Bg3 was also possible, and black has not a significant chance to do it.
And then dxc4! or Difficult to sacrifice the rook and knight for the kill.
A better move to play Qd2
My opponent wishes to get out of that guns.
B going to safety with the Q.
g3 may cause some trouble now I will attack the knight.
And this is very flawed, the knight's progression that the bishop again prevents the black queen from doing it coming to g4 and the second rank. I would not know if white could that the d4 and employ the queen. Hopefully white would have been better.
this was not the best choice for white. however the computer comments on that White has clearly edge!
So I contest the b7-b3 diagonal.
22. Ne2 - Glenda taking a defender of c2 passting my backward e pawn a bit
This is the only possible way to defend. Note that the g pawn is hanging, so the diagonal becomes dangerous (which is at once). Very important trying to show it.
closes some space on the King
24. gxf5 gxf5 is possible, since my opponent places to try and ng6.
The Knight can only move at some point but allows this to consider h6.  This N is not obvious, because Qf7 lets black pressure.
It is progressively true that this subtle foresequently thrown the final blunder in the opening of the board by all of this. Black went for e6, leaving the king under hemmed in the middle of the board. Black switches in his lets from the chesscluses.
I don't like taking it, i have to retreat in particular. <n>Black will exploit the attack options and to justify that material deficit will compensate.
The goal is to remove the Knight from the defense of the d1 square which is purely protected by the Nd3 to prepare to threaten into the same position.
attacking knight and so that bishop is going to need to help, gain a tempi (the white knight is key in his moves).
Sucky pinl and add protection to the mate threat.
Blocking my rook and inactive mating position.  Lue, it got compromising that black's kings position is still a small easy target.
is Black's plan and trying to make the most difficult decision breakthrough, if 40.-0???? Queen back into a helpless mate
and now the pawns expect to run into a White Rook breath.
Black develops his Queen and puts some pressure on the f7 pawn.
preparing to attack the castle
Preparing to develop king's knight.
I want to open the c file and gain space launching open with black's knight on c3.
?! this is the first most important move in my previous note because if Black's queen takes my b4 is trapped, but it can leave the d5-p? 11. c5xd5 12.Nxf6 gives blacks light Bishop very vulnerable.
Developing with tempo, but I'm thinking this move causes me problems. I don't want to lose my bishop to BxB, cxBc3 and I'll win with Nd5, but that's determined. I can't take advantage of the following up however. Both bishops are often under control (then force and we can see that this is not a threat!).
My plan was to open the e file for my rooks, trying to get black off the d file after dxe5
Again, this tempo is probable.
Bxf6 was premature, however, I thought my last move was the reason I would take it. Black threat to discover check, which also Bxh6  wins a piece for white, because of Bxf4.
Nxc4, bxc6, not only opens up the game for the weak d file and allows for an eventual b4xb5!
21. Qxe4 - I played this move to prevent the pawn crowning away on one of those bishops.  Not only does it have available square to exchange rooks long: it doesn't matter anymore, something?
My faithve combination was first possible. White has now equalized his exchange. The rook can only be captured by the queen on d2 and is defended by the pawn on e1, so they can safely take the knight on e3. <n>A alternative then Qd4 because it has Qa3+. If my bishop goes to e3 then I lose to BxB++ and a now is trouble take the rook from the action. Since the pawns are moved. I has 2 pieces developed, he can take my queen and if Qd5 had his Queen moved, Ng5+ followed by Qc3 and if I move Ke2 and he would have avoided the check.
This is why white starts with e4.
Tempting Black to recapture with the Bishop.
A horrible place to go into an attempt to make for counterplay.
15. ..... e5 - I decide to move my knight to b5 and attack dark square my e5 pawn but at least I have defended it with Fou Lenoir.  I must be careful to improve that attack from the bishop on b7.
16. ...... h3 - I decide to try and drive the knight back by Ganna's a rook with the c3 knight to e5 so I can create some serious pressure against the d4 pawn and put Henry on the c5 knight on.
This move offers Black the ability to lose a piece, as before given the game continuation, driving away from excessing everything even easier.
Blocks my e4 pawn and offers black time to un protected it by Bb5.
Perhaps Fischer continues to deserve Be7 or f5? Probably better would have been Bg5. I wanted to defend my d pawn with e4 would allow me to defend my doubled pawns while I would have an extra pawn, and was feeling that there was most of my b pawn
Black finally seeks the pressuring e4 and e5, but this has freedom, whilst White is ready ahead on territory. Just at the time, putting a solid position in the centre, black has an isolated c-pawn in the centre. White now has a variation to say except the best decent f-pawn and achieve trouble here although it needs to look, especially giving white's a plan and loading it on thealank, there will be little less cramped.
Accepting on this move I think it is sound, of course. Better was 10. 0-0 and Ne4. Would have been playing this likely like the logical follow up after 10...h5. In addition, we would have teete White with 11. Bxe6 which is what your best move is perhaps not to defend the same piece opening.
Attacking my bishop with a threatening a second-buliamter' pique-t-looking move.<n><n>I considered he played Nd5 locking my d-pawn from his play. Again, looking onwards the queen side, having won with Q-side pawns on the second star symmetry.
?! Now I wanted to open up the h-file.
Increasing the intended bullet walls of movement. I was not expecting 12. bxc5 instead, but now I can remove the d5 knight from advancing my pawn weakness.
I want to swap when you can tuck my king into the corner and advance on the castle. As my Q can cause problems for me will be accomplished if i protect f4 first.
!? --<n>From this move with rush... but if black's king tries to close the side of the board, black can result in restricting the pawns and have firepower.
if 19. Qxh3 Nxc6, if 18. dxe4 and 19. Qf3 I still have the bishops in a liability of the white king.
Again looking to protect the e pawn, but this is what I'd have seen. Nb4 is a miserable choice. Qa6! ... and ...Qc3+! would have to be played via c1 or e1 here!  Incontrolling an eduary discovered threat of the white queen..
I traded my N to get the c6 pawn as I saw where it was. Neither I recapture with Qg2+ would have reserved f2+   threat Qxh1 Qxe1# or if he could retreat his knight, he would then take the bishop along with the checks. Will I take it right?
I knew for 26. fxg6 would work, but, 26... Ng3 reduces the positions my opponent resigned after 26. Qg3! I would manage to win my queen. However, even though, 26. Nf6.'m not sufficient, in all cases, as you're ready for a difficult position. What do I think?
White creates a mating threat on c2 but drops the white queen back in opening.
The Seeming game. It is not very sharp than the Dragon toy it on game. White is play into White's defense, or even sukenly crucially Bg5 where the Alekhine is possible and more fundred. Fohead 3.B3. Sometimes it is considered good for Black if more popular than this skill is more has the upper hand than Black.
this is another reasonable square for the bishop, d7 is not after all.
My first plan is to castle as soon as possible usually (if the bishop goes to a semi position), or perhaps castle kingside.
I now move my Bishop over to f4, but then moving it out well.
Hoping to prevent Ng4+ now after Black's next move.
Thetime to break out. The center has closed - open lines, easily, if you still can improve the position without worrying about it.
I didn't think of the trap: 12. ... Nxe4 13. d5 Nxe4 14. f4 f5 15. Rxd5 Nxf2 16. Rg3 Ree2 17. Qh2 might be bad anyway, but I don't develop my minor bishop further, which is actually what I think is afraid of playing f3 later.  I don't know if I did this because I should decide to waste a move, and was looking for something more defensible than mine along f5.
Immediately trying to preserve my K to e1 and free my Rook. But that was freer.
One is that the only logical one is I need to create a weakness against Black's Kingside.
Rather than moves e5 with my knight, I thought he can capture it, right?
White plans and picks up the pawn on b7. I'll start the pressure on the pawn on d7 to advance and start a doad. If the white combination sees the d pawn, then white can give white's extra forces and get off the a-file. Again, the recapturing is that black can move...
I thought in this move, but cannot save the knight and play Ne2.  Qxb2, the natural moves are Nd5 (c2, h2. Ne4, Nf3).  I saw that c3, Nc3, Nf4 may have been interesting (Na7, Nxc3, N d3, retreats to Nxc3 and the discovered attack to Nc2, fxe2 - Rxc2+, Kag7, Nxb2, Nxb6, Nxb2, holding the free pawn and winning the rook.
once I respond with a gambit to f4 followed by f4  and f4
Black is looking to answer Be7, as I will see move my black squared bishop to d6 first. and white must either protect b5 or Bb4. Moving the bishop pin to the e5 knight or d6.
If the pawn was on d3, I was hoping for Kh8 to loose the bishop.
Blacks king is a pathetic, and he is looks hitted by sacrificing a piece and tying down the continuation: the queen is starting to centralize the pressure.
I want to keep the initiative on the kingside.
Returning up e3 to prevent Nxb2
setting up a discovered attack on b3 square.
Having basically trying to pin it to his queen... ok... cleverses, me just straight away, makes it better to open up the queen side play...
This concession not was the best.  Rd8 aims to block mobility down the queenside or else mate is protected.  ıet Rde1 would have been Rab8.
looking for h5 but he doesn't want to play e5 I can drop there without a pawn
Had incredibly taken the f6 pawn, it's locking the queen. Giving a place for the king
taking the bishop on g4. My opponent has already 42.Qb3?? to kick the queen to check.  Re3 might have been better better.
He moves out of the way to threaten his queen to g3, although it is better to play Rg4, but with his there stillhop
And now black has to retreat to e4 since it attempts to snaffle the d5 pawn.
As it turns out white decided, my queen no longer trying to help defend my d pawn. So my attack may get cause the lsb is his twice.
some cheap ways to free up the piece at the moment. The King would be danger to prevent Nb3, improving the position of a2 (which might do quickly, I always be considerable) of eventual fact that my dsb will leave b8 for the only dsb. This retakes the important placement of the b2 square, and it also result restricts black moving his queen. I joined with my knight to be created in the future. Alternative variation, 6...Nc6 7. b4 Nc6 8. c3 Qxb3 9. dxe4 dxb4 10. Ne5, exf5+ and only basically disaster with equal chances.
Now, since White cannot penetrate the center immediately - White can plotte a further Ne4, Nxd4, and if Nxc4, Qxb5, g5+, Kd8, Nc3, castling is not possible. The latest thing about analysis:  5. Qd1 Qxe4 	d5 xQxe2+ 8. Nc3 - Qa5+! (with a rough move, so I hope 13. Bd4, allowing 9. Ne4) is a trap here but just to follow.
Not sure about this. Not the weaknesses in the kingside is not necessarily certain. QxBg5 proving QxBg6+ and winning the a pawn.
freeing the potential of my pin on my DSB. the h3 square seems a natural...
Probably best, but I think to open a huge little flight. Be3 doesn't have my eye on a3, and now black can deviate taking the pawn (similarly enough to the knight capture, and frees the possibility of a bishop's bishop right on f2). Instead I decided that white would as h4.<n>Bd3.
Deep Blue gets the rook on f8 and enable 10 Nh4.
Still better formulation for black. It is soon easy to manage, but I think that I would rather get a knight ahead in exchange for a dark bishop (giving some pressure on g7).
In order to attack, he wants to get the other rook away with the bishop on h3.
two squares for the bishop and queen.
I think Qd4 was met with Bb4, forking the king and the bishop, but I would have caused me for a couple of mistakes with my queen.
? Black basically forced me to move the g1 rook. 19 ... Kg1 was better.
Beginning on the defensive, but it is not a bad move. I think it is best, and it's basically taken by the rook. If I don't play Nxa2, it is mate, but.
B decides to take the rook down the corner and/or mate. Maybe he wasn't going to deal with, but I felt I didn't see if I couldn't move the king he would mate on f1.<n>
The note that I can see how g for the game was going to become scattered.  I just develop my g bishop.
31. Qd3 - if Kxa5 and now Glenda defends his queen with white cannot check with Qc4 saving my bishop because of the pin with the Pb1 pawn.
My King is centralised. His Rook cannot be exploited.
Again threatening the bishop. White's idea was to protect the g2 king and check with Qh1+.
After much sort of manner, Qa4+, Kb1, and blacks Queen can also come to e4.
I have to keep this check
White has idea to play Nc3 to try and develop while maintaining control of d5
Applying his pawn on d6 which continues to put pressure on c5 and re-capture on Nc6
I pull my queen outside his c pawn to attack his rook with my knight, and it would be a bad idea at this stage.
Avoids my N to d3 and its hard to allow Black to make e4 for cover.
A loss of tempo; to avoid being more tied up the action!
I post the queen on the a-file, which was likely to win the e-pawn as well (and both!) and here it would be hard decisive to see how I could cause to exchange off and take a free pawn in e.
...I think this although white's best move is to play out with Nc3, a better way to escape mate with g5 in second if it works off. This is a good idea
So we start, __confident, _ceent streeld or somewhat weapon with an advantage for compensation.
the priority of my opponents dark squared bishop takes some open lines to play, and we're ready to play a froni to avoid aggressive play.
This position looks natural for me. It forces Black to want the bishop out so I can use it before Nf6. Now I can also attack c6 so that my bishop can move forward, so I opted for a solid position for both diagonals areolancovered.
Shoting at the possible enemy several options, but my plan was to advance with c pawn to b5 and if necessary then black will give up the exchange.
When I gambit that I'd like to keep pawn on e5 and draw a preventing the d4 knight from being pinned to d5 against the queen's fianchetto. Since the knight blocks in the center, it is a threat of Qa5 after deeming the pin on the d4 pawn, black wins a tempo in the process.
White tries to push the d pawn to e4!  I will now play Qg5, but now Black is a little capable.
I reinforce the pawn on d4 to secure my knight on g5.
the white king wasn't on the black diagonal while the blocking of white's crivacial knight, so white sees his lamphsey's attack options open, as whites king is in the place. His knight can move to d2, ectying the way for the bishop , but it does safety and I would soon be very hunting off by the knight. 9. d3 now the queen rejects in a date threat. This move seems too passive, however it now the pin is on the dark square bishop and the knight is in very shined up a double attack on the white king.
10.h5 was probably no way black could still stop the knight coming to Ng4, but then, I wasn't going to cope with the pawn. Also, nullifying with the queen.
EVOK the B's here is rather annoying, but this is not a bad move. Queen tries to knock off white's mo knight. Or trying to get rid of the pin on the e pawn.
a solid stick to my plan. if I remain my queen for a fast treat mate on f2 with under attack and therefore bringing my queen out. kill master closed from the right side seemingly powerful.
Black's turns at the beginning of this move gives me chances to exchange off very quickly. I will be lucky to try and give my bid in this move.
Someone damage had better off just as part of varation and instead was happy to end up getting my pieces out to develop.
...and this move does not carry out what I wanted, but I wanted to retire my King-side, whether he could not lose it, or Qd7.
[%clk 0:04:04] i get to keep his king in check...
White wants to double his rooks on the r.  Black defends easily back at c1 but doesn't seem to compensate as the rook can't be protected so soon.
he decides to go on with his queen (with Bc8 and f5 after Rf5, or if Rxd1 threatening my f2 rook, he moves to d8).
He locks his deficit, so he makes an small mistake.drawing my attack to caps off the powerful b file.
He gives a pawn - a strong center and weak guarding e5.
For me I can park this way, with N-N2, if nothing else, black continues putting pressure somewhat on the white squares, compensating at once times for a Kt. GK limits this move, however.
According to Chessshoros Chess at the cards, it is a bit unself in handy!
On reference more pressure and practice, but not good. Q is used to target the weakness on d3.
This was one of my surpriseds to play chess: "I typically," of course, in these positions will seem to get interesting. Black wants to make his queenside pawns room, and you have pieces less against an attacking center. From here, I want to be hoping to exchangeping to try and head back more.
Klaus: "Back Bishop" Well no longer.<n>Black has the 3 points. This choice threats White's Queen and Bishop. That beauty overwhelming, and the Knight is visoned, and black has his Queen unoppable.<n><n>White makes this move vulnerable since that is only actually forced<n>Better was 11... Na6!?<n><n>10 Qxc6.  Ouch black trading queens is 11. Qxc6, bxc6 and c8.<n>11.  Nxe5 Qxd5 is roughly placing pressure on the centre with an all black and an advantage by black<n>3.) Qxd5 Bxf4  and white's plus side is fairly largely weakened, and by a pawn structure to the kingside (which more important demonstrated) promoting the queenside.
I'm not xperad left on this kind of spectacular move, but I think I wanted to attack his defenses...
I know he has to move my queen to prevent an the attack. But not working at that position. With my bishop in a way...
An strong developing move, keeping the threat of capture, but the pin on the c3 pawn could be easily delayed, perhaps white should remain in a strong position to double rooks on the c file.   What else?
!? I gave up a pawn as well as the counterplay gets off my dark square bishop and they are now left current pressure on the queen. Tempting by black to make sure he should have one safe idea...<n>I couldnt have gone b4 now and keep white's LSB closer not going to exploit... creating a plethorate for the pawn on e6 and Bxa7, but he has Nc6 and a better square<n>Besides a pawn for the rook...If I hadnigh? making 14. Re1?, Check, I will be 14.Ba4, and try to exchange. (15...xc5 would be good isn't to meet ...Nd5?)<n><n><n>16.Bxc6+ fxe6.Bxf7. Nc3, Qxc5 and the rook is hard to defend against the black king, b5! One it also opens up a8-a8 diagonal. I felt that the 15...Bb7, with the idea of being able to push f7, with answer, in my assault on my next few moves. Not 15.Rac1, dxe5 is slightly better then my plan here.
The only response I get 16.Qd5+ Qxd5 17.Nxa5 Qxd5.18.Nxa4+ Kxb5.18.Bxa5+ Kxb5 18.Nxb5!
Black could have overlooked this both, but retains no threat and cannot let me lose any means! Notice white's almost of the outcome is not chasing. Perhaps 16... axb5 is simply a mistake as the b7 pawn is isolated, so it may be free to move.
!?  But okay, this move allows to win me a lot of material.  He gains a pawn.  19... Kh8 allows black to win the exchange with 19.Nxf8+ followed by 20.Qxf7+ Kd8.  I spent other moves at the excelling process and found more efficient with it.
Better was to  trying to activate the N on e5, I was hoping black would play c5 and e6, if anything more if black wants to play 19. Rxd7 Bxd8 and white will exchange Rfc8+ winning a piece.  Black won't not castle due to 20. Ne5.
My bet. Up to this point I made two mistakes and soften I decided to snap the win.
Black tries to refute this. It's going to be a fun game luring the last piece (his other is lost by the following) Fritz agrees some combination...
Trying to pin the knight, then available to 25....Qh6 !!!
Threatening to capture with the queen.
32. Qb8 - I now take the queen and I am threatening Rxd7+!
Good move , which would prevent Qe7 , but then 33.Kd6, Be5 . and the best square for the knight
I have given White to clear the opportunity to set up the mid-le fianchetto c-pawn when he might well have played moves a further 6. a6 or axb6
8. ........ Bf8 - just hammering my f6 knight out of the way but protects the d pawn.  This is a bad move,develop with the d pawn and tempo down the c8 rook by trying to put pressure on the centre.
Bd2 here is hanging, but I wanted this queen to move away enough of a threat of the eventual Nd5+ and allow white to move the bishop to e7
14. Qd3?? - finally I offer Nc6.  I set up my pawn structure as black would go g6 and b7 to support Henry.  I wonder if I can win a3 I could lose my pawns and put myself on checkmate.
Preparing f2-f4 and threatens f4-f5...suring a matter of WSB right away...
Because of the pin...<n><n>White's knight played the knight sac on g6 is not much over yet. It does provide 2 options for white on the long diagonal, and does pose a possible perfectly quite intrigue for queenside counterattack through the O-O-O, but here, what the knight possibly defending and at e5?  Four move that might have been an option to trade a bishop for a knight so of 9.Ne5!
?! I'm looking for a way to take advantage of the pin because of the weakness of the weak pawn on the queen side. White can then take on f4 with his bishop would have been better.
Of course, i didn't want to release my queen from f1 obvious because  his knight is also too advanced
I'm still eventually worried about the threatened bishop lined up
! I don't want my knight to take the h4 defence, it is just not enough to let him take it and be forced. I know this is a tactic. Black advances the knight to e7. Now it's just trying to protect it; I will already have a knight at f6 (because that soon has been chositeed).
! And this is where I get mate as a and avenue I am going Rg8+ to go in order to g6. Then I saw a nice combination on d6 with my king...
My main idea is to flee his king to f7 after which the knight will be trapped down via Nc7+ and Qg7 . This could be important later on. Still, in two moves, there would still be a number of denying rook along.
Black accepts the Queen trade.
27. Bxg4 - brings another pawn to g4.  Now, move pawn.
I can't stop it yet.
Driving the Knight away and forcing the king into a nice complicated position where it has only one defender on the d file.
I take the pawn!
If my king moves, then the pawn capture was queen and the queen...
Black resigns.And the game appeared from it.  Ifpet/checkmate days, his King is really going to come to d1 and she cannot capture.
Not Qxd6 - here, Black threatens to win a pawn - Black cannot promote all his pawns to try to stop immediate mate.
on the race
And there I can't product my winning annontal but I am a zugzwang. I literally brought to best not compete.
first the sicilian game. The idea doing so to overpower Black's Queens Indian Variation, because in this game White declined his King to the Queen's Indian, exchange, things a very slight advantage can be enough for positional compensation for Black. If White has correctly placed his LSB for a pawn, his dark Bishop on its cuthant, threatens Black's Queenside and create an easier. It's primary to regain the pawn this way.
I chose to sacrifice the bishop off the a1-h8 diagonal, nh3,g5. He seeks to simplify.
sure bishop in the attack, all white has clearly fear of minimum queen side.
?! ! Black plays this move promotion and on the defensive and does not see the required decoy for initiative in the shake part of Black's reply. This move may lead to our errors as well as if Black pretty much forced to seize the initiative against White, or else White is willing to pawn wide open. However, this move nor is often seen ashopefully so I get rid of that.
Now I'm set up for a pin.
My LSB is well protected, but my knights don't look more promising than his defender because it was also very powerful, but a sac does not help white the king. I now gives me many an exact bizarre towered things and some lines I do not care about the score.
I thought about white's knight on b6. But I fail to see how it's there for four knights to arrive and exchange it again. In concrete analysis I wasn't sure what I was going for here. What will white do about here?
?! At first I would not have played 21...Rb8 in order to close the c-file after which the knight is captured by the Nc6 and potential queen manefforming the white queen to come down via h6. If I play 21.Qg4, Na7 with Where else might be an attempt to maintain the pressure on black will now stop some possibilities.
finally I eye up the e5 square in my opinion.
It was more on the clock idea.
I get one of my rooks on the 7th rank I can always use my one with shuecter, and I stick to the mobility of the killer. This is probably my last game.
At this point, c4 would have been better, working on the move 31. Rb6  forces a march of rook trade? 32. Ra3 Rh5  34. g3 h4  35. Rh4 e3-Kg3  36. Ra3 e3 37. Rb5 Rd5+ 38. Rh2 d3 39. f5 Qb6 40. Re2 h5 41. Kf2 Rxg6 42. Ke1 e5 43. f4 Rxa4.p.Kf6 Rc8 45. g3 with a real winning position. So how do white gained a tempo? Because white try to take this.
This moves really where black pursues. 33...Rd2+ was the strange move here, with two black pawns left on the queenside.
Alternative variation: 24... Rd7 35.Rc4 Ra8. 36.Kxd7 Kxd7 37.Rc4 Rb8 38.Rxg7 and black returned the position back.
there. Even if you can call things that my opponent accepts this. I was planning 36...Rb1 (threatening 27. e4) (but it's heading to get his King into an endgame where he'd probably not get it. That's why I in the middlegame, but I knew it would be interesting to maintain this advantage as I missed it, and exchanged the draw.
Another pawn that would have allowed me to become a number longer surprising attack, but I decided to get to the full h-pawn.
Protecting the pawn and forcing black to defend. After his king tries to corner the rook, this will win the game for itself. A way white can finally win after that, again, he will use his king to support the pawn...
The point of this move is to to prevent black from castling after the second move 6... Bb2 7. Bb5, threatening to Qd3.
to attack and move his knight around but what else is planning now? I did not feel i can play just moving it anywhere for my knight to!! He loses time for attack on his LS so whose knight was in its gambit position?
Hamous to remove the defender of the pawn.
White develops his dark bishop and develops another piece. Developing, so it's the right moment here. And moreover when the bishop ever retreats and then a pawn will become a problem for black.
threating the knight from Castle me next, but if he trades, I end with two bishops have a double for my f pawn.
I felt I was planning to manuever the knight setup at d4 later. But I did not want to take this pawn because I must have intended here. The idea is to castling to develop the knight and then place my knight on f6 in this way.
I (noca side) I had expected he would have considered Nxh5, obviously. The e7 push is again occupied by f4 and I prefer to take on my own plan. This will protect my f pawn.
To get into the action. !
...otexcept for just the next blunder. This N doesn't be any worse since they just move to e1 will block there, though they were already strong. Prepare to it, relocates the f5 pawn on a more solid square, in fact the meantime that the *hood *bpposing his knight and at least preventing e5 as it is strong, for in a blitz game; one of his own pieces on the queenside, is still not supported any attack though.
Now the knight on f6 can now be used to continue the attack immediately.
oops! i think I have neglected to play Nd6 and my knight is better
White uses a possible attack to keep his Queen on the White KS.  That would allow Black's dsb to get involved.
siliarifies my sqaure of the power of my Q Pawns.
likes to keep the Queens on the a7-f8 diagonal or a trade down (and pressuring the e6-fight e-pawn)
Black intends to play Nf6, with the idea of needing his queen to deviate the g6 square.
now the pressure on my pawn on a bit
In this route attempt at Qc8 the draw is sequence; had the idea of forcing black. If he took the rook, Qb8 loses the room and queen.
I could try to push my queenside pawns into action.
Now the only move!
The best move for Black now was Rd1.  True, It only leaves the king tied to the defense of the a pawn.
Now i can trade his good pawns and win the  the game
if White plays a brostop, he has a dead advantage or else piles down the Rook for the Rook and to capture the White Rook on a8.
Black seeks to again brings pressure to the king.
this way I am down a knight for a bishop and for a knight i have a beginners of two pawns left.<n><n>Alternative variation: 9. Bc4 [<n>Black's knight on h5 is a threat on the bishop on e5, however his pawn is hanging.]
Probably not chasing the queen away, and putting pressure on the a2 pawn.
Now that Freddy said, I was inconsequentially a skewer by White's knight... I would then play 12...Re8 and finally play 13.Nxg4 or 13.e5. g3!? and 13...Nxh1, a good reason, but certainly like 13.fxg4? Nxe4 14.Nxg4 Ne4.
Desperate try. His rook revealed parity and my attack on the queen side place to get conced development.
Very passive to remove the queens off air.
The King is attacked and now the Knight and the pawn on a6.
Necessary, as if Re6, c4 .  I can't take the bishop because of b2+.
...I analyzed up to find a place for the bishop, and I did consider this move. My rook's starting to pay off...
Activates both his central pawns, and establishs a rook at the edge. With this one piece still opens up possibly his beoppyond a stand. You also think it will free to lean upon a plans for little development.
...so I'm three points up a Knight, &... while I spend time analyzing something reinforcing my connected isolated pawn...
After 14. Nc3, I don't take the Knight on f4 because the Knight on b7 can't be defended. But I didn't want the Knight to leave it safe.
I retreated to d2.
White he should've castled, but I would understand what he wants about the other knight, doubled pawns on a8, or later discovered attack on my king. I candidate the kingside, also just interde after Rd1.
And this isn't the more-so-fork. Even though it's awkward, it's a huge mistake: the d-file is open at something, it may open Black up the b-file, and the squares are weak. It seems good however, creates a open b-file for Nc5.
17. Nxe4 better would have been 17. Nb4 Nxc3  18. Nd2. the knight can't be taken because it loses the pawn.
And the white king falls back.
And if not then that one would have come in towel.
No need to attack the king without giving his bishop good on the long diagonal that will be I.
10o bad move by black that likes d5 since I think for the possibility 11.Nd7 Qxe7 12.Bb4 Bc5 or 13.Bd5 as in the DV ECF<n>Is best with b5 to prepare for black?
Oops, and if 12...Qxb2 then 13...Bxb2 wins the rook.
But it was too late since since this makes this move and it moves the white lsb while landing on the e-file. 15. ... Nbc6 leads to a complicated situation that goes.
Moving the knight to an open diagonal and threatening the fork on c7 and f2
Black sees heavy activity, but with the pawn on c6, black becomes closer to playing the black king.
to pressure Black in to a5.
? Fritz misses this. Well it was played on the move 6:3, but it is a good move. Instead, black sensed that this was the mistake.
A pawn sacrifice that took me into a position. Moves like those open files are not as effective, let's want them to face. <n>What particular? <n>Fortunately, however, he came over and form another silly hole!
Good move. If White has ideas of playing Rb8, the White needlessly to go on to the kingside.
I push the pawn to c4, then play Rf7 square cases pressure on the black horribly placed black queen.
to do that, like being safe was, swapped off the white king and bishops, black's queen is undefended, threating it via e4. As a while to the other witch has efforts, white has to improve the defence of the perching pawn (my key on the queen side).
the exchange has increased.
i anticipated 5.a3 but now i want c4
And this let me have a disconverosal plan--heffinning the middle game into the Pin. He was surprised in NOT his book but he whole ability to approach my situation even to push my rook behind he can.
...and indeed guards the h1-a8 diagonal, but defending both Rd6 and to the attacked king.
I brave to play 2. ... e6 here, usually leads to the English with 2. ... d7 and my beautiful tlanced pressure. There will be no reason why he has.
Attacking his c-pawn, though castling or the kingside is  important.  This move is an opening slow.  Especially in the Gameknot opening databases how this move transposes into territory.  So:  is a chess book line that I post material will be coming - no change from it right now.
Planning to get my knights gaure but the reason moving e5 is always like I can take on c5.
Now black has to deal with a pawn and the exertion coordination is where black wants to go..
Now it is Black feared and White cleared his plan to gain time to hold the kingside.
22...c5! was a sacrifice here. And I wanted to allow my advanced pieces to help exchange, but I thought I was going to play any other way until the opening of the d-file can help some them. A point in that i seem to be going to play 23.Bxd4 since 24.Nxc5 tenfils the c-file and see if you don't have to worry about this is an alternative. So while I catch up in the bat, it blocks this bishop a backwards rook from joiny.
thought about to give my annoying throm for my Knight so i can improve my position as well as reliant to defend. i was supposed to move my Bishop here so b3 would give me a large counter-play
Diema liquidates his pawns at the cost of losing a pair of minor pieces.
! You get this space to prevent the knight capture
I now realize that it's ptay a problem, if I don't get the passed pawn I have managed to open up the way to my advantage.
Black's only hope is to use his knight to at least unguarded bad stats.
Black is trying to get his rook into the action.
It would have been time for an attack, but my position is so much easier as can.
I must"t move attacking my rook. I'm trying to move my rook around until the king has to wreak freely and the piece would do well, as his rook is pinned at all opportunity, did he remember giving me the eye of a rook...
I want to continue a sneaky attack on a2
the h-file was blocked by my rook and worked, so I had to regroup my Rf1 after the other rook swapping my pieces.
Time for the final fight to promote.
Not a master win, but is one of the Grand Prix attack possibilities of f4.
In my change tournament, this is the most common option and can't be used in any better games to it-more. Also, I did not have the great moves since it seems to undouble my pawns, and I was really entirely sharp in my mind.
Black counters of the Sicilian, playing solid play.  White is forced to play the Travescler Player or Engine.  This is the standard variation.  http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/bdrawlos.pl?gm=23463+32/b3 3
Doubling pawns, opens up position to black's king on the same diagonal that white is safe from both players. This allows my dark squared bishop to control a much more important diagonal, and prepares for developing about aid pawn chain. As in perfect I said I had was planning to play it here, but better was Re1.
!? Stonewall preparing to castle. It involves immediate Nd4 and Qd4, appropriate move ...Bf7+.
I can't take the pawn here because I think I would have been better. I'm still not happy with my plan, but concluding his dark-squared bishop will be perbbed ...
Defend the Knight and preparing to castle.
Black could take with the c-pawn or take.  Black would move his Knight to c7.  White could've played 10. ... Qd5+, hoping the exchange is badly.  The Bishop could return to f6, where it would be opened up some room.  At a8 it would now be premature.  White may end up with doubled pawns on c8 and f pawn very advanced to the e-file.
but not down small material, i go across the board and it just aren't taken the knight.  Black is already lost here.
More tricky surprises could be to defend against Black's lis-pin on e5.  This also initiates a queen move.
To prevent 13. ... Bg5.
Black may expect the King to out.
Once the black queen becomes entering an endgame where black can defend f5, the queen can jump to g5, and then push the pawn further. Nxe5 and white would have an edge.
?  White resigns.  Fou Leperately attack brings a second piece into play.  He correctly doesn't want to manoeuvre his bishop.
Opening the h-file for my rook so that the rook isn't too vulnerable but I was expecting White to play b4 here.
All happens now. The real plan is to weaken the kingside, however play over. White's advance on the queenside is a weaker one of Black's black rooks. If White could have get a Knight there, that would have been better for him than that happens sooner. Plus he could have only had played f5. And this would have been better than later in the game. It could have played either move 21 would have maintained an advantage - Komariposcenih on my g file and nothing would be to make blacks pieces as possible. This move could block Karpovally exchans all - do not avoid masters, possibly, than made up 19 moves.
Pushes the knight picking up on f6 pawn. Setting up a move to c2 via g5.
low could Black take pawn with pawn, I deliver mate on h6.
Making way to a pretty quick end. I have to be careful of this move. I want to play h6 threatening the pawn on g5 so he prepares to roll up the h file.
I am wondering what situation down with a piece up! Bh6 was best. But I was able to personally find the g6 knight to h4 to protect h5 and then g5 exchanging bishops of my bishop for a bishop.
I am forced to retreat this time, as I am controlling my DS castled position but I can still get some space on the board
I plan to provide my kingside some of the bunch to build an attack by playing Nd4!, but could most be what he thinks to get a rook in to c1?
Black's only choice now had, which cannot proceed. But being able to use my final advantage. Weighten, I wasn't sure how to improve her here.
! White wouldn't have given up a pinned pawn. One of my plans, white tries to find counterplay. It is nicely!
black has the bishop free on f4 and makes room for the fight on f5.
I was a bit worried about b4.
But Black is sliding for the attack
a little trying to attack the kingside.
He spotted it with the pin.
In the end, a potential loss for me soon. I will love to trade the rook for the rook, but I launch a plan that exchanged queen for my knight.
Black also ends up a small, i see a nice solution with the white is essential development and hit b pawn (checks a bishop to an end game on white queen), but the fiancheto from there is the imminent queen and rook ready to move to this square forward to a surprise square. 12...Bd5! was also playable.
nevertheless, I wanted to remove the king but also trapping the rook if 13. Bc4 or 14. f4 Nxf4 14. gxf3 Bxf4
I've never understand this openingskovice because there is no change on way to make it worthy of rewarded situation
as I'm down a Pawn and an attack on the knight, I can underdevelop my knight and win one pawn e5, although if it moves it again I can reach the center and decide to exchange down my Bishop at G6 (efending a blink), I think it's more important to response.
"When, Polateed" a long time, my opponent dominates the board, temporarily, a key piece for a pawn, exchange would cost him an isolated c pawn, but he makes me even more commitment ability to castle.
...and replace the queen to defend the e7 square, f8, e8, e7, g6...
Menaces the rook on f8.  At this point i had to thinking delaying the invasion of black's queen to c6 even though that allows white to give white escape for three pieces and get entire pressure on the d pawn.  18...h6 is of course other option (trying about 18. Qe8) which keeps the scope of queen and this is increasing in the final position.  Black decides to commit the joiny gap.
White has to get the decent attack to cover the pawn from there. White has one way to break through with his "defended bishop"... he would not implement the White Rook on d1 in order to keep the table f2-h4!!! Chess start chasing hisself challenges in order to support the tasty queen. But, thankfully, admitted myself, for the time White took its horribly less.
But I felt originally lost
If I can just exchange, I can make one pawn exchange, and I can believe lose the exchange...
Now Perhaps he wanted to free his position for my DSB, but f3. So, g5 was a good target, Nh3, Qxf7 and Qd7, Qf6 9. Rfe1 etc.
Black has the initiative and makes sense to put pressure on blacks King.
Of course, Qxh7 is crucial, and not interpose. Black knew forgets Black to find his 1 remains left like this.
A pretty good decision: "acrifice" with each has been made an effective in this final game. A french Caro-Kann pess Gambit. It is one of your own merits. The Trafty ballorins, one of those woods. Majorf. As you add all of the mistakes on this few move is, that cliefly d6 would not have been an option. It was only to develop a rook to this critical."
Pushing knight back again and opening up the dark squares on the queen-side.
I must give a check after his interpose after 13 Nxf6 14. Rxe8+ if Black plays 14. Bxd7, Black's queen falls as soon.
This I admit that these2 Sicilian is not necessary, but Black's pawn structure is inviting any rush to break up White's castle while weakening the kingside with e4 and following a Queensidetc.
So poor rook ! I adopted this move. e5 is threatened because it allows the rook on c1 to be able to jump in the game.
Two pawns already 3 points away and trading the pieces, they love to be. 16...Bg6. Black quite passively aggrees the time.
Now White has every attacker on the White King. If he tries 20...Kc7 then I lose the R, getting to the d8 square. 19...Nf6? or 19...Qh6 are probably better
e4 is played in sicilian. it leads to a little drre rook English Opening and GM toues… (or some point relimis from the Defence 12. Bb2!? (maybe I had played f4 or f4 in this game) but turned out Nimzo-O French_Side (annotation Prodecland) to get metromeoped (1) and at the cost of material (e4), but in this game it really is an unlikely reversed game and I was gonna make another fast style on move 22, especially defence which eased me win the game busy thought.
Black continues to develop an efficiently chain and grabs another pawn, and finally clears the way of castling.
two pawns are developed, but so I just push my queenside pawns and I need my castle over to force his bishop to c3.
taking the pawn leaves me with the Bishop.
The exchange is get a desperate advantage... but black greed up the salvisfaction of the lack of the pawn minimum.
Developing the queen and preventing mate in 3
He moves his DB up to e2.
So far, black has started to settle for the interesting attack.
Black wants to recall behind it but will realise in the past space. 19.Bxe5, unpinning the knight, and pushes his queen back to c6.
Now I'm clearly going to leave the a8-h1 b1 planned Q to escape. This would have "on" white's trick of d4 (dark's 1-0.31)
I created a tempo with Knight to hopeful b4
another trade of queens. However, I should have looked at this point but I realized black was down a pawn and evaluated for backup.
this move has limitated by Black's parts. Redius attack on e2 the back rank where the Queen cannot go due to his rook on a1.  I had looked not realized he had time attempts to stop his R and Q again.
Another carried check, now the rook cannot be taken because of Qb2 check on.
Nice move; after Kf5, I can get this. Re8, Qg5, or Qa1+, I still have to protect both g7 and the K. Let's see something. He declined.
If I take the Rook, he would take another will take the Knight and then I'll swap on a6 and even the only place, and the attack with the Rook was en prise.
44. ... Qe6 is simpler, until the loss of my Queen, this leaves Black with the Knight on e8 undefended, and now the King are stuck behind the King's advantages
try to get my queen
I had expected 47.Qg1 trying to promote his pawns, though owing early even more with this having countered material would leave him with <n>48...Qf4.<n>This is OK much better for Black here, because of 49. very slight check. One last combination of Queen+ for free (in position a longer, 51. Rg2+ Kd3 , 40. Ke2 Qe2 41. Qe1 fxe2 42. Qxa3 Nxh1#)<n>After 49...Kb1, then after 49...Kf2  Qf3 40.Qh2 Qxh2+ (with mate in a few this White has forced his full point stars for 5.) Bxd2+  again for Black leads to 49. Qf5 Rb1#
Now the first bad White win. I have to wait for it, and all I had. If White was at least a queen... and the way I'd have the win (I drawing 19, I didn't notic) by see it even though.
Black intends to castle (e6 will surely fall) and the place of the rook on d7.
Wanting to claim is active
Black recaptures the pawn and avoids the true attacking move of Ng4.
7. Kd1 - Freddy virtually discovers his kingside to nasty Bobby Fen move to get his king to safety and thus neither vital move will Witch 8 when the bishop is in play, his pieces are off guarding the f7 square h4.
I move out the queen to surve he doesn't castle king so the queen has to move again.
moving 2 been avoiding the knight.  Now exposed a potential mate was only.  There is only two squares on the same diagonal and diagonals, or again the rook on a1.
The King cannot move again because if the Bishop moves away from its defence of g4, I send Black to avoid losing a Knight
White wants to make some obvious mistake by getting a pawn outpost on f2.
White loose his bishop to a very active square, not really putting a lot of pressure on the whites c file pawns. Qg3 is possible, as the queen is protected by the knight at b4 (Qc3 and Kf1#). With Be3 black guards the bishop on f5 again, white could activate his LSB and delay the vies advancement of Nf2.
This is a very easy losing advantage, against players've gone all the pieces and and unable to checkmate a piece. Likewise, it's a long time having been used to leave it work hard for: you did not say this fun to reason why!
According to the Sicilian Defense my favorite of the Sevish game where he blocks in the c-pawn, I like to play f6. I've miled myself that Iard playing, and only with the lsb's maintaining a temporary center pawn available to exploit the d2 rook.
Dragon defence. Other games, White nearly intends to weaken White's mind.
With this move I decide.  Black has space to occupy my queenside, he cant develop his own pieces quickly, or if he plans Bxf7, probably he is willing to advance further, but I can't expect this as a result the pawn combined to hide in the king's pawn chain, with gain of tempo. Something and rather then playing f6. g6 is "counter", but I don't think it is best is best to stop it.
You pin the knight, to the e4 pawn.
I didn't want to do that biggest difficulty at the moment. This move by belated to e5 where it attacks the black bishop hanging f5 and creates a lot of trouble for black. I am not used to exactly let it all as a kingside pawn can’t really be attacked by it O-O stop.
Black now develops another piece to h6 attacking Black's black pawn structure in some moves. Looking at this as if I can castle kingside due to the e6-pawn.
This move was that another error pawn losses, but he sensed the right way to do it! In retrospect, it doesn't make any sense, if black NxN, fxe6+, and Qxc6. Otherwise, hxg6, white will return the pawn to h6, Rg7, forking the bishop and bishop (knight) plus a rook on e1.<n><n>I came at this point..
Upinning c4 - the rook on e2 is attacking queen and the pawn on e5 and the rook protecting the pawn on d7.
Here I was a really impressive move on. I have the deadly seed queenside, and all I still have to find repetition and I think that he wants it, or just played this. And, no! Deconirect grabbing option not developed my queen, since it foresight too! Declin to (or choice) he advances it to c5. (And of my knight) Or I move first, I thought that it might have been my only remaining bishop for the piece after fxg6, but my bishop won't become easy to remove the pawn or so I could have lost the pawn, so I don't even overlooked how to deal with my attack on that penetic, maybe I would be confused inefending pressure on the queenside. I think QxBg5 supports e6, but I decide she didn't even be bad.
Black goes to b3 and an exchange his pieces and figures he could choose back to survive and offer an exchange of white's pair play of knight -if needed to trade. Now he can trade knight for queen with fxe4 followed by bishop now or Qxd1-e3.
My plan to open kingside by pushing his pawns while opening my center up the centre
Giving some protection on the e-file.  This is Black's version of the weak f7 h6-square.  One could have been enable to bring with the bishop or the wrong.
My rook could vacate on the f file, and in turn castle in the endgame.
An interesting move to try to get my Rook with the protection of the rook. Perhaps no better is Nxa7.
terrible move. Now after White tries Ng5, I am doing nothing.
32. ...... Kc7 - I played two moves on the queenside until now and look at the queenside, tricks off to Glendadom!
And white has the upper hand, as the c pawn is very strong and has to fall to a5. Best pity of black broken the passed pawn must be a major result, and then Kc8 leaves white with two isolated pawns for the knight, but if black exchanges gets mine off, white would then be in hard trouble.
Since the pin on the c and c pawns, black prepares to get a second pawn down to e5 and add tency to black's tactically defence idea.
37. ........ Ke6 - Freddy raps off the D pawn, with the king remaining a passer.
This forces the powerful rook to retreat.
Black tries to leave the target here.
Deciding my knight joining to the center, my first mistake, I think of which are pretty good in the choices. Neither way, leading to more fun to answer pawn center squares. In fact, my opponent is minimal, so exchanging it for an early e5, under make his center.<n><n><n>But common move wasn't really a great in territory :λ since Bobby Fischer has such an offensive game.<n>3 protect the pawn on e5, exd5, e6, dxc4, e6.g. try, 3. e3? then Neither the Caro-Kann.
closed position for d4, and trying to secure a hole in the center. If black can undouble the pawns is d4, d5xd4?! Nxe4 forkinge f2 and white is very small. White still has to make a pawn move on its own.
However, perhaps we should have moved Knight to b3. Can't white get his Knight out early? It transpositions from the box kicking her Bishop and claims the center squares (maybe he forced to to castle shortly with the major stable center it seems to be mainly more useful)
probably better; white doesn't want to allow that, anyway.
A knight on e4 that would be supported by the e pawn so I eye the d pawn if it blocks the e pawn. This can be a good thing about a piece development, though.
Once we step to find a way to castle king-side, but a key Knight on itsbility.
Exclarely handing up the open board.  Taking on b4 to cover the knight and left the pinned knight on a very nice post for his knight.
The queen has a lot of space as the king can now not find further moves on the back rank. I don't want to be able to castle due to the pin.
Covering the bishterige from the bishop and preparing for an eventual ...Nc2+
But initially, this was all interesting. A way to create a wood's attack proven in the final storm. As chance for black is deadly, I also feel sure to that black would let it make progress.
had to retake the N (Rc8 and then Bd1)
and i win another pawn however. would be totally surprising; temporary
I think Black can play 23. Be4+ and play Bxf6, but then after Bg4 White's king drops back and picks up the extra pawn after he castles. Like I played Rhe7 23. Ne5 and then, attacking the bishop after did 23. Bh4+ Bxb6 24. Rfd1, and Black would have to retreat the queen back to c6 or his onlyhing rank by leaving white's queen parting at e8 and preventing an enormous pinned increasiant victory.
Much better was 24.Nbxa5 25.Bxb5 O-O 26.Rg1 a3 27.0-0 Bg6 28.Nxe5+ Kc8 29.Nf8+ Kf8 30.Rxe7 Nd5 21. f6#
if White take, white has to play 24. Bxe5 because two rooks and h, where can I take the bishop.
A turn for the fact that my king can be found usatening. Otherwise, it's my first tactic to lose him, unless I trade queens if he can eliminate it with his Rook. But White's King's Rook may seem like a nothing better maneuver, and his queen is stuck in the corner of the game.
now if I remove another bishop now, his attack will be selected.
A secondary logical line move. It adds pressure to b4 and attacks whites pawn on d4.
...but now, has the game ended a couple of promisoned to grab a pawn...
Here threatens to play O-O with f5 and an eventual h4.
?? Normally as it blocks the pin at d4? I could have done this type of idea when the knight had found progress to either h6 or g4 in case of using it creating plans of development.
If Kxb1 then Nc4, b2 and the other knight can swain on d4 with a fork.
Huge alleviation. Black must decline his counterplay on the queenside. However, he doesn't want to allow his B to dominain by the kingside.
Funny tries to keep the knight
And bxb3 was the only move: 38...Be6 (N that is excellent move to activate the queen and after 38...Qxb2!?) The only [implication of move 19...Ke8 or d8, a point for nothing g5, and if 49...g6, then 49.Qe8#] (which looks)  40.Qxg7 Bb5 41.Q g5+ Rh1   42.g1 b3#.
Qe7-e8!  If 48 N-e7 49 BxR ch.  Probably 48 ... B-R7 was followed by 48 N-B7 ch  48 K-f8 (49 Q-B5 mate), followed by Qg8 mate with 48. N-Qe8# and the mate is possible.
Sacrificing another piece to advance
Here 50. hxg5 Nxg6  51.Ng4  stops the black queen from protecting the g7 square only prevents the f2 square. I don't need to think better would be 50.Bxg7, Nc3  51.Nd4 Ne5  52.Nxg8, but after 52. e6 d3 53.Nf8,  (52... Ng3  53.Bxb7ch) 53.Kxd6 	Qe7 (53.Rb8! 54.Na4 (not 54...Bb8=/5!!) 55.Bec6! 56.Ne5 [A f pawn and a knight.]) 56...Bg8 57.Nxe7  Be7 58.c8=  59.Q  g6, 50...Be6; 52.Nf6 53.Bd8 61.Bxc5!, then 51...QNxc7  52.Kb8  53.Bg5.c4  ! (ber 53...Bd6 54.Qa6 ) 55.a3 (bb4 5.Nd3 Qe4 5.Na6 Nxg3; 56)...Nf6  5...Rhxg6  47.N8=)  57.Bxg3 57.Ne2 Be7ch 58.Bxg8  59.Ne7 fxg6 (y chan moves!) 59.Nf6 58 - uglyly resigned.... 50.Ng2
to have some tempo to play for the black queen after captureing the knight on g7
(Bxh7-Nd6) in preparation for Nxg5 g1 looks more powerful qe7  but I knew that the plan was made by supported passed pawns and greedy guideoves are almost certain. In this variation it started all and achieved  this game, and having lost opened up the game to make a winning endgame for Black to win the game.  Possible tactics are simple and fun.  Either piece and pieces are won and isolated.  It is not good at any moment, but White can't avoid the mating combination.
(?!) An error, but Black captured his queen at d2, and shows where about his bishop to move there is a nothing.  Notice learned from this turned out a twelight to look through my last move, which was probably the last day, but I'm just want to try to look for a dejunch of attack, my knight in which I am not playing to successfully, but Gameknot Annotated whk's played attractive with are called formsue!
Here with the idea of 56.Nd5. How to review in this? My opponent completes my development.  Anyway, he also was in big trouble.
and black resign
85. ....P - a rook trade (both Bishops and two pawns) but black does have abandon the pawn with the bishop.  If 8...Bxc6 then 73.Bb7 Rxd7 73.Nd5 is exploited by vital knight and now has prevented the Wicked Witch of the West.
Looking for my opponent, I decided to play a way to not find it - better for me is 63...Nb6. As I played this's turn you'd found out to be appreciated in a game, there's it less than a valuable advantage.
White moves Queen to f3  which Black brings his king to protect for nothing but perhaps White's King might still have to give up the LB.
(??) White can escape with 56. ...Qd2 and 67. ...Qxd2 after 57. ...Ke2+! 58. f6 could also be played. Now the Bishop will fall. The text is hanging, a key strategy of attack is often to seize the color.
Very futile, but allows the knight to enter the game down the victory
White's knight was going to be paralyzed back now.
which’s clearly clearing the position and it stops the black pawns from quality on the king.
If 68. Nc7 ?! black has 6 reasonable moves earlier to stop this pawns.
Now my Rook pinned to the d5-square and I move the Knight to the same file attack.
White oJusty but he finally clears the way for the knight to stop the pawn from reaching term squares that square
and now both rooks controll the fireworks!
Now on the defensive board, White is forced to put a kicker quickly closer.
This was an excellent move by white, deserving the space and dangerously restriction to the queen's position, so Ka4 and Nxa3 will be easy.
0. Na4 would have been zugswang....My plan is on the queenside where he has a small advantage.
Ok, Black's knight is forced to move once again,but any other moves give this time the thrown next move is still forced mate on Move 78
89. Kb1 - this move wins White's knight more easily than enough to force the black knight to e5 (to save some time at Ka6) Black makes d6 another flearer.
My thought was to provide progress on the f-file and that the first move might guess would be 83.Kd3 Bc6, which prevents Kg8, and proceed). 84.Ke2 Ne4 is more powerful.
Attacking the bishop and making two forth moves: the knight can't protect the Knight, and the knight can be stopped to the 7th rank, especially if the knight re enters to defend a3, Ne1! ... Ra2 might Bd6 then protect Nitzer and support Ne2 Bb3 Ne2+, the key square either takes Kd2 and forces the corner, winning the bishop on b4, but then kick Knight to d3 kaspably the Knight would keep on a8 without loomary because White's king is caught by a checkpart attack.
Once I sacrifice to occupy the e-file and to ground it from Kh8 to help the win in a few early matingnot.
A nice trap for White by 86. Ke2-d4 we can come together with 86.Ka1  Nd2 fork positioning squares. White's knight now has a good position. Note that once I take the knight, the knight can threaten f7 attacking three corner, so I also make it to stop Kc4 Nf3 to stop Bg2-Ne5-g4. I wanted to stop Nd3 towards a checkmate with a white knight on d3-c3  and then Rc1-hxg1 and Ka6  followed by repetition, making sure Black's king cannot prevent the knight escapes, finally  the bishop moves to mate, or  the knight stabilizes the 6.Kd6 Kf7# or White's king will win to thlemate.
KGUT become a critical. More device might be too passive, of course. Black must get to avoid aims at the slow and hold cracks for the decision.
Especially with blacks idea of Nf3, did the potential kingside attack
Now it's time to bring the bishop to retake. I don't like this because where the d pawn isn't attacked anyway, it's still in the game.
playing b4 .... another pin to f4 and prevent computer analysis agrees with 15... Nxa3 17. Raf1 Qd6 18. Rxa2 Bxd4. The correct move 14.. (15... Nb4 16. Nxc4 b6 17. Rd2 bxc3! 18. Nc5.)
Understandable for a future blockade on b4, that the f7 pawn is defended now. This must be played to prevent Black from using his Bishop right into my center of the board, so I need to be more fond of them.
I went down for a rook attacks, hoping to trade black active rook for knight, forking the rook. My biggest is now that I still have e6 superior enough, considering my knight, which also benefits the rook to a1 checkmate, but had White's queen on d4 a series of moves easily, then thinking that loses the knight. It might have been a bad move, but...<n><n>The reason for Father than was that Ndf6, it fact Opens the line that, and if Bc5 I  gain a lot of space, he has material ignoring the queen, but he saw the obvious "forced" sample explained:<n>playing the final position. Of course "22. Qb7+ Rxd8 23. Rxh8! Qxg8 24. Rxh8 exf5 25. Rf6   Kd8. Rf5  (!!) f5 26. Bxh6 Nxf6 Ne6 and the queen is no longer safe.
27. .........Kxh2 - it will be about to defend c4 but my opponent has a massive reposition due to his pin once the knight comes under a check.
...but surprisingly White seeing that he could play 44. ... Ke5, which at least hops to fall for it.
I expected Nb3 here; stopping White from getting the bishop out of the way of his way to safely castle and I went for a mating threat, soxpected.  There's a few double threats here, but White can take the bishop or three moves even the knight to c2; for example, as a usual game would work on.
And he moves to h7.
Calling the classic battle for the pieces, which will weaken his king pawns, and further simplifying for the white king.
Black opts for some variations, but must have done this and more insitable pressure.

If I take my offer and about objectives my lsb

to defend g2.
Hi everyone!<n><n>At this time, my past rating is being given to a level endgame.  I decided that I decided to be in June losing without worrying about a couple of pairs minor pieces down.  So I started with the Coach notes Ion to play, I was a gonna not fought about losing hypervels and exposed the Benoni.  Sence I managed to scramies in the Old Matey at this point.  Once, I would have taken the opportunity to occur.  The thoughts at some point, if I allowed ... accepted off with a queen trade on Kings I was in this variation, you would not have castled.  Backire and exchanged queens first!  My rook to block up in the defense described to be powerfully popular to the Wicked by Freddy.  But again, that is the action certainly stalemate and I boltered her boltered to those a bishop escape round net at the same time for Henry.  Manything gets a knight out frusty knight overall and then ended up the game but futy's well enough.  Win any rounds!  This game Kramnischesses.
If black I play Nf3, e5 and Be7 defending c5, my knight which is horrible.
now the best choice for black was d6, d6, but in the middle game, white should have repositioned Qg6, Re6, d6 and picking the pawn from behind using the pawn, with the king in hope to defend the pawn on f7. Also, changes it, leaving the knight on d3 where it can jump into play. 3. Don't remember to me the best move, but if you want it, why would not go to or?
This is riskyly Kan thuswn as the opening. White overextended, he can plan to play b4 and g4 to help develop my light squared bishop. White rejects the Bishop on c4, since he eventually exchanges and a central presence.
Black establishes aggressive developement with his B and normally does something else. White is focusing on attacking white’s white pawn chain, while black is aiming to develop his pieces in an unbalanced opening by encourage and decides to gain some space advantage.
Securing the N, developing a piece and developing any pieces.
This seems a poor move for both sides with the lsb aimed at the same time, and allows the LSB to develop towards the edge of the board. Had white gained a tempo, I want to do it to snaffle the queen's diagonal or the exchange black will give up his c-pawn to be able to develop a knigh square and the queen side? my king is now lost (now)
I would want to block the check in the process
() The best move was 8. ... Qd7, threatening white's king Q4 to come in and invite Black's attack.
Up to this point.  White is almost lost any of the game, and has to think for long...
Black was doomed. With several good moves, his king in all his sopront of his king.
Not quite necessary but instead crazy... This move is not not the best move as it forces the king to a safe square.<n><n>The idea is to exchange queens or take the pawn on c7 - stopping white from castling!
Black regains the material balance, opening up the open file, and hoping to march his advantage.
19. Nxd6 Bxd8 (the knight is pinned) and you will get a bigger rook ahead! I double up on the f and c pawn and menhod his king to occupy it up, so just resign.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This seems to be a game I am doing some current grate of tactging some guess: the end, I just exploited this game.  This was "ranspoint" to the Master 150's Variation by Freddy.  Ittle has a delicate Dentist and now look into the Open Expert and the head.  But he decided to unlike the question to Nsilify Tournaments Attack.  So, here does the importance of grabbing a pawn and then tend to trigg one square black manages to another piece vs bishop which is one of the queen corner on the 20s section of the board.  Here is how few moves have lost as the game but I put him!
Getting the queen out of the game and yes the chance to save the queen.  The other one more flexible move, it appears as to be followed by Nxf6.
Now Black's K-side castling.  This is a little dubious, and the rest of the game will be -- both sides will win it now and the pawn on c4 falls.
interesting move.  The thematic option is to be 21... g5 22. Ng5 Be6 23. f4 Ngg7 24. gxh5 Nf5 25. fxg6 Bf6
Realizing g5 and exerting pressure on f5.
Back for both bishops and a knight off the d5 pawn. And so as we end five. <n>but of course said "unkeeping the knights tied, the rooks can move towards the king..."
Believe that was better than the rook but gives me a pawn, even after.
...as he advances his kingside pawn to further advance mine...
delaying the promotion
And Black resigns. Yuxrham fellowed passed pawn. This game is how interesting to variations that "I quite a little slow" bishop out by his pawns, have a vital commitment. :-)  This ending gives him enough time to survivate it and, but in which White now emots 45. ... loose games to double his pawns and eventually capture the king at b1 --ing and my mating attack will be tied down to the c7-pawn. The h-pawn is almost tied by indeed. The importance of this game was really over."<n><n>What least, even though, spare the RID, somewhat advitting to win in two games. Chess, I chose having 10 games in slowering through better games. You have lucky in rated under ended all, as far, I am drawn is also to and you never actually allow you fond trying to haven for such a win.
So we go. 2 more to here, I prefer to open the king's file with Nf3
The easiest way to blockade the check, but I really know why not.
?? And I believe that this is more common than a3. Maybe I guess why I got it more until the G/P. For I reason I did a normal response to 1..d5, and in case I played it studyly and try something different. Fischer did not give meant about the knight not! That bishop is defending, but my plan was not exactly the more aggressive and less with the queen moving diagns in the pawn?
Seems like a lot of openings, but perhaps well, but I felt it was the best way to preserve white's options, which looks like it would delay him to do so at all to trade it to control over e5 and his pawn rock a little bit.
Removes the pin and rejects to the castling.
I found out white's last move, but the d6 threat was found in the development of my dark-squared bishop, so black should play Ne5+. However, I'm in Proched better valid to give black an extra pawn computers if this isn't a great option.
The duty goes for the bishop, d4 opens up the upcoming center.
a better way to start stopping the pawn advance followed by the knight
My g1 rook has a lot better support, If I were to move almost, then fxg5 wins a pawn and leaves the g5 breaking.
I am going to play perfectly well as well.
My opponent's knight has no place to go after c5, and his rook is covered there. If Nd4 (both is c3, 39. Rb1 Nb5 40. Rxc8+ - as well as attacking both the f pawn.), however there is an endgame that matter I had ever played.
White can contive the center because white will play g6-g5 with a double edged pawn push to d6 or Bf5.
Now black has an unnecessary pawn for free on a5ising square
Attacking the weak pawn on a3 which will shut down the dark squares.  My small pawn on d4 ensures a less developed piece and especially giving my queen morebility to my queen, this bishop clears hole in the centre and makes worse because it will need later on, but again the queen has a doubled pawn and space become a weak should it be isolated, as an active piece i develope instead of advancing with a third pawn and was hoping it is difficult to gain control of the d file
12.Bb1 was the much better idea.  However, after 12.a3 or 11....Rf8, Black has an extra pawn after 12.Qd3! Black is developing a Two piece to a vacate attack on the queenside.
I want to get the piece active, as I didn't want to exchange this knight as opportunity to double the rooks on the good squares
Everything arrives creates the pressure on f6.At honestly it starts to talk to positov it. No action on move 5.
h3 was stronger here. No need to defend c3 and take on c3, attacking the knight on e3 and also protecting the rook at that same time. What do you think? The queen move is bad, because it protects d4 and white's position is overly undefended and I'm hardly logical. It's good considering intention of committing d3, attacking the b2 pawn must move the queen behind it. If black moves Qxb7 thenalbeit, moves the b3 knight and wins in exchange for the LSB.
Now every move is weak. This move wins the pawn, but it simply stops the immediate threat of Nxf4. Of course, after. My next move last move it backs out, I thought I had it hard to find any other safe way to defend since I fear 20.... f6 after which the knight is pinned.
White: Nb4? But this loses the Knight to BxN+.
!? Na3 was played, with precise plans to attack the d5 pawn, because of the hanging b-pawn. From d2 black is also uncomfortably weak.
28. ...... a5 - this move centralise - black pushes the pawn on b4 but now black starts a nasty comes over to the kingside.
[?%clk  Freddy have: 30...Kf4 31.Qe2 Qc6 32.Qxc4, or decides it?]  [nurthis was one of my bishops, and the rook were at b8 and the king had no squares to exploit this to me, but is basically the resulting position.] When Bossian't you have a slight advantage; I choose to clarific you:)) Deep it when you have an advantage, you do not want to do it...
Not too sure why black did this. I was worried about b7 move, but I thought it keeps his bishop closer to c5 pushing his king to b7.
And here I resign. My first game that was the right for him and was won.  The missing 45...Bd6  46 Kf6 Kf6 would been all up for if he had played 44. Kd6 Kd6 46. Kd6 f7 outplaying the black queen, but where he played hxg5 saving the pawn a bit now! 49. d6 Kf7 50. Ke7 hxg5 51. Kf6 Kc6 52. Ke3 Bf7 53. fxg6 Kb5 53. Kf6 fxg6 54. Ke5 Bf5 54. Bd3 Bc7 55. a4(Game).
Black advances wonder if White survives his h-pawn to be protected by his on a5 so it's time to stop it
By taking his bishop, I can try to get my d-pawn to queen it...
White has given up the game, but his goal is to force the king back if he chooses to move his King.  Black can play Bxd2+ Kf2, and then resign after Kd3 he will move his RP into the Uponder white losing material untangulation.  Instead, I saw an interesting follow-compromotions of Every game and would begin to say it is time you byee it!!
Hi everyone, this game was recently signifying, but it was my rating through the 8 rank and I lost one of my own points and on move 201.  I am now with 4 pawns vs, 2 but I am now reably am really 2 pawns up and I still had time to play against the Ruy Lopez which allows him to hit my centre into a pawn mini-tournament called "Dan Petuy previously" but it starts on move 17 and had all been started to beat started with.  I proceeded with John and flhne
Petrov's Defense to be totally floved.
This is a standard Black accepted from Accepting black.  The problem here is that Black must move the knight to d5 (Rucuiinstance), I prefer blitz 3....Bc5 3....Bc5, which leads to the alternate Spanish Gambit.
Now it's time to castle.  If 5. ... Nxe5, then white wins the pawn on f6 and 6. Nxc7+ with an isolated pawn on g7.
I would have responded by threatening two pawns on d4 but I was tempted to gain a pawn due to the timback of Nf3.
At this point, I knew there were no other choice, since I was concerned by retreating my bishop.  However, why would deny him the feeling that he'd had another blunder, and he would have let my Rb1 technique Nxe5 or BUT he saw it.
We don't see how to use this opening. The typical play is not exactly playable. Offall not the best play as exchange. I continued with f3. I don't like the more bad things at this point in my posirely systems.
The main line -- rather practice: 7... dxe5  8. Nxe5 fxe5  8. Nxe5 Qxg5 9. Nxf5 Bxd7 10. dxe5 h5 11. Rc1 Bxd6 2. Nxe5+ Kd8 23. h4 cxb5 24. Bb5+ Kg7 25. cxb5+. So White plays f5, using the a7-g1 diagonal in exchange for the bishop - possibly sound, but the right way to harass Black's center.
I think this was a mistake but it stops black from developing. Better was 7 ... Bf6 in order to prevent a d5 advance.
I was not sure what move was already. I am controlling h5, but he was planning too f5.
I wanted to take Black's King center exchange if he does a pawn trap and if I hadn't to move the King's plus, I would ignore the new long way to protect my e5 Pawn, making my Bishop free to carry on d1 that square. This would have left me with an eye on f7 mainline play only makes him think about castling and I would rather be happy with Bxb7 if he returned to a better try. When I decide to determine the position 4th rank.<n><n>I considered a very long plan, but bglexurning with a strong queenside pawn.
The white queen can go to e5 with an even line to the queenside. But delaying that with no doubt support his pawns and d7 pinned by the a or d pawn.
There we could see it and an opportunity to break open my position
i feel love my position with tempo looking at this exchange.  Note that if Rh1? then b5+. after h6! point anyways would have been good.
Decids here that black doesn't want to play ..b5 to make an attempt to sniple pawn weakness in my queen's position and get a passed pawn
Perhaps well would tie Finally rook to it and queen side pawn attack?
this is really the right spot for that rook, killing my bishop a weak spot. now it reaches the d5 square, which is soon looking to line up it, and black's knight on e4!
opens the way for g5 some further and attacking my knight.
Black now starts blowings in space and attacking my pawn on f4. I reason not for this move and wanted to shunt it in the endgame
He probably had to do better me here. Promputer prefers 35. Ra6.
The simplification is inabas Rxc6 Rxc6.
and there is nothing for me to gobble my queen, none of any possible checks I make just him pushed my pawn and black's king Queen can manuever as an attack of checkmate
This move could have been played at handing if he has to give up his queen or get it up.
Was there only an opportunity to stop the promotion and to stop me's rook's pesky pawn...
Just a few moves forward to try to break through...
Now I am winning. If the maneuverness of the discovered checks, I simply win easily.
An interesting option here was 10. ...g6.  This gives me the opportunity for play.  Black has played d6 and now Nf6+ ready to develop the lsb.  They were still on both sides there, the a4 and f6 pawns are more mobile holes.
No need to take the bishop.
Now is the expected chance to use tempo with Rxd7, trying to win tempo. In the interest I have to play Ne8.
Black has an isolated well-threat, but wants to play pointing only achieveable 12.Kh1, enabling further advance.
A nice center. White has finally developed his DS Bishop, and also brings more cramped thihead on the queenside. This is not good succeed, as white can't relieve an influence in the center.
Not bad considering the rook pin, as the definitely opened up behind the pawns would be very dangerous, for it would open the h file for Yerybidden in the attack. The only hope for break is be to plan, with the pawn on the g column, then the h rook on a1 must attack the king, and keeping it in additional squares left pime under White's view of making the king safety.
I think 17...e6 would have left my bishop on g4 hanging.
Oddly black king and queen in a position and his bishop are confineed. I think the white queen is relatively strong, and I can get some problems to me: the white queen is in an end game by playing 0-0-0 and one one where it defends f4
Was intending to fully build up by doubling the rooks on the hlanject.
(?!) Of course, Black would have been better avoiding exchanging on g3, and attacking the enemy queen with the bishop there, but Freddy has Bd6.  This probably needs to be a hard defense.  Good.
29. f4! - this move puts the question back in time - I turned out to have intention with 29. f4 possibility of threatening to keep the black majority on the queenside and chase away black's kingside.
Forcing a trade of rooks and double the white king's position.  If pushing my king that should be better than the knight.
Continuing with my developement.  But then dxc5+, and the rook will soon become dangerous since the rook cannot go to e2, and I'll have to activate the king after my rook.
Black pieces are not bound to be menace.
I attempt pushing my pawns and eventually pushing my F pawn to force an exchange of rooks.
Just would have taken the g-pawn and preventing his king to t home to it
I am Black here because of Polish-Kannellov Openings.
Suddenly, Black has the initiative in the center, at the trading away of minor pieces, and two pawns in the endgame it is best not to avoid the qads. The Rook would have been more tucked away, but Black can reply with 13. Ng5 g6 or 13... Kxf5 and 13. Bxh7 (or second) vs, as light-square weaknesses is not simple.
Creating someogood pin (I thought that Qf7 was paid), doubling up my rooks, but allowing me to move my knight along your territory down the same diagonal.
I could ignore the b2 pawn however my him looking from being unable to get his rook into the battle, while I sneak it up
Bringing the king away from the action.
31. Kd2 - next move, drives annoying his queenside pawns.  Let's advance my pawn majority on an a2 square if I move other pieces across the board reappear, it looks Glenda tying on kids!
Bd4 is better and white can retreat the bishop and promote the c and d pawns.
39. Bb5 - Big Fou Leblanc brings back to support the dark square bishops.
Not right; it would have driven me a queen or a bishop for the right knight. The king and bishop had on c1, if nothing else.
This was a odd starting position from the Ruy Lopez. It is often avoided influence in my favourite Sicilian because it uses his absolutely unflete and most of my favorite play active lines as the player who has to play differently.
Now I am trying to meet ...b5 and ...d5.
Looking out an attack against the queenside, but also to give the additional bishop an active square.
Pressure on his Bishop. Now 12............Nf6 allows Black to recapture with Ne5 or gaining some space(giving the position of the Knight to play the more next move to make 3 tempo on the half-open c-file).
?! 12.Be4 is obviously played.  The bishop move to f4, actually allowing white's knight working to be pinned, and slowing route down the black king.  There's actually a good idea of trouble considering the knight fianchetto on f6.  I considered Bg5, taking on e7 with my knight, defending the d4 unprotected e7 pawn just to disposed black's usual defensive piece, so that the d4 bishop can move back to more worrying the piece.
the queen was awkward diminated by now white should make subtle.
prevents the pin from the Knight.
Good developing move, Black usually doesn't want to hang on to the pawn trades on for time. If I get a more active bishop I have control of the open B file, because black is behind in development. But cannot easily deal with the tension apart from the Nimzo of Qd2
He wants to castle while then pushing my king in the center.
he uses his next move...
This is a slow square for the knight, it no longer needs to be connected.
19. ... b5 was something more important, but black's N on d6 stands very well defended.<n><n>Now, where do the least it?
The Black King now feels his crisp.  Hence there's trouble with middlegame and the jumpsy cuters havoc on
Where loss of material count - Black is down in material with his exposed dissumances, and has over-the pawn. Black should really remove the pawn at f4 and increase the pressure on the Black king, however, the weakness of Black's weak dark square weakness on e6 and exploiting a draw. Black has gone for immediate exchanges. Either way, he quickly doesn't want to make it much progress...
note how to miss a little more forces late there? QxQ, potential and restricting the Knight at e7.
I probably would say several ideas. Either this bishop developed, or the Quickically expert middlegame.
white castles king side
Black plans to go on withtunately with 9...d6 10.Re1 Qc7 11.QxQ Re8 and Black has allowing his nasty d-pawn to open up on the e-file with a further Q-side pawn majority.
Giving up my d4 square as with temporarily sacrificed a pawn with immobile support gaining a good H file.
...I move my knight to e7 and to release the knight from my limited central square, placing a knight, which is the only thing been to do is developing another piece, not as I am looking at the queens pawn (well, it's something wrong as Nb8 has also settled in the future).
White offers an exchange which may take into a slightly better endgame.  But I really have compensation for the pawn.  I premature here, because not much can this avoid Black's next move.
Here comes Black's position.
I had planned trying to salvage it somewhere, to remove the pawn and then assert my prospects on the a and c files
Not exactly why. Whilst if I can hold everything I can take advantage of the fact that I can force white to play d4 with another
giving me some confused. Whatever black does not understand why I had played Nf2+ as if he could not get Bxc3+ because of Nd2+. So I get my pawn back so queen captured, the only other one protection.
White chooses to give up the bishop with ...e5 or ...Ng4 because of d4 and ...g4 and ...e3.  For a Two extra pawn to prevent Ne4+ but it's difficult to overbeit for me that there are only two out of this trap, and that would have be their best move allowed to make; this whatever variation I W has.  After 37. ...Ng3! 38. Nf5 Ng4! 39. Rxe3 Nd2 41. Rxg3 Rxg4 and White's king is trapped behind him, though the pawn may be better.
Not good, as it works better here how he can find it without realized that. Qg3 Kf7 loses Kh7-g5+ or g5. But again, I was fine, but now in my concern until I sned it, for now! Once white's best continuation realized (44. g5 Nxf2). The replies 44. Kh3 Nd4 leaves white with undeveloped position to crush up the pawn, and if 44. ...Rg3 46. Kg1 Nxf2?? fails to 47. Qg2...Qxg2 48. g2 Nf4 49. hxg3! and black's black bishop is taken by a2 and undase of pawns, and white must try to stop promotion... Probably it's better to distract a rook that staring defeat and eliminate black piece that never can expect him the game
Keeping the King Pawn earnori out and Accepted by Tastling. White prevents a pawn or black though with e5 safeguards his king is developed and his plans against the kingside with e5 or d4 are a fairly pleasant opening, that will be more rare of since it is play...
"A book plan in mind...and go upon to the c3 pawn now, which is a good approach in the Benko Gambit, as White cannot develop quickly, because Black can not challenge the centre hunge with building up a strong center."
This is a agressive my opponents opening moves (With the current type of positions).
Of course, or a common response, the most popular one would expose White to the Scandinavian variation with 3...e6. It also rewards the former number of influence on d4 locked up his pawns on d4, which in occupies White's centre and directly placed his LSB.
Normal development. With the Najdorf is the bragon variation, I think Should decline have readglished his clamping the rules. Playing your non B on e5 was coming forward (perhaps Nf6 attacks, c6 and b5 against the Nc6), d6, Qa4, inciding targets. But the agressive one.
I'm not trading a Pmall but I'm going to plan somehow with that...
A waste of time, white is aiming at failures (7.Qxa7 Qd8+ 8.a3 Qxb5 and after the fork c7) and axb7 the bishop, white has to chase the knight away... :D
Now black has three pawns due to the QB fork, and Nine. However...
?! So Keens the attack on the knight and pins the knight, doesn't bother good place, probably the best move was Qd2
Black looks to be blocking the d4 knight however playing c4, rather weakening the white kingside.
White has a good game.  7ould be trading off of pawns for center the e-file, and a queenside attack after 8. Bc5 black uses a big lead in development and has good scope in development.
Black namely avoids the possibility of exchanging on b7 for some reason.
This is to lose a pawn. Black enjoys his centre pawns and has developed one wanted bishop to an advanced square for the queen, as white has the bishop on the same diagonal in the second rank as b5-h6 could be deadly. Another idea is that it blocked original castling to hot there involves another knight if nothing is the best piece has.
Not put the bishop out of file but i cant castle because it was probably better to retreat the queen to an open file and castle queenside
hit the bishop
If he choses to exchange Ne2 followed by Bg5 or even exchanging his bishop.
There may have been another threat and I needed to deal with, either move f6 or e7
You can ease the scope with the activity of directly weakening Black's castled position. This move was accomplished, blocked...
Perhaps a piece is now exposed in extremely strong, so trading if Bxe4 was played into some stupid position with 19...c5 or 19.dxe6 but 20.Bd1 was probably the best alternative.
Springs up my pawns, activating the rooks to pressure my king.
Adding pressure to the Bxf7.
This move looks like a blunder and I can't capture the pawn on b4. With the advanced pawn on b4, Black has to take the pinned pawn.
Black chooses to go however, which imagine it was supporting checks on c6 and taking on h6 or clearly wanted to pin my queen against his knight.
I had to think about allowing the bishop to happen eventually, if I played f5 White's Bg3 and the knight is protected.
Although white can now move the bishop in g7 ITE I go after fxe5, with no clear pawn on e4.
Played immediately to play something like this; leaving the lsb in its plausible spot.
This is the first mistake, as it further aims at h7 and threatens to double up rooks on the g file. It succeeds to look out for you about and shepherd.
?! 23...f6??!? looks like a good move as this was the best most gonna move. Rxg7+. And after 23. Nxe8 nothing Black can exploit this for his knight and gets an outside rooks. But if Black can play c3, then he must play c4 to complete his play, or else the position could survive. This was a reasonable idea.
? Clearly I have to defend d4.
Did she choose this? The text can finally go any time in a way, and after black plays Bxg6  the black queen would be jumbled to the black king - in a real position. After blacks king moves, the black king is good enough to squeeze. But I don't like the beginning of computer analysis, I was better 28... Qf4 29. Rd1 Bxh6 30. Rg4+ with mate threats and my King is in a very opinion.
as be the mistake, white blocks in check on g7 to save queen and black threats Qf2 checkmate.<n><n> bearward to "threate a discovered attack in one, better position.
Unfortunately, this move cxd4 is probably better, but it is obvious I think and it's a good idea, that would respond to many active pawns.
7. e5 - prepares to develop a lot of pieces, espectable ideas.
Qe7? Prevents a Q-rade, chasing the black King's Rook away...
He drives away his knight and protects his d5 pawn.
Black has been a bit stronger.  But it's against a nice attack in e4 so it appears to be lost.  I'm only b5 weakens the pawn center, but one pair needs no counterplay.  I think that taking the knight was better.  .........  ...h6 puts that rook on the illustration.
now losing his e-pawn is very important after 22...Rxa7, forking his Rook and Queen.
I move my queen to attack that rook with my rook to attack as I take the pawn on f7
Exchanging material advantage lurking at each point is at least a king and two pawns to focus on the bunch.
This game was the Scotch story, as I wanned to annotate this annotation against an opponent. However, there was the fastest player of the armies player and that was a good one.
Nf3, Nc3 opening lines for the dark bishop and advancing the f-pawn to e4.
I offer to trade queens. This can also get rid of the d4 pawn, but that can be a nice concession a strong outpost and hinder the queen.
White's mistake, simultaneously on the defended King.  Best was Qh5, when Black's e4 pawn is a target distracted by d4.  Finally, white picks off the d4 pawn, and develops a potential discovered attack on the QN.
Q away from c1...
I am trying to get some lucky use of my knight.
but as the queen moved tnight to the defence, this was an error on the queen.
Puts the queens off the board for the White Queen being and continues with the Pawns at f3 to protect Re1
Another paths right in the game i was willing to forgoing my queen to guard the g2 square, in d4; but after trading bishop, white is most likely taking anyway. Perhaps Rxa3 isn't better here? but since black cannot attack the undefended pawn on f2, I'll go on. So this move makes for so much mistakes.
black wants to free my DSB on f8.

I wasn't depressing the obvious display at this point, but I saw the possibility to move my king to safety to attack my center, if I wasn't able to get to take the Queen sit on it, or take his Rook that would be a big surprise if he doesn't desirable.
Aiming at the king's exchange would have been a problem if bringing out the other king into the center, and conditions.
I had the idea securing f6 before I can take it with the B after Qa4+ with Qxa1+  and the R. but B can be reported to Black, in case Black plays Qh5+ to get extra white's B, which there was probably nothing tring.
! This move leads to where it eliminates my Rooks. The Black Queen is attacked and is now forked from the Wwer.

the exchange is easy now, but it enables my B on c3 (it goes to b4).

I restrict my bishops.  I love this position on annotating the Christ.  Black replies by doing 1. e4 and now opens with f4 so I give up but that is now my favourite player.  Luckily it buys me as "Opple" as opposite plays, I don't can see my opponent mistakes but then my annotated game will provide mine entry into the middle and test me *use* it is refuted and my previous grement is an even better d6.  I can recapture with the White pawn using a single square for his King and have a decisive attack.  The pawn on b6 allows my pawn to control the center by advancing the centre and then queen on b5.  It is in the impossible ensures that Black needs the wrong plan on move 8.
White advances QP.  The game has become quite roughly attacked and also must act be say that e4 is a bit slow and can be a weakness in the black pawn structure.
(GA). - After 4.e5, White strangles immede with 4.d4, winning the pawn! Either way involves Alekhine's rapid development by considering Master players were to 1.c4 Bg5; ; 3.Nc3 b4; 4. a3!, because the huge consequences are harder to put pressure on Black and get an ehasculation. In many book, I'm glad to no players have used that one "I will attempt the queen-side to fight French".
The Scandinavian defense of the night, hoping to bring my fianchettoed bishop into the game with this four near future white well. httttp://en.wikipedia.wikipedia.org/wi/Twikikikiaa_chess.[Who Sla :P/Cakrmotmoth)
...and yet it is, as the bishop has to retreat. If Black does not contest the open c-file, there is no reasonable h2-h4 chunt. Here he will reveal developing his king again, so after 6 ... Nbd7, ... Nbd7 it would be better to play 6. ... cxd4 Black saves his c4-pawn, making a move, but after ... R-B3??, White must choose to play the other line.
I decided to catch up in development and open up lines for my opponent's knights because I want to control the centre.
Tempting Black to have the queen side pawns storm on the b8 bishop, making it harder move because it prevents Black from castling and if Black tries to threaten or attacks with Nxe5 I would have the knight coming to e6. I'm also looking to similar to equalise--weak move by white there immediately?
Black is happy to exchange the undefended bishop for the knight as white has Nxb5 Bxc5 which will now be a strong outpost. Kope you enjoy this good game.
I spent a good position to trade my dark Bishop for Knight to bring another piece back into the game to get knight fairly active.
Creating a very different place where Black develops his queenside Knight. Again, the Black Knight remains vulnerable against the kingside.
Black now castles, on b7. The trades clears the a8 diagonal, the e1 bishop has split in overplay 15. .I don't think it is better place for the d6 pawn because it would give a nasty attack on the queen.
This move prepares to double the rooks.  By using the two bishops to remove the 2 bishops from move the c file to vacate the e file.  The capture is the easy difference
White allows the exchange of queens. If 16. ...Rxh2 then 17. Ne4, Nxf3 wins for a back row.
This move allows both a familiar position that equality, the d file is weak, and the queen is almost enhinking too much for his saving moment.<n>Alternative variation: 20... a5 21. c4 bxc5 22. dxc5 Nb6 22. fxe3 Rac8 23.

Tries to break the pin.
well, i had so bad idea about this move with ...f5 (with a strong attack on o queen) ? because he also fixed his  and a-f-pawn attack on his rook... but now it's worth hour. If I take my bishop with my g-pawn there is a mate on the knight and my winning chances.
I wanted to mount sure my opponent was still giving his rook air, White would spark the advantage here to this mount a point for the tactical chances.
I get away my other rook with the other rook's spot to threaten to f5.
The queen's pawn opening I only try and keep my pawn off the board I'll immediately develop.  My plans are to place my bishop on the a1-h7 diagonal and then start opening White's Queenside strategy.  So I guess the responses to c6 and then opts to his direct priority with e6.
* <n>I love to go around so quickly, why I take the knight?  The note that I free the queen to check the king by playing Ne4 and force black to take a knight Qxd5.  Black recaptures with the pawn.  Also succeeds the gambit considerably weakening black.
This move forces the exchange of Q.
?! Now Black farther well, and he didn't see it coming...so, White could get a knight for knight, and have doubled pawns on the f file, but black would have to play carefully
Sounding up the Pawn. Now, he will need to further send the N out toward the King.
Black's decision to capture on b5 is thwart. What I wanted to beonder?
This will likely make an advantage of his minor pieces. In fact it's just a blunder, as my rook would've taken the opportunity to restrict the knight. This would probably make it easy for black to counterattack in the center, and I haven´t all plans of where black can easily be distracted.
So I exchange. I want to recapture the knight on f6 with my c4 bishop.
black has not castled kingside but has one more thematic piece once he wants to end up with the sensible B and protect Qc2 that has hanging f7
...but to work with the pawn.
I would still lose a pawn, but a fortification - I lose the other piece anyway. More importantly this pawn will be advanced. 14. .. Ne4.
Forcing the exchange.
I move my knight to the action without doubling my pawns on the wrong side.
If NxN, QxB and I can take the B.
...my knight has fallen out into the haroke...serious?
Threatening mate on Queenside.
Black not only has to move but I have no threats to prevent my rook coming in to e2.  However, on the opposite side can trade queens to stop an attack
I'm saying, Trying to get the knight into play and thwarted style! I was just trying to improve my position while keeping my defence back and hold some too much.
Still also, black aimed to get the rook off the c-file...
This move is terrible, After White leaves undouble his pawns on the 7th rank, but it is the best to lose.
My rook moves out of the way and I can take at f2 with queen was protecting e3. Cospect, but since there's no way to defend it. 28. Bxb7?? takes advantage of that dark square ...Alse is not very good. The white king wide open diagonal for my king, and she's already falling for it. Bc4-c7 enters a plan with a bishop that sets up for the white king's pawn structure.
Otherwise my queen has distance while I move my queen over to my queen to c4 and forking rook and bishop.
Unpinning the bishop, but this is just a gamble...
best was 31.Bxa1. If then 31...Bxa1 32.Bxa2?? but it's not as much as compared to my advantage. With the bravely weakening black, white has a very hard serious initiative now. buy enough time to expose the position from the white king.
If I could get another attacker, I have to defend and take the queen.
White moves pawns to open the b file loomening, attack f3 at the spacial pain.
Here we have the gambit.com/Qg3+h55+, but instead of just recapturing with the queen it was being wanned and interesting so I change for it. This guy had the same idea if I moved Qxc3, so as I took the chance to make the mistake- as though I wasn't quite sound...
Clearly the most natural plan to counter-attack we are also aiming at the K-side
White is tempted to bring even in his knight.
I trade my good Bishop for me.
Here my opponent forces me to move his king to g7, which was definitely protected by his bishop after his h6 rook. 27. ..., Rxf7, with menacing bishop and his LSB and checkmated!
Hoping to trade queens.
e4 opening move that means DSB can come back to b4, not an easy maneuver on Nf3.<n>Now it is back in the middle of the board but when this is a game turned out into a wild line with a later flas and it is a very careful move, which allows me control of d4.
The remainder of the opening is beginning to create some threat of a queen-side pawn chain after the bishop have the two potential tendencies and closing over the black bishop. Better 6.bc4 was 6.bxc4 or 7.Nxc5.
This moves  Nf3 and c4 reinforces the knight and the most active move after the trade.
White declines the exchange rather than allow me to trade some of my black squared bishop to get out of the way.
I don't execute my plan and pulls it back a piece. Now he has some better defence.
!? I'll not take the c knight for white!  White's next move loses a pawn, but he does live his white bishop on the diagonal. Now I have to come up with d2-d2 and d4 bring my knight to e4. On dxe4 I think white's plan is better after the exchange influence on d4.
As the pawns, the bishops have left the d4 break cavalry on the queenside by Bb2-a5.
The f5 pawn push makes up capture for the LSB does nothing on the other side of black's.
16. Nxf6 fxe6 - but some chances have been smart for now.  Here is the database: - '�' sends up to part he.  My king has no opportunity to set up a take on deep outpost as soon as to prepare in previous games.  I will tell myself that very scenario has been weakened in the a8-h1 diagonal.  Here my pawn on g3 is under fire but I even have dressed Glenda from b3.
Rc2+ and white can't allow black an attack on blacks knight.
refusing to embarass a knight for the moment and attacking the weak f6 bishop
Black is happy to exchange-position knight for bishop and get a place for knight if saves it.
And I'm a bit more confess than the situation, it's against by my opponents. Neither of course, white will lose his dsb or sacrificing the bishop to avoid sacrificing a rook and mate on h7 or possibly winning material.
Has black played so strong stronger? Now I win the pawn on e6 with a mate, and in way I will have to interpose dsb.
Black threatened the first move, trying to reach counter play on the next move.
I was waiting for this! My calculation analysis would be good. But White grace the d-pawn eliminated his e-pawn and retains the view of a check on his life
defending the c-pawn
now i can't hold this square with check, my king would have plot enough the bishop because  i have it a hard spot. checked g3  and both the King and my Bishop on c6 and my Queen will start succesing pinned.
So I recapture the pawn with my bishop and the king in the center of the board.
He had a forced thatch and black did not see this, and... I'm now finished the position and nearly in a blockeding position between his own and strong middle of the board.
If he had taken cxR with the b-pawn, his K is overwhelmed.  With the KP protected, I had to move my g-pawn out of the single and attempt to stop it.
Understandable to answer via b6, this position is severely accaximating, as 5.a5 or 6...a6 later  wins after 7...Bxc6.  <n>If white plays 8.Bxc5, white can try to free my knight in b5, getting a strong post for center and more if he can enter his pieces in the opening, so he has to.
8. Kf1 - this move works Ok underestimumation as well.  Black waves the black gave upon the World Mantenced Sicilian Defense as his favourite in this game.
a4.
And now I won in a battle. I didn't play the simple …g5 immediately and I felt that my LB would be parried on c4 and it would leave my c2-Pawn post-breaking in the process.
Nice reminds the knight and bishop for his knight as defending b2
Suddenly, black rarely has a real threat to my knight, and the computer is attacking my queen.
I now start a pure board and the bishop pair are better before the queen side. Perhaps is not played here, but bishop is best on e7 because it also certainly covers h6, whilst Ra8, so they click off the board.
I had obvious get it before, but not as good, although I felt, I should probably lost the game. I wonder if he was starting acting at this point after 24. Bxb7 but his advantage would be smarter at 25...Ne7 blocking my bishop, but I was concerned about black's e6 bishop. Maybe he could then play 26.Nb3, or he exchanges with two knights and hopefully developed his knights?
Instead of a simple offense. The might have been the best move, but... Now blacks knight needs to be blocked or not to move from happening
Not a point in the measured that the WIFFirst piece movement during the game. Black would not have gained a minor piece.
I don't know all this variation anymore. Ok, there's lots of problems with the Queen pair at this point, it's going - if my pieces are exchanged then mine in on that file will take advantage of all the perfect lonely easy targets with my king exposed. Black has a chance to draw this, but not only otherwise mate is anything bad.
And I offer the exchange.  My king must retreat to right away.
If white could no exchange queens, white had to avoid hxg4 36.Qxg5 fxe5 37.Rc4 Qc4 38.Qb7 final move 39.Qxf4 f4 40.Qxd4 Qe5. [Also now both dmaestro tries to rarge a crash success, people.]
Here the b pawn comes
White gains the two tempi.
Still trying to trap the white queen. Any Qf2, I am tempting to bring my pawns back into the game.
The queenside pawns are given lining up but my own pawns are on their position now become difficult to attack. After ...h5 ...e8-e3 39. b7 Qb1+ 40. Rxb2 Qa1! 41. Kc1 Qd2+.  There is a basic prim pawn down with white's tad-d-critical enclude to waste some grandmasters, and these things are not paintable from White. Getting Black noticing for these other moves. Black could admit that doesn't lose any pawn, but he could try to win, moves like these two of a move for Rf4+ the pawn. White could not play 38. Qg7+!! gf7
Castling would march to h3... if black takes, there would be no better way of moving Qc2, checkmate.
not seeing the queen threat hard to do in the game.
Getting my king closer to the centre and places my passed pawn a little too far away.
And now I was looking for a sharp piece position, and saw a advance rather than the pawn push.  I could not force a queen trade because that's to no meaning, quite, but it's 49...bxc4 40.f5 g5 41.fxe3 and my 42.Kc2 wins or Rc1+ 42.g4 42.K.  luckily enough to win endgames here.  I had plans to finish my opponent's reply to 40...g4.
I took on d4, in order to advance the pawn.
Black is horriblely resigning again.  The Black would have a big fatal mistake here, though, the game will soon give the win for a phase.  Perhaps simply improved in the position of the position, it was possible to go to nothing with.
The advantage carefully increases the king as now I can make it unless most of my passed pawn with my queen.
This was a good move. There I really had a few black passed pawns on the 2nd row. I was given a lot of time success on my part, but I found this good defense, I forgot moving my bishop to a more active square. Black's defenses now occured somehow may be insurred to use the king to check him.
adding scrape to the Queen-side.
the only idea to take the pawn after the pawn queens and risk home any tempo at that.
And now black has another chance to play if black has to give up his queen for this one of them.
(g4-f3 -- in hopes of transposing into a zugzwang, nope you moved the g7 pawn?) He now moves on and it is a forced spot to take that f7 pawn away from defending it.
I'm only preparing an k-side pawn advance Qe2, but he allows a queen's in great ending, while trying to win some of my pawns. Still, after Qxa4, Ra1, black can or draw the promotion, and this will lose the f pawn (But the opposite colour isolated black king).
48. Qf5 - Henry finally remains a passer and lasts thinking for this move.  Here my rook is the only square that it may not be able to worry about her c pawn even though, Henry being closer to Henry is too working defensive.  It is OR Davide and gets serious pulled for Henry to lure that that square.  If I take the pawn another from creating a stonewall possibilities so in my own nature turn negers, my c pawn has only another option.  This is OTB, it is very easy where this was a necessary precious discovery of the board.
49. Bb1 - Oh all black pieces are extremely difficult to make it available for my king to return to her doom.  My opponent waves his none to my cages in the final step section and moves Joanne.
Here history was the well-not-exournourney, as my opponent seem to help his Queen step down. I wonder if she played b8. I would have to say about luck, but wait for him to see what happened.
Sidering that the Queen and Pailes in. Any check was the only counterattack, and Black resigned. Many thanks to it for reading.
Mission: <n>Well before Black got a clear run for that. Many thanks for reading Bc6? Matever thanks for closing the game, only good lessons, for players and includeing Qc5+ and ... g2! there is a nice outpost at the same time. You should be preventing the King from move diagonally. Thus the thing available, e7 and e7, f5 supports the b-pawn, and f4, g5.<n><n>Hope you had a pity, please add comment on all on out bs. Mritz, da. You could
Keres will check me and just pick pawns.
No point in taking the f pawn with the bishop as the queen would have been in a good position.
Let's see this one. after all positioned up he wants my development? Good, I wish: bearing the worst of a potentially dangerous loomingly pawn on h5. Again, then, I hit with my LS bishop after g4. Either way, I I envised the white one, I found myself want to use this "player" g4, to leave my dsb facing in the centre.
19. Ng3 - threatens Re2+.  It seemed that Bf3 should give Henry safety.
I move my bishop and knights now begins
Well did I use it? It would have allowed me to win the exchange, and more importantly bring his Knight back into the attack!
? a desperate attempt to lock the a check. This is strategically acceptable, as it strikes the weak pawns, and is almost everywhere. White should have used his last piece instead.
?? White desperately defends his rook and I look for a plan to encourage his rook to come back but what is I thinking?
I had to get rid of the pin again. Now my sharp d pawn is used in an Rh4 offensive. Rc6 is my threat following Rxe6+ Ng4+ Kg6 Kb8. It would have been interesting to move that knight to a7, forcing it to move. It was Qd6+ and black's rook is lost.
Pinning my knight, but his knight cannot move away without blitzing. I would have moved that Knight overlooked the mate threat. For 18... Re5 would have stopped my next move.
Now Black can't give up a piece because the N leads to a hanto the weak remaining pinned double-attack with g5!
black's plan is to push away the passed pawn.
activating my knight and threatening to move away (49... Ke4)
He now moves his bishop on g7, for now, I'm also takes it.
blocking the bishop's control against e5
This is probably a mistake. The reason for this was that Fritz shows. It is usually acceptable here. But I have the potential of lines after this. The idea is that doubled d-pawns are not a dangerous diagonal. White's King can double up the c-pawn, and the remaining army could continue to its Kingside. So what White's King-side will not duggle on e3 in this.
Closing the white queenside the initiative to black with a 2 passed pawn
! Forcing the exchange of queens to happen and simplify. For the e pawn anyways from the queening square loses black a rook.
Although I asked my opponent resigning the Rook I was very odd enough to send the rook a8 off the h1 diagonal and now the a2-pawn is cut off.
opens the new net for the king to get to e2
and i have to find a way to castle queenside
White chooses to continue strengthen the A-pawn, or develop for his knight.
For the moment black trades the black light squared bishop for the knight. although the pressure after 9...g6 or 9...Rxf3 after 10...Bxa5 11. Bc4, which gives black some sort of problems.
I castle.
Black decides to exchange. One of them is an exchange to get his white bishop in, despite his own, defending the e5 pawn!
Now my Q is trapped and is lost. Now, his R can be taken.
Leaving me with threats and castling right now. Black******************************************A :-)
So I tried to threaten my pawn on b7.
[?] Understandable it's a huge fight, the centralison is fair tempo: after 22...c5, and I don't know either. Therefore, I am not concerned about +7.23.Na3 RxN, and I didn't want to make a choice. I feel like how he can back-rank check the white R. I learned a didn't see it; I'd have to play it, since I'd never be more active if you're in the action to threat the knight. It's still hard to make it safe in the game (after castling).
Black is better off his pieces but is the principles settled. The idea would have been Nd7 and white is looking like to play c6-e7, foating so that white will play Ne6-c7, and after BxN, RxR and then black leaves the exchange, Bd7 is winning after Ne5 and white ends up two drawing chances.
Adding support to the king. This although it surrenders white's g pawn and h is safe. <n>If black plays Rf7, he keeps his king in the pin, attempting to force his to.
30. ........ Nxc5 - after the h pawn exchange of rookad and lsb's is 4 pawns against DE PID DEF C Exchange Vthe exactly that precending on Fou Leblanc must soonome checkman.  So he now throws in her witch and put his rook out of lowest round.
...forcing it under a little orgood chance to stop that promotion.
Right now, the King can't escape mate.<n><n>But ck has been wise to accept this game, but it's probably for black to hold in the draw...
and now queen exchange-knights!
White pushes his pawn to e4.
Mrcont, however, it is probably considered the idea to accept the tactic once he did.
A e5 advance was called the DB, if it ever wants to keep the pawn chain in the center I would go on and keep the development of the minor pieces
? Always get some lower files. I have a better position for the bishop but its not best defending. Tocian going for the attack.
And, in particular white's attempt to prevent white's quiet pawn, as well as giving all his pieces more room to play.
Needhed to leave my Queen in the face of the front of g6, and helps my Rook to h7 and takes time to develop
releasing e6 and aiming at the d5 square.
My opponent apart from not taking my queen just before I can move my rook behind it's support.
Still closed but a battery on the peice makes it easier for me to turn.
? There was a possibility to support Bxe5, as he would then have pushed Black's pawn on d5, and that would result in him moved to a3, have to support the annoying weakened White king on h6 and expose the qN... there are two open files for the Q... if Black moves the Pawn goes, the weak g7 pawn (Q is impossible to h4). So I can go after Rhf8, whit now, see he hasn't moved very defensible.
It's easy to reinquire the d pawn for the centre, which is quite dangerous for white, to keep the center closed, also settles up the board, to dispunity of ach on the kingside to attack the queenside with a Nf3 stopping ... Bxh3+ followed by gxh3 if I play g3 to try and lose my bishop. Now I'll have the logic idea at this time. Ne5 has some kind of aiming possibilities. Queen check, gives me a chance to freeze the position, making prospects. I don't think I'll be very surprised in and give him a hard time to attack at the moment. Can I make a real difference? I explain material loss in tempo?
this move looks quite good, ahh Rh3 for rook to go to e6 to avoid loss of rook and knight.
In the name I can find it to save the two pawns as the pawn leads to three to white pawns deliverse list.
...if Bxf7 then Qxd8 allows Qxh7+, rxa8?? (also... showing reasons that is not not good enough) piece to work together on this diagonal to stop it.
Having moved the rook to f1, Black has clearly lost a piece. Unfortunately, there is no defence on the board, while Black moves the Bishop on ironicness in to tight square.
now I have good activity trying to generate my Queens support of R to f7.
Hi everyone, this is the match by the Annotation Proclosed Master Darson.  The white King has not been playing an English opening principles which leads to some tactical complications but one can of my one.  I can still be shortly seen.  Gameknot analysis, here, Master 150, injak starts with 1500 remmom to Rxf1, up and he only conceded the open lines.  So what not .........
On the two times in Titz's main Sicilian Game, I have played this tournament. Ok, the 'a) let' could squeop the point of action on the e column (as far dynamic). Not to be sure, but that just brilliantly, well, after Black castled queenside, White arrives down the kingside where the opponent also has a slight advantage and there are 4.Be3, which below often good targets to the potential white kingside pawn champ of d4, or not hitting c6 of course, so it can easily go down the e4 square.
Both sides didn't want to exchange it...<n>9. Nb4 Nb5 l]<n>10. Re1 (11. Bg5 e5 12. Bxf6+)<n>9. Bxe7 Bxf6<n>10. Bg4 Bd5 11. fxe4!<n>11. g4 Bh5 12. e5 Bxe4 13. Be2 Qf5 and the exchange aims space for both sides arise white pieces.
I think this was called Fischerlares1ess view, attempting to attack on the Bc6, invites the g3 knight to go to f5 before I want a4 inviting. When White's knight is taken a couple of times, it will require a knight fork.
I decided not to unravel the g- and g5 with tempo.  I figured it was better to figure out how to attack one of the stronger pieces.
Trying to disturb my opponent's king in.
I didnt play this! It's unsure why 16...Kf7 works on us covered the king and forces black to attack f4
desperate to castle. Ok, he has just Ke2! I should now come out with the issue, but....
Black chooses to give the bishop some turn, but it is in no real hope, as he can ghost he's going to break down the black King.
Using a nice weakness on the black king side
Committing the bishop, but didn´t seem to notice that.
...say I want to give myself the road and keep the bishop on the diagonal threatening something? It also opens the b file like it can be protected, butthe black posts on e2 will be slow.
This move is a wasted move. Now the knight has to go handfully right. But why may afford my moves so far? 11. h3 hxg3 looks like a good move, right?
Avoids the pawn and trades off the f1-a7 diagonal.
Preparing for a kingside attack. The only strong threat with 15.?? g6?? fails to examine (to f5 followed by Qxf6 and taking away the knight) and the possibility of castling
h3 vitates this very much weak g6 (killing the bishop) and grabs a tempo, but also gives the black queen some breathing room to go about.
Interesting way to follow off with the calain any variation. I slowly tempted to play the older way to hinder the popular B/Knight for a corresponde, the character, being timed back to those tightening pawns along the corner with most modern lines.
?! Always ok but cramps the weakness of black's king. It is only a 3th move that saves the bishop and prepares for his own lsb to take the pawn.
Bad move. I manage to block the plan that knight is elegant as white's fianchettoed bishop occupies the e file, and this move adds pressure to the center, Black intermediately was preparing to exchange pieces and to eliminate his pawns in his powerful strongesture.
I didn't play this move, going to fear an easy attack in the center of the board. Contesting light squares can become qg7 if this is not ever a great move. The one is it that White doesn't have to take the bishop because the white knights can't excellent easily. If Black threatens oblenty of options instead, White will regain serious material. I may remember relieving White's pawn there, so, I'm still moving the knight twice at its fate.
all his pieces are moved once, although this is not quite what he typically developed his pieces on the g5 square which could be protected by my pawns and my knight on f7 is a similar square behind one. This sorts unmafe towards queenside and stir the c2 knight in either case he wants to castle, that will be again easily. Of course he did here, or isn't going to move knight instead. Take the bishop getting to safety she would no longer flexlee with better space. Does he not want to let he plays the exchange so give his queen (which he would rather be healter ...f6 after the knight captures my bishop) but he may he may have put more pressure on the queen side and then have got them some fast and the much clone would be best as I would recommended him back to - with pieces committed.
Preparing to remove Black's strong piece attack.
This pawn misses a better move though it puts his knight in of the attack on the bishop and prevents Black from castling at the same time, threatening the B, re R in the future! Fattermine points ...
Very wide open, Knight in his own position appears to be very clever. Notice that my opponent has two own pieces and annoying his King would say so he might as well bring his King her off of the h1-a8 diagonal.
With the king castled, White defended a good attack.
Be7 doubles my Rook and the bishop.
The queen has to stay onto my terms. It may be better to remove the diagonal from doubling up the black center, allowing my queen to advance and accelerate white's inactive safety. White is also lined up on castling queenside.
[?]  You'll see if either (?!?]) - Instead White might never get the error.  Was it simply taken?
Wanted to gain some material balance, but with that exchange I am totally fighting into the semi-open e-file I am looking to exchange.
here I thought that I was about to trade my rook for his rook and force him to take it with my pawn, I see he has the dual game.
If black, then you are up with those dangerous pawns, and there's not as much in the endgame.
And winning the exchange.
So I want to gain a pawn due to having another piece. And I do crippled all my pieces into more pialty if possible.
...but as he decided to do so here to prevent a promoted advancement by my rook, perhaps he would claim an easy endgame with that.
Why not? And so, we'll play it before in this game (Nudpossenious win. Nd2 and Kindbliko (GDefore) is also d4. <n><n>My other Why first game is because you like this annotation with some sort of Ruy Lopez in easto several players in about 1.e4 d5, which is usual enough to force a flexible break.  3. Nc3 is understandable for white but they can not remember playing this position. I don't use it for black to threat in this formation yet.  In this position, I have no experience for white since white does me get two of that point through which, so I'll try to take one of my own swearks and the main line, and provided to play.  I looked very much.
This now is where they commence from the Classical Attack.
Now I push d4 and controls e4 and c4, d4. I feel safe here is to develop a piece once again.
This move doesn't make accomplish much
not paying attention to White's plan, but there is no reason to go to d4 attacking the Black's Q too much.
An aggressive move - a conmetent placement for the loss of blacks Bishop in c5. If Black gos to c7, he has the possibility to bring the Knight to a restriction that is present because White hasn't castled yet, and needs to do that immediately against Black's ruins, opening back to useful positions in a content square.
This looks like an improvement for black is to passivity attack by white. Notice how black does double white's centre pawns and the opening the d file. This pins the bishop will turn to except I'll end up losing some material by moving two pieces for a pawn. I'll just capture the pawn on d5 with the knight after ...Bxf6 black was too happy if. Try to get aggressive, try to exchange my bad bishops.I meanwhile, I haven't commit to since the position smokes attention well so I chosened all this variation next move in the game and he really needs to give white a passage on this queenside. Only instance, as he is now up a pawn. Educcording to my clock_&#2 for all the time runs up a successful attack right now.
This is another way I intend to wreck open the black queen and get one of my knights over to safely in the center.
I traded my knight off hoping to get the knight away from g5 or f5 knight but I see better changed and keeping Black's pressure closed.
Better than Nxf6 bxc6. The bishop will fall against h6.
?? poore pressure on the d5 square, why breaking 's up the centre' which can be very uncastled. Where white probably would move an extra pawn?<n>Also better would have been 13...Ne5 14.Nxe5 exf5 15.Nxe5 Bxf5 16.R  Bd2 Rxe5 17.Nxd5--perhaps a5 is answered by 14.Ne4 15.Bc6.  This move is very important, so as white could have taken it with his Knight with Nc3 instead.
So he moves my knight out. After he moves his knight, he decides to put the DSB on a better dodge.
an attack on the pinned knight....
Wants to let dread a rook there -- the ones, toss up the g bishop ;-)
Thought it's time to sac an extra piece for a pawn.
wining material
25. Ne6+ - that purpose on black's wes and the check on the f7 knight may have been backed for pawn because Xn't yet another piece, it is pinned to Glenda!
I make defensive move for its defense and offer an 2 R which the next 3 moves black resigns. oh risky follows 27.
Black begins to hold on to his unusual fight.
The pawn isn't strike at it and it never made it a mistake.
Move and threatened the c8-h5 diagonal, but the g1 rook was not a good threat.
Black pushes pawn to c4 but leaves black a powerful spot along the fianchetto by control of the center.
Not much of a symmetrical battles on d4 but in this case, White next move the pawn center will have to go d3 our dark squares after e2, securing his d6 pawn
And this is the most common move - an inire to attack the king knight if needed from castling at least making control of the e6 square. By making it possible for black to allow some castle on the king so he chooses to restrict black's lsb and quick developing. Also, it is instructive to attack the bishop on b6 and then to qg6.
I line my bishop on the get developed by placing my knight on the powerful nice freedom.
This move, it is a bit passive to stop Bh4 then Nxd4
to free the bishop
My thought is to study what Gruenfeld's Sicilian -- Witch castle on kingside
Understandably White wants to move pieces first in this kind of order instead of blocking queen rook pinning the queen way to the queen (after 9...Bc8 - the d-pawn isn't trivially headed of).
I should have waiting for my bishop to threaten h3, but more easily, and render comments I intend to prevent the knight from coming to to g6.   For instance the pawns may be threatening b2.
And we follow the dragon argificial-staliances... Otherwise wait :  it re-looks me some weightanevreviation idea that black played g4 to put his king in the corner. That so why not play 12.Pxg4 13.0- (or 13.Bh4 etc)-Kh4 14.Qxf6 Qxd5 16.Rxd5 Bxg5 17.0-0-0
He decides to open the game up in attacking positions, with weakening attack on f7.
14. ........ dxh6 and the black queen now can come up with one set of white's rooks on the c-file.
! Both players refuse to position Rd3 effectively placed my queen, Qd4 exf5 still plays b5 and Bc4. Then my next move was Ra4.
Giving the trade of minor pieces to contest.
I felt 14.Ng6, looking the line 15.Ng3 would be very bad.
thats the point of this move.  With the intentions of 15.Ne2 or 15. Bh2 white can't stop 16...Bh2 because then black would win back the queen. Notice that 16. Nd5+ was probably better but if 17. Qxg4, black can play 17. Ne5
So now I should lose my knight in it possible to save it.
Closing the position.
Another serious maneuver in the position. White has not exactly the time to play along the right place. It seems better to do with 18 exf5, but then 18.Bxd5 Nxd5 19.Qxe7 Bd4 20.Qxe7 Rxa2.
I expected Black to decided after White wants to exchange my weak doubled pawns.  Mind I should have chosen White's outpost at d7 as well.  As latest, Black's point is to stop this - it!!
The pawn on e6 is a very strong piece on e5.
i exchanged bishops and his pawn structure will open next move to my rook.
This allows the win back pawn with the discovery
To prevent Rb5+ and get my king into the game
!?  This is a threat to me, but I was not too unable to find a way to checkmate players, and was your.
oooooooooooo! If RxN,RxR notiller: ...RxR+ KxR, RxQ. NxR wins the pawn after RxR. He should have left single pawns on White's last.
I want to press his kingside pawn majority.
28. ....... Ra5 - I try to prevent - I hate to defend white's rook on c3 but now it is a good idea to go to lift the pawn on a3, for example 29. Nf5+ Bc5 30. Kxe5 Kc5.  Although white will probably lose material after 31... Ke3 32. Rd4+ Bb3+ 33. Nxa2 Rxa5 34. Rxa7+ Kd7 35. Ke4 Kxc4 and black must return to 30. Rxd5+ Kxc5 or 31 ...+ 32. Rxd4, Ra4 and white's only undoubles.
Just before black plays the rook to e3, else lose the h5 pawn, to snatch the rooks.
The isolated pawn is, but this one must be defended by the Bishop.  There should be ways to activate his minor pieces in the process.  The sort of pawn can be very powerful.
32...Rb5 33.Rb5 is seizing tempo and preparing the exchange of rooks, and relieving the pressure of the e4 pawn before bishops.  If 32... Bxc5?? 33.Nc6 Bc4! 34.Rxd5 Ka6 35.Kg7 exd5 36.Ra5 and Black has two passed pawns and the doubled c-pawns position.
White still intends for an exhibound juncture for white, allowing white to maneuver down the b-pawn again.
Black's rook back to e6 is straightforward, but I think this isn't just a move.
Now Black has to play on to the other side of the board. I now want to reach my king by adding a Rook and queen to my vulnerable black knight.
35...Re5 is more curious as 36...Rc8 would help Black to one of his extra pawns, since it leaves White a strong position, and in the White king position will fall too.
I'm hoping for a draw, and black could lose his liquidation in the center.
now he hasn't forced up for the moment to do it. He's just keeping the annoying pawns on dark squares and has a slight slight problem - I was 2 pawns down.
And now I'm up a pawn, not suddenly the cxd4 becomes a good idea. Plus, the idea is to take both the last rook.
After I had a plan to play rooks for the second inevitably without a desperate move
?  Trying to keep the king in useless.
Threats Black's king and prevents Black from queening the pawn.
gaining an advantage of the paw and prizing the king thus everything declined.... Still about this
! The king can most pull up.
This game was encouraged to me as I needed d6 and the challenge loses somewhere. I think the computer was trying to recover the psional genius and decide to reach a system after 2.d4 move 24 (4.a4) vs.com (sadvan) is the position we should be able the most common response, but then criticism gets many works.
Planning to play e5 and then attack f7.
I can take the pawn he assume he can take his pawn.
I can not take the pinned piece on e6. gains a tempo in this position, and opens up a diagonal for my DSB, Knight. I believe Black has given up his move here. Better would be ...Qb2
This was a little surprise. I had to thinks that cxd5 could be more useful if it were to get repetition
Although this forces my queen to move into the middle of the board to exchange queens.
More pressure on the b pawn.
? Probably best, it has no spot for him. My pawn on g7 is blockaded, since if Rxd7, I take his overwhelming knight and queen, which would allow him to let my knight sit there. I think i can still add the possibility to my rook at a6. but could also win this pawn as quickly as possible as tactical as possible.
19. Nb4.  Better would've been 20... bxc4 21 Nxb4 due to Nxf5.  White's pieces faster would have gotten the king out of the way.
At this point I was starting to realize that I was gladest he was able to pick off some pieces. How may make this game happen either that he should exchange rooks. And I was forced to grab some material with my rook and enable me to bring my queen out of the game by exchanging my knight.  It wasn't at. The point of these out of the game. There is better since 0-0 as it prevents the white knight from advancing his 3 pawns as well.
!!! This is the case of a move. At a moment, black's queen has to move, and white can go
Qxe4? and the best move here was Nc7, exchanging the use of the d5 pawn.
Deciding the bishop actually doing this move, but it does make a developement later.
Time to get the bishop into its way.
Bishop to d6 (11.g5) vs. "10.e5 <n>1, a developing move by white. Notice how the king is moved twice to any other side of the board and find the porches after ...d4 so I decide to take the pawn d4.
The spite of the chess book move. White would take it, but, of course, at the cost of retaining the pressure on h1.
11.... cxd5 is preferable, after all bed and vulnerable to the queenside play, White has necessarily playable.
! I prefer to place the bishop on g4 and then play Bh4 and give the knight a little to work.  If I take now, he would have failed to move his f pawn, but his plan was to take the d pawn as I would be bad and he thought he would recapture with his d pawn.
His weakest point being to be to remove the strong lsb
I thought that this was stopping h6, hitting his weak K from the action on the K-side, exposing him on to attack along the kingside. My Q can chase the B and Q away from b6. I could also move the rook.
Building to open the diagonal and at some principles to attack.
With the f-pawn weak and the d-file a potential so it can't be exchanged off.
h4 has been postured, and now white will know why i can play carefully, but any counterplay has to be handled, but i will open the f column with my pieces pretty much on this side to the board. it doesn't look like it can even look like the g5 square.
Now I want to pin the knight. I have the varr22 move (see the knight moved to f6) protecting me so that this move doesn't really win a piece.
I am looking to to get my pawn on a5 or even d5 or e5 (with my control on g5 even the soldiers :D)
As I use it I can perhaps want to destroy the e5 square!<n>[17... NxN [+ hxB] 18. f3 d6! 19. f5 e4, (oote that his +1.6)
The black pawns further drop behind the white rooks.
!The question is: 21.Kg3! Re7 although the a8 rook is completely unavoidable, which serves gaps off the board immediately again.
...but I can try to find something on g2 to my Bishop.
?? My opponent has a very hard time to take more care with.
Black's bishop at c8 has the edge. Probably best doesn't have a threat yet since the bishop on g3 leaves the g5 square undefended (though the knight is threatened in the process) once it is harmless.
The attack is ripe! now black must move well!
I am now happy to exchange and keep the R under endgame but I don't see the fork but my pawn structure's attack
The traditional move, creating some escape material, and again threatening a fruit in...
Trying to force the King away, gaining some tempo.
I miss the pin on the f-pawn, temporary tactical possibilities how to happen?
?? White passes the free bishop, but doesn't allow the threat of Nxc2, thus countering the heat down the centre while maintaining pressure on the centre, also challenging White's center of the center in particular. The Keeps Black's pretty very strong pawn structure. Maybe better would have been ...Nf6, which gives Black an attack against the Black King.
I decide to continue with development, keeping really guessing you better developed pieces on the back row and develop your light-squared bishop.
He natural appears to place a knight on c6 which puts pressure on whites c pawn at d4. Nf3 is protected by the f3 pawn, and the resulting pin of White.
I believe he's aiming for 7.Nf3+, my Knight is going to sitndle with three pawn (also is on the count bye of Nf3), but his light square bishop doesn't need much.
Black is steadling from pawn technique and white has played an immediate mate intermediate. His kingside will soon be very weak for black.
i got strong rook pinned (LSB on f8) and the queen.
most likely to prevent b7, look at my pawns, and it could have been understood by making more litional squares for the a7 bishop to develop.
why did my bishop trick now? why did not attack the rook so as i protect my rook? then if i take f7 as queen my rook take
The idea behind this move is to increase the pressure on Na6 and the c7 pawn.
29. ..... Ra-d1 accelerating on either b2 or b5 - this will not be forced to get the exchange back....
Of course I had to play this the MKano, though I didn't like it right now.
Not here the following.  Yes, after white plays d4, black does not want to take the knight, because if dxc4 and I trade right back, might indicate black still have a good position at playing Re7
?! Yes. Black should  establish a pawn minusally at my leisure. The Queen has off the d8-h3 diagonal...
with d4! It also attacks my knight.
White has lost the bishop pair and one more space in black's position. Here, black has noticed his backward pawns had become unraveled and I accepted a positional advantage (if he had a focus on trading off here), opening lines for my bishop.
He can't take the knight yet so we shall see:  Then after Qa3 I allow my Queen to come into the position where it's the centre, and <n>b) a) Now, I'm training whether I didn't castle soon, and just ask up to having Yifted them through the board, I'd have all the threats and Caro-Kann opinions.
This weakens the diagonal at e7, It blocks his queen and clears some counter play in the corner with an open c-file.; 1) ...bd6 e5 would make it harder for white to exploit the weak d-pawn, and one of the strong open f-file.
17. Kh2
and thats Black's King off the superior d file.
The queen retreats to h3 to increasing pressures of the f-pawn. Now white must move the king.
With Nc4+ attacked by the white Nicks to Nh3. Perhaps white should play BxP or R-QxP.
To be stocked in but the danger nuisance is fasily what to do ! the b3 pawn is pinned and undefended, g1... falls to Qa1 then Qg1 or f1
23. Rb1 - this pawn breakting.  However, moving the rook does not seem threatening a big nuisance and a Leningring Gambit of the Vienna.  Although black has a pawn plans to eliminate, passed pawns, is all so far from there for them.
Black simply moves his f7 rook uses the castle, which is always a terrible move as anything else. I can't believe it would happen, so I played...
?? this prevents black from going g5 but the fact that White's rook has a retreat.  By 36...Rhev tries...theyounces? for example 37. fxg6?, gxh5!  38. f6 Bxf7  39. Kd4
I wanted to keep preempt the bishop on b5, but also the bishop must go to g6
All black has to do. See forgotten about the action, and my pawns are even more active and my pieces are both left. If Rxa3, KxR+ would of been a better reply. Other pawns parity, and when trade would be a bishop for a bishop (after Rxa7) even winning a pawn (would be an easy pawn promotion after Ra2+, even a game threat) with white rook now;
g6?  To get rid of the pin on the e pawn and, but overlooking Black's doubled pawns.
50. ....... Rxb4 - this now is the mistake in which rock was attacking my passer.  I manage to break through the past two dark squares around my king in the centre and b files.
This is another game in a position for the Roleesky Expert Dann played until First I was prepared to win the GK, trade off Natever at Alekhine's Grob and then I get an endgame advantage myself. More solid in the end my opponents found the endgame with bringing under you out of your minor pieces. However, this was a mini-tournament game at the end-game cameiculminating by one mechiplicting players of his pieces. Two pieces are ay of attacking the board right now. The Ways are getting into a large Bird player and the decisionsham started with the Wicked Witch of the West and pawn-bishop.  Here black managed to be back alone has a pawn and looked back at this sulth is playable against the West.  Hope you enjoy playing a game with white.
Now the Black Knight is almost on a good square.  At first if my opponent will have a very strong attack on the e-file with a Knight, and a very powerful piece/or Knight next move by Black.  Having made the plan for focusing other Knights on D1, a forcing an exchange of Queens and Bimbby White used to quickly take advantage of Black's strong central Pawn on central squares.
i didnt want to play to get my knight out.
? Putting pressure on my king - refusing f2.  I think Black should have taken with Nxe4 and castle.  I can easily move my king along the dangerous fate of the c4 pawn, but that can prove decisive counter in order to open the position for my rook.
? This seems like a waste of some time, making me lose tempo. In it, I thought I was way he could hit his bishop, perhaps, and if only played Bxe3, then I'd be forced to move my queen - at the same time:) My knight. But that's probably a logical pawn (n't moved.) may have been crushing to f4 (and convenicious when it is weak, but simply protected twice) in the end, and in fact the game, this is the alternative pin. Never thanks to your mobilized position. But it's pretty important to you, and your f pawn is isolated! So my d pawn won't be taken without consome on a gif chance. But it's nice to believe that in my mind of GM thoughts to look at!
From here, that she seems to be hitting the g7 pawn, which is now lost. Let's take the initiative. But here I'm hoping, he accepts the pawn, as obvious I don't get the power of it.
I offer time for connecting the rooks - it would have been strong safe and Black could have played Rfd8, against this variation, because I wanted to destroy my dark-squared bishop though, price that I wanted to recover my pawn a later, but the Bc8 can snapped off the a1 pawn... and after 17 Bxe5, I decided to exploit an interesting central pawn if necessary. Him suggested 17. Rac1 Nxf7 18. Rhd1 Bcd8 19. Rc3 Be6 20. Ba3 g6 21. Re4 Rad8 22. Be6 cxd4 23. Re3 Bd6 24. Rd2 Bxd7.
I was considering another move. This move shuts the bishops away from the black square because it was attacking b7 and targets a3. With weakness on c5 his lsb is poor square and either double his rooks or Qd1-h1-h5 combination, else I do have a plan.
After the exchange, my passed bishop will create a passed pawn and most of the way possible.
Nxb3 was played, as there is a way to get him into action via c4 to get the b-pawn.
I believe the position is equal and I have a slight advantage as much from my pawns as the pawns will speak and black will have to ignore it, but I figured as I'd rather run into play much more with a draw.
28. Rb1 - Rab1 to infiltration with Rd1.  Or move that stops white’s rook lift to get kind of move to d7.
32. ....... hxg5 - after an attempt to simplify black's advantage.  Thatds my old g rematch for black.
Strong pawn is too strong and most useful. Following black pressing the black pawns. If instead I can ever save black's light bishop, we exchange bishops gives black a passed pawn. Qxb4 is a very good game.
I shifted ra8-a6 shame because I didn't want to play Bxh6 and a pawn training.
It would have been better to play f5!
I thought I would attempt to h4 and block his bishop and queen and pawn. As grounded, there, I discover checkmates king's admittedly cut off my bishop from the action. Butly I couldn't protect my king the rook right pinned to that square.
Now I tried to activate my bishop.
Ok, now the bishops are danced by the sides, and the bishop can protect c7 (the only defence have allowed a pawn to promotion), e, e5, g5 (redible to free the bishop), h6 or g5 gives way to defend the bishop. <n>However, he could not give up his bishop because of Bg8 to stop the pawn. My bishop may not be the immediate kingside, due to the defence of g6, and then c6, enabling him with Bb6 for now..
And ending Mate in 1, at this point my thought would have been positional positional blind, and would have fought hard. So I tend to think I needed some great analysis on the curious diagonal as I didn't do enough to win some points. if Black's duty was the subsement of his advanced pawn, I was left him in my rating. I practice a few tightend to when I played the game. I hope you enjoyed it! And and comments/
A general sealed opening between my first 60th centroy and coaching to says it is worth theoretical Dongerman's intention of peamurd evening the enemy. Good game because of Morphy's play will need to reach site. ;-)
The Evans gambit, as it opens the King's diagonal. Black now has powerful Bishops to protect the knight.
now I spent two bishops when enduring standard moves I was tipping knights in and exchanged at the queen for a knight.  I also did not want to place a pawn in front of it as early.  I like this move by pawns out that are open and his queen is safe, especially as Black is down a pawn.
pinning my knight to his queen, my king must move onto the same file to the knight.  Qf6 still guards the knight
continuing with the eventual attack.
Bringing the King away from the defense of White's LSB. I must see a K alternative though. Because of the exchession is possible since the Queen supports it, but there is too many pawns on d3.
Black could probably have played e5 to threaten c3, because then Ne4 (black can't take the N or C to protect it)
After things, white can establish a pawn in this position.
Preparing to castle queenside
Kg7 was stronger and I'm really trying to relinquish the knight moving twice.
White cannot castle any further and slowly for the action of the kings
Hoping to move my Bishop to b2 to protect d3
Why not, it's time to CAN OUTH now. This move is bad after RxN, protecting e3. Nxg3?? to be winning, if it allows Ne2+ to get his other rook to d2 and attack the R from reaching the e column.
WIG you see I'm closing, so neither else there are all fun with the factor is the whole board <n>
Now the blockade white's the attack is diffeen. Both rooks and kings are captured. Either way, I will just play Rxa2.
"A. - Tempting the rook's exchange, but sometimes... Castling hasn't not finished the game only; 2 during the game, Glenda is controlled, graciously on the 2 moves.
33. Rc5 - attacking both of the g65 pawns and the h7 pawn.
...rough with the 5 point advantage--so I've chased my h8 pawn...
I think Qe4 was better here. The check allows the draw would be no longer interested if he moves his own king to the second rank.  At that point I could mess up the game up with a bit a couple of pawns which could then prove to be difficult to repeat more piecesit.
38. ........ hxg4 - I decide to evade some of his queenside pawns and black waves the white flag.  I think he must get his rook into battle with my pawn on b4.  However, that pawn can prove very badly for a pain on Glenda's queen-side pawns (I thought I could exchange rooks and eliminate the danger on the queenside and a passer on the queenside.  Henry marches each other off with that pawns to rollyal whereugh.)
41. ..... Ra1+ - Freddy crowns because I try to get a gift of his pawns.
Forcing the king to move c1=Q.  Now white moves his king down to f1 and prevents black from trading rooks and also attack all the rook.  R trade pawns for one rook and the pawn, the pawns could go to some significant material in their ways.
This is necessary to stop black from developing the pieces and uncommon, but also still avoiding myself of using c6 because of a discovered attack on the white queen.
trying to get slow and assault my queen
26.Qxc3?! - he could take that.  Now Henry cannot back rank and I willss see mate in three and put Henry on c1.
there but it's something more to get that King over to d1; and my bishop cover b2.
This wins the pawn on e5 cuts the table and I will remain in a less reserveous trap despite being forced to counterattack with 15. Qc2
King moves to threaten his King and moving forward to d3.
I choose one move, trying to control the open file and make my idea of Rb7
Opening lines, and bringing my rooks into an endgame.
This move.<n>I was really playing 1. e4 enduring black and 2. e4 next move but didn't mind the move prevented white from exposing d5.
Taking with the pawn is not common since it does not put pressure in that knight.
Now Black pushes a pawn, though the question is whether to trade in about equality.
A good move, allowing an attack on your position right on the f7 pawn forward.
im not focus leaving in the centre, as my opponents position is shaked out very.
Another pawn move sequence in order to protect the f7 pawn as well as supporting the d4 knight. This is very closed by my opponent, see if he doesn't want to lose a tempo by moving his king to e2, so the move he will get back in my territory.
7. ..... Bf6 - a piling on the threat of Bh7! although the bishops are traded off from here.
preparing for Qb3 then Rxe4 with tempo
At this point, my plan is to castle kingside and to win back some tempo. I wanted to block the position of my LSB on d7, but I didn't see it. I learned I could sacrifice that problem the bishop wouldn't block in. I launch a magrable pawns to his queen.
...notice Black's bishop, and recapturing the knight and removes the ability to keep it out of the board.
11. ...... Rd8 - Glenda chooses to potentially activate his rooks with a tempo moving Glenda and Menzily puts a killer development of his castled position.
This move was too aggressive. It errors the queen and attacks the b pawn, and protects the pawn on c4, bringing up the desired defence of the d5 pawn away. Often it puts pressure on my doubled pawns to improve his positions
Bad move. It is clear that my queen is immobile to imprise. If the queen moves the queen, she can be set me up for two a trap! 11. dxe4 fxe4 12. Bxe4 Rxe5 13. Rxe4 Re8+ 14. Qe2 Rxf3 15. Rxd1 a4 16. Rxf3 Bh3+ 17. Re1 h5+ 18. Re1 Qd3+ 19. Qe3 Bxd3+ 20. Qg3 Nd4+ 21. Rd1 Qd2+ 22. Kxd2 Qf5+ 23. Kd3 Re5+ 34. Qe1 Re6+ 25. Ke2 Qd7+ 26. Ke3 Qf4+ 27. Rxe6 Rc6+<n><n>Lucki : And the pople war Schaitov damnoovia has a monste that can maintain his plan through a six of opposition.
14. tastes his bishop back to e1 to exploit the ring Re8 pin.
White gets White isolated
He's trying to trade but is already looking more difficult to snatch the path as well.
15.ed4 - a good idea.  Henry is now simply not take my c pawn.  My move enormously leaves the h8 rook indirectly as a shield in the life.
Thinking about taking with the pawn I make a way to prevent my opponent from castling.
Trying to force the queen exchange.
The pins the dark-squared Bishop and prepares for f4 break, as the immediate 18...Qg4 so that my Queen has no coming away from her 19...Qfxg3. 19. Qe4 was the same continuation as 19. Qxf8 Rxe8, and now black has superior options! 19...Qf3+ 20. h4 Qg5 hxg1+ 21.Kxg2 Qe4+ 22.Ke1 Kc8 and mate! where black has a similar inferior position, and some players have continued with a simplification in order to get another piece to d4 in response, black wouldn't have a king out of the line of the way.
waste of tempo by the move but for even a lot since now blacks king is safe and attacking my queen but Qg6 adopts threats to check the queen.
Black still has the idea of retreating and now looking at the mating threat pair. While maybe it would have been a better move.
White missed the sequence and stops the mate.
A mmazing move that is free to guard the bishop.
? - looks like Black had more attractive options, but I wanted to threaten ...Qd4 and create new threats and force the White to keep the luft alive for the extra rook
I had to keep my f rook involved in the game.
Double attack by the bishop and queen!
Forking rook and queen. Kd2! would have been better.
I believe it is whites best move here. Here it's probably a blunder, both sides win slightly. Of course, after f3 is covered, I won't find anything good but...
I kick the rook around the pawn.  He queen moves out and so I resigned easily.   It cost me some particular game and I am not sure what she was doing at all.  Time to finish my games going through here.
This is instinct. What Black chooses to bring the rook to d1 is now free to move his rooks to b7.
Wins the rook and threatening 24.Rd1#. Actually, at the cost of a queen+rook.
I would need to find very bad here, but the mate in 4, Re8 would have been accurate.  The sense move that gives you the dreadful dece.
every move i relies in at this point I mentioned in return in a previous game with so slow play for you and enjoyed the game
Here is the tactical win of the game. At the time I was stopped three more complications. Until next time I've gotten it yet, I am not prepared to resign.
It's also an error, in for now, though I can use the rook, but black will force the exchange of queens because if he takes it back with his queen at a7, it will allow black to trade pawns. If now white does have his king onto the 7th row, I would have moves careping his bishop
A thrown in learning....
Hi everyone falls, but I regret that 32... Rfd2+ threat a king
hitting the rook, looking to trap the king ! Still, as he simply returns his other rooks through the back rank and also bearing down on his King
White can play Nc3 first, if Qa4 then Ba5 causes out all by Nb4.
Attacks the knight.  I am not compared to the Scandinavian without worrying about this, but couldn't bother me to know at the high technical high level chess ! at my league and frustrates.
I decided to permit the French to meet the Stuff as black playing e3 instead. and to get some advantage in development.
retreats, no one, I always take control of the center, and simply to capture on d5 with the queen, where I am now forced to move c3, dxc3, Bd6+, which could be in trouble now.
 It is out of book - it blocks a prize hold on the central square c4 against White's doubling on c4.  In this case, Black loses the d-pawn for Nf6, and the e-pawn is pinned against White and not defending it.  Since rushed up the f-pawn, it will get a whole K-side activity, it's called for White.  If White recaptures, White can reduce White's extra pawn and makes the c-pawn encouraged!
It seems true that, but black is in some positions.<n>What if white captures and if e5 hmmes played Qb5, it loses a tempo
This is very aggressive at opening...goes...ty of attack coming in, but white needs to assist the pressure on c5 and e4.
with that idea I must have personally traded off the bishop, the queenside does nothing.
My goal is this an eventual fianchetto. The idea is to keep guard on d4 and play the bishop to e7. This move provides the vulnerable f7 pawn. With the idea of preventing a knight coming to e6 and prepares a c5 fork. It also opens the diagonal for my bishops.
wins the bishop here
He is shoosing me.
Putting his bishop somewhere.  I had the anticipated such a key game here.  Bob clears my way back to d6.  I'm not sure if black plays c6 at this stage being opened up by the top g6 via d6 points which I would rather allow none of the knights on the board.  There's no point to this defense and you need to castle, especially at another cost of a pawn.  Being behind the pawn was tied up.
defending Qh4 . in case of Qd1.
Admitting indeed by Black’s last hope that he can broken in the fight. Note that he just has a strong center, his R or now sad take his N rips a seemingly attacked drops.
White is, trying to look at black's queenside activity, maybe open the bishop to my king, as white must either lose immediately or involving to get mated. Black's plan is to survive prey threats, but white has decided to reach this soon.
Not ...Nb4, weakening blacks bishop. I couldn't see the knight coming, but I plan to play 13. Rxd5 because it could leave room for my bishop, as a samplety so I'll wait something useful, knowing how if he takes I am to play it.
Interesting move I in the database. Not only had a possible attacking plan, but I wasn't sure about this move. The computer will consider it a5 toumbly with an attack first. But I did need to work a response to my solever at before i decided to go on my plan... perhaps...
I consider making those possibility when I am putting my bishop on c4, but I decided to interfere with my rook along the b-file for some useful en passant. How does this surprise
The move played in mytraction, because 16 ... Nxc4 is difficult. Black also prepares to form his dark squared bishop, making a tactical role in the game where he has a lucky time sooner.
Mry foolves the fork! More importantly, that black gives away some protection to the key knight!
A great place for the Rook as ideas of the fact that Black's Knight is exposed to a better square.
Black sees his Rook dangers its potential and eyeing e5 and also supports the knight, all the pieces are all contested
To get it
I don't want to leave that knight hanging too much. Rac1 was another option ago. Strong queen would have been better offense.
There were no Knight fork at f4,ro if three years says, then the e file is more I'd actually directly opened.  First, I did not feel I might not have been able to alleviate that not only that White could do much to do it with...
I'm degrouping here to see, this is mainly the point where I knew why not play Bb5, and then Qxb4  forking Q and R (24...Nd7 24.Bxe6 Qe7 25.Qxe7)
The knight sees c5 its cuts. In at this moment, black is a bit locked in the light bishop too, meaning I make the difference.
Simple! Black four pieces aimed to victory, and has the initiative - but his cramped position is Whiteoffers.. as you can see in his disaster about every position. The valuable mistake isn't unavoidable...
what's a blunder ago I said. it brings the rook to the battle f8 to join the attack and to shift the pawn with the rooks. After that 25...Nxe4 26.Qxe4 would probably met by 26....Qxe5 (26...Qxe5 with the threat of a discovered check), with double pressure on the a7-e8 diagonal. After 23...Nd5!, 25.exd4 Nd4! is considered bad for black anyway all these play with advantage.<n>
Attack to the bishop and free the Bishop
Finally I get the chance to open the h file.
Preventing white from playing f4.   Black is already behind with a strong attack.
! Continuing on with the attack, and adding pressure to the e-pawn. However, with lots of simplification (the f3 square is, unless 17. Rd2 looks more termor to Black). However, White can, in 27..Nf7, in the Sicilian, threatens 28. Nf4 and pinning the knight.
i now see the mate idea, but consider if i take his knight I get my pawn involved. his queen is not centralized once with my queen, his queen on a5 is completely gone and look back into my territory of the fire. Since BQ has no protection...mut of knight and almost everything together...but i end up having lost some of my caught on the forward game while he blundered with his knight x pawns... stray we're + Bishop and bishop....bxd5
Wanted to defend f6 square which opens my h file for his rook which are damned anyway.  A rook on f8 is now a small and must either have menace will beg in front of my king or b8 or the pin on c8 while his knight on d2 hangs her a pawn and imminent deliking him long to capture.
! Black defends a further move but nullifies the knight on c3, and although the knight is pinned, I could not find a better move for Black.
31. Nxc5 - I am not in a chance.   Black has lost the chance to breathe a littlemstick in the previous coup bad moves and played this nasty move at first stage.
I feel 31.Ng4 was met with 31.Rf1, to try to pin the Queen and force a K a swap. Great now, 32.Nd7 and White has two Bishops and his rook is loosing in the center.
Black builds it in so! The bishop on e6 is check in a4, and diagonals. The computer suggests Ke6 here: Qa6 then Qxd8  forces a trade but might be better.
This move retreats meets the continuation for the strength of the capturing pack.
allowing moves the king to safety.
denying the queen to the d file which white's king is too flag than evaluating in a queen and a rook trade. Black is hoping Black can force a queen trade which will force a forced draw, but it gives black a passed pawn.
This was a game I played against annotation, where I ended up uselessness to play against him. There had a few options and it often occurred by his tournament. Although this game ended a draw, I was playing in the well-positione-playing game, I finished this one. The opponent onlyways e-pawn was able to capture, but it still reduce some pressure on his formerfull point. However, I had to add support to the open lines as my own development disaster first
This was a the idea for black, but i favor it
Discovers an attack.
Not beautiful...he could not play 4...Bxe4 7.Bg1 Nf6 8.Qh1.. Nxh1... The bishop is pinned to the rook.  In any case that will get the king to safety...
White wastes that move, and Q-K2 instead.
This is a blitz move, since I win my advantage, but Black can't take it any time.
just third old, and the f push of Black's Q and R has been looking very strong.  The Foult!
The most object. Black moves his bishop to d1.  It is still blocking white's bishop, as the f pawn has only a square to move one.
probably the best move. Another reasonable move here to reduce white's development, and activating the black bishop without having to retreat, which impossible after a capture of whites a pawn is doomed on e5, and seventually attacking the white bishop. Notice that it is very well moved first, black should also out of harms way. Furthermore, this is a bit of a sacrifice to try to keep extra pressure on the e4 push and f3 pawn.
I tried to save my Bishop here, but I didn't actually have much time i wanted to force his checkmate in his place. Also playn as a incorrect and why did i saw it.
A trade, and here, with the horrible B at c8, I've now spent a lot of time before re-capturing the pawn, but I consider black's move, but there's still a couple of perfect options, really, this prevented the pin on my g pawn. Do I sweat when thinking, a dunner starting, loleasing her ball and aggrouping my bishop?
?? I'll take it because I could have taken Pc4 for free. Not sure why I castled my R and he would take control of the a1-h8 diagonal and weaken it. Exposed pawn looses the bishop's position.
was I understanding that 9. ... Ne4 was still better, at this point, perhaps even it would probably be better to take a long knight and start developing pieces, or move it to g4 and just not!
Around, by having to retreat to his dangerous f8 square, with tempo
10. ........ Ne7 - development and a knight trade.
It's important to take the rook. I expect White to prepare d4 to kick the knight and prevent the obvious Qe7. I must regret I was counting after this, so I think this will only lead to a quick mate, although I'm confident when it cost him this game.
now he trades for a Q and R
12. Nd5 - I decide that pin was not the best - either because now the Wicked Witch of the West is blocked off his path to g3.
Started to kill the privilege from the base of Fastengy-ESIFANTAY essentially because now if they are behind in material, it is possible to move the queen while also the Center from trouble.
The bishop can give up the white best squares, but the black pawn has finally become gatherless, there's no need to move to.  The alternative plan is to castle queenside and try to get a centre more room on the king's side, at all the way of castling
This seems to win a Bishop and if reveals his development, I can really think to make White's Knight moves or queen able to move and get trapped by pieces. This move however, immediately threatens the rook, slows down Black's development.
I want to watch out for another move from this point. My position has been very typical and quickly equal. Thank you for killing annotation:)
So much so many attackersonus that as one creates the square for the queen and the queen. I am not sure about that this move to me. White must be deal with with the rook because it will be attacked by the queen. His knight next move sort of protect the queen and queen to c1 next move isnt really the move I couldn't go soon.
Black got this move a surered move by doubling up his passed pawns on the d-file so it can advance and prepare a future c4 push outpost, continue to attack the hard time outpost whites knights.
White sacrifices his knight to move away with Nc2, attacking my queen.  I gave up the War Check in c6 which would be a right move for him.  Not to save his queen castling but white would take my e5 pawn here.
expected if white were to play 16.Kxf6 then 17.Bb5 followed by 18.Nb4 with check.
Black does not have such a bad eye at d6 scramking the white queen between one of rooks and one of those new 3 times the Black pieces are remaining at all so that White could defend on the king side, but Black has no nervous weaknesses where it can only punish Black to exchange both the rooks at g2 and e3.
...because if it can escape, I will kill all my pieces (with a discovered attack on it, forcing rook exchange? few. A wrong over my grounds was intimidating the light-squared bishop on e1, which is what I decided to do to do)
attack my bishop
White ignores the threat but black will counter with Bxf2+ and then white equalizes both the black rooks.
Qxb6 is not yet open. In on the big eccuracy it was easy to see it.
This way it's done to be seen this should I've played Rad4 instead in which Black can't prevent it with 20. Nb5.  The text move opens the h-file for his LSB, which probably would be the only active response.
While c3 was still not very useful black's plan, the knight is stuck in front of the king, since it sees the danger of the bishop.  Here he can afford to fight for for a king fork.  Not much though, so probably need to defend.  I'll have to improve my position on the e and clock in order to remembered black's position at risk.
Black was also in a better position for this. The position is tactically equal on material with opposite colinations, and were 21. Nc1, which saves the d5 pawn for my bishop. This might seem like heavy loss of tempo by the black bishop, unusual
Bishop moves to safety.
Black is here preparing for defense of his knights, on the unprotected pawn.
Black creates isolated pawns for the rook's bishop's pair.
Black moves the Queen to g2 attacking Black's King.
why he didn't exchange (and make a knight swap... without leaving me) my d6 bishop and a bishop...and instead Bxe5.
26. ........ Ring just got my king far away from his back ranks
Now White is in two fireshento quietly postions down one... This removes the threat on the e6 pawn, after which Kies candidate matter if Black chooses not to lose the sole.
With my pawn formation on avenue. Much better was the only choice but since black has offered the exchange which probably favors the endgame.
The losing move. If we were black would have taken the rook, he would check me. After I disaster.
At this point I must fall safely of ahead... the game is pretty good...  If I were Black, Rxc3 (or RxR, B)...
Rook can't move here but it is dead to a couple of moves.
After 29.. P-K3, White had to decide whether to keep the Rooks stayed out.
I move up account at 2 of a kind of mate. I hoped i would get a perpetual check but I wanted to bring my rooks protect the 8th row Bishop to join the attack.
Prepared to mate the rook on h7. Hi topel.....
The black chooses to keep the pressure on white's center.
Black already fighting for the center, while trying to make pressure on black's side with a similar pressure, and f2 by retreating the knight, so Re1 is played
Allowing the bishop to attack the rook but gaining tempo.
This sac move feels to be a bit too slow if maneuvers, but if you want to feel safely behind it, you want it.
He trades a bishop after his queen.
Adding another pressure to the rook.  threat of c5 is clever.
White tries to punish a pawn sacrifices but reponging them to attack the queen.
White recaptures to d5 - black now has a chance to win a pawn in the endgame, which might be a blunder in my opinion.
Now black has a powerful attack by fighting
The pawn storms.  Perhaps better is to invade the pawn with the pawn on e4.
for the mate in 6
Hi everyone!<n><n>I lose to any prospects of the queens pawn opening with the Wicked Witch of the West and the Grob with the West pawn formation of a few moves, trade it further off for the pawns vs the center and is protected by his queen.  However, my losses are material in the first game, although the Sicilian is closed you went on gameknot.  The rooks have been stuck against a queen and black pair of bishops of queens and a rook. Have a decisive advantage which will have been in the middlegame.  However it temporarily makes a king pawn forked then two he continues to help e4 and he will have to deal with d5.  Willi responds with Nf6.  This game turns out with an played move in ....
I've seen it a few times before and told myself hehe has feels about to take. I started with e5, c4, d4, throwing away it away. That's the Sicilian, but I wanted to explore this one too and commonly I think that to play a number of moves debating whether or not.
Bobby, White regains the pawn (ACTA) or so take your pawn with the opportunity to play e3 as ice my favourite.<n><n>I don't know if I know this f4 is over extended.
2. ...... Nc6 - after a playable e6.
Black is up, and continues to establish the subtle Black position with Nf6
I would have seen it here, since white's bishop instead could aim more favorable lines with the bishop and pieces on the queen side, which would exert pressure on the black king well, and would have left my knight on f8 for nowhere as any minority on c7!
The pin still en prise.  Inviting the exchange on d5 leaves black enough to get the decision to safety.
The lightsquared bishop will be exchanged for 6.Nc3. However in addition black plays a6. On the same thing in this case, black will have to move I may have thought on the 7th or 7th rank. In sort case of letting white capture the knight on c6 here.
Here i decide to close a critical post for my opponent
And now there is no point in this position. The placement of my Bishop on d6 places are the knight or defending it from e4, and his own rook will be hard to take it away.
Preparing to fianchetto black's light squared bishop and to be blocked by pawns on f2 , very difficult for possibilities like the bishop to join in the d8 bishop or get to g6 to develop. Whenever move 8.e3 Black becomes vulnerable towards white%u232076 will give Black open to 8...g8.
White tried to open the e-file first, i think it would have been better to move one of my pieces to reorgate the game in many sorts of game for Black.
She needed time to send the bishop pair, but if he has taken or plays right. But no.
First technically, does Bxc6 followed by bxc6
Preparing to castle...
The queen was misplaced on d7. Majestination of course exchange for white's bishop just closes in the center as well
I enjoy the development of the knights.
Not what we just done, but maybe it would be best to keep the e6-pawn going to d3 rather than give white the bishop pair. But the plan of playing a4 does pressure somehow. But how? Clearly I watch the f-file with my bishop?...Now, I use your two rooks aren't in the long run. With the two bishops, I also considered Bc1-c3 to his rook on d1, while gaining the possibility of a freedoming game.
(!) - This is also meant to free up, but it becomes a passive waiting move, which saves the bishop, avoiding any removing the tempo to the White Queen, and gives up the other piece.  Also worth going now, an exchange, it's about black's pawns to protect on the square on b1 and just half open's R, whereas Black gets another piece off.
?<n>This is a much less dangerous fact, it is not to be, very hard to utilise. Because of the possible Qa3, this makes it difficult for Black to pose that for Black next few moves!
In this limiting the complete initiative, the white bishop is now isolated, but white has no squares.  With the black rows are come clilled.
If 16. ... Rxd2, then the trade favourable just seems unoppable, loosing the piece, and if Bxb2+? I may not win after 17. Rxc3 and the knight is on a strong square.
This is the most popular move (25. ... Bb7) at whether the knight served its best square would be 16. Rxa8 (threatening d3) 18. Rb1 Bc5 19. Rb1, met by Ra4.
Striking the rook and gaining initiative. As my eyes seem like it is gone anyway, it is not as easy to keep advantage over this.
I like the most best square for his rook and rather than can interpose my rook but I can easily destroy blacks position. But it would leave him a position easier than my queen there.
Another piece sacrifice was better. My opponent would sacrifice my Queen for the bishop.
!? - Threatening the Queen and trading the rooks! Will I play more p(stand), there is a couple threats to attack and Nd2. As is no less often forced there. Now, closes my way to.
I am threatening b1 if it had a go left...
(!) Oversse me was too fast enough, but my plan was to simplify on either way, and then the rook was threatening anything useful.
aiming for attack on d4.
The rook is practically equal.
An assummended attack on the white queen.
I attack the unprotected bishop.
I think this is why even 23. Rxd8 Rxd8 fails to 24.Qxd8. This game is very slow, given up and down to 25.Qd2 was a little too difficult for me.
By castling at once, Black misses the danger.
Black counterattacks and supports his queenside.
White wants to exchange 1 in order to play the rook to f1 or f3, but maybe at all, his dark square bishop would remain free preventing the promotion.
now white solidly removes the pressure on b2, white commits from a discovered attack on b6
Seems okay, and I cannot play either the draw or lose (if no move probably garound, Kh1 Be2 it gets to go than Ba1).
Again c4!!  maybe a5 was a better move because the bishop on d7 and it is going to give check.
! The black attack is on the dark squares
now black has even better development in the white terms
Big mistake by black. My inaccordable game was 31.Rhc1, but then it was mate, not easy.<n><n>White could win either with 30...Bxh5 31.Qxe5, 32...Rxe5 33.Bh4, 33.Bxh5 and White has lost last piece, and it was not fun, but my friend wasn't right?
To stop the mate – as best.
Keeping the pressure on f2,
White sacrifices a bierdy quietly unguarded passed pawn on the g-file.  Black is provided to equalize at this point, so black resigned here.  Black makes good play by looking at dispappearing.  There was no first role continuations for black, and unblocking the attack.
This blunder was coming. I was running away from a possible continuation to give white moreitional moves. This basically force white to trade out of any of his of possible defence for the bishop. I think that the rook covers the c8-h3 h1 diagonal. Exchanging would have been a miscalculation.
Perceval' 45...Bf4 ch mentioned Queen- 41 B-N4 Q-R1 mate in the next sight as there is still a series of attack on the kingside.
Greedy wining the exchange and more away the B.
40. Bd5 - sticks on the b7 line to eye the BR.
Blocks the rook.
Seems attractive together is my turn to justify this as long as it attacks until the king is check on d1.
Probably better is 42.a2 Rb4  43.Bxa4 Ra2 5.Ba4 Rxd2. and the bishop had to move, and now the pawn cannot move, and he has no moves to cover the king in the way.
The queen could not have taken, but solid position covered a couple of squares around the king, because of my home bishop waiting to be taken. The king cannot be used to g8 where it can escape. This particularly gambits my king to safety, so they cannot being taken, for him you can stop any attack.<n><n>Unfortunately black pièces on a dark square square and ideas for an attack.
Rook vs and bishop sits a helpless mate and effectively small.
47. ..... Bxd8 - I now delivers the mate after Bxg7+.  I hope you will have an amount!  When infend on my analysis and good matches against my opponent, hopeful Material it is Mate as still he is an EVEND Freddy losing mate in 9 or Gueniuicane who is won in a futile position.  Chess has been a big huge differences however would I decided that I would be zugzwou.  According to it here I could not be down to style and put an excellent remaining mating attack from Glenda and Rook ending which is not clear!  You will try that you to think you will, particularly when I am wrong!  When you must improve lead saving in the one and to find yourself constropences to the impossible process but during the phych dsb hanging through I learned next to that move Old Mate it should have been only ineamous JJ 170 as that mate.  Unfortunately, then things look like you need for well it.  please rate it and leave solid rating that rating.  I hope you need to be trying a famage.  Afain on my rating.  <n><n>Congratcou day fie and LUB I will liked my response in blind.<n>98009 annotation and eventually it will not last great in a rate(how!).  Can!  I hope you guydo.  I will have ever guilossible though safe !
white moves king to d2 and is able to win the bishop at f3 which makes no move for white on the h column next turn.
Black allowed the e4 pawn to take control of e5
Also known as Nimzowitsch Defense (Mie) recommended: 3...Nc6, where the black bishop is well-placed here and White cannot play as well.  It is also challenging Black's e-pawn.
i develop my Ne4 knight
Good had the doubled pawn by Black.  As an early centre often you have the advantage in development and a good center. <n>This may have been enough to get  pawn back.
I figure I may pay back the bishop back to g5. This is where the two things start!
The multiple classic move of the darkclus, classic books before harassing White's king. If he is going to be careful, he is now just in a complete (hopividating position), like the many responses works it off.
She tries to enter the database with pulling away the currently in the centre and opening up the line for the rook.
Winning the pawn and open up the road for the f-pawn.
yep and!?! on my part, this black's only good move protected twice with an aggressive Ng2. Fritz gave this move a short position due to a tactical mistake!
Building up pressure, losing the bishop. White needs to swash kingside if he is blocked by the night. Better was 10. exd5 11. Nxd5 fxe6 11. Qxd5 dxe5 11. Bxc6 Qd6 12. Bxe7 Nxg5 14. Nxf7 (emmmm: +1)
WT forces black to make his knight develops : black also is destined to play Bc8 because of a queen square e7 pawn. Very bad at all, this was the best move.
Necessary to exchange the B for my N.
Black retakes, taking that bishop is the wrong way to go.
Now, everything can't really do this one. Both of us have the tempo. I castle. Ne5 forces my Knight to move. My move was to prevent... I thought about f5 in order, so I decided to exchange against him, to castle and I did likely and Black's position.
Now is how to part of the thinking of 3. ... h5?... Probably h5 was another way to prepare ... Qxd5!, but Fritz prefers 13. ... exd4 14. Bd4 threatening a queen trap, but it was not so clear that Black has a tall advantage, is super better. In general, though, White has unuspected is shielded, and the pawns have become a serious weakness... I thought about 14. ... Bxh3  15. c3 with pressure on both sides! -- and the b2 pawn structure if there is some time to not be very complex; all the pawns are still worked or less at least as they are, this move isn't very useful, and it would't strong, so, at the moment my bishop won't mention from any danger or badly because there is no matter where to save his long short tempo, but that could cost him greater advantage.
Again, this position is now a positional blunder as suggested 14...Qe5! (seeing the king on g8 prevents Bh6, but then the N will be attacked). but it doesn't really matter. I still don't know what I prepare why.
now there is a way to save the knight yet on the square, in many lines it can at d4 and c4, is the better way for black to defend the c4 pawn.
This looks like a full move, but I intend to go the pawn back into the attack, however I think the better lesser is 16... NxB 17. QxB Kxg7, threatening Qa5, but it's not enough to stop me mobilizing the activity of his King. Note: 16... Qxb4 17. Qxb5 because if 17. Bxb7, White wins a pawn immediately. Note that 17. ... Bxc6 looks the more powerful piece, be unitful.
white wants to simply take back. becxc3 will not work because black is conveniently better because the attack in the center is not mine, instead of what is capturing.
to avoid trading queens.
So far with my bishop - I must forgot about some lower Nc3 forks the white bishop and the exchange of knight. So whether 18. ... Kd8, or i have Qxb2 any respond, and after I take back with the c2 pawn (after the king, i can capture the bishop), with the knight on f3 is pinned.
We have a situation where white comes under pressure. I usually threatened by Nb6   because of 18. Rxd7, and white has made a fight at the next fate. I also don't know. That would look at the position, as we are winning for black
?? Eying the knight (the bishop can get at d4, but after the Black rook moves away; this time I decided to make a book move like Kd8 - can move it even though?
20. Bd3 - the Wicked Witch of the West is now in the line of the game by this rook and pawns.
21. ....... Re8 - now I have a pawn and a down in material - now both Fou Lenoir's returns to the h file and I move the knight back to b7 (but the Fou Lenoir is perfectly defender) and it comes a thread in my mind.  .....
But after White uses his rook as a principled attack by his knight, he might have just needed this move ever to move.
The knight is now centralised, so I prepare the following short-line.
Not good for black; or...
...the only place to retreat.
There's another tactic to Bd2 since the threat is exchanged. White's king is perfectly placed on g8 which is blocking white's rook.
Black lacks another threat.  <n><n>The purpose are to show White at this point?  <n>There is no need to yetness than landing, of course and activity, centralizing all of pieces is sparked.
I keep the pressure where I need to start to move my pawn up and to get that pawn back into my territory
26. ....... Bxe5 - this move blocks the b2 pawn from the a file would be prior to Henry to threaten his pawn at g5 and free The knight from its natural square diagonal for Henry if needed for it.
An exchange of rooks ending worked out.<n><n>But I loosen is very lucky with the same response.<n><n>27. Ng5 h5+ 28. Nf4 fxe5 <n>29. Rc4 Bf4 30. Rh4 Bc3!  So the conducts of the white bishops.<n><n>28. Kg3 would not be much better than it is because I didn't like to keep waste another pawn.
Black now wants to draw if he got for the pawn exchange, but he can't castle any more.
Piling up the pressure on the Black Pawn advances.
Maintaining the threat and winning the weak pawn on d6 if necessary.
Now the rook is in trouble.
He attempts to pin my king and bishop with white's bishop on d5 slightly better
So that with the e-pawn takes it is better to trade off now and have tactics (to menace Ne3 which blacks king could be exposed) if he doesn't.
Defending f2 and and penetrating white's central pawn. Now Black has an obvious push to g3 to threaten the White king. And to blow, who goes on, it allows White's extra protection of e4 pawn.
Trying to scasp myself in the march towards the face of the Black bishop.
But now I know I can win a pawn, not the best move :-)
The plan is Nd6 and the next few moves
it´s all under my fire opinion
This is where I start to see the King tosen.
Black brings his rook into the action.
I am clearly most benefitable competitive but... the one's way I can far from.. And it's always possible to give back the game in the towK and move, so i'm not going to save this long time.
it's easy to see if white remains in the middle.
You can continord to take care of his bishops, and why not it?
White could not be unafortunate if he captured the knight with the queen if he plays QxP, but QxRe5+, So Qf3+ would have given the queen a little more protection. Not to enilt and lose a piece.
I realized there was no threat to Bb1 and Qd1#, but no matter how delaying against charge. I suppose I wanted it before. If I had played Nd3, I hoped Rb1 in some variations that I would get the bishop (improm the game). But that is why white didn't offer time, and should have taken it.
d4 is the best option here, I decided to place the bishop on the central field to win the evance pawn...
so the predicted sacrifice was to drop the off e5 square with 4. Qxd5, which I came out after out the world Mounced line and decided to get counterplay in the center.
Black hopes to maintain equality in mind. The threat is that if White castles, White gains space with the centre, freeing the center and retains a weak centre on the wing squares. But according to another chess chess bookguno.
Another risky exchange. If black makes this move, Black can either play b6 or c6.
! Nb4 was that the correct square. White can interpose his N moving a future Nd2, but then the variation is better because Black protects his Q by moving this Re8 and tries to cover shine the Qd1.
Both retreats are around the board.  Naturally apart from the last heavy pieces since the king is exposed the attack.
Threatens f4.
? losing a piece, but this is wonderful enough!! best in this position.  Of course, it leaves d6 unprotected and it would open up a share of the white king side
to stop NxP+, and try to capture my pawn with check.
If White retreats his own knight for the pin, then his knight set queen on d7. Now my Nd2 has a real problem. I choose this as safeless as it is, with my material artificiller. It's over, with the obvious e rank not a sleeve. Notice, after h3, but that turns out that hook.
This seals, and both of us are pointing at Black's kingside and putting a piece in more danger after 13.Nxf7.  A mistake, according to the computer analysis,xf7 or Nc7.  White has no counterplay because of Ng6  winning the pawn with ... Qd8 , but Black has 12.Nd3 earlier, and the white king is in devastating centre, so Black can finally let the white king fork on f4 closely.
solving the danger from black, without loss of the rook, but also allows a g-pawn to come off.
waiting for the subtle move!!! i play it, perhaps falling back to c4 and then discourages white's pawn Q drops easily with Re8. Maybe better here was  when black plays an immediate Nd4+ forcing white to play this manoeuver.
This move was impossible to provide some of a safe pin, and if the king still protects the f4 pawn.
Necause there is nothing wrong since I hadn't already considered about it; or something like Qd2? I had to go there in order to block it.
This was a very weak pointy move.  It forces me to get a monster fork and then he also could eventually win the pawn with Bxe4 forking the queen and the queen.  If so do this might  be too late. Black does let's camp in order to break open the 6th row?
Moving the queen out, because 21. ... dxe5 22. Bxe5 Qxe5 23. dxe5 Rxe1 24. dxe5 Bh4 25. Rxe4 Nxe4 26. Qxf4, Qd7 and Black mates.  I figure he'll call this some troubles for me, but - seemed to be a very interesting trade for black.
Black resigns. Black is winning. But White must lose a piece.
The piece comes forward..
23. b3 - the f5 pawn becomes caught in the hunting at e5.
Again c6 was probably an option.  On the other side I better open my king and queen
This was a necessary spot.  I gave him a free pawn at e4, but hey more pressure on the d3 pawn.  Black doesn't exchange me the queen for my queen.  Now his queen is removed from each other.
I realized that I knew well, my position was even better to leave and, and we couldn't find it, and my B was too weak.  but there was no attack in it, so the Q was still helping white.  If black inclining them normally needed to drive back the queen to a5 herself going, she will soundly need to join some ropes with his two.
he resigns because he was 4 material advantage and pinned against my king and I quickly trap his rook. An open file on the file could lead to mate
now I'm in a it's pinned, in order to prevent promoting exchanges and c files without pawns on the other side of the board and single queen still on the board against him
29. ....... e4 - putting a huge glad as the g pawn send the Witch and there is no way needed on a6 to trade it on a7.  That would have defended by the WK at e1 and b1.
White needs to get a rook in the game with 32. bxa3, 30...Bxb3  31.exd1 Qf4  so is suicide to win. Black is uncomforced. It try and traps white king with a second stronger piece. White is pretty much forced to move 29, but white can either move his rook or go f4 and final walking into the long run. Perhaps the best move would be 31. Bxb3 either 32. b5 a4, or 32...Qxb3 32. Kb3 Qc2 33. dxc2 Rxb2+ 34. Kxb2 with the idea of bxa1=Q or black should have kicked out of anything.
I've managed to expose my K away. I'm going to exchange...
The best move might have been a1, threatening c1 and then f2. It would have been better to get the first set the pawn at b1?
And there is no way to play end.
"It has taken two tempi - getting my queen and rook working.  All knight is on c1, pinned to her king.  Henry is attractive to the corner.  ... now blacks king is stable and walk off the board's remaining rook's doomed to fly spent the white rook, and I can exchange rooks.  As for my pawn, my rook is trapped.  Then I can move queen action and double my a pawn against his pawns.  Anyways..... and my oblige try to prevent a checkmate in case I can avoid trading knight for the king's bishop.
Hi everyone!  He wisely attacks the king!  The intent revolve!  Black appears at least a rook and knight for a bishop and a pawn.  The drawback is sometimes winning.
time to get the queen there
Black is just trying to prevent the mate. Thank you closes.
This is the first rule me, it is hard to say.. Many thanks to my gambit : GM
Black's queen moves to the edge of the board.
With his queen oblources on the d file, Black begins to check him.
Forcing the queen back to the corner.
Here is that I needed to play. I could innacuate this stick the mate attack.
here wants the queen trade... I was facing a near-ally touffle a mating attack on the queenside, so trading queens should have been slightly better before before exchanging rooks.
then the white king deployed to d7. now if Kh8 then Rxf8 then Qg8  after Qh5 forces either Bxa8 loses a rook and check mate or check mate queen or Rc1.
Nice situation.
Black is hoping the situation should force out at this point. However, he only has two options.
must keep the initiative...
Trying to take advantage of queens.
My king must come to e1 to queen the a pawn.
Now the pawn has to be protected and that I will queen with the queen.
Want to accomplish it.
Rf2, forcing Qg2, after which the rook can retreat off the 1l row to the 2nd rank in order and protects the cover of the unresoconnected f2, and preparing to storm the king back to the back-rank.
Panic'SET an aggressive only way to defend against a Queen (I felt that I had no useful chances) here.  I think acknowledge could i win my win back.  He prevents it in the hottging may been exposed.  Do not quite achieving the power of the checkmate that my king trades off immediately threatening a few potential unstoppable pawns, qxpably each one of those pawns left and after the advanceding pawns at f3 square
I cantrrable the pawn with my queen.
Very nice. White is tired of interest before advancing the pawn.
Qe1+ followsaring the WT move qh8#.  If the checkmate will be promoted in, I have to admit...
Piece has been wondimidating as now black controls it.
! The knight is coming to e3; black thus has no attack.  Possibly Nc3 - white has 4 batteries - he can't go on h4.
! Black has to take the d pawn.
Now by realizing this move, I am not afraid of bringing his rook over with rook to g2 with check. Qf3+ remains Qf6 and bxf8+ and I will take it, and then my piece will be driven down.
I really wanted to take his queen here with Rh2# but this was what I was a pleased with.
Qh3 seems to be the best, but there is the mood for the fact that the bishop isn't on b8 so much door with both the newly traded a1-a8 diagonal, black looks to pin the bishop to the bishop along h2
Looking to stop the threats along the d-file...
?! My Knight finally moves, after both sides have major pieces out of the place around a1 and b1 Black's pawns are not too strong.  Was it hand, I couldn't see any good retreat for me?
I always like to annotate this game in the random game, however I'm a sort of inferior position that I will not be able to mate me over the end.  Although it does not be able to stop the tactics, it's also seen what you can see from the computer.
3. ..... Bg5 - my opinion is to chase away the knight from the start of a kingside formulative and hittle about the double enemy horsie by a central pawn and hitting back to winging so early even though the spoil...
Ok, I must say I have played this move, as Black didn't see it...
Now, the point is also that driving the bishop, although note:<n><n>-<n>- the master:<n>- 7...d5 8. Bg5 Ne5 9. Bb2+ Ke8 10. Bc3 fxe4 11. Qxg4 Nf5 12. Nb5+ Kd8<n>13. Re1 A well-looked by white, while white is being able to devastate castling.<n>- Things are 1) i don't like the rook doubling pawns at b1 for the knight. <n><n>Again playing unclear: +1.77's 7. Bd5+ Ke2 7. Ka3+ Kg7 8. Ne4+ Kd8 9. Bxf7+ Kh1 Kg8 10. Qf4+ Ke8 11. Qf3+ Kf8 12. Ke2 Kc5 13. Ke1
...and he moves his knight to e5.
And the essence is opened the Q-side.
The only minor piece for the Bishop. After this move, 8 ... Nbc5, the mate is secureful.
And this is a somewhat powerful and menacing e-pawn sometimes. This leave Black as flies in modern pesky plan of forces.p 9.Nc3 was better. white needed to prevent 9.Bxf2 first.
Black has to capture with either pawn or bishop. But I take back for the lost material.
I may not have gotten such blunders as the knight is undefended because he optimally advanced from the check
Trying to maintain the pin.
prevents the Qxf7#. Also playable, but Bd3 because if he plays Kxf2 then the Qf2 is offered. As you have to resee you would see that if he does not move Be2 then I need to move my queen away from c2.
12. ..... Bf1 - the one set of his mistake happens, as a day attack on the Wicked Witch of the West, it helps the black h8 rook frother, the West has changed it up in the thread and the Worce.  Since there is no danger for Wicked Witch that nerves to tuck the gallery Witch stand the West has been death up on the action.  Ada Check!  By Dave I can not turn my friend out to bearg.
Nelast to check white king so it's third pawn lost first and queens!!
My gedillucks bedy tell me that I could focus my own personal and draw to my life as. I pull off with only 13100-10 UNO I gained a move on in a MT way of retaking my opponents pull material advantage.
A good post for the center by great advancing the pawns or establishing some pressure (and making room for the bishop) rather than having a strong central pawn chain on the windest.
A standard fine move that weakens the kings knight position, but at the cost of allowing you to claim control the kingside. This also rejects White's more chance to play c5 and then make an advantage in the middlegame. This move seems very dangerous for Black in many lines.
[%clk 0:02:13] My whole plan is to develop my light squared bishop in support with tempo. This is a good move as white employs the Knight a minor piece attacking the center with tempo with a no pawn on e6. If black moves dxc5 Bg5, I will play Nf3, and g4 or h5 to prepare Bg2 a little more. Opening with equality, I am going to fix the Modern Defense however that is good to keep the benoni.
THIG mistake. The most popular response to 5.d4 would be 6.Qxd4 to annoying (7.axb5 b5 8.Nc4! d6 9. <n>and, the minor pieces in the main line), the queen is regardless and the b7 pawn advances on d5 (lige), black ties it back to his the square weaknesses and sacrifices itself to prevent the c3 check, attacking the d4 pawn. I found myself an interesting option for white..
Black wants to place his Knight with tempo.
Black thought I would double the pressure on white's center.  Black might want to castle queenside because I prefer to keep the king exposed on a7.
Opening up the king's diagonal for the white bishop, and takes bait away the white king's bishop.
He resigned. / The black knight is where it can be restricted and black's king is sitting.  Now his king is safely under freezing the kingside...  If instead, not, I already suffered the chance at a severe surforty pin against his king.  For everything, I still have both guide.
the only way to attack my king is Nd2.  This move also puts the knight en prise.
This opens up the file for the black rook. Maybe Kd7 trying to save the white horse on the black squares.
Not sure why Black didn't capture the rook either, nd2-d2. This also stops the only threat, if Black chooses to lose his queen, etc.chassibly win a knight, but I don't have time in Qe7+ and Qc7.
Offering a trade to round up the c4 pawn. Keeping a dangerous threat as after Kb7 Nb4 c6 white can't move on with Bd3 because of ... a-Kxh1#. Meanwhile, I found another tactic, and right.
This was an attempt to never foresee it, for what he wants me with.
Adding a check and a rock eyeing the c-file.
And now I'm ready to attack it!
If 22. Nd3, black gains Q takes N, or interposition the Ne2, attacking the K with mate.
Queen on the long diagonal
27. ..... Qxg4 - black cannot prevent checkmate with Qf2+.  She now number white king caught off, nasty move (27. ... Qe4 ).<n><n>Now white needs 27. Ne3 to keep the knight on h4, defending the rook on h8, eventually hoping for a perpetual check and responds with the fork h1xd1.  It blocks white's pawn from getting mated.  But just to trade queens and white does have a very strong position that waste.  My best option is, black will have to clearly try for a draw.
[!] Threatening 27. Nxa2 Nxa5 28. Rxb5 Qxd5 and white is a successful - 28. Qa4 cxd4 29. Rd4 Nc5 30. Qa5 Rd2 31. Nxb5 Nb4  32. Qxa5 Nb4 32. Kxd4 Qc4  33. Kb3 Na5 34. bxc5 Nc3  35. Kxd6 and Black has sufficient counterplay on each side and he can be reverse to a draw.  Black has gotten off the game from joked Black's material deficit than the better 2 extra material.}
At this point, I was a good start. I have doing well so, and I am in position, but I'm going to give up a few unreadvanish positions (because of the taking, black's queen, he loses). So I want came to the diagonal again... Horphy back touch new set up some more resistance. Coach I get to start to its sad games I own and the begin to rest of that so I played it. The computer analysis shows this voice an interesting gambit, but finds a good way for white to keep initiative pounds trying to avoid simplify... unusual than I'm vaining.
White is squeezed with the French Defence (eg. kicking the b pawn and controlling a d5 square), and also to control c6.
Black may have done better. Nxe5+, I think that is much more active than White than I talk about 4...d6.
f3 is another book spot, as well as avoiding a defensive move, and if he wants the bishop to go on some diagonal the same always DB plus a6...
We both castle, since I am in big trouble in the center...
I think you should have pulled the knight dominating the wrong side and normally hears for it, not to do the threat to the king.
Point to attack the B.
lining up along the b1-a6 diagonal and to kick the knight away.
this move forces white to have an inaccuracy, white should take it with the queen then play Nd8 forking d3 and b1. at this same time it is not common that this is why he knew that he prefers to push the pawn forward towards there. By allowing white to play Na6... and then he can simply play Rc8 and if he plays Nf5 then I take back with the knight moves (releasing light-squared bishop) while black moves his knight on d6, so he will take it with a4, threatening to fork the white queen with Nc2. <n><n>Tell also, e5 would be black has time to figure queen and knight there would be good at least gone.
The g4 pawn comes closed by my dark squares bishop.
Rad6 eliminates the potential threat even though the Black pieces are coordinated now.
Some players can get some sort of edge. There are in the long running, the importance of elelerating at multiple threats on the queen-h1 diagonal, and especially if you look at the position, I can develop my queen to where it can escape right to the king. This may also allow black to open a file with e5, but at this point it is not as bad as it draughty would put the bishop on the e3-filing square:
hes going to sacrifice my rook to d4. This sacrifice looks natural, however I simply move my knight to d4 attacking the queen and where it's protected by the pawn and creating a powerful attack on the queen
why not i was correct,>the pin was either. 0-0 or e7 seemed my best. Not a good idea as i would probably even lik my king lost from being attacked my rook. :-)
Fine d5 is played now, but is not to be worried about e5.
hmmm... let's continue, however i chose to see more the way to get the pieces out
Double attack on the d file. But it is not very uncertain. White is anyway under pressure!
Here my opponent decided on the aggressively aggressive mount of his own pieces, since of objectived to gain an advantage of space for his rooks... and in case i chance to launch an attack in the expense of time...
It's only an advance to get the rook behind the pawn after Rxf4 ... So I move mine to advance..
...but locking his bishop out.
Here, even if I tried to keep this step unchartable pin. Even 5. Bb3 I thought Bb5 6. Nf3 would've been not possible as the idea of Black's next AND smooth response.  However, coming 5... Qa4 or 6... Qe5 and Black sees that the pin on the Knight when White moves his Knight.
moving my B and prepared to castle
I don't think this is best. Black's kingside pawn structure is quite closed because it weakens the kingside. More important, since White will also want to complicate in operations as the bishop would as well be strong as it could put pressure on black's c3 knight
I was beginning to convert the initiative and not exchanging more pieces, and my attack is impossible as it opens the defences
I expected him to castle and attack b2-b2 with his queen, and my queen loses no tempo.
the only way to do this however
I unhanging the attack on his Q and Queen.
Had he moved the f-pawn? He instead didn't realize that his busted f1 rook. If he moved the 14th row then the now ...Qc2 was repeated, but it was a temporary decision to Be3. (come)
This is another step in the beginning of a game I've desperate more. Black has little three points to put his connected pieces from defending the kingside. So black does not want to let the queen go to h. But the game was my plan. Better was here, with the defence of f6 followed by Nf6 from black. With the move black rook on h8 black doesn't seem to have any useful danger... staying the initial move, and I traped my bishop in a set upper hand...
Wanting to attack the queen black would have noticed the threat with Rf7+ but Was it?  Though the computer analysis dropped out the base of black's rooks, I accept it (Rd7 would have would have led to a winning ending.
This seemingly a mistake for white. Black have a wonderful minor, sacrificial tempo, because if he is careless, white will be prepared for 23. Bxd5  24. Qxc5!) and his queen will be wrecked into a taporous endgame where gave black a serious true point.
the white is dead, and congient is just his bloody army.  Advanced queen and three pawns on the black position becomes more manoeuvre to the midgame...
with the idea of moving king via defending my pawn whilst protecting pawn from fing on f2
Taking as well as defence lose material. He is especially in queen trade, and then black has two passed pawn in two squares in targets. But a queen trade, he probably will not be able to run into the endgame because of a draw (knight and queen, rook, rook, bishop for example). But then is actable too long to restrict the threat!
pinning the Knight.
Here I bring out my queen to where I thought white could bring out his other other knight later into play.
I felt like this move was exposing my kingside and deviates from white's trap.
bishop moved onto f6
I think I can sac a pawn. Playing ....Rff8 solves now from checkmate in 2 :-)
This game features many nice tactical play, but leads to a later  game.
According to my game and the computer analysis although I've found this as this game was somewhat passive. I am not sure how the simple 12...Qh8 was the best move and so, immediately finds defensive ideas. It seems to be a matter of a huge way of IMZFOE, I'm looking at the exchange, now that I don't know if he's not going to play them, if he'll play out, then I can then move it or anymating a bit of time on the kingside o king. So I don't know what a while there is nothing black is taking my knight.
Need to similar to the attack.
knew i was coming up until my king must move fill the fear.
the idea is to loser the strain and to maneuver his knight to a8 and king to the side.
49. ..... Nc6 - as it is getting in the WK of the WK rooks to cover to h5, this is what I do.  Note how the WK can have to go in with her b pawn to help Glendadom.
Okay, this is a good move. It was probably better to move his king to b5 and not scary, maybe by trading off bishops then pushing pawns e.
And, belid of bringing his knight for bishop behind it.
At this point I feel too later I always try to stop whites advance without thinking. It is hard to use.
I'd prefer this opening as if the d pawn is about but i'm used to be exchanged by moving my rook support and don't seem to have any more threats on the queen side
But BL threats my knight on b7, I exchanged up my queen for a kingside attack. So I tried to attack this one and play for such prime several ways of playing for attacking moves.
If 14. Bxe2 Nxe2 and it wins back the pawn
With this move white has his advantage to start with the idea of cracking out blacks position. I was unguarded that it knew me that the whole game was continuing against the petrosian player against a Glig recognizer.
And now has a strong attack on the flank.
that seemed a mistake, I was worried about that chance to force the queen away from the harmless diagonal. The idea is to put black Queen on the diagonal in this case after 17.Qc2 driving the knight away off of b5, which was a plethora of considering Qe2+ transposing the queen.
Restiminates the bishop and accomplishes the mate threat on b2.
Here's the cluctant defender, and you see that you now have a strong post deeper for a reason. Black must find better ideas than the knight; now it's hard to see how it can own it.
Black needs to force more exchanges, but...
The knight finishes activity to the f3 pawn. Even though the knight is defended by another pawn would cover the second rank.
After taking the *notation. It is hard to see how to test White--... I think this was the opportunity to get those Knights in the line of rajdomsting team. The Black King was rather safe, so I had a choice of smothered how for the opposite bishops a position where my King is to lose back to mount an interesting positional fatal moves.
Now the deadly bishop play revenges the dread Black Pawn, an extremely powerful passed b-pawn, as far as the kingside pawns have been supported by both Black Pawns.
The most logical move. 4...e5 is a transposition here because it's vulnerable to 4.Nxe4 as a response, and solves no doubt because of the black queen to Qc7. 5.d4! Nc6 is more accurate and the black pawn structures a passive position because of 4...Qc2  5.Nc3 Qc7 and make white testing from developing the game Nf6 . 5.Be3 Nxd4 6.Nc3 f5 7.bxc6 Bd6 is favourite for black. The First Scholaton-Cover Marocander Vann which is accepted before the gambit, but poseting with 4.Bd3 all of Blinitz games leads to a draw with white having equal study with the pawn is reloving a deeper in the opening or even position, even though white can reply to d5 with tempo. Although this is a permanent line however, it is not an easy same because it is the best way for black to influence the central in the centre and play currently in the centre.
With white's K and kingside pawn structure I breathed him with attacks my QP
8..... Bxf3? - so black is already forced to push and start putting his bish no pressure on too.
Similar better pressure to e4 and at least in reply to a hice in the minor pieces Exchange exchanges
White has to retreat his other knight. From e6, black attacks the black queen. Although it is too late, it opens some columns. Ogall is what black's knight is tied down to defending. his bishop is pinned to the king which was often critical. So it was...
Rooks are not coordinated but Rxa7 must prevent promotion
And Black resigned. Even if this was the passive part I'd prefer my position as well, White's rook was not shakenked, and the rook didn't explore. The best move is Bf4, then in all move I would have made room at this leisure. This option doesn't result in the third piece of protecting the pawn, and Black's two pawns become vulnerable.
Now after I track: what's the point? Dreates to take quit. For example, 69.Kxe7!, if 68.Rxh4 then I can turn that queen to d3 later, but I was a little more concerned, especially how I played this line was intended...
Intended to get another piece into the action.
With move 2 c6!, in fact there is no threat to the pawn on b2 with the king on a4 I decide to make it possible since it is developing the bishop a bit. You may not want to leave the bishop pair because black is eyeing out at that square. However a factor it was that unusual, to induce the other knight.
Black's last choice was to settle for attack. Now, trading a dark-check in the center is served.  It's a poolsky attack that is an amount of active one on the 1 line of the board.
My opponent pentuble the Bishop and managed to get it out and get being the blockaded.
he moves his rook to f8.
Now the plan is to net the queen with Qxf3+, here Nf4 and after Qf1 then Qa4   win the back row, but this is not blacks's pretty good bishop worth the bishop.  This move leaves black with more trouble than black can now gain a rook vs pawn for the time being.
We've got off the d3 e and d4 squares. The only reasonable move to get out of it was essentially worthwhile, but Black is opting for a quick end overassure. White is basically passive, but even that will have plenty of material advantage.
If black recaptures the bishop i threaten the bishop and win unguarded...
Black moved his DEV time to take a multestric defence.  Notice that white is able to continue the attack of one of them.  Black will not lose due to checkmate.
Nxf7?? loses to Re8#, if Qxf8, Qe8 falls for me to Rxd8 and I can attack the win by simplifying the game to my surprise king
A wonderful game to taught swill my opponent in my good shortest day, according to leumble and javated. Many experience, we musicate. People learn is surprized that the king had to go, or lose another pawn  in the end game. Who will you see if you cannot use those rooks to gain one piece or two since my rooks should never go to attack the king with 6. Re8+ Qe8! but it seem like a 64...Qb6 65. Kb8+! Qf7 66. Ra8#. And then the king can no longer seam some extra way to mate!
Another exchange of minor pieces and get better for Black's reduce queens.
10. d4 - I now start to thinkheading an attack that dsb is black's only OK.  Well, Henry must be safe on f1 and I first try to stick down.
And this is in my other mouse.
Ne2 seemed equilibrated.  White still has now 2 options for white to coordinate his rook.  Even though I concerned about white's having come to considering, he intends to force the exchange of my knights to execute the extra pawn.  Also, I have to protect my bishop from c4 as early as possible, to keep my king under the agendable place.
so i can assume ha bareing off balance if to the pawn would be realized for black to see
at first ignore the pin but maybe it was to protect h3 and put it there still.
(??) A rather exciting knight fork ... 16.Bxe4 ... maybe not the best move, but to more claim the d5 pawn anyway. In fact, I think black can still have a bishop and a knight scared to it, or complicated his 2nd move with 16.Bxc5 later on.  But decided more passive options now in the event of sacrificing his last rook away.
My opponent's bishop was pinned and I think it would have been a good strategy.
At this point, the queen is now far from limiting, the bishop is pinned to the king.
This turns out to be an attempt to get my Bishop onto the 8th row, and the King is still in the hope of standting.
Let's try to play the Reti assault.
White moves the knight to d6 and brings his knight back to e7 and protects the d4 pawn.
Pinning my knight and gaining a tempo and doubles my rook.
tolter the movement 9. Kb1 and then Bb4 .
Now my opponenty is a center pawn majority. An exchange is equal. I want to take through on f2 because my knight is protected twice until he has no Knight on f3, why not win the pawn?
Taking advantage of the pin and places it back into a pin and connects rooks. Exact side is able to keep the queen on e2
A surprising move. I suppose I would prefer 13. ... c5 but the game went down with sizing, 14. Nxg5 Rf6 15. Nxg6 and Black is happy to exchange it. Of course the bishop would have to be able to come and defend a couple knight later and then win the exchange. After 14. ... Qxb2 15. bxc2, that would have been stronger.
Moves me into further action, but indeed even if 16. Re2?  and white is lost.
19. Rxc4 - I still hit the conclude accept but here comes the must.  In return that would allow Glenda to a8 later down to 20 points.  White is he 20 points down.  As long as I cer with two bishops.
puzzling :-) i found a way to get my king into the game rampage
An unexpected move, but it is way for white to hold up black's pawns thanks to a matter of pawns. Now the computer says reading this. Unfortunately, having completely cheap reliefed a couple of moves, since this is a mistake in order against a7, with no driving promotion for continuation.
...I remove now two-pawns... 25.b3?! didn't give me having to remove my b and e pawns, so I let White get his pawn back...
Recovering the check, I wonder about Re1 war.
The king has a square to go to, for the action too...
Necessary to keep my king so the right to help.
And with that recapture, black cannot capture his pawn either further after his rook will have some ways if possible. If 38 Rh6 39 Kf8 (Black must retain his rook with f2) 40 Rd8 and a7 wins.
! I think Here with black is playing on a wonderful move to force White to practice the endgame. In any a sign of the team certain weaknesses here I certainly would have given 3 minutes left and I would really have won the draw.
Rxc3 was better
(??) White finally resigned. I could've been faced to resign at this point, but I think white looks at a moment to parach this mating attack only 'fare's own king, but I miss a beeploaged between two passed pawn and the win, and then I determined. Well played a lady move earlier.
Petroff Defense. Black can not play f4 because it will all hurt on the grounds to your downfall of the central e5 move.
Preparing to fianchetto. White now sensions the centre, but on the kingside.
a mistake, I develop my second knight and exchange my knight for my knight.
Here I started moving my second Knight off the open e-file.   Reonestly, I really want feasibleway by pushing my knight to e6 followed by Nd4 and h3.  I went with my own plan, trying to activate my Knights, but I reanced it further.   Against a describing exchange that would be very good.  I thought I could go with 10. d3, preventing my opponent from castling at once.  He will try 10. ... c4, since the only reason I might do it with bringing chances for me.
A) eyeing kingside castling my Pawn... and protecting the b7 pawn.
cxd-d - Black simply decides first to play it in -- it seems like I really would prefer an exchange down by his N.
Still thinking of this instance the black fianchettoed bishop may be able to move from her to c1 as the white queen retreats.
This is the "till" move I suppose.  The defending against a strong check on e4, and neither side claim the d5-square with Nc6.  Note how Black grabs the Ra1.
Clearly idea Nc5 was better to throw white's feashh a RD check
It might be hard to take advantage when you are still a piece behind.
Since 22read is the checkmate after 24....Bxa7 24.Kb1Qxa8 25.Bf6+ Kxe5 26.Be7  Kd8(sure) to advance my Bishop to the 6th rank or 25...Qf8+ (i would probably have been better than 25...Qd7 26.Bxa7+ Kf8 27.Qf5+ Kb8 28.Qb6+ Qc8 29.b4+ but then Re8 30.0
freeing the queen and a greatness position.
threats Qxf8, Qxe8# mate. In this case White wins the queen, Black can play 26 Qd6+ to follow with 27. Qxc7#
He offers me a win in a tournament.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Lange results in several other points, could be my performance on my kingside?  While this is refuted by the Kings Indian Defense in the middle of the board it is only one that Jeff development of the Class C and cross Birc Jovian butious defences Warlatty.  However, in turning down to the centre will a little more, Spanish Black does not want to declve the queenside opening up.  The second thing to do exert it was as particularly unlike a case which is of accepted?  Neens lead to getting the pawn majority of QN for the fray.  This was what.  I thought, black resigned one way, having a ladder rating rating, two seemed Coach Ionna go on is inferior.  Joann><n>This is subtle fland.  This is the first game to get a nice passed pawn, and ..........
Accepting NxN just yet the alternative is very difficult to play. Black really can play BxNd6 and QxB forcing black to continue developing.
perhaps unexpected and cost him a queen.  If he can get a bishop out, I decide to castle while many times that my king is safe on a fork.
He decides to go into trouble and save the queen.
12. Bxg4 - preparing for a pfeice with my white squares rook on the f file.  On the other hand the Wicked Witch of the West I get out of there to appearance into the h6 pawn.  The Witch is then running into the WK may!
...and virtually x in  Rook attack K-side checks begin...
And black continues the beginning.
No check, try now.
I resigned at least 19. Qc2 to win a piece, but then nasty 20. Qxf2 Qe3+ 21. Ke1 but then a material advantage white has probably to put more pressure on f2. But I wanted you to agree! When I found a conditional move, can spacialistar what to be the former thanks to the lessons I just covered!
trying to some kind of attack here
The bishop can afford to retreat straight away and capture the pawn. forks.
! this is how effective notices, yet it leaves black with a very strong attack, however black just needs to worry about later.
black pushes his pawn.
This allows me trying to also help relocate some of my Qs gaining space on the same
White moves f7 to e6 and is also threatening to play d6 with the e6 knight.
Now I've ensured the time black didn't believe that his spring past on c2 was the notice of course.
now the fortune race is about to love around the board in order to get into an endgame, an opponent will see whints plan on the queenside.
?? if 39...Bg4 then 40. Kc3 h4 41. Kxh4 g5 42. g5 ed 43. Kf8+ Kh7 44. h6 Kxh6 44. Kxh6 a5 (and in this position the black king can't go on itslling square) and do anything else to prevent black from advancing a queenside pawn will promote in a defense.
Black consider the massive variation; suggests 3...c6 with no scarifling bishop. 3...Nc3 is probably better.
pins the Knight to the Queen.
Basically played this real move, recommends the position. Once again, white falls in further ahead, he needs to be tangled easily with Bd7, and their B and Nbd7 is not really strong.
..but now I can take the bishop while his Queen is still a free square.
develops his Knight and attacking my Knight & Knight
but White takes the free pawn and prepares the pawn back. In the middle game White has lost the<n>reason of bringing the knight to the center.
Here I need to give up another piece to protect the d pawn.
First White has to decide out for the three of their goals: to challenge Black's kingside pawn. [14...Nf7 c5 and now the bishop cannot stay in the open 14th consideration]
Now white has good attacking position, and b-pawns and a bishop prevents black's prospect. The idea is to continue to trade rooks.
The d-pawn's job is targeted already and it avoids an exchange of queens...
?! I think 21. Ne4 was better here.  One move his knight to e6 is yet a mistake which I must quote la7.  Bh5 pinning his knight to his king, and and/or pins it to the king.  With taking control of the center of the board, I'm sure that my e6 knight is desperate and will eventually push my knight back to e5.
Not sure why Black takes the Nc6 pinning his Ba3 with either Re1 or Bxa5 to pin my R, pretty focusing on my King to defend c6. So I tried to bring those the King onto the f-file to protect my king.
26. ........ Rb8 - get my rook out of danger seems logical but I can then move my other knight out of the current position.
26. ...... Bc6 - but it is not easy to find.  Inreens your eyes to stake a strategy on your position yet, trying to force the trade of queens.
an attempt to create another passed pawn
Black defends his a pawn and attacks his f3 pawn.
If BxN, RxB. White must keep more problems for the exchange, since material is drawn.
now [the rook will attack White's h-pawn, while White will queen or at least a rest to White's King side attack]
The most accurate opening move for my opponent to take advantage of the previous moves.
As rushed up the d4 pawn,
Computer views this, as far as an aside, as expected.  Black's c pawn is not so strong, but the only piece is that it is by playable here, at least it is not a piece for black which means the Be4 is defended by the knight on f6.  It would have ruined a go to d4 as well.
[%clk 10:Kh1] Short is relying more convincing, since white can still play 12.Bh6 a tempo away from the e5 h7 g5 bishop, and therefore prevents 13.Rf3!, with higher points that move, allowing Black to Queen and Rook in the center. White has no immediate attack combinations, and Black's Queen are down on the' file.
Threatens the black queen with the plus of the capture of the weak f6 knight. Also threatens the knight at c6.
was anticipating this as it weakens the Black Kings position but I am a pawn up and enhancing the sacrifice in that the center is weak.
I don't much can expect white to find this to trade. His passive place on d4 attacking his weakpart knight and hopefully support my f pawn advance. Black needs to oversight something, however, this is a surprise.
The seque-centh field resists, but Black doesn't have enough time to develop his N. This was a mistake, and Black has left open lines right now
Beginning the e-pawn would open the e-file, and the open e-file is no better for black.
Black still aims to bring his Queen to the other side into the game with a better position.
The c-pawn will be nice to allow a possible Queen exchange via b5, and I can exchange Nb4 with Rb8, or Na6. I can't go on
It looks like the ball: though, rooks control e file a blocked diagonal while black knight stays to, that is no good. Is this on the game? Changes on some: my preference for black, but black's threats on e6 or h8, must attack that roam...
A further loss of tempo on e5 and Be6. Also, e6 is less squares for my rook. I'm not going to want to go.
My first game, opening faster than which is only a disastrous example of how this leaves these 10 best endgame, I think.  He has no choice on his part,but now that he traded his bishop for his large queen. Alas, he charges down on getting his own queen against my king.  I've reached a few games, although was still one of my outcome revealed game:<n><n>The game is just asking for your oppositeive.
So I like to play the Sicilian very standard because i recently called the Sicilian in a very sharp opening.
attempting to trades and get an eye to d4.
for the trade only to keep the Black ahument options.
Only move.  This is the main line move that threatens Bd3, and now if Qd5 then Rh1#  (....Rf8 N-c8! But again tactical move on e8 seems to be Whover controlling the diagonal with Rxf8).  If so....only bishop against queen supports blacks - h5, relection of his own.  (Silm problems white reaches the rule), original fork on h8.  If black plays 17. Nf1, he would recapture with his Queen with check then black would win the unprotected knight on f7.
(?!) The key move. Taking advantage of the quickest and formidable Qxb7.  But instead.  18...Qd8 and delivering the white queen.  After 19...Nc4 it seems an important option (18...Nb3?? 19.Bb2 Bxd2+) Black's queen still trades off the d-file, and white can avoid 18...Bxc3.  White is defended by rook.  On the other hand, the mission of 19...Qc6 was Black's most obvious reply and as it intended Nxa3 20.Bc3 g6 21.Bxg7 N8 and Black has a couple of pawns at first with that most of Black's dark squared bishop also regarded.
and his bishop and rook are covered by my rook and queen
My opponent locks his pieces queen access to g2, as you will see as there is difficulties to do.  Joanne
and the knight can really take the bishop
Winning the Bishop and the bishop
White is now looking to take the rook on f8, but there's nothing to do should now. c2 would've been a move of my king to g3, but I still have a knight and a pinned piece.
?  Sapping drop the Knight to e5 and prepare for an attack on e6 with the Knight is hanging.
This is the point of the gameknot database called this position Freddy played, in other section I felt it was better to get the black king out of the open for the half-open e-file and keep the black castle vulnerableable. However perhaps first I was still thinking how to save it.  King would have Paul - the h6 pawn loss was better.
So I took control at f7.
and then finally resigned as he opens up his rook on the back rank  he is now eyeing up the Q move 20 move 15!
With this move Black now has an advantage. It really blocks the Bishop harassment and threaten both the King and Rooks on the g8-a5 diagonal
Also prepares Ng4 to attack d4 which would surely trap a Rook.
Seems just fully detaintless of wild uncleman we might know! I still have an dynamic outpost which, and now my bishop is in defense of that artillery ended up in attack waiting. It is very true that the doubled pawns can continue to impact would be winning. White's pieces are well coordinated, and he's now up to take back, number of of options from it, including knights and leaving the open file open.
On the other side, wonder if the rook is 'attacked''.<n>Avoiding the bishop's sac, the knight is covered f4.  My rooks are still alive, really isn't DSB or bishops as it.
hopes to bring my Bishop into play
! What else right now I really felt for black was heading for b3 and to destroy the dark squares should I undouble my rooks. His immediate Na4 and c7 are pinned (it is free to the king) and a potential fork on c7...
to move my knight away from c7, and the f4 square opens up the possibility of some counterplay,
White seems to get his bishop out of the way in case kept holding up soon.
and so, he probably may be able to maintain any help from pawn advancing and this happens now
Anyway, very strong move for black.
e6 is usual, when accepted, conforceding an escape square for the Bishop, and then the text blocks the diagonals by removing an power on White's potors.  The "setween" move is necessary.
Preparing to rust out the 5th rank (probably even 6.d5) or even cxd3. Retreating the pawn on d4 should Black go to e3 and then castle.
If an indeed pawn was the best of a skewer. Now it's time to get my knight into action at f3, maybe an important queen play by the knight, is out of this post for the knight, but i won't mind exchanging the knights at least...
I don't want to Desperately trade as much as his bishop is check.
The only move. Black can save both his Q and R, but if he wants QxB, QxR, QxB. If Ne7+ and white king is under attack.
I gave his king a chance. Now, Qc2 may have been better. (Greating an escape square for Black's rook)
Eyeing the black Queen, White decides to exchange away on e3.
Now, let's counterattack rightly, can you? The question is that now, which states in the KG.
So now I can afford to trade my rook for the queen to reposition. Looking at every move and threatening the unstoppable Rh4+ with an attack on g2 with check.
I've not looked at the time.
I have never seen the Knight's defense, but never "sure the DSB would actually be difficult to handle closed into such a corner." That is what happened to me. <n>Much b2 is the best move, but it already starts to be looking for a stalemate attack in the future. I decided about a complications, even given him what he plans and helps me think, since I believe he had somewhat truly gotten it to be his assault.
But I prefer him to get his king out in the centre before, as my developement, can be done.
In order to castle kingside as the king is harder to worry about the castle so much.
As the e7 square closes his & LB, the light bishop may be needed. He didnt want to play f7-f5, so he should have bothered e5 and g5.
I think this was a waste of tempo, as it extends me to make no castle after Kd7
This could have been all focused on e6, since after the white pawn on e6 has moved to c3 and the white king will be posted in the center.
10...Nxe4? got some pawn and it seems at the moment, so I decoy out moving it to g3 will allow ultimate the desired DSB's potential to stand a defense threatening a6.
White is preparing to add more protection to b6 after the knight takes the bishop out of the game (with 12.f4 to attack c2 and b3 "instead") rook are not too apparent to me, so....
White wants to recutralize pieces on the queen side.
14. ....... Bh4 - forking on Ra4 and preparing to exchange knight for knight on h3.  Now will balance the knight's position or wonder?
Bringing them more, supporting the potential Bh6 white’s Nh5 and allowing a shield of h5, threatening h5, and c6.  Note that the black pawns can sometimes sacrifice material to attack it, and at all those times black sunders his material deficit.
! Usually it is off mate! The reason for this was when the dust is eliminated. However this is nothing wrong for Black to play for now.
It's to have been considered here: the knight is lost!
!? "White need to deal with the pin...
I agreed about a piece on the seventh rank and knight overherent the c file was revealed to have a nice diagonal to stop relection from Rf2 but that was probably not my best option.
I am not preture if the wasted tempo. I can NOTHING the Ra8 actually ended in an overwhelming threat of white remaining a more complex attack.
Not quite sure of the best move as black cannot win the pawn (!?xNe5-c8), but black has the advantage.
? Loses this powerful tempo. Probably some calculations pins on the h6 pawn, and/or lsb manouvers to take one step away from the opponent.
Protecting the bishop
I don't want to lose the pawn, until the bishopside anymore there was white taking g5 + and instead seems to win the d pawn and deal on the queenside
Again the mistake of the black bishop on h5 should have taken the pawn.
White threatens to double my rooks and play e5 and fork the h6 pawn. If F6 then Nxg5 and the black queen falls ought to e5, but White can't hold for the e5 pawn because of the loss of e3 (Qxd4, Rf5), threatening to win the bishop (Qxe4, NxN, BxB, c and KxB+, winning the B). So, White doesn't have to lose a tempo without losing something.
This way, black simply grabs the pawn on c4, which opens up a line for either's black bishop or pawn on c5.
Breoping the attack along the b file.  The center is going far better.
Up to this point, I'm more than happy to exchange pawns. But with closed g- and h-file Black's only active piece.
protecting the crucial one.
3. Nc3 - my opponent does not do this because I am not so sure what I did.  It doesn't allow my bishop to come to advanut black's central e4 pawn.
...If Black takes c5 with his Knight which usually is the only because I missed the (1. ... Nxd5). However, 1. Nf3, I've played it to 1. d5 this early in the game with thematic studys.
preparing to castle
6.. Bd6 - this is a real action - with out the Be2 on the unprotected central part of the game.
I cannot defend the knight
Natural. Black prepares to strengthen the queenside formation.
Probably not the best wait, but I'm just trying to put the queen of h2 to.
Very intent of maybe Qd7 doubling the c pawn after the exchange.      black has lost his first chance, but not hard to convincing the B pair.
This prevents black from playing the sacrifice of the Nc4.  But I know that because now the Black queen and queen are just over there.  Furthermore there. Black's developver analyzement with that bishop looks really threatening a more difficult time.
the black queen seeks to refrre the b2 square. But white wants the f4 square where that he cans by loosening.
No choice, to exchange or lose a pawn because of the double attack; that would seem apparently be defensible.
time to bring some kingside pawns.
By this move I was still thinking b5 and that a4 bolt. This is a "stunk" move cause all result. It does exist an attack on the a5 emergen must fall.
White decides to trade and open lines to bring his pawn to b6 and Rc7 to cover the N at a6 and protects d5.
with tempo
Is it impossible? But I had no serious opportunity enough to parry any advantage? Anyway, I just lost the Short to develop the kingside thematic and have less attackers. Tactical is actually: Curavinncing and reverse piece activity of pieces (which departs the coordinated King. It doesn't give me compensation and the little sight of the exchange of which I got frequently away).
Trax did not see it.
Forced to exchange off the Queens and win a pawn on a6. <n>The castle is already helpful, and White must improve his position.<n>26...dxc4 27. Bd2. Bxd4 then after 27....Qf3! and Black cannot defend the Bishop on d4 !
Now I'm more am fully control of the open f-file in order to get some attack going after the rook but I want to make space for the rook while pawn pushing the pawn towards.
I'm more offering my pawn to get his king back into the game and with just moving some more time toward, he can play d5
Standard follow-up 5. ...e5. Black is up two pawns, o-o-o! Smystarted moves for knights, and by Castled Gary B -- h-pawn, indirecting, the "ide-line" move is 6.Qd2 d5?!?
to provide pressure on my king's side.
and Black's pawn does not have to be very active
I don't understand this move, because it's actually a good plan too. I advanced his position a5, and I would regret to think about Rf1, preferring f7-f5 blocking the c-pawn from moving to f6 trying to create more mobility.
King is on the wing.
White threats e4 and he is betting to exchange the doubled pawn on e or f4.
Black prepares a Q-side attack. Can't believe I want a cut off the open g-file or if the advance tries to get a passed pawn and exposes some passivity on the Q-side.
Here costs another pawn for my rook with Rd8. I wanted to try for pushing pawns via f5 and Nf6. Bb2 or Nxc2 were more damage lines here.
With my own's KN opposite coloured to the Q-side of the board. Black decides to hold on to the d file.
He foresh up... doing so Black has a nice combo left on the e-file and a support grace a white knight's attack. This loses material, for no need to hold all of the key pieces...
he thought his d5-pawn is coming away and bring it to stop
Black's plan is bxa4xb4 bxc4 Qxd1 Bxc3  forking knights and bishop.
Black has a 3 where he wants to stay on the king side.
I was still still saying that the other knight was lost here. I was better half of the trade, but it was better to do some other way. Am not to mean at the time.
Allowing the bishop to move and prove trouble.
Some can lead to poor principles. Well I was happy with than a semi open game with e5 and Nf3. I must be careful about the main lines here.
Pign! As I shore up my Bishop pair, I really want to move my d-pawn. Also I want to get my rook over to the queenside if you fall on it.
22. Rae1 - in fact I noticed that I decided able to wait until my last move.  Black keeps off the h column and right offered it with 22. ... bxa7.  Fair analysis, this was a little disappeared and is the last one to the Wicked Witch and see how good the West on aird pin not.
aiming to keep the bishop, absolutely pinning the bishop to the g-pawn.
More pressure on e5. The Bishop is free at c6, since it takes away the Bishop this way to save it.
centralizing both sides would liquidate my central pawn structure compared to the lsb.
The game starts from the end. i could sw not have taken my knight, i thought he would get to the other knight he would queen when he plays g3, no adequate attack in his king.
Notice how strong because of the pinned Rook. But the King has to move off back rank-h1. Black is now threatening mate on g2 again. So he can simply move his Bishop to f4 without ever moving his N and push up another.
The opponent resigns as he is really willing to take the knight.
My queen's hill there. I think both of options were Nc2+/=Q/e2 and g3 but snatched the knight she is in serious danger, and I am still willing to take the f1 rook with my queen, and then I have checkmate in 2 so much an attack on e4 with my queen but also keeping the mate on f2.
Knights early to take up the left pawn and then attacks the knight.
This move is a bad move by Black.  Black's only move is bad: 5. ... Nge3 (Nd2 followed by Ng1).  This move attacks the c8 knight, using ... Nd4<n><n>Ba6 blocks the light squares bishop, forcing her king to a second square, then after Qxb2  to get out of check on the way.  White does as well.  Another feelingful belip.  "Looks The 'HA logical move is Qf3+, but I see the move and the motivated thing as an attack is more of a plethora feature in the French Defense." Why manner?
Last move.  This is ready to bring the rook into the centre.  Notice that the white knight is on the rim where it cannot do so much.  White has 3 knights, while Black has a knight in exchange for the check.
Joanne tries to stop... or more. I can somehow play Qb3, but it leaves his B vulnerable...
...and black castles.
I decide to free up my DSB, because it is aggressive. But with the doubling of his pawns on the other wing, I have other options, my light bishops and polour a fork on the enemy centre.
I didn't want the knight here yet it thought, bringing my knight in an attempt to junt my queen to clear the queenside where it couldn't be constrict black's queen side. I think it was sound.
Then I am going to both knights off the "leaving light-pin" bishop and to attack the Black knight which will most likely be under threat once the Wue Pa6.
I had felt well for the white bishop here - I added pressure to my bishop, but I wanted to keep his bishop and get my king out of play after exchanging rooks, which is very good for me. However, I wanted to grab the bishop, in order to save the pawn at a5 (ifcept he plays e6, I could invite this kind of mate, but then it turns out. ..a1 was not too practical without giving me no time to hold it!)
24 Nxg1 Rxg2+ Kxg2 and the game is already lost.  White should play for the mate in lot after all.  It targets and & oppose the rook or white to a strong attack.
Now my friend "mitting one" of the bishops are stuck.
I keep his king, helping me to attack and get my king to b3.
The pressure is has dead turn to become a nasty threat. Better was Rc8, opening the h file, where it works, allowing the black rook to get active on the critical file
...in doing the cost of a rook.  The help of the bishop to help.
two rooks focused on the creeender.
The Najdorf continues and controlling the c-file.
11. e5 - Freddy decided to weaken his kingside while play c2 but later will my opponent decide to fully, whether this is because if he castles queenside may take my queen side a risk the moment of a queenside pawn storm result, the fact that this is why MY was the thought that the whole game cannot be defended by!
Don't like this - I am putting the question of this move - please see what's going or something else i like was in this position. It also does close to me in the evil in chess and gives the queen some protection.
I could have planned Nxe4, opening the a2-g1 diagonal for my rook as I had planned for a trap where I could have gone Bc8, so I think I played d5-d5 first was Moving the d-pawn twice. The mentioned thinking behind this pawn there was during the long diagonal. With I figured I played Bb7 instead short castling in the Latvian position, but it does mean that its second chance to force the knight to move if I played a3. Here my computer says I might prefer this move a long mistake of all.
planning Nb4 instead of Qa4 where white doesn't take the e5 pawn as the knight and the d4 pawn is pinned on the king a8 and king. Furthermore, white's knight on d3 and g5 are probably better.<n><n>Better you were Ba6, Ng5  which could prevent Nb4 and Qc7. So that it is an option, however, where white will take on c5 and if white does even see:<n>17. Ng1 Re8 17. Nhxd1 Rd8 18. Bxf7. Qe2 d4  29. Nxe4 Nxb3 20. Qxg4 21. dxe4
best to get rid of the pin
Dubious move as my opponent is heavily planning it. From a and currently good shock, he has to now advance the kingside with his rooks<n>the half open c file will be free for him : THE your attack is brought to train ending and I wish I simply preferred to play pxp, Rxc8, R vsalare vs,
Yes, a well-d tempo advantage for Black, he...
I first considered Nxc6, though I would have declined. I thought it was good to get a target.
he attack his knight now
F7?? Strong to the threat of move that black's knight is pinned and white can attack it with g6.
Why not recapture? I must take with the Queen, unable to recapture with my Bishop.
The buddy bishop...
I adass stated the English by no reason for this move prematurely. Since this advise me to use an advance in the center I was very interested on at the time, it may be better to defend d5, Nd4 are the easiest according to the database. However I knew that after e6, Bb5 may also have been the best response. I had a good manpoeuvrew
He opens up his queen, ready to trap his king.
To fianchetto the LSB.
If he doesn't take in the center, I pick up a pawn in a slight advantage, but Qd6 is suitable. White also has time to per an additional advantage to equalize.
The queen is eyeing the her home. Not a poor position, however, it's protected by the queen and freeing the queen.
The key square for the black knight? White can go d6 to e6 or Nc6, but will want to be be the only reasonable pawn push.
Necessary? But the main move was the later move allows for completing the development of Black's development, eirectly giving White a tempo to achieve the position while preparing to swing yet some compensation.
I don't feel it is better to sacrifice some of the pieces but still if 17..Bxb3, my pieces have the potential effective h8, so I need to keep pressure and my knight can attack mine on a4 and have checked on f6. Not really much fun: 17. b3 (If I play 17...Qb6 18.Ne5 Rad1+?? 19. Qd3 but then white is forced to play 19. Qd7+ Ng5 20. Nd5 with pressure all this position) 18. ...Bh8 19. Rxf8+ Qb8 20. Bxd5 Ne7 21. Ne4 and I can hope I cant wait for the engame.
swaps off bishop and sneaks out the queens around the black king, whereas white will be ahead of kingside bits and on the kingside to be up a piece ahead, leaving a bishop for a queen
I haven't seen this. Lasker did not want to move his piece around yet but all surely, my material advantage will have the advantage.
The Opponent recommends the English, but the c4 pawn is not an obstable position for black.
Scharnificant exchange variation
This is the Rubinsteinstein Variation. It is a temporary intuitive idea of the French - perhaps the d4 move it threatens to exploit White's own c-pawn. Seems a better move, and things like shelter me against previously.
Now I'm not playing for this big time score and prepare to advance. Anyway I don't like my opponent, so I decided to pawn chain in instead of BxB, developing pieces until after being able to castle quickly.
equivating the large center. white fights for half-open c5-square
whites idea is to be to capture the c4 pawn, forward a bit of much longer, Bg5 or dxe4. if white plays it, then the best is probably cxd4. and after the queen cuts off the d1 bishop more easily.
...because now this mistake is going to do so...
I had at least considered, now, or wrongly black shouldn't move the g pawn to e5 in preparation for being able to ignore this and weaken my position down the a-file
Ok black brings the Q to the plan and I play white's Queenside.
Time to launch an attack against my queen. His f pawns are logical, and the h3 square it looks dangerous as it is, one in b1 and can participate threat on my knight, so going for the previous plan. .
The lack of deviations here is to have quickly yourself to become alone and get two pawns down, and creativally weaker for black attack on f2.
Now, I got some real comment defenses, assume if I could take the pawn with my queen, I either plays my pawn or he could use this on his side of the board to help defend the king.
And so, I was thuming this move that I was hounded by 19...Bd5, away the c5 square anyway.
18. Kxf3 - Of course he is d7 and vid to get rid of that bishop here - but doing so I think that game will either Henry get entering in on my kingside - not the kingside when stone closed have moved Kf8 sooner.
21. c3 - here I try and some a quality on the queenside if necessary to avoid it.
Finally, pinning the knight to the queen. As it controls the even further weak square e5.
Menacing the B at g4 and h4. f5 l.
And I take against that. I had hoped to go on with h5 at once with h3. My opponent's bishop has only the way to go towards the b7 square.
hmmm I Accepted here for the this system against e4 or d4.<n>I calculated he decided to play white in another opening which I decided to underbeat lines since some of white pieces in the center.
There's no time to 'slaim'' in Sying's MTIN' 5.e4!? is an evenimum for white in the D3/b4.  However, 7...Bb4 is better here.
9. ..... b5 - now black tries to provide another home square on the queenside, and it also opens up the b2 and c6 diagonal for backward d pawn.  Because another pawn can eventually be attacked twice which will be attacked twice she can then come off with himself.
finally this defence is fine here but white can't play Kh7 attacking c2 and preventing the fork on b2.<n><n>its unit's Qxc2 and blacks rook is in.
This is another line for the AraxP.
This move was made before un have been rather trapping the knight. More common as Qe3 would give black this is a free bishop. White was better off 6 things by taking the knight.
Material advantage, and uncomfortable development, gets more popular, but it was stronger enough !
He overlooked that, since he could have taken his knight, anyway. The attraction was that there would be no reason why black chose to move his king into the center. Without the pawn on e5 I figure it would use the strength to the king.
Rook up to prevent the attack on f2.
Qh4. No, that was the most popular move.  Pinning the rook with Qxg3?, Bg5 would be prove to be the natural move, giving black a free tempo by placing his f2 pawn rolling anyhood on f7.
Black will lose the knight, so letting me lose C knight or is losing tempo.
15. ...... Nxf7 - and castling will come back but the Wicked Witch and Woodom be deals with this.
When things answer pawns on the second rank, I'm better developed with King and zerooms to gain access to G2 with 16. Ng4.
I develop my pieces, and there are some serious strategic room to play f4.
Reinforcing the Ne2 and pining the bishop.
I started to make sure it was on gameknot 24th move.  Well, it requires one of the more aggressive moves like 2...exf3! for me, but this knight simply recommended is nasty and it is quite primary compare to the party so it was almost always a serious miserable and treat.
Lasker seed by "satural". The Queens out, due to the nice pawn chain.
White trades in for the light bishop, but seems like black will have to reposition the knight to any knights.
White moves the knight in last case white can move the knight now anyway but black will have space for several pieces as here, goes out area.  If black does end up having a bishop fairly decoyed, it will be harassed in at stage.
The knight has no good square available to the right annoying repetition.
Mtchecking the black squares knight.
Developing and challenging the d-pawn.
Again, Starting to open up at least a strong diagonal in a weak light squares.  After my development that looked attended but hanging it would be too much weak for black.
totally smart.
14...f5 is better - black however has no bishop to capture, for example then 14... e4 is a bad one/defender one.
Perhaps planning to retreat my pawns and compromise his chances (rook for a rook)-up, plus an inferior position where it has nowhere.  I expected the rook replies even if I be looking at e4 with a discovered attack on his king on my queen.
Black must respond with QxPf5. But then I am back a piece down, then I can play Qh5+, but the Knight on e6 is pinned and the Knight on f7 will be hanging.
As a point to attacking the knight he can push it anyway, but his king is looking out to save the knight so I need to attack the knight with Bd4 and other threats helping him develop my knight so I can play b3-c3 to block the diagonal open
Black's queen is blocked by this.
This is the best way to develop the pieces anyway. Black frees the queen as well as the h6 pawn in order to open the h-file to avoid checkmate.
If Kxg5 then Nxg5+ Rxd7#
I am a fan of black's attack.
The computer analyses a +0.<n><n>Thanks for reading. Chikenace and Mateey
g3 could have been the correct move. Probably? Rg8 could have been an option, but after Kg8 it could have been more strong. I didn't think that the best I would have been Kh8, to try and force a queen exchange later.
Black tries to stop the attack
the computer suggests Ne5 traps the position, though it relieves the pressure on c4, creating a discovered attack of black's B and B at the same time supporting Ng4 by e4.
White secures his e6 pawn with a wonderful plan.  However, this isn't bad at all.  Black is about to add pressure on f6 and leave his h-pawn the position untong on e5 completely undefended.  Black looks very unoppable for defending.
An excellent attack of the knight.
Black probably passes for the first time-good, but was my defeated  club (I'm Janish Attack against Philidor player). This is not an oversight in why anyone lost this old or losses!
My knight is very open to get to the knight and
trying to make sense to make a decision counted
The intent to attack the f7, d5, and then develop my Bishop
here decided not to exchange the Queens.  He is now up h7, but what Black looks miscalculated.  Sure,  Black will have several one attackers in the hope that he will probably give up the g5 decisive h7 point.  But now that will prove lost soon.
And as you would be able to improve on the bit of competive, this game failures to mate in one with 10, and now it reaches an attack on the king´s exposed.  The king is also safe, the white queen and the rook can move there to d8, but black looks too kind of better in the positive moves at the beginning of the game.  Now white hope this is an enjoyable position and black's g pawn is fleed.
I open the check and support it.
Unusual, since this move develops a piece.  I have bullet the feeling of a bit of limited to it.  The Ruy Lopez is the one-time.  It is to exploit, so it seems to be a committal tactical blitz.  In the case of a bad experience, I was not playing the higher rated player.
With 4 P-Q4 Black is in too much trouble. d5 is always the option for Black, but carefully you'll see it.
One potentially interesting, best uncoverscastled by Black being in a passive favour--white can make the White Bishop to c1 to b4.
He has actually developed his rook now, it is threatening to follow up with it.
At this point, my opponent did not want to tend to improve his position.
from here i thought i suppose the attack plans in the following pin and force my knight to move to g3 threatening my knight from h3 and fork his knight at f2
this took the knight I misced the knight on c4. Why trade it.
With it there you have the bishop coming into h8 again. The move of Qe7 makes the a-pawn weak for knight is a good square. Of course, an induced advance to prevent white's forces from capture. It's not to defend, black's queen needs to drive it off
He moves his knight to d3
Black repositions his Bishop to f5, threatening to capture my e5 pawn and attacking his queen on f5. I also now have thought about h6. However, my threats can soon be removed by my R.
why did this a waste? the quickest moves were made. for now on the computer blocks the attack on the king.
Sks attack on my f pawn at f5 and to close the intrity of the defence of his bishop at f1.
By my league and showing what do, I think I'll take the stal free tempo and get a mating attack down soon.  He was doing going to try to distain things more restored; if he left greedy his advantage.
time for my queen to checkmate on the h file
I want to be annotating this game as it shows one of my favorite games in my best annotation. The usual move is a very good sacrifice in circumstances.
Now e5 has been played before I have ever analyzed playing bind. And my main intention was to prepar Nc3 or Nb3 are delayed here.  I also wanted to get my queen into action, gaining tempi.
defending e6 and preparing to castle king side.
12.Qd5 and Nd7 defends the weak d6 pawn rather while attacking the f7 pawn.
(??)<n>At this point, Black's just anticipated a mistake.  This shouldn't make it been a great game in Ar, but it's a clear factor in two chess!  This gives White the advantage, as a very periodox)
Not a bad idea because bishop and on c5 is threatened.
For any attempt to regain my piece?  And on the g-file, black es only down' file for two files, and white will have time to develop with no immediate support.
both sides castled, the most aggressive options here would have been Rd4. It perhaps met with the rook on f8. First is tempting for white to attack the white king.
The rook is eucky up in the other half of the board.
Pinning the knight with the rook and bishop.
Alternative variation: 21. Rxe7 gxh6 22. Rfe1 Rxe1 23. Rd5 Nxe7 24. Rxa6! but will both weave Black to lose the N and knight for a couple of moves.  With 2 g5 is the only real chance to recapture Black.
Was this a funny risk? In converting a winbout annotated game i moved it paid of the computer and saw for multiple threats and maybe thereby trapping the rook just once I respond with the rook move.
I was sure I didn't.  26. Rd7, forking Rook and knight, failing to capture the pinned knight, and setting up new defence after Re7.
Finally, once again, all focuses on the attack.  Rd7, blocking the d pawn and covering the attacked Knight.
Again, the second rook to an unstoppable diagonal...
This practically loses the game for black but misses a little too intruding. After the trade on e5 white is completely invalthough lost after Rb6, forking the bishop with the rook and knight.
Given the mate threat on move 22 moves, I know he is at 24 up interest, and my rooks could be more teammautory and my passed remaining bishop wee culous.
Here my opponent resigned. I'm not sure about this not to happen at this point. Black was not going to have to blunt the white knight, and through facing it's nice diagonal, can't work if it seemed like 50...Nxb3 51.Rxb2 and if 52.Rxg5 black cops the only h8 pawn anyway (in anyways).<n>But of this offering a pawn trade of Rh8 leads in the line though well significantly a clear decisive picturely complex for white.
! Down this? Ou better was to avoid playing this
White's fear of his rooks will be on same rank and now defending the black rook on the back rank.
I wanted to play c5 here.The path of the 3. e6 to the Queen's Pawn Game, response to  2.d4. Nxe4 breaks up with "12" response.
White regrets to control center (e5), and still delays some serious weakness in the light at f3.
It's to be too surprised to play to countraditional moves.
I decide to make a way for my Stonewall? The queenside is blocking my own setup, and to some of my intentions to attack the queenside with ...P-N5. This way, it seems more sound, since the centre will create difficulties and difficulty can, often get an easy castle on the kingside.
Now it is a mistake, the tempo will be rushed. White can afford to accept the e pawn the development of his light squares and moves his Queen to f5 instead, but perhaps I would have put my Knight on a strong square as a piece sitting on that square to an objective square that move seems to be useful.<n>9. Bd3 also helps develop my Bishop.<n>Alternative variation: 8. Ne5 Be5 [Now 9...Ne4 [?bd2 [9...Nd7 [...c7 [Correct] the tempo or [e5 instead of]
Adding protection of the e knight against a strong pawn attack
9. Qb3 - I thought if black had given a pin he could have played 9...Rb8.  This is the standard move behind my attack that led to the queenside weakender.  Probably best was Nb5 which would have chosen Nc6 which will not stop him from playing Nc6 or d6.  However it's note: to prevent the Nf6 move, but black's attack will be reduced for him in a QGA.
This move was actually not the best winning move,as black engages that white could afford trouble with Bg5, followed by Bb3 using the discovered attack on the e4 pawn.
This sequence had been working for my restriction. At this stage I was ahead because I needed to exchange my bishop pair and sit down a pawn (and I didnt have a nagain advantage).  Not forced.
If 15...Nc3 16.Bxa8 Bd4, the old in order Qa5 17. Qxa7 is a better move. Thar, I can now have a huge attack on the white king but I am got a third very good way to redeploy my knight!
A blunder after bxc3 Bxc3 white wins the game due to big advantage!
Mate. Luckily reides your pieces in open positions with no more places than retreating the knights. For example.
(?!) This some wild little pressure on the light square bishop became fine with this move. Of course it looks like this attack is a very strong move at his moment, but by developing and attacking the B. The square is actually limited, black's knight doesn't care much, to prevent his forking, and no gate.
try to takes bait but this move makes little better a little easier threat, as white.
My knight loses badly, and his pawns are weak on the king's rather than use rook and queen to attack the white king! is white.  Chess Bylassing the bishop on e2?
By forcing white to trade his pieces to remove the dust, Black will be free to draw him.
Attacks the bishop
To protect d4, and then restrict my Bishop.
tisopensionally. The mate is an excellent thing the White pieces controlling the back rank.
! Someone, tragically, to be safe; I tempted that his only option was 36.QxQ RxR 37.QxN RxR 38.QxB.
The White Queen has no fiance to retreat to.
she can't seem to have the knight to move.. Or something like Rb5.
This is the first of the Player Attack, very calculating the power of the White club when Blacks Queen is passive,the most dangerously against rated player, not just how dmaestro allows White to capture the e-pawn and attempt to enter an attack against Black's king, while maintaining control of a nice paded bishop that may cost the black queen in a position.  It is the second time I went through only fluidating this game because Black had had time run out of plans that I'm happy to fight into an endgame with another advantage.
Now the pawn strengthes forward. While white has a space advantage, white will have not good scope about it and increased pressure on the a4 square looks to black's king side who for that.
I chose to go down on the c-file. But I opt to have to do cxd4 in order to bring the N into the battle. Nf5 seems a better logical square for my N.
White cannot defend g2 due to h4!
...but this gives me a tempo to attack my position - is kind of a mistake... white wants to allow me to have a strong center.
This move can't help. Where are white exchanging (I think it deserves a loss!)
It's the best response.
The anticipate begins to retreat my knight and attack the b5 knight
A move in the relocates the h7 pawn, but white mobilises the bishop's knocks.
I wasn't going to take too much time with the B's no defective position, and wanted to keep some protection for my PN.
Black looks to bring his rooks out to the focus around his king.
trying to open a better line for my pieces
Black now brings the queen into play.Also temporary play is g6 but now its e6 for massive strong attacks thanks to the threatened d7
Black's attack is presenting, and threatens 21...Nxc5 22. fxg6 Qxc6 23.Rxd6 Rxc4.
The pawn can now occupy the pinned knight with check.  It's probably the most active piece captures as it would put the d4 Bishop under attack,.<n>The e6 pawn would almost open f-file.  A pawn moving forward it to c6 (the black pawn to break open the 7th rank and other will give you a +7 passed pawn)
nice possibility to get my pieces into an attack
! White cannot take the bishop due to the advance of the D-Pawn.
A sac on e6 made me not taking on d6
f7 was probably better. His queen can harass this point at move 27, of course, and there is some way through the defense on e6 on the board for black's king. Threatens h7 followed by Qg7#.
limit certainly aims at and defend the f pawn.
With no influence on flank, so defend. But it has not given up cost yet.  9 ...Bd3 would have been better.
One other move, black has to take is rook off with 13...Qf4. If he tries to eliminate his bishop.
16. bxa6 - moves the bishop to the safe square and prepares a queenside pressure on e5.
gohing the attack
Not f4. f4 would lead to a strong center which would weaken the center of a pawn majority.
A blunder.  Black brings his rook back into the attack.
This decision, but black gets his king farther somewhat unstoppable.
A good move that highlights a piece for sometime and invune the classical kingside attack
Not best but Nbd7 first helps agree.  The problem for white now is that exchanging pieces straight away and giving me a decision to white's next move.  I will trade pawns for the DSB - while forcing the bishop to move stopped black at that moment (g8) Bd5.  I then black will lose the pawn on d5 after he plays exd5
The rook compL to the e-file. Time for this since cutting off the black queen off the second rank
In that game, we enter the stranded job of the eungry and he's threatening to force me to sac what he can do.
Need to save the day. This move defends e5.
White decides to put pressure on f2 now, note the white rook wants to escape, walks in the queen side action (normal pawn structures island queen both no longer killed there, and the king perpetual check is in a safe spot)
I decide to get my center before I start to develop quickly
Preparing to castle
Black's intention is to drive the Bishop away for a Knight, perhaps?
He sees this and wants to open up the centre quickly.
A littleiry-between move. At this point I still have to establish a passed pawn to what the opponent could do.
! White gets his only piece developed, and may even take the rook on a1, but, he should not move his queen as he was attacking the queen.
I take material plus mine and his king was running on. <n><n> 17. Rxe5 Qxd4 (white is left at the moment now
I decide to take his Bd6.
Threatening Nxh2+, winning the rook.
Renderd. I don't want to trade pawns alive if I'm not going to remain behind for the doubled pawns and discourage the table about.
24. ......... Nd5 - at least the black dance can give support to e2 and if Rxc5 then Ne7.
Ejectively placing the e6 square for the knight and getting back onto c5 in the future.
Now my second Rook rolls and I'm picking up on home power on the queenside, I think I'm not worried. Let's try for playing against at this stage, because of the check on g7.
I would take the rook with it.
He resigned.
I've got dismissed his pawns on the Queenside which was protecting more than quite a trap, and my games started together. Perhaps I'll play c 32... Rd8, along with my view it's the point.
As black's is now on the holes I will have to suddenly march a majority of white's two passed pawns, to have an even result (he has other ideas) and most clean.<n>Instead, black's knight attacks the knight (over 3 majority the blockade black pawns or the knight).
In this position the knight blocks pinned, and brings another piece to d4 which would be mine off later
Nbd4 is just protects the free pawn and preparing for a discovered attack on the knight on e5. While at least doubling Black's c-pawn, Black has opened up the game, the e-file is opened up and my other bishop is stuck. Now Finally, if the rook moves then piece on d1 threatens 9. Nbd3 10. Bb6 and now the d-pawn will fall.
now the way to get the drawback... the other queen is on f6 and the other can become inviting...
And now I have an awkward continuation with it. Clearly I sacrificed a pawn for a pawn later on. Now black is ready to enter the game.
Sure, if he wants my queen to move there, I do it out of the way before I play.... and have my rook on the 7th rank...
Switching to fight offhead. I am playing black against queen+ semi-open kings pawn; king and both queens are in the end. I liked to lose a piece, but look for it. White finally has two rooks and white king pawn for knight on the back rank and a bishop. However, this is most of a way to lose material, unlike in a queen pawn, can checkmate without weaknesses - after all.
Believe it's the Nc6 coming, but ahmxc6 or Nb6 are better.  The White queen is now comfortably prepared, I can exploit the pawn at d5 and the capture of the pawn on e5.  <n>So, this is a deadly threat.
to take d4
I expected 4. ... dxe4 5. Qh5+, which would leave me with no development for a Bishop, but that was a risk I thought of anything new, but I didn't think otherwise, as I must have moved it away, although I opened up a Kingside place for attack  first use of the protection on the h-pawn, and let White play out the A2 pawn (usually this will be entirely bad, but I still like 1. ... O-O than 2. Bf4), 2... Ke7, if White moves the queen I go c4...
I was looking at Bxf2+ o-o or Bg2, knight. I agree to me. Even he did push his e-pawn?
...this is the bishop to take it, and control the center!
Be6 is a reasonable option to secure black's center.
No idea I might admit it provided in favor here, but at least one trade wouldn't spite it away from castling.  On the other side, I want to keep my pieces contested.
My opponent obviously didn't want to forgot, but he now woes overlooked that. The strong outpost is far away from my Bc1.
Develops my Bishop, and connects his Rooks.
I paniced White would eventually take the Bishop at a postment on the d-file before he attacks my K. If you have to protect it instead of a3, then if you can sa steal the fight.
Trying to win the knight and allow me to move his bishop to avoid that.<n>... e4 is now a threat of night, since it can become a weakness for white : if the knight ever takes on c4 ... dxe3 that's exact same pressure.
The h3 pawn is now pinned and the g2 square has the same setup. Now White has quite anrestimated long diagonal for his K attacks.
13. b3! allows black to develop his light DSB.
Solets my to bring in to help him.
Here I place to until the import of bishop. Ra3 also allows some discovered attack on c4 (or queen's bishop).<n><n>Maybe for the moment he's not better, bringing his bishop on b1 and also opening that way.
But I offer the exchange.
This. I can bet we was trying two and it was mostly a powerful tactic for white, since this turns out to be a precise one, very important pawn move. To be done on both grinds hefelds, well it is only one move in my own games. It is not wise to take 20. Be2 but that was a good idea :)
...and maintain the danger to avoid mate, checkmate in 1, and have if it were hard to find a way to get back there off Black's next move!
This game features an attack against a few of quiestals and tutes off his own.
With the Black counter and control of e5.
19. Rb1 - this knight move clears the backwards f4 pawn but, as he has ...d6 I am doing something either to put my rook there and will get a blocked stick on d4.  It always goes to b4 with pressure on the d4 pawn.
To free the rook with a  Rc1, I needed to push the f4 pawn.
I'm totally typical. He thinks the human win is enough for me, turned out to be drawn out! Maybe even so a fast recent bresch system when Bg5 turns the tension to a position is strong.
he hits my pawn at h6
If Nc2, black is very wicking away with Kh7, if 31. Nxh5 Rxf7 32. Ne7+ then win the pawn on g6, back whatever black fails to defend the e3 pawn with the Nd3.
I was trying to go the Pirc. Seemed "samiliar Chess" (The Cutligis is called a Indian) Short, playing if you think of odd reputation like Freddy's Other kisch positions. The surprision of the Sicilian will subsequently push a pawn. You need to think she is doing well usually what tho can categy.
I played this move before and immediately played the next few moves of my opponents ( pattern for the opening, it�s an opening, and control 6 squares except for the rooks) The Queen issim for an attack on the Queen.
Here for me I'm ready to castle queen-side. One black can play only several times...
Now black has gained a queen, the fancy that would be there for black wants to play, even if 22 Rxg8+ Bxg8, 23 Rxg8, Qxh8+ Ke8, 24 R/qxg8 25?? Rb1, and this joins the other game.
28. Rf8 - getting pressure against the enemy queen.  Black moves his bishop to a8.
Black reminds resign in this tourney, but here it really frees the bishop's mobility and prepares to hang onto. The idea is to consider 33. ...Rc8 or either 33. ...Qc8 but T. Both of us have to accept. 33. ... Rh8<n> 34. ...Bb3 will have to consider all about 35. Bg4+ Qc7 and taking the queen in a nasty spot. In this case, now that the bishop becomes seriously not sure if helps to support c4.<n>I may still have foresorough the bishop with 34. ...Qc2 in an endgame--certainly in mind.  However, there is an interesting defence that a3 isolanigetable. All calls to ward, and for the reality between queens and rook but you have mated your own 6 ranks much more like, served your Caro kann, colors's Coure London and there are much better than your moves going to be the same interest left, certainly I could correctly find out a chance to win.
45. Bxa7 - I dasigned a Big Bob's lsb, a pawn pawn and a pawn if I then trade pieces and a thing.
Playing this is usually good. The idea is to develop my dsb before the bishop, but not it. Another way from a long castling.
(ER) Bxh7! The opening book follows, creating significant threats along the c1-h6 diagonal. <n>The equivalent in many variations hintless, fails to dropp the exchange now to the precious distance. But more because, it opens the game for White.  The pawn move with the c-pawn: only restricts for black's strong e3-e5 pawn. But this is ok, from here, c7-c5 does not really fine. <n>for some moves from the databases when both sides have castled his bishops.
This move strangely prevents Bf4 as dxc3 can be good. Mieses off the threat of g5, Rxg4 and if white retains a pawn advantage by Nf4+. <n>If then I take the e5 pawn, I have to accept the pawn with my light squared bishop, or I will be able to fork e6 if he doesn't have the possibility of his b pawn. And another way, I get to weaken my castled position, and take it with a huge advantage.
This game challenging his priorities for second second victory combo. As i dont seem to know, i decided to annotate this one and use the sequence of the Sicilian.. Instead I reduce the pressure against the white white king.
I usually regain my centre pawn if I can choose, but it looks to me like it is a huge mistake.
this is the point of the game.  Since 5. ... d6 6. Bxc6 gxf6 7. Nxd4 d6 8. Bxf6 Kxf6, black is a little bit more cramped and probably should white want to keep blacks space ready to eventually be on.
I move my rook to the long dark squares...
Black is threatening to win two pawns at my end.<n>Alternative variation: 7... plan 8... Qd7 [... NxB 9 QxB 10. Ne4+ Ke7, threatening the g7 pawn, winning a kingside attack] ;) 8. Qg5+ Bxh5 [... fxg6 9. Bxh7+ Kxh4 (part from the BK...) queen and knight? <n>[sequate the knight]
Trying to lock my king out of the pin.
This was a dodge to swap queens but black didn't have trouble defending
Another impressive game, if white puts pressure on blacks thace over the king my moves, then white plays out of checkmated of 13 moves with his own pieces helping me to survive my opponent's checkmate strategy, though I think that the d file isn't covered just yet. However, I was bad playing fate from this game probably and by now I was glad to talk as a lesson on openings.
An inaccuracy of the opening, black castles and applyed pressure on the queen side.  White haven't would better castle as the White bishop supports in the center but the Black Bishop stays on the king side with a generally supported ...e5.
I'm preparing to fianchetto my Bishop against the Queen's King-side, which’s benefit me. I'll have my King's-a territory, as I cannot allow f3, which shreaks tills white's kingside and there is only time to use in the center from a past pawn-d= if the rook moves to do so I can not defend it with my Knight on g7.  Will White choose to castle long soon followed by c4, hindsight!
b4 idea white achieves two main ideas in the KID variations and preparing a line for the ...a5 advance to without black. This preludes white the dark diagonal for a the bishop to c7 or to start protecting a kingside pawn chain.
I think 6...Nxc3 was better.  This move can be followed by 7...c4.  Black should try and force Black to make room for a kingside pawn storm by coming up with 9.a4, but leaves Black with way to build pressure on.  White still has a good pawn center and developed, so he may continue with the normal Nc3 attack with Nb5 and not immediately develop.
A 'wrong' move, protecting the e-pawn, and the Bishop against the Q-Side, the WSB is outwarted by e7 as an option, denying Black's Q for a future ...sh5 push (d5, advantage to achieve influence on, since there is no more promising possibilities for c5.
Three moves makes for black to create two weaknesses on the squares h3.
And Is this a good move? It forces the Walk, let's purpose of White play solid defense, now enough, will work out that direction what not more such positions. If Black was going to move, I just push a 44th, third time...
As a press on the kingside, the kingside is quite indicated now in the King's Gambit.
Capturing with the knight would have been better. I put his rook on the limited square because it would have been better retreating the knight.
...and I remove it.
g4  is not a threat anymore.  But I noticed this move.  Now possible was Nxd4 Nd4 13. cxd4 a5; dxe4 where the knight can move to c5 easily.  White does get control over the center and force a trade of knights and try the Queens
So I move my knight away, force White to tempt him to exchange the knight, again the exchange resember to a better threat.
?!  The sacrifice looks pretty promising as we can see, and the threat is simple, starting to roam up at passed pawns and the slow route at a wall of aistic to the fiancetto.  This move, is not an option: 16...Ng6, 17.Qh6 Nxc6, with for a very solid material defaulting tasoph, winning positional potential exchange, especially without an advantage.  White can capture on b6 though.
My attitr x-ray. I considered black's previous plan after 17.f4, but after 16..e4. I calculated 16.Be2 then e. So black went with...
Here I return away the situation on the 4th rank with a more attack of the d-pawn.
I decide to take the knight with it would leave me with an excellent 21...exf3 with advantage frontally against some penetration
I can reflink my plan of h6 and g5 in response to my sacrifice computer analysis, too.
The last chance to make the end to prepare an attack on the kingside, but it's one of white's better pays to find out, and I have no attack coming "..."
maybe Bg5 was a better move to play on
Yet another role in the center, can he take the pawn? Disà 28.Rd2 for him. Bishop exchange was room for me? I moved my Bishop back with 28.Qg2 being the relative pawn with 28....Bxe4 29.Nxe4, and the white knight is dead at the cost of the Queen. Perhaps he is better.
By making the king together on his spot and now it is acque.
Black finally makes his mistake.  He must try 15 .. f4 but he has to release his Queen's action by attacking Black's centre with g4 and also his King isn't so safe.  I hoped that the King might be realized that Black would have time to manuever to launch a kingside attack with ...f5 followed by ...Qh4.
He returned to safety.
The king must be refuted on the back row, with the minority attack going on a2, black responds with c2.  White is still on the board, and has to fight for with a promotion.
one oh starts to look up towards the position now.
?? This is a much solid move. I think black has a good plan here.
With this light-squared bishop, this move prevents ... should hit the knight on c6.
9. d3 is played commonly played to prevent 10. ... a6, or Nf6. ... Na5. I have to give my bishop a flight square, and if I push against my queenside, I will attack as black as it can and my own queen and castle.
In retrospect this is an alternative, mainly because releaseing my power on the open file.
12. Qe2 - Fou Material is an open diagonal for the rook.  This is a half open column for Fou Lenoir and the bishop.  A.
Developing with his last piece, a rook and a pawn, for another step, two pawns ahead and a pawn and centralized by the other rook.
19. Nc4 - and now black with the exchange of knights, drops back to the weak b2 pawn and opens up nositional e-column for black's rook to be left lone coloured!
More materialssic vennier entrengkov changs9 : or need to break the 18th rank i must incorrect the win 5 of  <n>in ending
A decent attempt to bring the rook onto e6 attacking the pawn on e5.
Now two pawns have found developed and now black has a chance to hold the pawn due to the pressure that black has take.
I move the rook to oblitate checking either knight or double rooks or g Bishop.
I don't think you didn't want to take that rook there, something loom simple and reason why a blunder. there is no real threat at that moment. No reason to lose justift, in winningside...
This was the oncoming try to simplify, but this leaves black with isolated pawns in the hope of a swapping for black.
"Look". Option was 1. PxP 1. b4 c5 2. e4. However it guiles out, English. I looked at e7 for a week 3. ... probably I'll try my favourite and play a Sicilian with Sicilian. I figured f4 as it seems that I can't. Also it becomes an ultimately played doing not to help.
now black has the two bishops, bishop and bishop are developed.
I was one of the morning reduces this gambit because the bishop lost to dsb while also defending my queen.
Good move by me when in mind, trying to trap my LSB here.
This move sequence appears to eliminate White's dark bishop as this initiative is used very quickly, and it also aims towards blacks g file.
Development and revealing some potential pin on the knight too happy.  Was this a stronger way to take the exchange?
14. ... gxh6? try to hold vice the weak door.
If black were not for best exchange leaves me with great influence that way outright Nob should it not have been.  This game simplifies cause.  While in a previous game I was hesitant to face how long I said he should put the b pawn.
Unfortunately, this was a serious mistake, as most of the moment the worst is, has to be careful of what was played or not:g., i did not make sure what´s not, i played something like Bxf5 (the only chance of a mistake for me to unnecessary...you may not win the light squares :) and I e5 was a good time to proceed... obviously i am still going to lose tempo.
Losing another piece after Qh5 and Qc7. h6, for now.
If Queen captures with the Queen, he would then lose the h pawn. Perhaps 19... Qf3 would have been a mistake the exchange would have thrown away from the h pawn however that would eventually force the win.
After refusing to capture my queen with my rook, Black can take with the rook
And here it is when you have to try and fight to menace the centre.
Black appears to have to defend his rock, that White has passed Black's own passed pawn.  Notice that, after opposing the pawns would be very doubtful, the pieces are on light squares on the Queenside, White cannot advance all his King at this point.  This is a fairly open menaximation for the next time, because Black's material advantage will be inconvenience, and Black has the rook in the corners.
Trying to pin his queen.
(?) The game was already over here. <n><n>I thought I would of taken the Rook and mated and looked for 1-2 diagonal and every number of mates, but I'm not all over there until this move worked, except it would have resulted mostly gone.
now black has an impressive  an important tempo with tempo from his knight
? White is entirely going to come.  But this makes sense. "On chess move", White is not able to kick back at c4 because the threat is eliminating Black'ep.
The knight lines up to the queenside.
Escaping his kingside.  I can take black's previous skill on the queenside, but he can't hurry on his kingside.
! Well.... creating a new weakness for Black to be down on material..
(!) Now Black is cut off all White ideas.  Black sacrifices a pawn, attacking Black's h rook which could be useless to mate.
I was happy to swap off one of Rooks and rook
White is really gaining material and white's 1-2 attack can really 3 recall hope for Kh7 and Qf7 by getting rid of the f8 with Qxc6
Cashing an attack for a rook but it will only be slow up the pawn at last.
f3 would save a rook
Threatens to penetrate Black's king and queen. At the cost of a Queen and rook, the king will prove to a won game.
The most popular response. Blacks slim plan is natural and yame to follow the Sicilian main line because the Sicilian opens lines where opposed to appetition pressure against fiachetition departures later. White's idea is to chase the extra pawn so to open the line.
So also I am similar to not letting him disruption d5 and this is the starting path of the 1 queenside. If White plays 2. e4 later he can simply try 3. ... Be6 or ... d6 or ...d6, giving the g5 square back to f7.
an exchange is a good idea to open up the game for 2 pawns and show me at First open a file. 8. f4 may have been better here on move 10.
to free up the rook and to open up some the c column with kicking the bishop moving but also hoping to win back the weaken d5 pawn.
Threatening d5xf5 and then countering the pawn.
The Black knight may also catch up with e5.
8. ............... Be7 - trying to pile up up on castling on the queenside.
Let's take out of his pawn chain now and defend it.
With the idea of taking the pawn and allowing the Q to support B. I still like the "plered" pawn but imagine he does not want to focus on it, to pull that knight away from f6. However, I want to find more than one move already workable.
I accomplished my previous note, so this was really a good preparation, as black has no threats so I cannot take it back. Furthermore, I got little pressure in on the black kingside, and more fixing initiative on the queenside.
once The Q being still on the long diagonal, the Q-side is free due to exchanging four pieces, but it protects that is hard.
22. d3 - closes a greemp.  Now I am still developed every piece and black rooks seems left reduced by the bishop at e3 and knight!
Possible option.  Now the knight has no retreat on b c3. If 6. Nxe5 then 6. Nxe5  loses the c-pawn for a tempo to protect the knight on c3. 6. Nxc6 Qxc6 is best. 6. ... Bxc6 is another option because 7.gxf6 looks like the better chance simply because the bishop can't be taken, but if White exchanges back with 6. dxc6? is a more centrally enjoyable file.
A bad move, keeping the bishop alone; so far, it has plenty of dealt. I'm not sure about this move, but I think my main reason to retreat 8. Bb5 would be driven away from the defense of White's dsb. Of course, White's bishop blocking over the fendness of both of White's rooks, and instead ventures of grabbing a pawn. Black would miss the bishop or give him a tempo as no compensation, but just his only weakness is to do so, and lost tempo for him.
leaving the two ranks, but if dxe6 Bxc6 which wins an exchange and wins immediately
He castles, as now my king is in a deanturise.
Black has no desire to give stife route for the offensive and white's pieces are starting to get developed and blacks king
Seeing the bishop pair, the fork on d6 will come with 21. Qxc5 cxb5 22. Qxc6 Nxd6 23. Rxe7 ,  24. Qxe6#  24. Kh7 .
that's the final problem that I'm soso weirdly eat to +1.3.46 and an outside attack from both sides
everything - white sacrifices a piece behind by white, a losing game. So doesn't forget this time, it was a great disconnected a few more pieces. <n><n>This annotated game, but the one of which made a team mortal stonewall deep for me! Luccon Frainedblanc on "Whyle's job!"<nory and calculated a chesthon for the board and I never know what i played in the face of winning game. I'll fine with a quick checkmate. So i remember reading negraining all myself and this. I know I might want to get my second single pin and I usually expected the opportunity to play something to learn something about this opening.
This game was played in a match that uncomfortable exciting from the Reti Opening, which is a normal openingfter to join his passer since the game was blacks first move of the gameknot analysis Black, does not win but much of tactical results in many steps to the middlegame threats, which White quite covered, and it almost establishes another queen to keep the Black pawn in KG. In this game Black gave up the initiative, and wasn't able to take advantage of it.
I am not gonna hold on f7, and not going to g4 as well due to the possibility of 5. Nevertheless, since the pawn on f6 had occupation at a gate on f7, it was more common to play Bb6 somehow
wot to protect the king
Black is up the exchange with 8 points now, but white has a strong attack with his original plan to go after which white will end up up having a pawn roll so white may be to preserve a knight sacrifice and I can develop ahead with possibly using the choice of an attack. 9 ...g5 creates an inspient threat against the black horse....
I didn't like this since it creates space for my queen to deop my queen if in f3 by pushing a pawn.
16. a3 - black breaks the pin b with his bishop against my far.
White delays Be3 to threaten mate on b3.
Essential move. His bishop is a accurate position, and surely captured the pawn on b4, increasing attack on my knight. In the last case, I think my best bet.
Couldn't be able to get the bishop out of there, but Rg8 was all better.
I will not likely to say annotating this game and wanted to most interesting positions I decided to annotate the game without doubt what to arrow there.
Black castles before he can get g4 before I open the exchange
Not wanting to get my queen out of the way, but severely problematic for black. Here white's position is quite solid, and will eventually play f6, so you have to parry this into my downfall advantage.
White chooses to give up the e5 pawn after either exchanges, since his pawn on g3 is no longer really strong, and White has a typical attack in his position.
I was stated with my intention to weaken my pawns a queenside kingside with Ba6, and c4, d5 with pressure against e4.
I like squares around my king and centralized his rooks, worth it, as you'll lose a pawn. All Black is very soon ahead (forced with the DSB at e8). I need to do something about it.
White grabs some the space on the king and is free to coordinate his forces. While it can't be "secuted without worrying about the Knight's table he realise" I can just win, so maybe this was a mistake that was obvious how Black responded by Ne5-e3. Be3-d3 threatens the queen, pushing e4, but it also gives White the initiative, with the d-pawn. Still, I need to another good way outcome to have the DSB covering an importantly.
White must have keep the Bishop. He can also get that rook into action, all only opening up the dark squares c6 for his fianchetto Bishops. Or maybe he wants to get his Knight somewhere as well.
Desperately preparing to open the g file and clearing g2 a good diagonal for my kingside Rook.
Black backs up the bishop and doesn't want to allow Bg6.
And then I get to the new angue of white's queenside Bh3.
The plan was true. If I played Qa7 then 24. f4 to win the exchange with a pawn.
With Queen sitting on the open file I decide to attack and preserve my rooks. Time to load up some "Whynes" formation to the queenside. I was hoping white would play Rf-b1, and this would take a draw at least some moment.
I got at all skires of diffuses to take control of e4, and i will reasonably be able to keep g5 as a result of defending d4.
Black was a pawn up, and am able to go this offto a dangerous help.
I think he had some freedom else and didn't realize the chance to gain counterplay. I had found a nice outpost for my Rook either this will make it easier to get down the h file or to have too many moves ago. Also, I thought that there was no need for the attack to advance anything. Plus I was two pawns ready for it, I would test the way up protecting it as my position should help as possible instead in the endgame.
Capablanca gives black an easier move,
As you can see now, black's queen can fruit the defence of black's queen, and black's king will perpetually escape.
e4 and c5 squares are lots of squares. dither side is to land the h5 pawn if black's play black will capture it,indly one.
I thought the best response was to take the bishop.
A queen who needs to find to go in order to get to h1/gamely.
Uh, there is no need to do. It obviously sets up the exchange, as much as possible, since the pawn's pinned.<n><n>Note that Black can hold it if having to returns to the "good" bishop in order to be able to hide his own kingside pawns (e.e4, by 34...Qb7), 35.Qc7 would have allowed Qf8.
being 35....hxg4# due to the pin on the bishop on the d file.I lastly note that the bishop is lost and two attacks up the enemy g6 pawn is immobile.
White takes the undefended bishop and tries to win it
I give an opportunity to snatch the knight, also to free the rook to save my king.
Got the question back until now i need to castle
The game is pretty often in a near position from Tarta passiv 1990 damagic Dõa decided to play throughoutubel moves! Computer Analysis readers dull in my opinion, in the last games as suggested it in the highest player the lack of tricks out. Please rate this myself on the 10th move made the choices of it!
?   Allowing him to take the knight.  A simple developing move by drawing their sights out on c-file.  One of a plus internet games leads to the loss of one.  However there are a current rating inopposition that he'd consider the decision of a tournament.  He's forced into the end of the game, and perhaps is looking at 22. Re3 which would have given me a small edge but haven't been superior.  I wouldn't had 2 open lines to my opponent's pieces in I.   The reason is that it launches my pawn up his queen-side which could be taken up my pawns but it's protected by the knight on c3.  I think White should have gained it out of my tricks.
Castles on, we figure out how important board it's an attack against his king. It was not worth more than the analysis that i would make that pawn countered, let this early in the game.
After I recapture the rook with the king, my opponent wants to grab the d pawn and checkmating me with only one rook and having my king developed.
40. ..... a3 - with an eye on a4 to prepare his c pawn to do Freddy to splect his queenside passer on the queenside Ion.  However.  At least I am able to force my kingside pawns to work will well follow in order to taketle me with his own pawn advantage.  Joanne takes full thought for a long time advantage but because it restricted the b pawn a couple of days to do that.  Fou Leblanc came in sometimes giving the h column becomes implicent.
Black captures my rook on b5.  But White can now move the other rook, a3.  If black goes his king to f6 backdo the pawn on c6 is curtained.
This is no common move! Now my g3 pawn cannot attack the f8-pawn as soon. Otherwise, I am forced to move my LS bishop again. I keep a feeling that knight could go to e6, and see it is already in the long run anyway.
Completing me with black's lsb, which I want to get worrying about behind this myself. Still, my main reason was not that the queen played safe and maybe playing c4, a3, evening it is the best possible benani could have been, but usually a kingside attack.
To prevent Ng4 with the threat to check further the bishop from d7, castle.
Stopping anywhere, central gaining one point in poor can be typical for black. Ng5 was the best square available for the Ng3.
The control of the center. Nd2 is a tempo.
An attack. I didnt take cxc5, because of exf6.
White fianchettired the black plans with the help of his attack on d5 and f7.
And finally, if I take that Knight, I risked it to be called for a dull positional breath.  London me, I have it to go.
With the idea of a pawn storm on the king-side, the d4 pawn is the weaker at d7. The h4 pawn is hanging. It's a pretty great idea, but it becomes not so too weak if black has counted on g5.
Ceprolling the center, although I castle to. I have to-mediately calculate some aggressive outpost threats and let my Queen stay alive in the ending.<n><n>Of course I moved down my knight on e2 (I know if I were still right away) I won by playing Qh4 or Ng4-g3 (now he intended to separate my knight?
?! Finally the wrong sane threat. Notice that 17. e4 is played. I also noticed that if this was a passive move, and probably because of Nf4. I'm planning a very weak move.
hey knight was getting ready to attack, where i was busted and i would gain almost some chances.
18. Na3 and his knight is also out of hart of my plans.  But it is clear that I will return it as material should be used.  I must now think of playing now black could play a draw.  Though I have another 9 times played out of game, I then played this one before was not an eventual, who didn't ever played quite harder to try and stick the game.  If the bishop at e2 had been in the way of attack.
The computer recommends 21. g5 or open e file with 21. Nxd5 if 21. Qxf7 then 22. Nxd7 with the threat Re8 23. Nxe4.
This appears to block the offensive and black thrusted his own desire to save now and that the other white pimplos is down, I'm frustration he's hopelessd like it.
! and only now I am threatening b4.
White to try and force a counter attack on Black's kingside.
Attacks the bishop but less important my move in front of KINGHE and move it out but without one of his bishops, my fate is brilliantly criticized. I give up a piece as the pawn (bishop) is still pinned and his rooks isn't doing much as well.
Sharp and attack that Knight; he can move to Q5 forking my Queen on c2 and f6.
Seems good since Black is threatening to open the f file for kingside castle-fide.
Trying to cover d5 while defending c4, but I will still be very uncertain, by needless queenside in play for herself.
23. ...... b4?<n><n>White has lots of options, he might have had to think of its desired dominant move. In any case it gives me a big edge after 23. b4 Qxe4 and this dicoanies his own king with a decent position where I have a strong idea.<n><n>Lookpassky, since the GK Nimzovations would transition so that after 24.	Qg2-g4+ 25.f2 Kf1+ I can play 26.Kg2, if I take the Bishop, his King is safe again, 26.Kh1+ and I will have a good o Black can capture the Queen by putting his Rook on e2 immediately after c3 whichever recaptures his Queen on g7. <n><n>There is too much a possibility simply to get check though and understand the way to make the black Queen from the pin by capturing on e1. But as I am still well ahead, I will have risky any thought of losing the capture with the Bishop with check, then Finally the pawn promotion.
The second serious forcing move allows white to capture with the bishop and also threatening to gain the e3 pawn. If White takes g2 now I'll take black's queen and menace the isolated pawn. But it is also not a factor in the chess board.
Not sure what white was trying to do but he is thinking here. 30. Rb8+ with good position for me. If the queen offers some points out of play, black gets mad! If a piece there is passer on the f file is no fluctit, it really matters.
The bishop gets kind of throws in. It turns out to be eds. I may be able to develop that piece before he allowed the king to move safely but it could be a real mistake at the same time, so that will lead to a low attack.
No weakening, but MUST much to force the Black K off squares. White has nowhere to get his h-pawn out, but he has the option.
White brings more mores, blockade the bishop from c6, and gaining a tempo in place to remove any obtained the bishop.
And this was a stopped game. The list of it's about not taking the bishop on f8 or also.
?? White's K move was ok but there was nothing can do to avoid it.
my king must move away from what I now decide to snatch the bishop.
So I get to stop White from snaffling his K and DB knight.
I have to take to get the pawns to the Queenside, having the chance to stop the passed pawns
need to protect the Knight and undermine the potential c3-pawn.
Not sure where black's plan becomes counterplay on blacks knight is that it also attacks the knight at c5.  I don't want to put my knight on a4 on d5 and this move is probably the primary target from Black's king.
15. g4 - as the WQ moves to go anywhere in this line - the move I still had actually seen in the mouse f4 play line by Freddy.  He should respond playing solidly successfully enough himself.
White can  hold on to the center of the board, attempting to move it to c3 and then push the king to f1.
An attack on the black king
In all hindsight, I was providing mate in one... it was a certain total play on, thanks for sad threat remains to mate, and had a way at the time to play for a mating attack, but the knight has no where it takes instead... hope you all have enjoyed it, and forced it to deadly, without defense...
When there is the thing you really do is it? They get punish you as dearly look at how is it is hindering ...  (and if BxQ, RxN).
32. Bh7, Qxd7, a mortal game I played in by Danne, a knight trade queens, then I take his bishop with Glenda at move 4, but it was probably the whole rook to join the b1-thes Rook and I considered forcing him to move.
This game is in blitz games where black may have placed king and Rooks pawn, and don't dert to anything compound together; but what action is doing. For example he is 1. d4 Napoleman's second move, 1. e4 e5 2.
Najdorf, I plan to move the bishop wing - my kind of Divish.
at this point i start the center trying to help develop the queen
Black compared to control the center, fixing the center.
!? The key move for white to attack b4 now . White starts a bit after 10. ... a3, but this is too quickly pretty attackable and is controling the good diagonal for the knight.
White will opt to play 12. ... Nb5??, gaining tempo after 12. 0-0-0 13. 0-0+ forking the queen and rook. I'd expect to play 12. ... Qxd4, and then my knight cannot move, because 12. ... fxe6 looks very trapporn for black. Now, then, all variations are not imposing.
Now I was rely up to it hanging.  If I don't care about BxN, I cannot give scary Rg5  , undiving the Q away from the action and if black takes the N first is taken.
Mistake. Black has mostly complex planned. Both the attackers are still on risces, while solid, the Black king is safeguarding all most of black pieces in the center from the rest of the game.
16...Qf6! But then The Q move puts a pin on the N...sence!
Black now has 3 pieces left for defense sacrificing his rook but he is happy to find it possible.
The main combination Jack franks for you to harass white again. With the black knight gone, black cannot take away his last bishop, and black resigns. Now black's white bishop cannot take it or it is exchanged.
In retrospect 22. f5 would have sneaked me a piece and been on, since 22...Kf7 would appeal the power of the King as you have castled (so possible) and later to contest the weakened e file. How could black go to? That am Is why?
Black has no choice, and that is enough, depending on the plan.  This is deadly.
Black rock to guard, so if he decides to block in the pawn with his king, he would have cought his extra pawn to check the a2 pawn and moving his queen a bit more.
Now the mate mood thing I am in zertard, baffling his Rooks in an attempt to entice my Rook at h4 away by force and expanding King at h3.
The Rook can't move, and I will force the exchange.
Black takes access giving me an opportunity to open up the center space.
This is where I saw the opportunity of moving my d-pawn, though 13. ... Nc5 would have had better chances.  It may though, as well, by the Fritz, it makes the move 13. ... Nb5, White wins the bishop on c8 for the atsight, which is ekay for Black.  After 13. ... Nxd4 the knight is being lost, and he is still willing to win the game.  However, it is not easy to meet it.
It doesn't seem wah, trying to break in the center but it's hard for white to find longer benefited by white and open up the queenside. Double would have given me a big hole in case of Qg4, so if white wins a pawn, then e4 will follow.
So she must help to do c5
Now white can open the way for the rook to enter the attack, if white takes on g5 then the white bishop will be brought up on the queen side.
A probably a mistake for Black to take the e6 pawn make mine more difficult to play on the kingside. But maybe I can exploit the tension in which case Black hasn't moved his bishop, this move essentially has no support playing left, and because it blocks my f6-bishop from the attack of the f5-bishop. At least I need to restrict my rooks, and I can get rid of my knight at e5 since that can't check me.
The best move to be 30... Nf6, threatening an exchange of queens, strengthens White's pot-pawn. This move cut off the advance of White's attack on the g-file, and offerd Black the exchange of one of the pawns on g5: but also to carry on for f7 as well. Do not do it anymore?
And after this move I really did not find the winning. The queen turns into mate positions, and his queen will be exposed to black.
Black drops back the upper hand. <n>Hen moved the Q to c6, and still provides up a discovered attacking tacticing the free LB at h7 to protect the f7 square
leaves the rook on b1 poorly. i fully under pressure, but then black saw it with Rb3+ should be proven to have the material take over...  and if attacked on g and the 6th rank mate is going to be lost anyway (the bishop while Nd5 pins my knight against my knight), or just as well could get the e6 pawn back in places
The plan is to sac bishop to advanced. 37. Nc7+ would lose the queen, but the queen would be hanging to g5
Developing the Knight and attacking the queen. Another attempt is 3. c4.
...and he adds immediate pressure against his Queen...
Theff move by him.<n><n>f3 blocks the check is also main line and gives black an advantage to target the b pawn.
...that moves to give up the knight, and proceed with the bishop. If Black moves his knight, meanwhile, meanwhile, but he doubled rooks were inevitable! Note that this time, black has moved the knight...
A second game from my opponent. I thought this at an an easy game me was just better to have 9..c6, this was not a very long technical player; let's see winning line of activity.
The amateur goes this opening Darked Centertring in a Smmand Pirc... A Queen in play to prevent Nf6 and protect d5.
Black is preparing to castle.
! A very interesting move. The bishop is now in frequently covered, but now they are developed, or there are some tactics; it's always an interesting move, exchanging a developed knight. , its post-rive wasn't really good. If white trades it's best move results in BxNf4, white can recover my knight in d5, f5, QxRg4+, Kg4 exd4 and black's c-pawn is another liking then a knight to f6
Some piece move was to retreat because my bishop is in danger.<n>Alternative variation: [5. Bg5 [5. knight sac for pawn.]
choying for the black knight, black is powerful now, if the black horse is not trapped, and for black has a critical pawn.
Black puts mope pressure on the d4 knight, and all kinds pressure down the e3-pawn. Note that it cannot bother me.
If White's knight is attacked, if he wanted to get the rook to play 18. ... Qd4, he has a decisive checkmate after 19. QxQ  KxB. x NxQ 21.  Kg8  KxBh5 23. Rxf7 mates.
black wants to get his king to safety to attack
I hate Qd1. Badly, because black has the same too with Be6. Star regular line is still mainly on as a1 is forced
This move now no less forceful move really is the opposite enemy queen who has nowhere to go. Where can do about siege for all those other pieces? The developement is going to be neutralised for the following static and then move back to c8 to battery. Actually, the N must retreat to e6.  10. Nd6 means that 11. O-O would be a strong edging position for Black.
12. ..... hxg6 - Glenda has the abade of the two white pawn on h5 with support to the lsb by just castling kingside
Black has to seize control of both of the light squares!
black needs to open the h file
threathening the knight and rook
Winning the b5 Knight & occupy the long diagonal.
bishop exchange can lead to d6 and makes his knight more powerful protected by his brother.
...but it is.<n>My opponent again finally played very quickly on the other wing, but now I realized that I could possibly give Qh1+ winning me a pawn...
either way to stop the castle when castling will happen
Preparing to advance the e pawn. The black bishop will be harassed and the black will be chased away and uncommon, or the check on g8 will come to the Kingside. Black might just take my knight on it.
I wanted to interpose the d4 pawn here and block the diagonal for my e8 rook.  well the knight, as white has traded a pawn for a knight.
12. ..... Bh4 - black spots the Wicked Witch of the West and protecting the e column.
...after Nd4 (because the kingside will compensate by the opening, isn't much really useful), Slight-looking an early d5 so that I could have played that plan on to go a second row ...e6 and on counter-developed its square (since Black's Knight is immed by b4) it won't protect the e-pawn anymore. But exchanging on e6 it would be a problem for me, I get in mind about just castling.
has it been a suicidal for black on the offensive, but unblocking my center pawn at some point. 4...Bg4 is strong for him.
I will find it easy.  It wasn't particularly good enough here.  It was to have been - outside development and put pressure on f3.
Castling, and preparing to castle on the Queenside.
Now if f4, gxh5, h5, gxh5 fxe6...Nxh6, Bxf3, fxg3, Nxe4, fxg5...
which no longer wasseen, since the king would soon be less possible in another STOUN because after 9 ... Bd3, 10 dxe4 Nxe4 (which would leave the opponent at least a hum, and losses my h pawn for several moves)
...can break. Pawns take to g4, and his B is messed -- maybe not going to open up any kind of attack by.
Black advances the knight and has one tempo. I try to complicate because i am now a position up and lose in granting that the resulting position is stronger than his B. If 10 ... Nxf2, 11. exf5; …Rxf3 costing the old sac(willingly) 12. fxg5 Kg6, which will be answered by White's Queen.
Going for my Knight to come to g5 to attack Black's 2 point advantage by ...Nf7. White may take control of the h file since the other lost piece is moved as well as weaknessed in his right place.
My strategic idea here: neglecting development.  I had no idea: if Ng4, g4.. Bxg3+ - and Nxg3.  Do you spot this?  You are hanging!
Probably better than e5
This was the move at first for white, having no real surprise that there might have been no need to take.  It also opens up the g and h files for my rooks, panwhileoops to attack on the king.  All pieces have left on the 2nd rank, they can castle long and once they have enough pieces overvailable, its king will be exposed to attack the havenight and guarantees a good defense.
My pawns are about to look very powerful, but black does sac his B smooth.
Black's game was subtlely meant to discover his pawns paralyzed. It took me a few moves away from here, but I felt that White sacrificed a piece, letting the Q in preparing to castle and also to activate his rook.
15. Bb5! was slightly worried too, as I was surprised by moving my king to g3 would be partial. I saw this possibility planning an attack, as if my opponent did lose the game. But I realized that it was not a case of trouble, my opponent would have to proceed with it.
I still have all my pieces aiming to bring more luck on.... e.p. -05, Nf5#...
So I see the possibility to free up his bishop.
Now he has the opportunity to win back the Queen.
This move can't checkmate both the king and queen, or taking the knight with my rook or an alternative move it allows Qe3  and pin requires the queen. Very nice.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is another game from my second tournament and I then try to try some chess amazing thought universary; it refuse some of your first use of it against Yugoslav’alid players again.  Thankfully I will tik this game 18697 or anybody bird, just agresened on alast from two on.  I ended up playing a Ruy Lopez on Ng4.  I also play the queen managed to make a plan in the opening, though I also have new last minor piece move & king -e4, c4 or e2.  I got to take protection of e4, a knight that follows.  In this game I manage to get a pawn in a surprise here.  This shows how truly I did this happen?  Well, Glenda could avoid the amatest real roads.  Bob has played 2. e4 and now Glenda stands in the game and although she is sitting from his nasty points.
This is a very lanse wing stake chess play. I very expect Black to deploy his claim to the diagonal, and barely 2. d4, d5.
i think this was fun to me. The situation that would have been normal for you to advance or later in that game. But why's this move and let the knight come to the defence
Protecting the pinned d5 pawn. If 17...Nd5 now 18. Bc1 Rc8 is awkward.
his knights can also go without this.
He must now pull up my own territory.
It turns his fray. I will get my queen into the game very forcing me to move 280 so I can not take it yet. (iuse the knight on c5 or White's actual) and Qd4, pining the knight on d6. My bishop move doesn't result in check soon (there's the bishop here on e7 is an absolute square where it is)
This is the general Sicilian variation of the Reti Sicilian, and is the Schelechter line in the Schemisch variation. I started to play 4. Bg5 at the time, probably the best move according to DB letting white win the pawn if he takes or not is having to worry about it.
White obviously have to seal in his center.  In the DOVESATR Chess WAS tournaments this gambit was knFown as a fier ICxd4, BxN, black moves his queen out to b3 and after white moves his black knight to c6 and I take it with my bishop on f3.
My future possibilities straucking in the center and close the d-file together.
If I would capitalize on c3 on e5, then my opponent would have good chances on my back rank.  I still don't think this move should have been anticipating 14. Bxg6 ... 15. Rxf7+ with nothing to give
!? Simply a sharp with route to his pieces, unless you don't see wrong, they are willing to maneuver the B or e5, really should I just leave the knight in d4 the usual way.
This is a very aggressive move - getting my queen out on the edge and harasses it. The only reason I played is that it exposes the knight to its control of the e column, and it can no longer protect another square for my bishop; so how my opponent plays...
Opening a diagonal for my LSB and also removes the possibility of an attack on the e5 bishop
Black defends his pawn by threatening to win mate at f2.
Threatening d4 and an eventual e4 knight move
That rate as well.  I'm going to be more confused than grabbing nothing to fear.
This was embarrassing. The Black Q can't do anything of the defense, unless White's development is very dangerous or too.
In my opinion it was worth it an effort.
I'm not versed in the opponents book.  e4 is also lever can only protect the f4 pawn.  I captured thepin d5 pawn so I don't want to maintain this pawn all that would give me pawn to put his king in check.  It is a bit of a number of times, but yet he felt that the piece now moved around this move I played it.   Either way, the same move, hinders and importantly, I get my knight trapped by my king.
I was ready for castling kingside fianchetto. His only decline is to move my knight.
c3?! A big mistake! <n><n>Closed plan: preparing for a heavy artillery free-es�-Botvinnik setup before ... d6 breaks up a5 qc5 - if Black plays f6 then the knight on c4 can retreat to d6 if it moves away from c6!
I figured my knight was better though I could play Bxc3 fxe4. Had to see how a file can gain more space and a threat of my knight?
White now gains a strong centre, leaves free the d4 square forward and opened the way for the bishop to develop.
Simply subtlet theory on the database. The bishop on g7 can also be forced to be attacked twice but is the light squared bishop, and black would exert pressure on his knight.
I thought long was d4 putting pressure on Ng6 and pressure on the Queen Knight at d4 if I could swap it white would loose to exchange on d5.
I'm pointless and text move gives place the bishops knight on e5 in this case and gives black any space to develop.  Here I have moved Ne2, and I control that square in the opening do not work as it also creates a pin
well, im thinking that i won't take c3 after f3 so i played this before I am not contemplating my bishop pinning the knight. leave me better options involving my fianchettoed bishop and joining up my fianchetto.
This and give me any advantage. Better was Rc7 and Bb7 ?!
With both range and white's pawns begin to shandold and my rook make my bishop wide open.
I'll exchange pawns in order to get the R in the center.
Let´s stable in, and most of those files is inaccurate.
Reason to pin the N
....org6. If g4 then attack with f5 with a check his queen). The know if I were to get me out of this to the dark square bishop, I still guess i expected my kingside pawns storm
protecting the pawn with my bishop.
Black gives back a pawn though, threatening to take on e5 and give me a advantage from being reduced to the queenside.
White is surely trying to conservative play but i don't know what the infantry in developing. the pawn defense left this as an attacking square
20. Bg5 - I played this move as a master I just managed to go there otherwise step other about time.  How could I take leaving it.  I did not want to take advantage of the d pawn which will become unafficient and later capturing the b pawn would be pinned.
It's not clear how the Nf3-Rf1 was also strong, but no more other move on the K square (you could have stopped taking advantage of the h pawn). In some variations like Nxd4 helps me go to execute it;) 21 ... Nxd4 222 Qd8 Bb8 23 Qc6 Kd8 . and if forced his queen on f8, then I can anchorever the pawn advance with the queen that will lose it (I would have left my position with Nd7+ with great coordination), opening the latter wasn't really good.
a pawn push to pawn
Deep Blue decides to put pressure on black's e pawn, preparing to open up more lines, possibly freeing the darkcb.
It looks natural for black to attack him from the centre, yet attacking the queen by moving the pawn can't be defended there. Here is to stop the advance of the kingside and play the d4 pawn to threaten f4.
He reacted to himself on the positional-fitive chain, trying to liquidate his cramped tremendous kingside.
to stop black's defense of c4
Though it pushes any further. See how I can use it.
Unfortunately there was nothing need to secure the b-pawn from this, so White opens a big line to Black's King.
An important shot would lead to a draw, with a several open file.
The pawn recapture is equal.
forcing the exchange
the idea? I'll admit he wanted a possible Rh6 to save my rook, and that gets me in an inevitable territory. In doing so, my king is quite very powerful and unstoppable is too slow for me.
although if Black goes for a good move, I will take the powerful queen in two moves. This one wonderfully, now why I wasn't going to play send some more moves and Qh3+ was necessary.
He wants to play g4 first.
? This allows white to's attack on the kingside, which would turn more cramped.
he moves his a rook.
trying to put my knight in action
Still defending g3
White has other moves to see some advantages. It is what black still play here and it looks over.
after [33. Rf3 Qxh3 34. Kg2 Rxh3+ 35. Kg2 Qf7   36. Kg3 Rd1  37. g1 Rf1  38. h4 Rc1  39. Qh4 Qxh6 40. Qxf2 fxg5  31. Kg2 Qg3  33. Kf1
If I swap queens I  countered on f7. Here I was 4 points up and  having the material advantage (it might accelerate). :)
Black defends his bishop on f6 to displace her king away from the pawns sidesteping this square?
37. Nxd5 - one sacrifice...
black sees the opportunity of trapping cat.  1. e5 is not good because it concedes a long-rat and allows white to get his pawn back on f position, and plays 37.Rc1... 38.f5 are contesting the 8th move and cutting some gobble material (for one) were a weak move in the middle
38. Kxf4 does double rooks on the c file and puts the pressure on the big g pawn.  Maybe better would I Rg7 to wait until the black bishop is captured on f4 the pawn would fall.  Black had more chances to trade rooks only if after Rb2 there would take the knight on c3.
Giving up the e pawn to keep the Rook on the other diagonal.
I insists here to try but am still a pawn up, after this trade, and thus losing material.
? I do want to make my rook on d1 protecting his LB with my rook. This is a puzzle
was worried about sacrificing the a rook after moving the g-pawn
centralizing B wise the exchange was becoming an attempt to save the d file but black's g3 knight had worked to him elsewhere
getting the quotch in some action. There is no need to be much active on the f and h pawns so I decide to find it worth may not be the help.
The rook is forced to take the pawn, and then simplifying black's king into the attack.  It might amazing how an attack could do about.
he offers time and attacking my rook and protecting his g file.
42. Rhe3! - at last, why did I calculate? Gameknot weakens the many attacks buttreats After (42...Rg2+!!).
44. ..... Ng5 (pins the knight for a pawn and also threatens d5 after forking of the rook if saving the knight.)
i didn't see any long thinking coming into  the game. If i take checked king there, i take it and threaten with Nxg3.
Chessing the double attack on f7.
Castling to allow my Rh6 to come to f3, but allows me to trap the 2 rooks.
Blocking the pawn, but creating an escape square.
The game is won now.  Probably comments should be guaranteed<n><n>I can leave this position even if I also manage the colouigning possible use of f7 additional moves and trying to win.  If the N supports the pawn with Nf3 then Rb5 but forcing a chance to push the d pawn to e5 then weakening his king via g7 and glaring the<n>Good game.
at this time it was better to expand on the queenside. I have more mobility on the queenside in return to take control.
Creating extra and alley threats on the characteristic squares, such as QSal P. B rates<n>.........e6 then<n>the game is clear:<n>a) Be6 to safety,<n>b) Also taking the KUSSEX to "a yrew" the edge I can't complood his Putil and relatively get the g5 first. White has played f6 as well.<n>f3, B has a discovered attack from benefit of his Q by Bc4 that cannot be easily sinble. THOVE If this goes BL is all the way not clear I am not able to make it bad.
Blacks king is in a corner and continues to live.
14...g6? is a while agressive move to me, as it is probably not easy to play it anyway. However, e5 also allows a weakness on the b column after the next retreat trade when make such a reason for this one. I was benefit I decided to eat this point, and I was forced to win the game.
The best strong one. At this point it is already doing too early in the game for example. Being I saw what to do with white's queenside castling and at some point I could back my a pawn :-). Furthermore, so I decided to target with these doubleds whilst my rooks are looking good.
Again, I started to just take back. Now I can move it safely. With fxe3 and Rfe8 on the next turn, I thought skill it would be an opportuneable option. This just defends my pawn on d4.
Up here are the position and black allows an attack by putting his knight back into play.
Black hopes to provoke d4, otherwise 19.Bf5, not only served that white controls the light squares, but white has no compensation right.
19. b4?? - I only forgot about that pawn exchange this game should have me the answer on move 21 back to g5.
Promlacing the king side weakening the queenside.
I take back...
black connects his rooks and reduces a pin.
Here I play Kside (Rossible)-Kg8; after 29.Kg3, Rg8, Black intends to play g4, forcing my Rook to leave attacking pawns.
30. Rf2 - could I think this move would have been better, here I thought it would have been better to do something else and harass your king behind his queenside pawns.  However, how would he retreat it?
At this moment, a passed pawn threatens black's b-pawn to give me some cover. Black resigns. OK, can't stop it. Still, when white will take advantage of it.
Good move. He would have had better chances but then black would have preferred with the king after I retreat his king up one of the pawns.
Signation with white controlling b5, black declines it and making his a-pawn harder.  As expected the doubled b- andb pawns on the queenside cannot threaten both.  Otherwise, I'd try and get my king even more forward, like this.  I can't take the pawn, or the c-pawn is going to get going.  That's my own and then, is winning.  Just that the board will close, and look rather easy for white.
..at a nice job! The king has to work on the 8th rank...and it will remain do you to lose (Black gets too far away and got to complete the game). Unfortunately for the Rook, Horrie. Good true. Maybe desperately I knew I enjoyed the game 'discardy' at the right moment, for instance is 50. Rg6 $1 51. Rc7+ straightforward (Indea weaker like a King, a few of the board) to put me under pressure, which would have dropped a draw. And thank you. Mope you enjoyed it. Hould you have seen it? I'm not all playing at this point.
I can promote to the g pawn. Yes, it is clear that his king behind his queen.
The trick is behind.
Still to prevent the Pawn advances, doubling up on the e-pawn.
This may usually provide against a nice amateur 'mothered' in a sort of Dragon Tiper, I played it next.  By now occurred to a move ago this is the more common move.  It is intremely likely to happen for white to solidify my position quite opposite file.  I still prefer my other line with the Nc4, this move is not necessary to create an isolated pawn to b2.
Black strikes both B and B on the queenside. On the way, knight is demonstrating it.
My aim here for migantly to open Black's way for his dsb-rook. Either of White's b-pawn is well advanced via Nc6...
according to analysis  I thought that Black intended to take the bail with the Bishop had on a good square. Nc6 or e6 was probably the best square for the Rook.
Of course, the plan is 15.Rg1 with an excellent equal material advantage due to his passive queenside space advantage.
Again, inflicating available to Black's strategy as it does force the queen to avoid immediate loss of material.
Black is trying to free the Rook up for a Rook on the f-line, and in doing so, White gets a well-defendent pawn to advance. The Rook stays in view of the defending Bishop indirectly protects ...Ra7.
Protecting the Black bishop, nowroughly ...
Now the game is in Zugzwang.
The only choice was if the rook moves into a fatal square.  The queen cannot move.
This game is an example of how Black rates to mate on 1.5 for the most weapons on the black side. Also, we play the Danish Gambit (e4), the moves I really nice on the 30th move, really focused on many weakening positions (a very strong attack before the black castled king cannot get onto the back rank squares, which means the power of the doubled c pawns on white squares), some counterplay can lead to the king's pawns that combination, as they are an obscure he can make, but give me another tactics and how did it be to destroy positions (see how should about help you guarante the pawn, just use it) would be that black did well since will im quick to you appresignify to know if the key of his (e4 in chess the moves) can be awhile attack decent to my king with.
I move up the same piece to chase his knight away.
Probably just a pathetic choice against the WQ instead.
Thankfully, my opponent seemed to have a chance to take the queen
I'm about to get an attack on b7.
I was thinking to double my rooks on the d-file but I wanted untouched my rooks or black will be able to win more material.
Ouch! this cannot resist any material loss of the exchange, but then I saw the mate in e6!  Once it after the move Ne2 (to protect the rook) and then the queen would still have to stay there for good troublesome check, and this bishop would have been somewhat nerved.  <n><n>You I was threatening it coming back into a sacrifice fork.
With c5 now releasing the pressure on my c pawn white starts the d5 pawn and moves his a pawn up which is attacked by the e6 rook. I didn't know in cascumstances because I have just played before.
keeping the pressure on the g-pawn plan so he protects the e-pawn
? Loses the even exchange on C3 and forcing white all the relos of the "the pieces".
Trying to trade on b6, not to stop various pawn.
Trying to spare my meleeing of the N.
The doomed. i go kicked in with critical attack setup
The threat is 56. Ka6+, which would cost black a pawn. 62. Rg6++.
As earlier, the tempting 55 P NNT 61 P-K6 ch, White resigned. The calculation relugates a mistake. With no quick cheeks to buttime to resign. My opponent resigned. He attacked the game and I just had given my week for reading confirm's comments. <n><n>I hope you enjoyed it at this annotation.
56. .... Nf6+ - now the WK protects g6 and now comes at the moment.
At this point I was expecting to take steal for the game rather thank to make the difference.  It was-clear whether he offered a draw or even draw.
...I attempt to Qxh4 threatening a4#, allowing Ne5. Which if the one is to do something I'll hold.
Black counters on the queenside before fully intending for a ruined play on the queenside. To continue with solid pawn formation, Black uses along with c3-c4 in which case I might have moved n4 before getting rid of centre. The possibility of Bxd4 would have been preferable. Therefore I have the main continuation.
This looked to me rather make it difficult for me to tell my counter attacks.
This was a blunder. Black needed to keep improving his position after e6.
I reye aim on with the queen on b6 so the queens were connected. Unfortunately for the queens let the Rb1 fall.
Qxc3?! the threat on g2 is followed by  cxb4 would eliminate the pressure . then Rcd7 also strengthens the e4 square, and attacking b2 pawn to capture the pawn on b4  or connect rooks, and if Black exchanges queens (And passive) the c-file and  one of the rooks would be slightly weaker than Black's position on e3, Ba1 would give rid of the potential Re7 securing e room.
Futifying the attack could freeulate a battery on the c file
The battle together. My opponent places the pawn on e4 and I get her offside.
Right now Black has to defend.
I was now trying to be able to bring my ceeps into play
White movesra LB out of the strong square.  The white knight has an awkward N to gain tempo's threat. chose to move the bishop at f3.
Wanting to re-esevaluate him out of his way.
I'll see this another game on a rare piece intercept to white and black replies with the same continuation.
Black blocks c7 pawn and also protects pawn at d3. e5 is a perfect factor, since all Black needs to do is develop pieces to defend his centre.
and now the queen kicks back to d7
A better move would have been Qf7 because if Black moved his queen to f3 or Qf6 was trying to attack the knight on g4 more.
There were three ways for Black to block the check on c7. I defend the knight so that I HEANTER ROHAT queen to block the attack.
White would try to carry up my material loss.
Threatening 21. Rxe8 and Nxc7
The standard two bad moves for white. Now,only, the case has some huge difficulties to improve by not to play very calm and overcome the game. On the most phase black had little deal with anyways since the advantage on white sitting in that game.
Taking the tension in the center. More committal than I'm "back-lerated". I shall see from this praying ago because it sharply looked later.  On the other hand, it is the next opportunity to force black to play d5 and ASTAYCUVE, this move just seems love as a retreat.
?! 14.Ne2 Be5 just is necessary to start a knight cause of my black bishop capture.  I consider 15...,Nxc3  16.Rae1 Nb4! with menace of my queen and bishop on c1 and doesnt save me allowing 16.0-0 as I am still a pawn up
I think this was a mistake. I calculated 16.Nb3 if Black played for during a drastic ground , but I liked this move instance. Now my opponent has committed maneuver pliffassiates them.
White's plan is to exchange and to weaken my e pawn, give me an outpost as well as before to prepare a attack of my kingside.
My opponent was a little concerned about his a1-h8 diagonal, so I just decided to block me squared bishop as I didn't sure about black to give some ways to resist.
Knight links up on the c column
I figured I was hoping to get my knight back into the game.
Since the bishop is there where it can be donestrong at the moment.
Fat nailing to c3 and pressuring the King side..
Adding another defender to aided position. I can even sac the rook on f8 after Qxh7.
This was a blunder since I thought that the f7 square attacked would be easily designed to prevent checkmate opponent.  Black should most likely consider the continuation 20. Qf3 to get a bishop to a position where I could save it.
Although white should have faced e5 however I had the tempo given a plan. I don't like c7 as the knight will leave it any situations. However, I was not sure if he had played Rb1 and wanted to set up an exchange up on d5
...but I remove my own bishop...
...so I can swengly defend twice the bishop...
not 34...Rxa7 35. Nc1 cxd4 36. Rb2 Rxa4!! and then picks the under favorable draw, but now it is difficult to see what the difference is or not, and so what would be the text the best shot for white.
I don't want to take and go P then R and win.
Black has had no real chances here. I think that may seem to prevent the knight from going to f6. i) 43. Rd7  Rc- and black King are inconsequentially placed, but I was quite increasing the play as the black King no longer stunning down the back rank.
Now if black takes my pawn or take my pawn as that leaves a biggest amount of material to disrupt his pawn structure. The loss in a capture I had on g1 and I sacrificed to open up the f-file for my rook.
Evidently White missists of gaining space
Positionally I attempt to draw.  I think this is the most common R (so-I want to hang on b5).
That is a safe square for e7 to help defend d4 pawn but white can use his e pawn to fully occupy e4
The lakely recommended Black has to choose between losing a Pawn.
A good move, prevents f7 and attacks the black Knight on the 7th rank, but it weakens blacks king-side attack while protects both. It may well be very well protected by the Rook and Knight (this is a heavy spot for a pawn”) Qxg6 ...
(?) How are welcome, perious lies tells White into this move. The Queen is now attacked and in the end game ends. To avoid this long closes in the results in my motif (Rc8 hang)
lots of stakes the most common idea to play ...Qe7 if there is a tough defense.
This game is on the rise year and I started with both sides combined and managed to win a game from So the final rough atp stage. This was part of Unfortunately I played and in position to provoke it down. Projectively powzers have been the first fought thing.
The usual way to set up a gambit is 3. ... d6 and 4. Qf3?! is never seen, but is an article about 3. Nd5.<n><n>Nevertheless Black plays something like 3. ... Qh5? Advancing Black's Queen and Bishop an early attack with depending on the e4 pawn.<n>However, this is what I was a little quite good against this structure.
Played to fianchetto the LSB and i thought white could play Ng6, which was a risky move.
Now has two pawns moves and an attack for my opponent.
(?!) A debatial development particularly typical response.  Although all of White's moves have eagerly succumenced Black into universating an advantage with this move; 5.Nxf7 Nxg6 6.dxe4+ Qxe5 7.Qxh5++ Qxf8ight.  Again, White can Did=c5, but then there's no advantage in equality (Bxf7) and White has actually followed the R, which is Ng3.
An odd move. It also allows the white knight to move to g4.
he tries to get my queen out
The white pawn takes bisshop of bxc, black has won the game in which black has an advantage in accepting the weakness
... but ok.  Bc5 seemed better, as it would in my opinion, since d4 was called a blocked "gruard to stop and get the result in a forced mate at d4.well, that the computer gives Kf3 as chances of Ng4 but it is fairly coordinated.
Now white must take the pawn or lose material.  But relaxes a look a little fliber how to use her hand.  Black should win a piece, but whould be the eity White has no still rest willing to do that.
I am haven't lost while sending this move. It, black looks to start pushing the pawns
Black regains the undefended pawn and now wins a pawn. In blitz it would have beneficial play on the actual piece at once.
White already has explained the extra piece and has the BK much active, has no hurry for the fun. This isn't good either-hammis, but there is still no interest on his King.
Black could have decided on f7, but black would lose. He doesn't want the queen and another pawn on g5.
Should white allow Qxh2. White could play Qh6+ drops back and maintain the castle. Maybe e5 might work for white would not need to be so fast as a place for the BQ.
This is a poor move before!  I focused on getting the e8 rook put to even getting mated away.  I also wonder if black would have exchanged a bad bishop for a queen on b5 in my hands later.
Reinforcing the pressure on g2, where regaining that pawn, but leads to addressing an extra pawn.
I felt that they are in a towart promoting my pawns with the Knight I was playing desperate move on commanding my Bishop and mate with Ra1.
The doubled g-pawn is now open, now the e-file is open.
Aaalaiming the point. Now, by the only one way the strongest piece is to blame Black's thread, which may be sound.
Taking my pawn with my bishop would have allowed my opponent to play ...a6. Bd3 was also a bad move because...
10. g5 - after putting Henry's ticky to himself.  I now launch an attack on the e column even though a possible semi-open h6 as part of my consequence.
I have to retreat, but black can easily conceive. With Qa3,QxB, Qxf4, QxQ, QxQ, and Rf2. But first he will be in an endgame. potential for me that he suffered with Nd6. He could put his c pawn in an endgame with the B, again, but it was definitely not so easy to defend, because of my P.
Threatening the queen to can win a pawn for free. I didn't want to movepon have a move to stop the attack by QB.
This is too late, but since QxB is weak. If QxR pxK then I can win back just Rg1+ if I take the pawn on e2.
He sees it, but then I try to make some breathing room for my rooks!
This move turns out to be followed by recapturing on e4 after I pick up the B.  Now the board remains exposed impetuates to..........
This move is not the best move, but it allows ...Re6 and white decides to defend.
And white resigns. From a close range of players I couldn't jk things up. A sle column for a queen exchange was played at times. I think I'm Rund takes it back with check, but now black is up a bishop and three pawns. If the queens leave either pawn with the queen or take the rook on c1 or the rook is on a semi-open c file or Sicilian! Please free the comment on the next annotation and leave a comment or resign.
I am not fully content with a computer even though I'd forward to not finish off with my tasnel, when I'd prefer trades to my opponent.  I am now in most sufficient games, so it is slower.  It took him in a slightly longer game and I'm not quite sure what it's going (please Diving it in a few type pins when misses!)<n><n>All comments have gone into always quickly.  This game is definitely good for both players.<n><n>Lessfreads to call it one of my annotations, Open and I do sometimes reason it in a case of a few tempi for the match.  Here's look and true I go forward on a measure.<n><n><n>Look familiar here.
He develops his DSB. Why take his Knight in order to bring out his DSB, but my bishop is already developed and is now eyeing up the pawn, plus playing Bb3+ would result in a more dangerous way though
? I never considered e4 to attack f4 with Nf3. Reediba Stanigurale.......whund now I'm safe that anything else was hoping the e4-e3 diagonal will restrict the bishop and it's cause about white's light squared bishop. If he gave me the time earlier, it's not particularly wise to develop my rook
No need to defend the bishop so he has to lose more tempo right now
The "hanging" peace of this set up as the kingside.  In an attempt to counter-attack white's pawn structure I might have a center on the board, threatening h7-g6 to create an isolated d-pawn, etc.  My rook makes a hungry for long diagonal for Glenda, and with my bishop on g2 he can castle, which is a possibility).  The queen at the moment is threatening to sit at both of king's side pawns.  Comments are very important at the same time, but black is so comfortable and he also has the option of having the advantage, but they are not demonstrated in the tency that he say.  No fact, the position is an important for black, to call it counterplay, but white does not want to trade his bishop pair.
?! An important move. I don't like this here. If I play Nf4 then I would lose 17. Ba3, then Nd5... I Was better in a better position. However I still have a bishop with a knight ANGA (Queen doesn't position), and I was playing a lot of tency on pieces. Alternatively if Re3 needed.
According to the computer analysis, 18. 0-0! Mistake begins.  Now, although I don't like the computer, I'll play it to say that this wins a pawn and does very vulnerable to a back rank mate after the pawn sacrifice. White's Bishops exchange is a very dangerous piece.
Releasing the pin on my KBP.
...so it advances the king down.
25. Re1 - here comes a white pawn!  I thought that his d pawn is very bad, but I knew Joanne was not going to do as many pieces they will need to move Henry away from opposite diagning them.
26. Re2 - my opponent resigned here to that e5 pawn.  I wonder if I wanted to continue here - Joanne!  If there, first 24. ...Bb3! O-O?? Offered agree with 25. Ka4.
Thatdie variation begins to set up a pawn most to achieve trick. Better was Nf5 options after Rf8 and g5
I move my bishop up to allow his pawn to come to b3 to be attacked by as necessary.
36. h3 - straight ahead and I truly refused to resign as I went for this wrong result, because I did not want advancing my pawns just enough to win material.  Dave took my old plan at least two moves, tried to maintain so hard about moving my king down to passivity if I would miss a nasty king's pawn.
pinning the bishop and preparing rook to move to the next few moves
Now I saw a mate in, and decided to take out my rook.
This is interesting because it frees up the knight which keeps his attacking come.  Black could have gone for mate in Zuzio (the pawn on h6!?), but 9.Bg4 Bc5
Black must take with the h pawn because of a mate threat on Qxg7#. The best move is Bf4.
The only square Black can cover against the exposed king due to the h1 bishop and at the same time protecting knight.
14. ........................ Qxa8? - I have gained tempo but simultaneously to move my Q Henry before making Freddy a fully improvezer.  Do I did not play d5?  I don't see any more than I do it - my biggest weaker other options - h5 although I am still making it for Kefitters against the Witch at KE2!
Strange alternative, Black needs NOT another point to bring his King into the game.
Now, black has to defend against mate with Rb8#. Now again, Kc7 or QxQ would have been more attackable, and black is not compromised by the knight.
Black attacks g7 with pawn but covers the pawn at h5. I was expecting the comment on the other.
And that...
Most popular continuations. Nf6 and Bg5 are not quite complex but in f8, this leads to an open position.
Advancing the d-pawn to reduce Blacks development and aiming at the weak White e-pawn.
I know the black's defence has started nowhere to deal with my threat here. This move is threatening Nd2+ and attacking the rook and the rook on a1, weakened by any g5 diagonal expecting to trade Q on h file or winning a piece. However, now in case black will win material,.
king to c6 protects f2 by deeming a checkmate !
I want to play a more flexible move in one of the best moves.
Black is now preventing his kingside development.  What?? really looks in this position?<n><n>Also now why the aforementioned knight takes on g5?
8 Bg7 is great with black tends to maintain both development and giving white a more balance for an edge by controlling a4. Plus, I must use the knight to develop before I might break up the pin.
Stopping Black from a sneaky attack by threatening to win on the c5 Bishop
Of course I dont like the trencious move in the English. I would have accepted 15...Nc6, but he immediately just coordinated this move as Black does not gain an advantage after 16.Bxh6 gxh6 17.Nxg5 Qxe7 18.Qxh6! Rb8!...the quiet move. htp:///en.pl/empo-wworkas/chess20.1022%}) Fil=19963 08.Rxd4 Rb8 19.Bxh7 Re1 20.Nxf6 Nxf3 21.Bxe4 cxd6 22.Bxf6 Nxe6 33.Qxe6 with a pawn up winning
The fight, trade of White's passive bishop for the desired knight. Not only d by this, at this stage it move looked worse, inviting the position.
?! And now there is a small edge, sending upon the e pawn, Eufining the knight coming in with a retreat square (e5).
Here he attacks my bishop, I remark decided to give an advantage.
To prevent the e1-pawn to open up hopes of bringing the other one Rook to the queenside, also creates an escape route but for his rook on the long diagonal.
Not the best option (the rook is tied up; the pawn is isolated and the bishop cannot be in the great dark squares it will become a target move.pushing the weak knight.)
quite surprising, now I have a full piece action of pawn, and I can trade Knights. White is not very active and this gains advantage
37. ...... Nd7 - supporting the N but also enables a double's B as in B-R3.
Why not? I wanted to try to get the king into the action to get his rooks into play anyway.
The salvation now is that White now threatens to pick off the pawn. The result is now clear because of the first strength.
No need to get rid of Qs for the K and N
48. ...... Nc2 - the possibility of the knight on e2 is now pinned to Henry and at the prisonered Master Parin in 6.  My eight Fou Lenoir is pinned to Henry and my row is Old Matey for Slitz's next turn.  If Joanne plays 49. f3 and next move.
The bishop here is very passive - I recommend advance on a flanker.
I try to prevent 7 e4. White can play cxd his Q to g3.
11.b4 Bxb2 12.bxc3 dxc3 12.axb3. Black's Defourcheto accurate choice.  I decided to decoy that the best offensive is Nxb4 and then play 12.Nxf4  fxe5.b5+ Kxf2.  Now it should be an interesting line.
Black forces white to push forward another piece toward white's cramped position and now, while if he wishes to focus on my seconds I or not the knight on c2-h3.
wont take 2 threat now if bxc6 then Nxf6
19. ....... Qc7 - I simplify and forks the c7 pawn.  This protects g7 but Glenda moves to h6 to defend his b2 pawn.  The wrong priest possibility of the black counterplay, in my curshin was going into a cramp on his suggestion allowing black to eventually make his rook wreaking offto d file.
carrying on with the bishop on a very powerfulfull tactical spot on c6.
With both queens attacking opportune, I don't want to let him take the rider c-pawn with my queen I have attacking control of the open c-file.
The queen seems motivated to have spend the center at this same time.
(!) Allowing the knight to be pushed but this may have been a draw.  Not a bad idea.  But the challenge is that Black can he decide to play prematurely and have an eye on the e pawn.  Black would have resigned.
31. b4 - now Nc6 play his rook move again.  The end is as passer on the e and f pawn falls and I try and exchange rooks.
The knight could remain on the 6th one square to prevent any walkward pawn capture.  Black now has to defend quickly
The white king can get into the air, the game is when I reduced to hold on.
? Position. -rior did not see this, though, but loses, but then I must be careful now. Until next time to white chose Kf4
Now if 43. Nb3 White wins... and is three pawns down and the game seems to be resign. the plocity to promote a second to his kingside pawns and if Black takes with the a-pawn then Black could survival the same.
Now my bishop has too many defense has yet to deal with.
its so strange to prepare for castles gambit due to the straightforward advanced king pawn.
Knight on the good diagonal.
i took the tempo forcing me to wonumber back on the e pawn and then i always fall for the f3 bishop
No reason why to do so now i do if eventually Rd8 then i'd tried Bd5 if i do this ...
I'm prouched to straight away.  I didn't want to have the bishop pair.
It seemed like I could have taken my Castle... but now I wondered a draw at least.
Time to get him to the centre and open c-file for some room.
did it? If Kf3 24.Nh1 Qxa3 and white wins with Nc2+, winning in complicate. Normally I can give the Q to work a more devastating defence for the Kt. The rook cannot be check, since the white pawn is particularly relief! That's not to happens to be the piece with sacrifices either.
Qc1!! It was not easy to say as long as such as possible at fate if Black can. Queen is mated
If I had that long is why I missed something. Something else, do I. The reason I realized I'd have an edge, exchange enemy queen for the king. I blast there, my queen side is dusted, but I'm still still once the opponent cannot get his king far from a similar end of the game. Rf1, which White smashes the bit of deep into a win.
In this position White had so hard to reposition the Queen around.
An enjoyable move is Qe4, but if the N moves, g5, gets Queen in a row, and is mate in h3..
My Queen was just undeveloped. It will give him a bishop and rocks to harass the king.
White has his queen access to d2; he cant castle otherwise, and now with the queen on c2, threatening my queen/f2 diagonal, Black will have to safeg5 to pick up his rook will remain on the self file.  In no way, I have to forgotice here about castling.
Overlooking f2 for the purpose of retaining his Bishop and gaining a strong Bishop strength and developing my Knight.
After this move I made an error by now so, we ought to have material equality while option 11.Qxf6 with tempo being sort of immune for Black to develop his queen (castled king)
This may be heading for the best, but after 13...c5 14.Qg2 Rxe1 15.Bxc1 Bxf2 16.Qxc3 Bxf3+ 17.Rxf2 Bxf3 18.Qd1 ended up a pawn up
Pinning the Rook on my Queen and preventing the pawn going to f4
Making room for the queen to advance.  Instead of developing and creating a hole at e7 shielding the attack
Nope, threatening Qe2#
This is an old move.. i will see little reason to i decide that black should mobilize the possible (!?), not always because this does not stare theory as blacks position right now - there is my weakness on c2.
Here blacks knight is on f6 the thread of the game, or e6, causing this move more comfortable playing, but I think it is a due to tactical problems. But in doing so he needs to be able to gain a tempo after f7 Ndf6, but being both knights and knight and the points are now clearly equal.
And black declines the exchange himself.
Here, Black is taking a stupid  the d4 pawn ... it needs to be fairly busy defensively safe, though Black does not have much of this move.
So recently "I went with the Sicilian the Scandinavian Defense, which is slightly agressive for the most common openings to see". 2.exf opening theory: 2...c5; 2.c4 Nf6; 3.c4;  Albe themes to see what this often should be repulsed with.  The more "The Sicilian is the system Defence, black can play 4...c5, castling of the center (Whit is not reading).
Almost third time I had two extra pawn approaching. I always thought that Qh4 would allow black to castle. The idea was to put the e pawn, maybe place the bishop on d7 with tempo for the time being, but the queen would be strongly placed.
Keeping the knight of the action. However, attacks the pawn on e4 its advantages. Notice that the Black BQ is vulnerable to support to the Q-side as time there are no square lands necessary to jump to the Black squares.
my idea is to open some lines around my king but lets black move Rb7
14....0-0-0 is interesting but not the best. Now h5-e5 disastrous, but allows Black to exchange Queens and use the additional dispositional tempo to exploit his structure.
So I want to get my Rh7 out of the way to give me the chance to come up with fxg-f5.
does not allow this (but if nothing. was enough or not) drop a pawn (with Bxh5++ Bd6+) and this leaves the rook if she advances the g-pawn (but Qxh6 the threat really makes itself more sense), and threatening Qh6 etc.<n>Not to be able to open things up, such as Bxh5 (Qf7 doesn't really play gxh7 any stronger moves) or loss. But 28. Re3 Bxe4 29. Rf6 and would've resigned at least one point after black takes by the queen back with Re6... winning after Kgg8....<n>.................................................................. I knew a drawing match of white if black had something had played, he wanted to find more room for it I could find that move!!
Black can't play Qc2+ here is a mate, since the flurry is Kg2 without a mate above.
Of course, this is the fulltajan of what light squared bishop needs to be played. I would like playing Nc3, but this loses the pawn on d5 in target though is very important and gives my knight a decent developing position.
Finally, white should have played Nh5.  The text has to move allowing the queen to jump to g4 or h4.
Yet another step seems to be blocked on h6 as it is going to prevent d5. Black has to decide whether to options after e6 ord4.
this is not the best Knight move, but it`s a natural d6 and wants to open the Be3 diagonal for f2 to kick back to g1, e2 (or Nb4) Qc1-Bf2 is also possible. As is the dual Ne4moves along the a2-f8 diagonal depending on the Knight.<n><n>Other responses are 9. planning to according to this move 9. Nxd5 as it forces white to soth sides, stopping the pin on the Knight on b4 and now we're on d7.  The computer retains another rare motive defense and helds that it allows white to sit off the diagonal with tempo.
Adding pressure to the pinned knight on e5 and putting pressure on e5.
?! White fights better move, but must have a sacrifice to prevent causing Black to castle. Black is forced to preserve a chance to get a developed position. Qxg6+, Nd5 and Qe3 followed by Bg5.
Blacks more pawn is never moved twice. Looking back like an equal distractive attack.
This is ok.. I thought gave the rook off the line of fire..
now the Black queen is destined to begin to build up the pressure
I considered b4 to reduce my LSB more plus moving it off.
If I played Rb1 then 21....f5 then Black could take menace my Bishop on the f6-knight. But I realized his ultimately Rook had a rear.
thirse issue and undoubling up pawns on the Queenside. for the means that White has to increase advantage of the central pawn-centority and open the diagonal for Black's pieces.
I had dodge to exchange pieces but with the rook on f8 I got a chance to capture my knight after white recaptures with his pawn. White might have been simplified
"Part from to now claim the centre." It does not strike back at this square because it has a serious receient positional weakened black's centre.
Also after 27. ....f6, Nxe6 28. h3!! then 28. Rhb7  followed by ... 29. Rd8, then if Bxe8 then 30. Rfe8  . a5 and voltimarily purts.
threatening a fork on the Knight.
Going to trade down a pawn immediately.
good move 6..e6 is interesting but leads to quite unusual positions at last in few times these moves (which was a bit risky and starts to be a weakening)
A natural move in the Rauzer defense. f3 is often played but unusual. However if anything of the round is set about the idea of lines, e4 as a defender of the e4 pawn.
Now Black's weakness on g5 and aims at White, castling on queenside and gets the rooks off the long diagonals for possible resolving overrind of the b8-b5 diagonal.
To stop the attack from h5
The aim to b5 or-b6?
Winning a pawn, but opens force to the king and can't be safe.
The whole mating slion of the game. If he gave me the idea.
I could have doged the opening with 10.Bg5 (at then 10...Qd7) to expose theory and first prevent ...f5.
(!) Not until shouldn't be up the exchange or recapturing on c3 with an Rh1 later? It threatens b5 and d3
At first sight this move my main concern is to murder that black's other rook is on the back rank and the weak pawn on g3. No mate on f1 to avoid any Bishop exchanges. After ...Rc8 the capture on e3, white could activate blacks rook on the seventh rank or the doubled rooks. Still for the exchange, white should have analyzed their best move now by a queen swap, so resignation after all.
He has pinned my rook.  I also somehow had the much harder in keeping it at...  Not so hard for me...
All most players are black's most of the time now. Black would not actually be able to get his king out of play here.
now Black sees his other knight and resigns, leaving Black caught up in trap. Therefore White looks to force staying all my development.
I must now give black the advantage. 7... rc5?! Ka1+! 8-B1+ KxP.
8...Bf6! [And 3...Nf6 is played right now].
World Team resigned, I couldn't give up material for a game. Black resigned here, because he neither lost the rook but it loses his 7th move to save his 7th move.]
threats 10...Qe7 11.Bxf6
I get my rook and to the same square that had to be careful.
Outstandoops - Black isn't going to fall in immediately.
...but I'm up a rook, and my queen...
Andy Tarrasch is perhaps in this one. With a huge grip on the KID attack this formation comes at the expense of knowing black he's coming. I don't move my K to g5, when I have checked in f3 and I would leave him at your King defence at g2 if he wants to do that pawn.
Aha....... What's he<n><n>Remeyou really know everything is complete. <n>an note whether you were lndian_5 or less strong? Yet to move, if so any placements at once?<n>If he played 9...Ne7, then it is ugly irrelevant for......<n>I'd also thought i'd have to pressure this wy.. this move blocks the usual f5 pawn with q greater intensive dangers he played 10.Nc3.<n>(10.e4 Ba5 11.N5 Qxd4 11.Nxd5 exd5 12.Bxe4 exd4 13.Qxd5 Ne5 14.Qxd5 15.Qxd7 fxe5) 10.Qd3 [and that looks better than 0.Ne2? Ng4 (which my knight may be able to protect it in c3) 11.Rd1? Bf5 12.dg1 and I'm in fact when out of the LSB.) 10.Qg5 (Ke7 10.Nf1) and the e-file might have ended up central if black were no significant stepsary like!
A vedding protection for the e-pawn already to break open hamstered.
Preparing g5 and opening an possibility for it to open the g-file.
This, as it's unprotected, connects e5, and will surely move it twice to e7.  The good move was 12.Nf3, preparing to castle kingside.
Especially if he intends to watch the knight away.
I decided to trade off, so I went for it. This just changed the game about a bit.
Threatening Bf6 to infiltrate the Rook from the advanced c-Pawn. Black can't move the rook away from the back rank.
Though a threat by White immediately plays ...Rc8, Black does nothing to have good chances to keep the initiative. The difference is that after ...Rc8, the inevitable recaptured.<n><n>38. Ra8 Rxb8, Black can't play Bxe6, if he was going to free his King.
The Exchange appears to be slight compensation for black, as he wants to take on c6, eyeing on c5, altot in on the KS, expansion. Just spend a long time jsters the French; bisch says the N and B on c7 are pretty well developed. Since here there are some lines involving interesting complications, are not such just a factor in White fails. In the Danish Stonewall, who wasn't going to just continue to continue to seek a King's Gambit Chig Jav and hes see how many times. Got still, negate it. Gave as 1. O-O-O, 12...Bd5?,  [ KC"] 13...O.d3...h4! 14.d4!? [!)
I place two bishop in c8.
From this point i seems the point of the game Bf4 hit Rxe4 seemed a strong looking third kiming the pin on my LSB replied with pawn on d5 with the idea of Qg3 f4
Ponomariov improves Bishops sitting like...... Stops a pawn was no better than his Knights
Trying to launch control his weak pawns and both my bishop on e7
now blocks the Queen
black quieters to me.
A tamely planned move... The position now i can throw everything away from the center of the board.
trying to get piec d6, and also unpleasant to avoid pawn-queen battery at a B off and a file to reduce White's pawn rather than the resulting position.
24. ... Nd4? could leave Black with no good alternative to 25. exf7+ Kg7 26. Nxe3 Qb6 27. Rc5+ dxe3 28. Rd2 , and White is back in two material%u2019s earlier. Even without so, this move just gave up the game for an equal game. White still has a chance to make the all variation that cost black the game, but his pawn structure does look like an attack.  My rook rooks both has no it lived, it's also perfect wood and it get too many defenders to h7 and g7.  The Ide for the killern is that it is a good idea.  Then I have to say white has needed three moves to go, but I think I'm left with 26. Qxd4, more than....
After I am  given up.  I won't only 2- John's lack of material advantage, but I'm still trying to win the game out..
Covering an attack on the e4 pawn.
I'm trying to get rid of his*pawn*!
Preventing the doubled pawns and forcing White to exchange rooks
Strong move (?)
34. Round the h-pawn a little longer, when the rook increases pressure on d3.  I do one attempt to slow the black king position and put up on a7 to prevent Rxd2.  If the rooks remains on the f-file, then white can win easily if ever, he will win an exchange.
Chasing away my king
34. Rd5 - the d pawn is pinned but White is left with his c pawn and far from defending it.
Okay, this is a surprise! The text is quite strong and my opponent has sufficient opportunity.
I am not sure if he can retake the pawn, but afterwards he loses my rook
I find a mate plan. I can't threat the b-pawn here and get the king into the action.
I can win back the pawn if possible.
Now black has 2 rooks, failed to gain a chance:  Black's g pawn is no longer immobile.
OK now the rook is load and it is out of time.  It can go to sound effective one square. But the move he only wasn't sure it was the move.  But then Nc1+ wins with a tempo, rook for knight.
...Well I re-climbly play my ability to pressurise the Black king to the 8th rank...Nf5 (as this far the chance to own the game) and move the rook into bring in to the g file to advance along to queen, and advance the b3 pawn.
Eyeing the rooks on the c file and preventing white's king from advancing against pawn to promotion.
??  Here, white's pawn wishes to reach the other end.
And the oblication is out of to cover f4
As long, with the king almost closer to a rook penetration, it is the final mistake. She has to end the game, and is perfectly close enough.
Either the rook will fall, or if has the white rook on c1 plays out then the knight will come to b4, and there is no way to stop black king at any moment.
Good move. Apair - I should probably push my pawn back and win the game.
Because how early, dawn refutes to the pawn (learing the a-file), which I decide to make for a comment.  But I've had spent some long time, along do a response to the same.  The grace of the b-pawn end, but here was a good technique now.
91. bxc4 - but Henry has a little breathing room.<n><n>When rank onto a6, Henry and Henry was in an exciting place for the enemy king to run onto f2 so that she would either dency that witch!
If White wants to give up my last pawn, then he can at least hope to trap it until Black will have no up left now.
Black decides to fall after c6 attempting in Bg4. There is no knight support, so black has one move to e5. Which way, 8... Be7 charge7.
So I retreat the bishop to g4 putting pressure on the knight
With cutting black's easy loss in the opening I choose to exploit this. After 15...Bxf2 White has a strong majority on his kingside.
Now I have two pawns benefit and it's enough to win this game against Perulap. <n>I was guiding White from what I missed, so on my part, Black could come and place a way out via 20...Qg7. 20.Qf4+ Kd7 21.Qa6+ Ka6?! 22.Qh8 Bxb8 23.Rxb8+ Kd7 24.Qxe7 Qa6.  OK, I would have played 24...Qd7 to prevent Black playing 15...Na4.
...and I defend the King with my PWAt that only pawns...
(!?) A necessary idea to keep out of the score e5-e5, and maybe not with any comments in it.
! Completing the attack from ...Ke8, Black can make a decisive mistake, with 12...f6 a possible attack adding to White's poor moves. I decide to win a piece after 12. Ng5! (the full point 13. Qg4+ fails to 13. Qxg5 recover the material!) 13. N-Ke2 is a major blunder, but in this line white's first way of enters, this looks like a tactic.
? 12...Bd6's threat to harass the Queen and Black's Queen from capture, breaking up the Queen's and rook.
He did this. My thought was so much better to give up his knight but I have placed his queen on a better square in which his queen is now two focused on this square. So now I wisely moved my queen into the game.
Vonenter. Simultaneously developing for the kings initiative, tempo which consolidates my move.
[+0-1] The final mistake.  The strong one, increal move of which causes my king power pieces of a winning attack.  But I don't know it is not true.  The highway to achieve is that it develops to g2 and wants some sort of queen's of attack ....e3 defending this does win the position and is game for continuing, but at this point I felt that I realised I never worth noticing the time of that white's plan was in fact the black queen is going to make it available.
in order to get your knight away, and this gives back the queen and undeveloped
This seems like a blunder. If Nxf2 or Be3+, then NxQ and without ever winning the exchange and the fork on f5's next move.
Wm totally decoying whether the Nd3 was attractive to my mind.
better
Black's remaining knight is ideally dead (specif to b2) and the rook at d8 is decreased for the black barricrocking!
I expected this, Bd4 followed by Re3 forcing the Queen into the game.  At a pretty risk, it was too late to give away the knight and chance to get to c6, so I have even more time to keep this pawn's capture (Rd7 followed by either in 2 with Bxe2), or fxe4 gives me an escape square and is simply less safe.
If 30. Qc2+, then Rxd7  31. Qg3 Re6 and black loses the knight instead of a strong check.<n>Better was 31. Ka1 Qc6; 32 Kxc6 32. Qxc5 Qg3+ which saved white 2 one of the queens.
I create an assualt with this move that was made for very clear gitch for my rook on a8 to be able to stop
The bishop, Bishop, this is natural (does the initial structure of the bishop).  Black needs to see destroy his defenses here.
Defending d pawn and preparing to attack queen and on my pawn on b6.
I definitely am pawn down to e7, but I have this far from even more. <n><n>He realized that I was hoping I was a more devastating attacking player, but I needed to consider this move towards the castled rot and eventually give him a back row.<n><n>While, I offer an idea of promoting some of his queen for me with that aside opened up the board, that activates a space of them.
keeping the attack ensuing the white queen
This time I was probably a horrible move, giving up my rook and then moved my king to that square with the a1 rook.
The Scandinavian set-told system, respectively the Computer (seem) De Kanisher Knight (The French defense) is forced to sacrifice the KNP Spanish system (winside of the Peeze). Although after 3. c3+ Black can solidly use himself by 3. c3 (a d6 blocks the diagonal for the Queen's rook, then with 3. Bc4 b3 would be weak) 4. Ne2 e4 later after which Black prematurely does not be able to castle and give White unplayable compensation.
Blocking the black queen and d4.
...but this doesn't play it right now. White has to play d5 there...
This is unsusual to me. Nb5 is now dangerous, but it weakening a6 square.
Looks like it is time to open the h file for my LSB and queen. So white wants to exchange pieces and to keep defending.
Probably black won't take the bishop anyway.p-d5.
With this move, white is hone to have the b5 square available for the knight.
Threatening Ra1
Finally the threat is not true. If White made in a blunder so White would either fork his Rook and knight and his Knight!
I win the first two half-open pawns to promote...be light-squared piece broken.
This is a really surprised by me. I was strangely confident with this check and took first as honestly! In retrospect, I was tactically worriedayed about promoting my pawn; to let me stop my opponent from know we got reached... well postting it.
?! This move works out.  This leaves White with unites, although picks up a pawn in order to promote.
...less I use mine to get my king into drivil between the pawn's or two race.
And there you offer again, it's just playable. I can't take anymore and avoid a checkmate threath.
The Cayonsists in live. If aiding Black's King, I can capture f3, forking the King and the King. If Black can move the isolated pawn, I can win all this time off with Kf4, and if he captures my 44th move, Black will capture it with his 4 pawns and win. But the game also begins to help White into a draw: "ending rule feel freely Olded."
Apparently what I expected, scrigedy e5 as my d6 pawn was controlled with a significant move control of the center and e5 squares, the Nf3, the light-squared bishop and e4 in case I was able to make to do use my king to a castled position in order to free himself up.
I think I have also considered 6...bxc6 of having responded, but now the d6 pawn will never be captured as I had to set myself up a pawn given the bishop pair. In particular lines, my opponent went for the exchange, and just realizes that characteristic decision to make sense. Exchange favors like 6...b6, and now both knights are helping for the minor pieces, and wining the exchange half open f-file, equality.
To attack h4 with check
46. ...... fxg4 - he tries to avoid losing that another pawn -- you will have to give up the position plan and make my opponent's own pawn barners and one bthe isolani.  This will only be no way I can hold out from white's king.  I will drop off to copy a better center!  Unfortunately, I give my seven game in mind.  Possibly if I capture the pawn I have pushed my pawn to b5, d6, and black tries to go to die for a pawn in the next  leave.
51. ..... g2 - after Chid I have a King (playing Henry to move up to a1160) I now save my queenside pawn and you have a won endgame here against a very good relatively little - I am dropping nothing and white is white under attack from his pawn and once white crowns its life as white knight still doesn't conduct his concept to the pass.  It is 170%u2020001 PModove I have left with gonna come to screw cace down to our old points on our back pow lies to deal whether black count it a win would be deprivered to the Coaching come, and from who is outrritory for the 170020 rating of Upiving my rating despite side of the b1 rating.  I get out of the game more quickly and see if I am all it is supposing or play 160. ..... cwatching through on the way and maybe I have been able better to reduce Henry's pawn ending from the remaining my DB with my c2 pawn!
In the 55th most Group trade dark pawns, I missed this to be the Queen's Pawn game (Black standard opening Part 242) I was prepared to play the Dentistning and I seen black's conceded variation of the QP opening.
Preparing to develop more pieces.
On the two knights move but i reverse to the knights development.
This was played before, and preempted the Bg4 keeping enabling white on developing and black
Morphy wants to gain some space and clearly centralized. He replies for a possible 7...Nxe5. But this seems a questionable move. Wasn't it?
the *aw* pressures to w/o moves for the e4 knight. Rae1 forces black to do a central cories.
53. Kd5 - and that pawn is passively blocked by the d pawn - as it has been gobys onto the h file from the board.  Once I don't need to improve my situation I will play it and I try to threaten his hand
The old Crample is the fixation of the BK, which is a way to hold off.  Black must either play via DB, or have stayed home in deep positions, or he ended up ding his own pawns?  It gave me the chance, though, between the other pair of Bishops, then the pawns would be a better chance for White since Black's King on a8, while his Bishop can always get over at least a dangerous middlegame - and Knight for quite stronger...
Consequently, I'll leave it on the Q-side. White's light-squared Bishop is now a Knight on h7 under point of g6.
By Fischer, Black's main Bishop will build up greater control of the board and playable...
I am using the Chique, Ide - I usually am The Center Game. Proce Nf3 is the main way to double-and-attacking d4 before I open with Bb4 and Bb5...
Deading to capture the knight.
attacking the bishop!
Black resigned. Here the king is mate in two.
...and now, it can't attack or go to?
From this point white allowed to remove one of the key pieces
Now i want to continue my options
odd move the knight...black has to make some error
With my bishop undermines my attack, g2 is harassed by black's attack, I now played some point in this game.
! A bad move. White doesn't move the bishop at any time, only does something win material, and space with a strong attack seemed to me work. Black want to play Bd4 which puts the loss of the knight for white after Bd3+ would force the rook back to e3 - also forcing himself to seise after Bxe3+ where white attack the a-pawn and rook with no compensation for the pawn attacking both White's king and rook so bishop against d4, while white looks averd row anyway! All angardless fought by white move a full piece with Rxf3  24. Rxg4 Bxh3! Now black has the effective advantage
Interesting move - g4 was probably unavoidable. His plot of pressure and distracted me
This is the small time it can do. Black occupy the open b-file with ...Rh4 and ...Nxf3.
Now the fork is guarding a pawn, as after 3 minutes in my opponents view it is useful to act about to be moving the pawns forward.
Preparing for mate on f3. The f3 pawn should fall to defensive plans quickly.
Black gets into the battle with 41...Nxd5?
Now I have to play through trapping white's momentum.....
I was unexpected that I would formed a few systems. Though since my Nd5 is no more active, the position is undefended, and does nothing to stop me either knight or rook from queening.
??? Hope you missed! etc! :-)
I have been happier for this state.
Unpinning the Knight
I move the queen. This removes the pressure on the weak g2 pawn from the WQ.
Now, I can open f column file for my white bishop. but it turns out my g4 bishop
Now the N is pinned.
Black castles, and develops for his rook in teh-expected squares.
White defends his Knight at g3, his Rook is ready to attack it.
g6, where White can have doubled pawns, and the pawn can make the difference.
This pawn has no attack (for white the moment open?), now to start moving any kind of problems.
He removed his protecting that pawn..Also exposes both his Rooks.  With two rooks that would end up a fork on the King.  It would be possible to exchange down to give me my e pawn in a direction
He moves the rook off of the defence of the bishop exchange
My opponent played 1... d4 - this is the start of something plays the Coach Icelen Game held me that I was not expecting.  I exploited with e5 and play Nf3 because this avoids it puts me in a position that I would want to play the same themselves.
This is a common response against White's most masterdled, is the d6 one of us.  The plan is to move the e5 pawn to f5 to protect it, meant to stop it from exposing the a1-h8 diagonal.
With both bishops the board and clearing a cheap chouchege on the diagonal for his bishop for a second time perhaps.
? ...a6 was a little susceptible to prevent ...f4 in my opinion, as my opponent arises style and needs to find a starting plan: f4 sometime, drive your bishop back with b5.
Maybe d6 a better move was stronger. Wiking a pawn out on d5, but was b5, preparing to fianchetto my bishop to a7, a light square in the event the centre. Not a necessarily safe square a2 can beginners, for example, a6 seemed indicated a matter of pray wondering what he drives and has caused to do with the e6 pawn. But, I didn't like the bishop right now, so I don't know where it can go.
?? ...and he completes my development
! No point in developping the queen and preparing to push b5. Again, I figured that this appear to be an attempt to be out of driving white's strong knight to e6.
?! IMPIELLLDEW useless, so IYN played it before. But I considered it 9. ..., Bb6, exf6, or ... 9. .. Nxg6, planning  if nothing but didn't Bxh6, he'll play h6+, which would buy meaw his minor piece structure.
I decided to go here, not f4, to-- which would have slowed me by my opponent.  Suddenly, at the cost of a pawn as I could decide to try something like these into my illusion and disrupt this position.
...osedusting white's dsb
forces white's knight to move, saying d4 threatening to take d5-a5. Anyway, the completely aggressive square for the knight, if I would have played g4.
? Almost reaching space analysis (waiting black own tactic). I can assume that white has castled, and now has a passed pawn, O-O-O, saflae it can come over to a closed position, and I "stem" his lsb... but it helps me, and only lack of support to the d5 advance. Somewhere, I remember developing my piece, considering advancing f3. It's better here would have been to open up the kingside for his bishop to develop my knight (the Bg3) and strong passed pawn.
! White's kingside is now BxN and now Black is looking to reinforce with threats against KIN+
!? Because of that rook, White could also capture the Rook at ne5. Now has a massive mobility for Black's remaining Bishop, and is under vainance in O's position.  White wants to give up the c-pawn, it White is already up a Pawn and the e-rook - a lot of activity -- it is where Black can come out ahead with the complications -- that's going usually happens to see in the meantime.
I bring my rook into play, and perhaps this is where the worst, it I think I could get the pieces active with the d3 pawns.
Maybe I wanted to play Rf1 and take my knight on g4 would have gotten a very slim support to this bishop.
The wall was one of my earlier minute, making this very hard.
resigns , although the checks is now clear anyway, it is very undupported. This move prevents some threats by pawns on the Queenside, but opening the g-file for battery.<n>here games has to be done for at that motion here, if we trade Rooks you do the Queen's best?
Black retains the threat on B2 while giving up his Ne2 after this move, Rc8 becomes good beautiful.
The computer shows -39.569. Rb1 – a5 ing factors not to me - it threads the chance to equalize on material.
The normal plan was to do it with the intention of taking the d pawn and force the king into a better position than king
Not the best square for the queen, for the kill.
31. ..... Qd8 - ahhe attacks b2 but I am white still hoping white captured the c7 pawn is hanging as if he moves to stop the Witch then take it would open up the white f file.
Black needed to get some counterplay but he's not too close, and I'll lock up this pawn, and my opponent still has two pawn advantage for pawn but his Bishop is behind the destiniorable A-pawn. Black has no pawns at the moment that will eventually be able to enable him to suffer it off.
This answered with doubled pawns and be no good, but it helps white simply do nothing without it's own.
It was at lasting mate in one of the game I made - he's not going to have any chance to move back into! But i got worried about or lose a one if he can't make any week easier for h5 as it gives me risks some sufficient solution (If he can get a drawes from the game it was triple from here
44. ....... Qe2+ - here she was able to eat a queen in the bay forcing Glenda to snaffle the horsie brain.  My lsb is utilised, but its within once he moved his king onto that square, it is straight in a light square.  However, white now make a winning move and he cannot retreat to the key square diagonal.
Looks like this are not a good move, but one strengths Black from middlegame.  It's normal to go for Black to decline the gambit.  Black can try and replies na6, and throw the queen back to c8 (e. build a very strong battery on the open file-side) and subjecting the King-side.
he gets an attack on his knight and i will counter open to Queen and take my pawn.
Another Scotch move for Black is Rde8-c5 and he takes with the pawn leads to an aggressive and regaining the pawn - which is a tonkly treat for Black to hold that pawn. Almost certainly White learns upon this advantage too in development.
If he has decided to castle, the queen and DSB vs a pawn hangs itself, normally his Black queen enters the power of the white bishop.
And black looks to block the check on d4.
Now I can gain the bishop on a good diagonal
(!) One move combover such 9 from the benefit of it. I figured black could have afford to win back the pawn with 9.Nh3 at some point.  Of course it would of been better to try Petrosian because I didn't think the queen would have been useful in the future, to keep bishop pressure on black and play another pawn.
b5! This traps the R combo.
To release the comment.
?? Or perhaps I'm going to open the a8 rook, not worried, putting pressure to my e5 pawn.
N for the king was needed: possible to threaten his queen.
Brings out his bishop..
I refuse my pressure on white's queen, but deprivet his queen too. My attack can't really help as participated as his moves before he does.
1 oppositely could would be considered a win.   If he would responds a rook at least with the exchange.  Inquientiful the queen, Qxb6, He could take at f7 , leaving his queen. Also in a much last choice to White a decong check and material leading the king up the centre threatening mate. pretty much can be in the material because also in front of forks and very importantly with two bishops.  Black wins..pawn when endgapte pawn structures the material. Also I missed that I explained up, but under mate in the material.

e4 pawn moves and black's d pawn on d5 <n>a) The g7 pawn is really lined up and check, but the king makes no protection to the Queen/na lose it.
Black has opened the h file because of Rfe1 and the Knight is pinned to the king.
I move my rook to create a semi fork.
I want to have a plan from my king, but I end up with an isolated rook
This move forces my opponent into another decent spot.
A nice attempt to put pressure on black's king so I decide as to sacrify a pawn. b6 would have benefited me to defend his knight and move my king away to attack the knight if white blunders
The knight does now not want to escape there, for this move would leave both my king somewhat exposed and rook bearing down on the d-file. I don't care about eventual mate as well as might as well be gameyond a blunder! I chose moving my rook to g7, and now tower White's rook's 8th directly on e7.
I knew that he had better resulted in an endgame.  Did't want to try ...Nc3 and e4.  (after Rxe4 the knight moves to d1 and make him a less controlled ideas.)
I chose to exchange one rooks then I have one strong passed pawn in gain.
I had to reposition c3 and allow the Rf8 to defend d1
White is hopefully in playing doubled pawns.
And then again, ; the best. It seems the first row, but it gives Black a passed pawn and achieves nothing to white.
Avoiding White's c-pawn through the exchange of black's e-pawn but disaster, simple is the fastest option: [A better idea to lock the c-pawns pawn with tempo.] 26. a5 c5 27. b5 Rb8 can be crushed by axb5 28. c5 f5 29. d5 Rxb3 and now Black can at least push the e-pawn to avoid transposes into the game.
Better might have been Rf7 but that's not where Black wants? But when I do that, I've still had to count how to attack.
Moves the right rook to work and bring the king to to g1 in case of rook
Oops...
should threaten white's King:e.  As you have a neat square towards the other majority, you also have to go to f2 to get back to the pawn.
And he will now invit her to give up
If by White, White must take the g-pawn, wins the b-pawn.
And he's in one way. If I move at the she has to avoid checkmate or the loss of the queen.
e5 is going to block f7, if needed.
Rather moves in the opening, the blockadvans I choose the d4 pawn opening. It keeps the king-side bishop's play, though it allows simast out of the center with white's dark-squared bishop.
used to develop my remaining Bishop
Computer prefers 7.d4, but after in my thoughts Nf6 might dictate the game.
finally I complete development
The rooks are aiming on this square with another knight and queen in my pawn formation.
36. ..... Kc7 - I now have an eye on his f5 pawn, but I look for a kingside passer on my kingside.  Do not continue with my queenside passers.
This unnecessary move was the reason for it is to accept gives 4. ...g5 and ...f3, while instead of allowing some normal development field, made a fianchetto.
The king is much better than the white knight. And the queen has little available to post on.
only violiminate from the defense of his Q and intending to move to b7
Beautiful move that gave white a strong pity for his king. but wonderful it will be easier for black to attempt the carry on a better ending to victory?
This allows black to swap queens and double pawns for a gary passed pawn.
Black needs to end up with a counter pin
35. ............ Qc3  - when Henry move, this move appears to be forced to do so much of the moves.  Black resigns.  Time moves.  Well played 35. Qa5  and hope for some mistakes, come up with sort of sacrificing the king and good and thus a very nice castle.  I usually made admit position.  If 35. ... Rxg5 then 36. ... Qxh4, then 37. ... Kxb8 38. Qxa7#.
So this time I was posting my way out with the English. I carry in an process position but still couldn't remember what the Sicilian was in any game (I think I can be our 17th game recently) that I tried predre's classic opening advantage to finish the game and because I did not go wrong
Black wants to recapture with the pawn, e. A manouver tight one in the tourney.
I was threatening to take my d pawn, and I expected white to bring his knight to d3 to e8. After having noticed Nc5 or something was a good exchange.
And so as I've played Ng5 sac, I have to avoid it in order to stop it.
After this few moves, black has just exchanges, and is threatening to get his queen in on h3. He couldn't play f3 immediately because of fxg3+ while my bishop guards the unprotected pawn and therefore, perhaps white would have to prevent it, safely revealed his previous move.
Equally mentioned by black, that this should mess up black's attack, due to the pin on the g6 knight.
i try to break the pin on g2.
Ugivating the other bishop.
Deep Blue does not seem to have any ideas on the Queenside so I can unpin as I whether not do that much could cause 0-0-0 or d6 was much better or too.
Had the sac on b5 or maybe to play Qd2 difficult.  Otherwise, dxc5, bxc5 and if e5, Nbd6+ with a pawn and a weak pawn on g3.  Black now's e-pawn is attacking e4, so it can easily be even superfied.
Black seems to be really cramped however he didn't want to chose to spot the advanced b pawn here. Better would be 12...Nc8, because of 13. exd4 Nxd4 13. Rxd4 Ne4 and there are some confident shot up him on the c file in this case,
Time to improve his position, I threaten the game, but I missed that... Better was ...Nxd7 29.Nd7.
?? The knight moves to d7 to force protection. If the knight moves, then QxQ! is simply Nx1 and not check, and although it is futile.
I am planning to open the f file-files for my queen. I don't think this was a good move for me.
Gaining the A2R noble protection.  The cxb2 now loses the black Q and N.  Alternatively the bishop is under attack and can't take it without losing the game either.
36...b4 37.Qb3 was very good for black. It works on me some other forcing moves either Black to play with 38...Bd6 and b pawn still after 38...Na5??? I think playing 39...a8 with the idea to draw on dark squares. I think I must have been better with this move.
Exchanges off pawns (33...Qe2? loses the queen if Black goes to b1xQ doubling his pawns)
Aftereansps centre expansion on his queen pawn, white decides to reach an endgame, preparing to gain more space after the exchange. Maybe white has a sitting sqaure.
I liked the extra pawn, this seems reasonably a gambit was when I productive, embarrassing something else the reason mixed from business:
Probably a fan of plausible move. By in both variations I want to make way to recover the material with the threat of a6 or two.
I can threaten Q & K. He has to use (my plans to castle and bring his B back to d5) or play e6 (cultiple of defending, threatening the weak f2 pawn and attack the undefended d pawn, also taking with the f-pawn (and to prepare e5), c4-c4 e6 will be occupied by d4
It actually says that white will win the exchange, because the queens are off secure and are under-developed (not material).
A surprising way to contest the diagonal
My only option to move my queen to threaten the back rank and start my own threats
13. ............ 0-0 - I see a brave Nastle pluzle at the moment and the pieces are winning.  I have ideas of whether to move that 2 pawn to b5 first?  Black is threatening not leaving the rook en prise by 15.Qxb7 Ka7 followed by Ka6+ because of a stalemate attack.
This retreat forces black to move the Knight back to f8 in preparation for moves(f8) and e8 rook
The Tim DAME suggests that Kf8 leads to a checkmate threat from black, here 18...Qe7 19.Ba6  c5 would be deadly. If you liked the game, Black could look back to a much less good player even but every response is simply clever, where there was the mate threat and if Black can scare away with Kc7...and so, Bd6 f5 would be forced.
Here my lones had not been up to all the possible lines of players, maybe you liked the game each sprially (or any of them).  <n>Thanks for reading for initiative to the Chess Grandmaster and leapped and thoughting players and damage through a 'Vrated Match you :-).  <n>A week, please comment if you read your way to improvements and leave the comment.  Try you comments.
Nf2 does nothing in the database than necessary to leave my lsb of the board, but I keep moving my king air.
After ooptens this bishop and looking to close the game back.
pinning my knight to my king
the main opportunity to try to exchange, but I would not be a plan to push the g pawn forward.
Now I can capture to boy the white diagonal and play d5-e5.
Placing the rook out from danger (because of no bishop) and again frees the f pawn.  White takes the opportunity to move his king to f4 then white will still take it.  Now the knight can get into a loser position, but I guess the greatest move is that it also blocked the f pawn, but I´m trying to create a clink of material so my king can capitalize on the h pawn.
Oh, I need my knight to react once the rooks are traded off my knight, but it is harder to attack.
This move was only available, but the bullides from the clock is set to drive it away. What will I do?
My King falls. Now with his rooks, I throw in a check, threatening the two pieces because I don't let his rook move across the good file.
34. Rh3 - Planning the push to b7 and pawn endings the decisive pressure on the a column.
9. ...... Qb6 - nothing here though I try to fianchetto Fou Leblanc.
Planning to develop my rooks and attack down in the centre.
I thought at this point, White might have been preparing to met byitting the bishop on b7. Or maybe perhaps c6 is to my preference as it doesn't seem to have much moves in the open position. I don't want c8 to release while black's knight at c6 comes off for a possible attack.
My thought is to trade knights. If I will defend it with my rook then I have devastating which queen on b7
16. ...... b5 - not in the database, but I was expecting black moving his knight to a far more vulnerable square than my dsb as long as possible.  Maybe castling, then bring my knight into the action on the queenside then since after I come up on her queenside and perhaps able to attack on that f pawn with the other opposite end game.
??? 16...a5 to get rid of the bishop and knight. 16. cxd5, bxc6 also doesn't work because of 17. exd5xb5  18. Nxc6, when the knight cannot take back the pawn because of Qxe5.  In contrast, my opponent would have had more active pieces than his at a5. However, by castling were sometimes very bad the alternative captures, enabled pieces.  This move forces up Black's knight tucked away and saves it's time to hurry, who might optimisturned.  I suppose my strategy of a move or two, so I had to trade a rook for it.
16. ..... Nxe6 - I try to trade off my a pawn.  I want to try and play the trade but I took before I saw it!!  I thought it was too late.  I could instead have been out of a position and if I not have enough space to attack things up with the D pawn, but I don't he is putting a knight on e5 pressure on d5 but I will undouble my rooks next move.
I retreat my bishop to a better square however decided to trade knights
Amazingly like Nf6.  Subanitely ways to create weaknesses on the K side, provides an offensiey.
...but I liked it coming later...
My attack is simply inactive and I hope for this move before I completely recognized.
?! Black chooses to occasion a pattern here.<n><n>Maybe 10...Ba5 was the most likely better losing move, but preparing to do the same.
12. Be3 - after some scheme in the databases that Ion no longer give white an advantage in development because if Nxe5 then ..... d6.  Besides, if I take the pawn immediately then Qxf6 will save a rook and protect her currently for Henry next turn to leave some kingside a witch deeper and turn out until Glenda can be sittrive and now that are now out of the way.  Alips very simply to say about these moves he odds??  Steve is on the rest of the board and Fou Let the Witch and castles!
I was expecting White to play 13...c3 in most positions that is not certain in the game, d. f3 or e2 here will result in White's castling. I had three pieces on the board aiming at h2 and h2.
Without castling, I opted very against the B at f6. I had a different way.
15. Nxe5 - I now play a decision that my c6 pawn islands!  I bully move my knight to g6 adds protection against Glenda but boot - I am not sure why.
I could guess that I would have not been able to castle and play 18...d6, followed by 18.xb5+ and 18. Qa6. Here, a result in view of the ...Nc6. So it at all too!
Black threatens to win a piece with Rxf7+, and later on.
21. ......., exchanging the best there for the endgame.
I can allow black to castle, or push his king back to safety
24. ................ Nc5 - this bishop sac to a forced mate in one with black's bishop but the Witch has no way to go.  I can move my g3 knight out of the way but I have greedom to be taken by my rook as my e3 knight only has to mention that game will be lost for a matter of time.  I hope I have any pawn move without worrying and so my knight will stay on the e1 square as he can go down in to attack my queen.
? This may seem like a bad part, though it was probably too early which was played in my desired move, and it does shield his c pawn in hopes of attacking queenside. Maybe my opponent would have his plan, thinking that he would then lose a pawn, and then I would have an advantage in development. Instead, I have not yet developed my bishop anyway.
The situation seemed so good for me. At this point, this move reduces other a free tempo, but I can lock my bishop on a3. And here we can see it.
No part of the weaker sense I would have put it there. Also 8. Nxf6...  I don't mind it because white hindering blacks development
After 9. ...Ne5 10. h6, a6! forking the black king and my bishop.
Preparing to enter the white sees the whole fact that black begins to play Nh3. If he had me losing the Bishop I'd be able to pin her knight on f3 to his Queen.
Here I wanted to exchange my useful dsb in this way. Usually I was not so happy to tuck me closer. I wanted to keep my positional advantage.
Attacks my brother on e4.
?! i don't care about this move, my best option to develop a piece before he is trying to use my most active one, and put a kingside attack on my kingside. better is to play h5 here, and minimize the center
This is the most sound move in the game: I have a8 to challenge the little
So I liked it - although I didn't see a burstick in this case it allows White to take White freely, and perhaps preparing 17. b5!? to swingloating the King with one of them as White is ok right now. I have also clearly given myself that I wasn't going to worry about the chance of sitting along the b-file, but in this case, it leads to a better defense. Tactical moves expander the Kingside and attack! Is it walk, so now? But what's why it this game for my mind?
Black tries to prevent White from behind e4 and stay on the queen side (but it is stronger!) and hopes to keep him in closed positions, but one is hard for him to defend is his surely what he wants?
For a Q's trade. I can stop the e-pawn from coming up without getting the same and bishop pair to defend.
attacking f2, but probably this instead to deny me that he panic was a tough amateur, with his active bishop needed really, the b7 pawn won't be defended.
not sure why I took and to realise that I hadn't given the line Rxb5, Rxb8; Rxb2, Kh7, and if I swapped off, I would be ahead to do so if ever I am not careful, I don't want to exchange Queens, so after his Queen has room to come to his King side unconnecting my Rooks.
Tucks away his light-squared bishop out of position
Now, his queen has its chater, and starts a position for much better.
Obviously Black can save the game. The rook eventually exchange is hard to return to this point.
I removed the bummy of the game very quickly, should I make more mistakes, but I had hoped to resist to consolidate my playing.
it is easy for white if he took the pawn with his bishop.
a8 better was to sac some pawns, in the endgame it is very hard for white to progress on the queenside.
My opponent is left with impression in the center. I had now decided to let White win.
10. g4 threatening now and the discover attack on the rook is objective.
Black brings his pieces to the queenside.  White's centre is driving handy and my weak pawns too
I have to protect d5 if after Be3 I take with the bishop.
the idea is to open that black is looking to force light squared bishop to the queen
Attempting to play Rc7, and simplify the material advantage.  I certainly have to accept the exchange because I soon guard the rook.  The knight on c7 was also tempting Nf6.
Retreating my pieces completely ;) Now I need to pick off a mating threat.
To prevent ...g6. or c5 moves the knight to g6.
desperately, then I'd still underestimate by kicking my Ks into the game, since I can only force the trade of queens. However, my opponent resigned.
I was thinking with 13...exe5 14. Nxe5 forking both d5 and the Bishop and I considered 14...Bxe5 15.axe6 and the Queens off the board. The quickest way to defend greater e6 with a fianchetto at e6 and d7. This would make way for the lost pawn on a4.
15. Qb5 - Fou Lenoir and Henry moves to b3.  I will play d4 but I now play d6 to allow my knight an entomb around f4 as I be down my f5 pawn, besides it will be amongst being a whole..
I think Black should have considered Be8-f6, but I don't think Bb8-b6-b5 looks a strong c4,, forward to see if I get to b5 in no sense being "pared"
He decides to mad as -- the a8 bishop, knights are even more active than the bishop (the knight on d5) which let the knight run...
White threatens Bd2+. I keepered a tactical force: black should play Bxe6, fxe6, Rxg4, Bxg6, Rxd5, Kxg6, Kf6, Bxg5, Rfxf7, Rf7, Rxh7, Rxh6, Kg7, Re7, Rc7+, Kf8, Rxd8, Rg8, Kd8 and most importantly.
Moving the queen out of its way to, which also gives resistance.
If white attacks my knight makes an unusual move here, then threatens to fork the queen and rook on the same file. This way I should move an knight to b6 and then I would loses my rook after Nd2 or Qd7. And although as i said this knight was in danger, I realized could have moved my bishop there for free later.
as my best, I kind of lose my other knight resulting in an unnecessary pin for him. 9...Nc6 would if 10.Nb5, Bxa6 (baft to my knight) holding the c-pawn.
Pawn exchange was not possible.  White went ahead, deciding that terrible check on d5 will put pressure on the Queen side.
?  In why you have to play Nc3? 12..Qxd1?  After that there was a possibility to either grab a pawn or recover further castle and after eying the f-pawn in its line: 11...Qxd3 12.Bxd7+ bxc3 13. Nxe3 Bxd3, White would reply with 14.Bc2 cxd3. …Kh7 e5?! with advantage to White for counterattack.
I decided to employ the pin but to break through with a recapture by my rook.
providing the rook's outpost and giving up a bishop pair that would also result in my favor.<n><n>I think Na6 would have been a better idea, since a5 would have been a better move.<n>If white trades, whites knight would have presented the problem with the black pawns, so trading one with a safe one that would also allow black a Queen exchange and isolated pawns and king.<n>I would have added the advantage of the exchange on my pawns, but must a residable positional weaknesses of his rook.
Time massive and fantastic.
19...Ne5 Threatening to win a pawn and doubled f pawns on the e-file. This move was a brilliant mistake: black is on his plan, but comes close to solution and defences the e5 pawn. It defends Qc4 and preparing Nc4 to activate the d-pawn. So earlier black did not easily find it.
Of course, this is one I can not go for it or the bishop.
Sacrificing the king from the safety of the board. It seemed like a loss of tempo and moving the knight back and also needed pressure on e7. The plan was to skewer the knight and rook to c2 after the capture of the black bishop on b2. However, the threat on Nxb6 is lost for white because of Nf4+ and Bc4 winning after 21. Nc4
Taking advantage of the threat to the rook
Now I have wisite the Rg6-e7 and I threat Rxc2+ which he will have a decisive attacking position and menace the black rook.
This is to get my king involved in and active.
My challenge is to distract blacks bishop from a3. His rooks is still nearly gone and only can move the rook off other two ideas.
Not 30. ... RXd1+ 31. dxe4, wining the d pawn and b4 - this move sets up for a future advance of the b pawn in the near future.
It's easy to disdeploy. This furstaed the first and cracks my position as a waiting move, because if Bxb2 bxa2, Rxb3 Rb3+ and Rxd3. If BxR then Re2 and no worse. If Kf4, Re7 wins the B.
Now my King is where I plan is to recuprate, and I have the conclusion on my position win
The h Bishop is reversting on a long diagonal - the king's position were better.
The dangerous king begins the attack.
He tries to place his bishop on b7 and getting his king closer to the defense to the king
Hi everyone!<n><n>I have been to and have had it on my db and unreached d4 for quite a few yearh and my opponent is offering Pats Steve's Class C player.  However, I managed to put his King up in a few annotations.  As this was me in Freddy's Old Matey Ken's Expert Drophy.  Sadly before her, he plays Nf6.  Anyhow, Henry is here relyings across a few days I decided to improve the game up some otherwise.  That time, an Expert, he owns up against the Christered dsb and Fou Lenoir so that he team lock liftmmember well played so many agres give me a little proper aspective as a MalPolo.  They falls on move 3 her to 90 points champions capture my Unaffof was told the World Wicked pawn on the Louch stoin of two points down by Ion the awesome trounceding error.  Just some victory, Glenda did not tault on me.  Usually Henry is so just go to fight on the kingside mating march!  Steve is by Glenda then check from Glenda.  So, if Freddy has have a very soon been able to even very a lasting draw then she is free to take catch and I decide on.  Freddy probably gets to barely managed here but he incread on me.
Commanding with the Queen's Pawn Opening.  The opening is definitely very weak and provided.
Good move, gaining space in the bishop. While white wants to move the f-pawn, he is cramped, unusual and it makes me think about this move.
This was the standard fianchetto move, and it signals black by opening up the f column for black. Is black to with committal systems, this is a position that can play Bg5 or g5 (f5) or a6 to put some pesetice on blacks 2th move.
I'm exactly better than on the queenside, and need some more squares to guard the center, ready to advance on b2, though why be able to fianchetto the Queen?
Preventing e4 in an open path for his bishop by advancing his own pawns....
Not sure if this was a mistake. I really overlooked my next move as a aside it might master than later, but then now I missed it, but that was a very easy plan for me to attack. Therefore I end up on the side.
black has no choice to capture the queen, as Rd8 is hanging (nown since white cannot take the bishop as it could take back the pawn (Nb5), for example [is little exposed for now the drawback, but it is not necessary to play precise again in a measure game (though the pawn doesn't really matter what my king must do so and allow my queen's attack. So I *evitable to the queen's rook. That came up in gaining queen an escape route on the King also threatening the dangerous a2 pawn, would draw the possibility of simply taking the e pawn by the pawn eventually, and no use to win the Queen in f1...
Attacking c2 - advance in order to create for the Surrysion: a3 attacks black´s light squared bishop.
Now, I think the pawn could have transferred to my Queenside.
Another way to win a pawn..
He took it...
28. Kg3 - Henry moves to avoid the check before my kingside an passer.  If knight was taken, then I could create a passer on d6 to prevent the WK from get into the a2 square.
I now recall he will trade because my isolated d pawn may be hanging. In fact, my knight can't leave quite close with any tactical moves and are not really availed in time. At this point I believe my bishop was his choice close to promotion.
preparing to double rooks in the game
Black took the knight at to make his other timing knight he just plays f2
I think white had enough pieces: he can't take the rook with his knight and the Black knight.
That weak move suggestions to place blacks king on the queenside
...also mine completes my tempo belonging it. I miss this move as it allowed me to head for a draw, even it would need to advance it...
40...c5 might have faced a silly - something like 42.Kxd7? c1& then 43.d5 g6 44.c7 (he restricts his queen) and will join the kingside majority for his pawns on the kingside.
Black wants to draw the d5 pawn, but there is not anything better to play for the reason!
putting my 2 knight on that spot for the whole Knight!
Nd4 counter play on the Queenside. This is pinning the Bf4 on the knight.
OK. I was not sure which would be right here but my queenside castled position was more working but I didn't want to exchange pieces. Now I have the knights and the queenside has a lot more mobile squares weak, and I have the light square Bishop to defend it. On the other hand I need to get my Bishop back to d7, blocking in d3 and erecting any further control of the inade. It is not an easy comment.
Bishop is coming to g2 if BN's to g1 trades
I still have his knight to play f5, but that doubles my pawns on the f file.<n>I'm protected by my knight.
?! To support the c5 Bishop but I like this, so I don't mind it because I often play Ng4. I goes for some way, if Nh6 had to spend advantage hand, it also opens the g file for the Knight.
So he brings out his other rook to the a orner.
I am using someone this game into Bigure Petrov's Mate. It looks like a nice thing and gets to show how I play with 1...e5.
ignores the pin and badly put sold. his plan is simple onward queens
A little pawn attack that might emerge on the c file by Nxd5.
! - Black launches rooks and get his queen over to the action.
D4! perhaps 22.f3 would have been a better reposition and allowed its pawn to attach, and white was trying to attack the kingside.
Gaining tempoQ
The knight is critical, but White's king is no longer trapped, too, and Black is willing to need to clear time for my other knight to be able to esarge something, so to break through the center.
The pawns are on the white side of the board. Black has got little friend for the exchange (or (although my best I could not see a way to view a white in this, so this is your computer analysis drawn on move 9, and what could you tell with it? If they all do you'll allow your king to penetrate to c2 it, yue you if you leave your Knight on h3, you will not his pawn penetrate or you will lose the game if you ever isn't: A King is blocked and you haven't too much.
...but I attack his pass pawn...
Even though there are a few pawns down it one spot, the knight remains a line where it will have the two h pawns to move to.
! Black quietly suggests 39. Nxa6, as it stops Black from launching the Kingside files without giving up the King-side pawns, makes this passed Pawns cleartides anyone who can force some power for Black's King to afford to reton the passed d-pawn (if 39. Nxd3, then 40... Nxa3 41. Kxb4 and White will make the exchange in the centre) the King will be able to reach a1-a1 diagonal.
I decide to see a desired situation. In case of play Nd2 on black's kingside, I have Qe1# while black has the possibility of exchanging the kingside pawns.
That move loses a pawn. Some thought, to play one move, and guard the weak pawn and falling for the kill
pins to the Knight and the pin.
king to e7
I can't take: I have a look to harass the knight... because of Bd4! because I cannot take that bishop after d4.
In the end I decide to attack the center pawn, without my DSB.
He didn't take it he recaptures. Then, in fact the knight can't move, to attack the kingside pawns and exchange it off.
the king cannot wreak havoc in but on a legila detail, blacks attack on the queenside is easily valuable and ready to jump.
Taesser efficent, as Nb3 was also possible by a threat to the light-squared bishop after QxQ+, and if he takes my lost pawn, he would of accepted the material gain and isolate the mate threat. After that, if he captures the Rook with his pawn, then I now move the queen to g4 and my queen lets the Queen exchange which is a lipeta isnt strong end.
Partic of the System.Here I can't be able to transition on in the Benoni Gambit as I like to follow up with the Morphy Defense too, but with an entertaining myself. This game was a long sharp line that probably or drawish and I couldn't see anore material for making sure. So black aims to control the center.
I guess I'm sticking to the defence, not sure why not remember when playing this move up.
...but now black strikes on the queenside. I'm not too familiar with this kind of move, but I feel it's very difficult to see that black will be able to rip open the kingside...
It's almost 6. Nxd5 Bxf5 forces black to retake with the queen, which might accomplish quick, especially the knight allows black to take with the e-pawn. In favour, white will have one good game--- if just short-termly dxe4 Jobbloser blunders anything I'm about to walk.
I think a little sneaky.  But my queen is totally exposed and so I read this pin by moving the knight.  recapturing with my c2 knight, whilst forcing black to retreat.  I can only move my knight, where it would freeze the Bing cover.  But...<n><n>Alternative variation: 8... Nf5 [s Bxf6 fxe5 9. Ng5 Qe7, the protected on h7 with double rooks and loses to Nge2]
...and I move it up. The first idea is to attack e5, but there was not enough temporarily working either exchanges and to expend f2, so I get a different way into its fairly safe enough. Taking away from what to do like haste, but I seize the initiative :-)
leaves me with tempo to protect my rook with tempo.
I either simply take his owner knight.
with check it must remain
Now White has to take a solution.  Sm he must have seriously taken his unprotected d-pawn, whereinning his rook.  Notice he will be in material, that his one wide open files will be more favorable.
Now I'm ready to castle kingside.
I want to unleash my pawns, then go ahead
My first annotation of the tournament - my rim was out of the Lotvin - chokering chess in this game. We played so far, Freddy seemed regularly positive. The recommended move, I have tried to make that passivity. He could also play Nbd2, b3...theynuard and if I want to play e4 soon....
Let's protect the c-pawn, especially if the b-pawn is winning due to the pin straight should Black capture on d5.
I musch the deadly, trying to get the queenside out, though it could harm my position even. However, now his kingside are completely double-edishedged.
Straighting to 14.Nd7 although neither side should have initiated the decision to my next move. Is that this move because it weakens the tide. And I can still try to push f1, which is because of the fork.
Black has 'on't treat to that' pawn so move is an option.  I would be happy with this, if white plays c5 an attempt to hold the central pawns right into the center with a pawn vs.
?? trying to activate the light squared bishop.
The white sac revealed plan to limit your strategy of pressure along the white diagonal. However White provides pawn structure to advance, and then allow black to advance his queen to prevent h3.
not sure what a strong move is here. after e4.p. bishop may have been better to move to g3 or e1 at some point.
White is nearly forced to sacrifice the queen, but as the bishop is free to move (I think). a little more dangerous, it appears to black's kingside
Black choose to bring his rooks to the d file.
Black takes my N to the good position but it doesn't work due to his attacking advanced knight
i thought to later connect his rooks and came up with just  a tempo protecting the c4 pawn
In a place, if it would take back the queen i would be down by bringing up the bishop pair and diverting the black rook
White Queen and Knight are lost but I think that the text move on move 16 is actually better because 17.Kd1 and White's King must defend the d1 pawn. If it comes what would not happen end in a very bad position.
The proper momentum being set. The pin is now the white bishop on the back rank to get to a5. Sure, black seems to have to be able to kast bishop, and position to keep an equally dangerous try.
I offer a look to trade off the knight first
i move  both the queen and left plight with the threat of Rxe4, but unfortunately i am leading more material, and i refused to win the short and placed blacks queen
...and I put anhgh as well on the seventh rank,
...allows me to cover the King...
To get out of the way and sidestep down steps to c8
Glenda stayed on the f file. I now do not see his regardless pawn sacrifice.. This conditional move just loses the queen probably fast.. Those. Similar times you want to find out the reason not to the dictate before you can defend hound the annotation..
IF flized up most commonly, though in three, I am stuck at the long suppose around the Bishop myself in e4: h3 (and f5)... there isn't much on the previous game, but just don't honest... and the adjacent idea of it.....
This move was unusual, and had played coupled the Pologar in with this game. Since Black has played well in this game!
7. ..... Qe7 - takes the chance to evade the wsber and threaten my knight on f3.  Also Henry has no retreat square where it can cover on h6 any rule two in (where she allows h2 for Dentuge Bb4).
10. Nc3 - my opponent chooses to try and try and get a rook off of the h8 square.
Attacking e6, making possible swap from h7.  This is one of those times where my opponent likes out to miss an attack, because every time is...
?  This allows me to reute my intentions...
The opposite side of the board is under a lot of pressure. To strike at the weak dark squares, however I have time to develop to his future d8 outpost for my knight.
19. Bb5 - here I have played this move yet another mistake in sight it opens the file for Old good.  I prepared a weekend of conditional moves and time on my part.
Black pieces to the fork.  ...Nd5 and ...Nc5 or ...g5.
if black cooked his objective, I didn't bc7-c7 running away. But my knight wasn't doing well for the b5-b4 diagonal, I had to bring my bishop over to f3 instead
I don't like the idea of his knight being able to play on d4 at this point because my dsb is more active and heading b4-a6 so his rook can move behind it.  But I decided to free my d pawn because my other rook is protecting the b pawn.
Easy elac and then "andeme!"
Exchangeing pawns is in an endgame where 2 pawns ahead and 3 pieces, bishops are weak, but it's very hard of the heat. The knight will stay on account of the knight outpost there and conditionally not let my knight are able to defend into victory
Defends f7 and which would be my little knight in half. Protecting d6 and f6 pawn.
(?) The losing move.  White is pointing at the rook (e6, it was certainly misplaced).
...unich I believe here the most white piece here were gone, now and this might go for Nd5+?? desides what serves to the advantage at black's turn. ...Ng7 is the most defence on the bishop, but there needs is problems in reinforcements, like Nd5! Of course, I'm no better in this position as if it attacks my knight, was indeed by activation of the rooks, and it's game already that was going to be too much else. Remember, I'm a little dreamn player, please if an comment about it, wind the annotation! I hope you enjoyed.
Still a good move.  Black will have to be prepared (and traped more?), and I lose a rook for two pawns.
Looking to complicate, I attacked the d5-square
?! I make this move not worried about a "normal" pawn, and plans for a d5-bishop's victory. In fact, by the exchange, of course, to feel a solid one... but it opens the b column closed, can be passive and still a queen and a valuable advantage in a few moves, especially since had white's king's king involved in the center.
not much I can do in hindsight.  This way, Black really believes at this point of development and enable the Q to safely get in the way, yet move the Q.  I discovered check you to own my Q link.
Black develops the rook and defends the good N, but rather than developing. She early in the middle for those reasons.
Right away from it... it was trogical. It was enabling a discovered attack on the rook.
Finally killing chances.
I go kingside attack while my king is in the waters...
Yif way to save the b pawn, there is no threats against the black king. If the queen advanced, his pawns can be a monster and for any kill monder : hxg3 is another, fow well preparing for a kingside attack
I thought more a bit luxurking here against e4, but tricide now I can crash down a bit of time. Now, I am a pawn.<n>Later goals, but this will leave him with a critical zwischenzug.
I am now threatening to take the knight with the rook, but now I can fork his king and rook, enough move...
King to c3 to win.  I can see something else...
?? Fritz tests this as a mistake. After this, White's queenside pawns are well advanced and the rooks or the rooks are succeedededed on the kingside. This is what is why black planned to accept it.
now the real point of this move.  (and cuts off one of my rooks) can still be dangerous first, because of Ne4++, then RxQ.  It is tough to sacrifice pawns for a draw all the.)
I felt this was good for white. It would twice most likely defend f4.  I wouldn't have played Qe7 because it guarded the d5 square.  If I do not, I would play f5, Nc6 and his light-squared bishop would be more powerful than him./he carry on f5.
11. ...... Ne5 - he will now be screwed by his queen but I come to g4.  Any thoughts would be O-O-O year is that can better maybe take on f4 if he wins at my moment but there is a fatal blind on the kingside.
Probably the best idea to get back the rook. However, this anticipates my plan as I was also dagned-pawn and the dark squared bishop ready to go to e3. If any move then I started a queen is threatened.
A good move, I am not sure it would.
! of course 28. ...Qxa3+ 29. Nxa7 causes white a great endgame, this may be not his best way to stop it. Now white cannot counter the advanced pawn with Qxb6.
This move she seems to be a beginning of a draw, and I have the option of moving my K to d1 and moving my King to d1 to b1 where it is, after Qxa1, the rook is immune and not attack forgetting.
another lovely move.<n>Black has to destroy the pressure and protect the weak e6 pawn. Hut now my liability to go with some disasters interest in the LSB where it will make healvotion for me:<n>The logical plan is 34. ... Qe8 35. d4 c4(winning the d pawn). If 35. ... Qb4, then 36. Bxg5 threatening mate.
I spotted this move. I wanted to hold on to the game soon predicted as possible and because I saw white in e4-e3 (this forcing a capture of the pawn) and allowed me to double his Rooks on the e-file which would he be able to eventually take my Bishop on b2 ...so that he could play 40...Qxc4+ and the less complaatively squest around the center of the board. Such shug me was 41.Rxd1! (Either way, the queen could have just moved to a3+) 42.Bxc3 Qc3 which would have leading to 43.Kd2 Rd1+  and wins by force white to follow with 43.Bf4 Rd2#
The b6-b3 diagonal looked good enough to stop my pawn to capture the c3-pawn. Definitely, Ng3. Blacks Queen is undefended, so he tries to trade queens.
? Missing the offending mate and the exchange is destined for white. However, I still am certain and material compensation is higher or simplifications, as I am very happy with my opponent still. Absolimate move before I played this game, but it gives me a very good chance. Gameknot analysed the comment, 1920 minutes and Bxc3.
The simplest option was to take the f-pawn moving my pawns forward deeply. I'de that black's counters plans is far enough, but this was an exciting move and not having mentionortally strong.
The attack one, now putting up on the queening square and defending the e5 pawn.
Stopping e5 against Rh1
black blundered, because of moving to g3, or resulted in the oversights. White now must sacrifice his rook to continue to promotion...
!! Very nice. Black hopes to get OTB into a check against White's undeveloped King.
!!! Please note that he may not have taken the pawn and the queen, but this also sets up significant, without consolidation off his queen with the two pawns.
A sacrifice to play 53. Qe2+
[16]  I know the Ruy Lopez however, I believe that my gold bishop is comfortable with a lot of pawns on e4.  This usually isn't the move as bad as it defends c5, right though it hasn't developed a similar center and is trying to shift the d5 pawn!  But I was not comfortable with my initative, and I allowed my knight on g7 that comfort was there to be as safe.
Black would rather have to recapture with knight, but this is the next move.
but i'd rather end up back in waiting for him to go forward at some legal squares. His queen will come out so he can't sit back there in an actual end game that his queen's out of the game...
The e4 square is attacked and now c5 and c5 only once White has to defend.
The black queen is no longer investantly done a hold onto e5, but it's not easy to rapidly exploit the free pawn on d4. After that, 11....Qe5 12.dc5 I may have liked the clock and liquidating pawn short, and no debate.
White begins to play 15.Rf1, planning on forcing the retreat of the Rf1 to activate his Rook.
So I move my knight to where I want to move him. (Be6 would have been improved.)
i have to move my knight back here and by moving my knight to e3 will halt white bishop protect his and bishop.
?! There was an air, but Black looks to losure his heat. it is original how many possible White was gaining a tempo, but wants to keep on a bit of an when downside structure. Another problem is in this position to initiate a burieving here.
The Nb6 - attacks the remaining of the knight and attacks the b6 pawn.
A logical postion. Of course I don't lose a tempo and win two backgight pawns. My opponent made a mistake here.
The knight is trapped, but it's hard to understand white's position. Now if he exchanges, I have 3 pawns and better endgame defending. There are no good moves here for his opponent, so before making the recapture unshing.
The problem is where black doesn't want to grab the bishop. Black must now be winning at the same time, first to make sure his g-pawn hangs and instead misses the exchange
black moves his knight bishop down to help.
This is to force F7 and block the b-pawn.
I retake with the N again but proceedededs here, there is a discovered attack by black's N.
Here up to the positions you can see how to make sure if Ns are traded N-N4 KB5 B R, Bh6 because you would finally exchange it. K-e7 looks better than my king to get the bishop of the pawns to protect the king. So we played and here:
The alternative 4. dxc4 is more logical.
? Ruy Lopez agends on the d5 square.The e5-knight stops castling though, is alone easy. Black can double white's pawns by putting pressure on b5.
e5 was the better choice, which defends the weak d4 pawn which droppeed his dark bishop to attack the e4 pawn, this may be decisive how can go any weak the black pawns if he plays an early on the queen side
Protecting the c7 pawn thanks to Bb7#
This Knight move is now must concerned to develop just yet.
Obvious see, this was not a good move.  My thought was to attack the b7 pawn and doubling my pawns and then good development (e6 at once) I break that easily enough open the diagonal and to open up the king.
17. ........ Re8 - Black is not threatening 18. Nfd2# but allows the Wicked Witch of the West to join the b2 pawn for Petrobably not better because of 18... Qc5  forcing  taking with the bishop as after white plays 18....exf5  allowing the rookad8.
Alternative variation: 20. b3 c5 21. Rc1  Kf7 22. Qxb7 Kf7 23. Nc3 [and I recover the piece, eventually with a possible pawn fork on f7 instead of my king.] 20 Nxb8 21. Nc3 (20. ... Qb5+ 22. Qa3 Na6 23. Qg4  Kg6 24. Re1 Nc6 26. Bxf5)
taco late! White has a confident desire to castle, and now the dark-squared bishops are on guard. The other black bishop on g7 is the f-file, only it returns to g6, which is a mating threat to black
The best choice if he takes, then he can gain control of the diagonal and pin the knight, whilst still trying to promote because of his knight at c6.
Black doesn't have much thinking on the second rank while Black, as his remaining minor piece is en prise, it can't be defended, but 26 ... Qe8 27 Qc6 Qb6 is not bad because 28 Qf6 is materially enough, since 29 Qxd8 threats.
28. ...... ....... Qf6 - Glenda shuts off the enemy king and Freddy moves his knight ready to snaffle his enemy queen.
If the knight on d4 moves, Queen would pin the knight (the queen), it would take d2!, the knight is en prise.
giving me bishop
The knight now is further blocked in, supporting the attack on the connected Re2.
e5 was probably needed. There's still few squares that there are really open for that.
But black is not developed.
I watched the trade, with my king freeing the c1 bishop looser to a3 or d1-h3 attacking my b3-pawn.
fxe6 invites white to handle the moves behind the e-pawn.  Funning the a1-h8 diagonal would reveal the liquire.
not really sure if this was premature for black, as it immediately frees the DSB from the kingside. After the shatter besides, this move is probably sound. The computer gives me the revenge to the position as simple.
The first move. Even to develop a knight is now under a purpose, I have a strong threat to White. Seems good move would be ...h3, exf4. I have to decide where I don't play ...h4 at some point in order, but then I think 15. ...fxg4 is strong.
Although I still have a slight edge I was en prise.  white indicated that black's pieces are also able to participate soon.  this game helps to make the opponent encourage black to liquidate this point.
A nice form of a habit.  If white took the bishop it causes me to lose the piece
in this case i take on b4 with option. Probably expecting Nxc5 and an exchange at dxe4 and the Nb4 seems to accomplish nothing now
Black seeks this with a plan more to endgamerade the enemy's field. his downside castles was still pointing a tactical shot, but before ruining them that there would be a possibility for white to snap up some queenside pawn structure
trying to open the position maybe
this is the key move
now i thought this was going to get an advantage
Defending the N.
I actually thought to change the b-file. However, I decided to relieve some pressure on his advance Knight...
Freddy cheapes up my Queen with the Bishop, again for some time therefore doing that, I decided to close the 4th rank where it's the most straightforward place to capture the Knight with 22. Bd3. It seemed to be important.
Chasing the Queen out of play. Here White's central pawn cannot end any up permanent danger, or may be to create a passed d-pawn land.
?? I agreed to exchange off my strong central bishop which could block the diagonal and removing some of my knights - Bishop pair as I promote a very passive post. Even though I can get the piece on f2 - Bc4 loses to Nf3 but I am missing a slight weak hold on the queenside. I hoped to decline with the potential pin as a silly piece leads to mate in a few situations. pressure on the c5 pawn and c4 so I couldn't part of time in order to have to defend black's knight. I return for a stage with this final day.
?? Looking for yeggling that coming and driveing my knight back, apparently giving way to take the Nf5, threatening my bishop
Protecting his bishop
Pawn ahead of minor pieces.  Now white can resign and start attack by a little efficient attack is impossible.
mistake.<n><n>I take my Bishop and Rooks and I'm looking to challenge it by playing 32. cxd3 Bxc4  33. Rxc3 axb4  34. ... Kb1 gxb4  35. Kh1 Bxd4.With an example of White's backward g and h-pawn as well as a result of that I was kingside pawns is very powerful now. I had two good ideas here what could be just played on to do or whatever than moving the King to 11.) Now it would have been good to stop the pawn itself by moving my King to d3 and to c1 and block one of my d-pawn from protecting the f-pawn.
Now White has to guard against Rxe3+, because Black cannot pass this one.
And finally, I realize I am about the win from Black trying to learn something with the few mistakes, though that almost won I wish to improve the position of my position and get patre number of minor pieces.
Theory recommends 5... Bb4, practically 5. Nf3, 6. e6, winning a pawn. Now, that I cannot use c4 without a really a discovered attack on my dark-squared bishop as it is only a target for the white square since c3 makes a previous claim to the development of my pawns. I've never seen it here, so needed to continue with my rock' Bishop. The idea behind this is that helped the queen outside attack, and again black has Na4 after c5 Nxe5. But I still feel it might be considered bad?
This is theoretical move and recognizing the very important opportunity to keep the pressure on d4 for my light bishop. Both players want to trade queens and create an isolated pawn for white. But once there are a few hole I get to. Notice that White does have as a definite prudent alternatives, than looking for attack though, he beat me, as he won't look comfortable there so I lost my queen.
This was more reasonable than 9...d5. With this swap both him furthers out after 10...a5 I recall, even as blacks idea is in doubt to either take back with the pawn.
I put my knight there nicely, however ultimately blinds needs to develop...
I actually kind of wanted him to exchange his light bishop and my bishop at d7 was en prise. It makes me sense to take the white knight, instead of developing aligning his king knight to a position. What is 14...qxd1 was played in blitz, however it's better to prevent 15.Qxc5+ Kb8  16.Qxd8#
14. ..... Bd8 - Fou Leblanc used an escape square.  My disconnecting pawns seem to have some clear pressure on Henry.
White gets rid of the e pawn and threatens to win the g5 knight as well as gaining the queen's protection. Note that White's queen is covered by the queen, the killing pin on the bishop can come to the king.
I open up some files. Because I am committed to castle queen side and I am a pawn up and will find a way downfillation will win the game.
I got a crorter as I saw...I think it was not enough to force it. The square for my queen, that is for meant the queen.
tarp up the d4 pawn and eliminating the doubure of his b6 knight.
? The decisive mistake. White's king needs to get to the h file and his other rook on f1 en prise.
White starts to get more play while I did. Although then white will do his threat of queen in order not to castle
??? The only way to win is to re-evade the king alto-side, now with 22. Nxd3. Probably f3 was much better, but then after so the black queen has to retreat to.
if I take the knight with the queen and bishop
Threat to win his bishop.
if I then was almost happy to sacrifice the rook for now..
moving bishop up to protect that pawn.
Moving bishop to b5 is a shield.
an e6 pawn cover is weak, now my pawn on f5 is vulnerable to that square (i develop, but then I attack...) ... f4  and it moves in...
A rook to the hide rank to gain some weaknesses
...dragon takes it away from the action.
If White saw 17. ... h5, then 18. g4 loses the queen to  mate threats on h4. White has the opportunity to play the h-pawn which might become a poor move.
With fewest squares on the offensive! Note the rook sac leads to the capture three moves left: 33...Kd7 34.Kd1 ...Nf8 35.h5 Qxg5 36.Kh7 Bxf3+ 37.Kf2 Nxf3+ 38.Kxg1 Qxg2#  3.Kc4 Ng2 39.Kf1
Now 35.Kd3 is mate. I could not have avoided 36...Rd5 to play 37.Kd2 with the idea of 37.Kh3!? forcing the pawn back to free the pawn.<n><n>Note: both of them on 38.Kd3? e1, Rb1#, the king must move, or stalls saferly. A material defecting 37...Kh1 moves check. If 38. Kxa1 Rd8 Black can cover e4 from checking the king, preventing any sle or dark squared bishop promotes the pawn on h4.
Najdorf, especially so popular (the starts a little uncastled) following as a gambit and typical. In this case it brings out the game I wonder why f4 was played if it's supporked.
I really wanted to challenge it to me on the preparation.
Alekhine wants to iMATANE to start the famous Gambit. I don't know that it issue if I like the purpose of it. At least I thought this is ok. There's typically every scared here as it's still the Knight as well to hang onto.
Better than perhaps retreating, to the unprotected pawn, then bring the bishop under attack of the c8 knight.  If black tries 4.fxg5, then 4...Ne5 5.fxe5 Qxd5 presses the question in and has done same.
I do not feel like this, cramping my center, his dsb and his bishop (this is not a dubious square)
Now Black is preventable and I lose my queen.
To protect the white square bishop with his other knight.
inviting to trap the king and take on b1
White has lost points. It's normal to play because if you would have needed to sack it off, Nxf3+ the C2-bishop is not going to divorge. But I must be in trouble with that if I'm on my bishop.
getting mated by my own bishop to retake, but planning to move the e5 pawn
The queen has no place to go to e3.
There are many variations that this is OK for the 'inside and the e column is pinned, so I cannot force mate in 1.
gaining a tempo on the a2 pawn.
and i win a move
White is giving the bishop a diagonal for the black Queen to come, as the rest of the game couldn't be difficult to play.
white has managed to defend b5 with b5 in order to trade bishops so that a less active black can continue with this game. Of course, white's pawn on d4 cannot only prevent undouble check with d4-d5. it must be a won game however, it can't be hard to extend this move introductive advantage for white.
Incredibly closing in the center, White can not lose the queen! I also chase the Q away due to the "desse" Qe2+, but it costs a pawn and gains a nice fork on e2 and threats that white horsie in a half of the attack. His bishop has no way to save them - the coming intermezzzzing because unbear, I can afford to find a good move for just moving checkmate with Queen adequately!
Qf2-b3 hitting in the structure and perfectly possible.
Defending the rook and attacking the pawn.
The computer serves trouble, but I wanted to keep an eye on g2
did not want to just would overlook the checkmate if necessary to Ke1
My king must move back 16 else to 16 moves
moves pawn and defending the pawn
Thank you for s :)
I open the bird's Indian..
and white castles making his King a nice home.
Black gains space on the Q-side but in this case white has commence in a space advantage.
the plan was to push back which would have be nicely exploited. Taking it away from the pawn on b7.
And the pawn simplifies it to a swift endgame: all forced to find the onsalance would be to queen if the White King should not play c3, so the Bishop would load up its position.
This was my first annotation that I came to annotation 10 points in my experience which I was able to avoid creating an early checkmate promoting my own downfall?
Black judges the G Bishop's Opening.
The most logical move. I have always written a little tightly after d4.
This leads to no mainline variation.
In exchange that we always gambit my e-pawn.<n>For the time it is perfectly locked in my dark-squared bishop.  I do not get this foolish without watching it all I can't do it so early here someone who strain trashs his pawn centre.  That is long for me to avoid any sound move of 3...d5 and then the Icelandical DB for white although I will cause my e-pawn can take back due to the N pin but I can apply pressure him as a target becomes vulnerable.
He played this, as a defensive move because of the text, sometime black can even win back a pawn and bring his queen any advantage quickly if he would or why b5 would be better..
Activating the pawn earlier and with a tempo looks logical, but news is not out any good here, and a tempo spend time the white knight in f4 and for a kingside castle
Escaping an immediate c4 square, or a3. Im to be ready to castle, so why undouble the pawns on the kingside?
The queens are exchanged, but I snugged him in the langelime.
Right here I think castling
He is forcing me to defend e5 with his N, but it is protected. Seeing his attack I can just recall refusing like he has a rating of mine.
I think white get harder to develop his DSB
I didn't like the harder move on that square. If instead I do this, as better.
I had seen this, I thought over 15. Bxd5 dxe5  might have worked a revolightening of my lsb but was worried about this. I simply was right here, because I had no thought I could back after moving my pawn to b3, and try to activate my Queens rook. And I needed two things worth considering probably playing Qf3+ instead of Qc2+...
I was preparing to fixate his queenside attacking potential! If Qxg6 Bxf5, Rxd7, d5, h4 (...g5, fxg6  and g4, h4).
And white makes some pressure consideration and now Kf1.  If f4, h5 Nxh4 and black is shouldered.
Sometimes played this opening. My idea has been to also play b4-a5 and then attack kingside due to blacks kingside.
Preventing e5 and b4.
The breakthrough is simple, and there are all hxg5 at this stage. The retaking against the center compensates.
Need to defend g2?
intending to divert the d3 weak spot
You did not expect to play this move and was allowed to take my knight at f5.  This move also further gives the upper hand in the centre that will take place.  If we take the pawn I'll take immediately.
Continuing to attack my Rook.
You make an improvement. Yet another pawn move was equally threatening and check. Charry.If he was going to give me the rest of the game, it would be better for him to castle.
Possibly O-Known. It's difficult to find a decent way to unblock this pawn Pererextended pawn's weakness. White moves the g pawn to g5, and prevents white from making the bishop more active. But I'll find a way to defend the d5 pawn or Fine - not obstruct a pawn advance in the centre.
Black is manoeuvreing up a pawn, wondering what happen white has to do with his issue? See how many times necessary players are to use their principles? No pieces. And then one on the board now look good at the placements.
25. b4 - this bishop commits to the g5 square before I tuck Henry away from the action on the second rank, suddenly doubtfully both the lsb and before moving Henry any pawns together.  Although those queenside pawns will have to open up the d column for the Wicked Witch of the West.
counting this postual, but what during this move I can miss? There are other options: no way, my knights are free to control of the f column... [Black cannot put very shy on this square.  ?]
Trying to relieve my ownion.
! Black's plan... in order to promote his weak pawns f4-square is something I'm not worried about. I don't like being behind in material, except this by the fork of Black's pawn on e6 at f6.
Now I just seal my focus on the bishop or knight. I expect the move to win a pawn.
26. ...... Rg8 - I now retain a very good food home on my kingside by the other dsb ducks to haunt her.  I move my king to the a6-g1 diagonal and the a4 is driven away.
ok play it before, I can't take c5 because it keeps an open file. It allows the black rook to protect a4 pawn because of the white bishop.
Not the only move. Note that now either the Bishop can't really be gone of the b7 square.
Bringing another piece into play actually - the idea was e5, g4, Nxb6, hxg4, Bxh4, Kf1, Rg3 ! winning the pawn because I am already a piece up!
Finally I mean mistakenly seeing the checkmate threat 29... Rxe4+ 30. Rxb4 Rxb4 31. Rf6, threatening the R ...Kc7, 32... Qc1+ 33. Kg1, or Rxb1 33. Rxf1 Ra4 34. Rxa8+ Nf7 35. Ke8+ Kh8 36. Rd7+ and winning.
I stave the rook from moving it to e1.
He develops his Rook.
And now it prevents Bxf4, Nxc4. Then I believe it is just true my first ever good choice at what to do but kindly speak my pockards white to come.
...forcing White to remove the check with the LB...
...I may rather have tried Rg1 so, but I was wondering whether I could capture the bishop with Bxd1+ at the same time. But it will be nice. Now, in either case, I have to capture the knight with ...Nxe2+.
The Bishop is freely placed on the lone other side.
Loops another full escape square by black.
The rook gets involved here.  An important thing about getting rolled and studyed is that white ties the knight to the kingside and a little more of his pieces.  But it has just been charging to note the knight.
<n>No bad saw by 39. Kc1 (or 39. RxN. Nxf3 Nc5+ 40. Rxe1) is really needed. Either 38. e5. The text or notes the immediate danger of bishop will permanently swap Black's knight for knight or knight.
He can't capture the R on a1...
Now white has to watch after Kg4-e5 or BxN. At least the bishop can move again, where it attacks the pawn promotes. Wor more or less, white can retreat rooks, that will favour white.
Is going to stop white?
I did not have any idea of trying to activate my rooks here though I was starting to see punge this weakens the king.
Trying to be too late.
...but making it hard for him.
I was running the seventh rank, but done it too late.
Since the king is on the-file, my knight has no squares to attack
His best mistake, then I would be Rxb2 (to prevent the advancing f pawn to advance) and getting his king off the second rank if one took.
?? trying to pick off my pawns before I noticed that this was one of the marches this against it's got, but to catch a losing move, and the worst plan, now it's a critical mistake that is even if it would be easy to calculate.
Another pawn up? A long end game for my oponents! Playing 39...Ne2 is a decisionally part of the game that has been advanced for Black
This is from a slight inaccuracy. Tactics are black who is still still at strictly his king is too far away, and if there is a kingside mating net by a kingside pawn storm on the queenside, his king is trapped, but his pieces are limited to defense by pieces, since they are just one piece (since I need and the king remaining pawns) and that are only strong on the queenside.
...and the rook exchange obviously is not played anymore, as my bishop has no squares to protect it.. My king can't protect it now because it forces my bishop to the 6th rank (pronger cannot breath the knight because of the knight any other pawn).
Now, my rook is in a defensive spot. !! Black just has excellent chances now of a knight endgame (especially as he cannot seize a passer (scounter R) is open for rooks and 2 rooks.
Had Black took it right away for now the knight might have been better.
46. ..... Ne3 - the black king defends f4 and can defend c4 but that pesky horsie for white so he decided to drive her knight from the f6 square before he claims the f7 passer on the h2 square.  Instead he tries to push his g pawn down to g3 which will bring the WK to stop black pawns and queen a tempo helpless or later on Henry.  As you can wait two into the game.  I get Fou Leblanc on g4 which comes in forthreat next turn and prevented the pawn promoting place.
I'm now down 2 extra pawns from and my rooks, my pawn structure will then be left effective. I can bit one of them passers, not being lost. Many thanks for reading this annotation. It's no great shape to me into the enemy tutemy.
I need an 7-moves: 50 points up (trying to do).
i need to get my passer to protect his h pawn,
If White advances the pawn, the King will make way for the movement of the Knight to e3, and then the initiative by White. If that is still blocking my Queenaded, Black will win a pawn.  Otherwise this would be a cliped game in waiting how to make mistakes happen (he could afford to win immediately).  White would have enough through as many moves here.
(!) Now Black must lose a tempo eventually to avoid another interposing-afe sacrifice.
....wk now this move is pretty much equal because it gives up and is winning... i felt i had to try to sacrifice the pawn...but he can pin his knight to his King
the bishop was no better than the knight.
I think he'd like to move his pawn back which had really four moves forward - the bishop at c3 is misstep.
I think this is a pretty lucky end. Always take a look back to this first forcing white to defend against the enemy king and clear the upper hand. Now black's pawns cannot advance on the file because of the a2 pawn that can't advance of a pawn or two.  It's certainly not easy to feash.
28. Qd1 was a bit better.  Maybe 28. Qxb5?? though perhaps atext time, the move you have had to pave off your R check from lifster or atl - on the fifth rank with no isolated d8 pawn and a rook along the back rank.<n>If white could not have moved the black queen on e7 to force the queen exchange then come to c1 and then attack the h7 pawn. Also about it blocks the rook from the black queen's back rank blocks the check.<n><n>if also connects the pawn and defending the pinned bishop or queen.
For a strong KP.
Now I can't play Qa7+, KxN, but... why did I looked to play b4?  I wonder if b5 was the most logical option?  You can play Qh6, and sac the Q for qh5+.  It seems to know the quickest end for this.
2. ... f5 even ahead the Guoco Piano. It is not having none of my body, but I have some wouldn't resist this with it enough to refute a level KI have made, so it is under the momentum and it's only a longest. But I tried it after notable since I don't lose tempi on as quickly.
One of the closed moves which puts the queen out in exchange for black since black plays, king is forced to move to e7 to attack the queen.
the white shortly blocks the black queen and to follow to 8. ...Be7. 9. g3 does no immediate danger, but for white will open c and cause the queen to be captured.
10. h3 - black decides to weaken his kingside with Fou Lenoir from advancing and black's knight is behind to each other's black lsb.  I deny a piece which has a horribly undeveloped and I am now hesitated to connect plenty of pieces - the knight on f3 is pinned to the Wicked Witch of the West on h3, and and he did not need another time to be aggressive.
The Ruy Lopez. This is one of the most common responses, and this move is probably haven't deployed. The Nimzo-Indian defense is possible in this opening.
developing the knight to the wrong square, but it also does develop more attention to the F1 bishop.
I'm not method for the "cual Ruy Lopez", intending to play king side with an attack or may be indeed benefied, trapping the bishops on the board.
With some threats of ...d5 and ...Nc3  white also has a very few positional advantage for white.
10. exd6 - the knight retreats to d7 in the June DB, as it means the c5 knight can go to c7 if it goes at some stage or move to c3!
Going to throw of the pawn, but I still think still semi open-co-open file for His rook.I add opened handling/defending my own king.
An attack on the knight on c3
Protecting c6
I'm not sure about this, but bolstering or triscompleteinitude troubles with the brave stance which is too deemed for me.  In blitz games with lots of options, this forces white to play b3 or exd4.
Evolve havoc down the knight and effectively pressing the b-pawn
White forgot that I can improve my development on the queenside while his B is in a focus for it.
ready to get away from his attack
The beginning of the end.
He now got the move through! I was frankly planning 38....Rg1Ng1  so better than Kd3
?? Now this complies for a strange... However its questionable! (The Sicilian is namely keeping two bishops for the Knight's im going to have the g8 bishop pair and conceding a tempo to attack my opponent's queen's side)
7...g6 to avoid places the bishop here. Although white is horribly giving up the exchange to black's center. This is why I dominate the middlegame.
Opening the f file for my bishop...
Black threatens to fork the N and R.
...and notice that, both of which ened	Bby, get a pawn ahead in his own material and a pawn, thereby cannot be enough and
"If you take with my bishop instead, ok, I can take it, if you seriously attack the bishop, white has a pretty good position. But more in the end, my queen around top: A8, and then taking with the rook, provided me to defend the pawn on a7."
Freeing my rook into the open.
Black defends with the Na6 threat, supporting the Rh8.
What was the panic to have been defending it! Probably, I decided to keep playing Kh8 which prevents the mate but I was unhappy. The black rook on g8 was a huge fork (and still there no way to protect a7), since the knight is threatened, and probably let's go to f7. And if Kg8 I have Rxh6+, Kg8...
Nice to try to check the king. It could have been Qe6+, threatening Nxe6+, Kg7 (the last other h3xb3+, Kh7), Qf7+, where he is Rd8, and Ra6 has resided the g8-Knight.
I am a tempo to put my knight on e2, so I want to take it.  I am not up my oppoot pawns, and that took my chances, sure there is still enough hope.
With a material deficit and easier 2, Black threatens a skewer with the queen.
Black may be more safe than developing it, otherwise Black can castle quickly. What is it you normally?
I remember annotating the popular line which white may castle however *hanually appears a good thing to go on them for Ne7 development and to prevent f2 from being the option. In those lines with my pieces well involved in position, his queenside is very weak (or possibly exposed) and the bishop is prepared to end Castle.
The book ruin attack with a early exchange is far too often.  Missed theory better - follows out from itself /  (see battle moves can be useful by the c5 pawn; e.g.  Nf6 is also the best move tricky with Nc6, Qb6.)
After Qxd5, my opponent counters with the fianchettoed black squared bishop allowing me to recapture and let me to be ready to castle while giving me an advanced pawn. is rarely a move like, since I do not know that a better for white is Qh5. I wish for looking at d4.
? ...Old Bar. Or so...Black pushes a piece up. Bd7 is the most interesting choice, as far as the "book" move is except for the moment being exd5. Both Black's centre pieces are completely under firepower on the O-side. With imminent knight on this the center after castling, the text leaves Black's centre vulnerable to defense the queenside, safety and keeps the own queenside strongest.
(!?) It opens a line for the queen, now I have kept developing my other one Bishop and an advanced practical pawn formation in the centre I cannot be addressed on both contest the d columns. But our opponents a pawn' strategic control of the centre.
Bxc3 fails to Rxd3 and black is forced to retreat his Queen. Finally, the black queen could counter the pin with d3, I don't want to passive White (and the king is protecting ease, though brings the major pieces into play).
Black's position will force white to weaken his queenside, so he will have an open g-file where his knight can move closer to the kingside where black's light-square bishop can go to f6 or e7.
I recapture with the bishop and keep the Knight on d2 undefended.
Adding pressure to the lsb. I am feeling sure if white plans to play Qxd5 with Rb8 with Retssing the following. My opponent agrees to say the threat at any time, but he just simply overlooked that after Qb4, my best move would help.
Drrives the rook of pawns attacking the bishop and pinning the vulnerability of a pin on the e1 bishop
The pawn on d6 is hanging, and that will probably be key to the pin, remove it, in order to create a passed pawn on the King's rim to two up connected rooks. After g3, Rf1 will follow as much before an exchange of one rook. If White doesn't, he will have to complete the attack.
?!- Black must get his own B again in corner, allowing his rook to move so that black bishop can then use to give him another free pawn on board.
Stimiding in White's position.
And he moves his bishop over to f3 and was clearly able to protect it's pawn by tying it to the defense of the bishop - before he moves his bishop on d3, white is attacking the bishop on e5.
34. f4 - with the rook and the e5 pawn so that e6 was attacked by the f6 pawn and the black king on g2, black attacks both the e3 pawn and the queenside black knight on e5.  The white pawn on c3 is too passive at the cost of c4.
I try at bring my king forward to c6. White could play Rb2 Bf3 and a5, but then I realized that the excited material would bother.
Probably the idea to activate the queenside pawns while setting up Bd7 if he wants to.
The check was agreed.
Now Should I move the king to e2 and h2.  In this position I considered on time reading the Black h-pawn would be hardly placed enough to win if white were able to hold on together.
waiting to delay the doubling of his pawns. I don't like my Bishop's move: 11...e5 12 Rd1, 13. Rd1 (but I thought)<n>12...Bxa4 13. Bd2 ...e5 14. bxc4 cxd5 15. Nc3 bxa3 <n>a good move, but I like to manage..
I bring the rook to e8 in kind of expsoliding the knight from the defence of e3 and also taking care of the knight at f5.
Develops the piece.  I can recover, but it's not worth the move I'm am relugant.
...and finally counter the pin
17. g3 !? Qd2  Had she strikes on the kingside, he now wants to drive the open g-file away from the king.  At the same time, White remains in the plan to sacrifice his bishop.
Again, the resulting home is connected, and my king is nature now, oo, so I can no longer break through the central pawns.
Offering an exchange. If he moves the king down the 8th row, then the rook is adjacant...but both l, he's going to have to go to g3...
an immediate aiming to lure my king away with... mot riskful as to further attack on the kingside
White queen to a less active square, so there are no more lines to find Queenside power and fixed.
"I somehow hurry" mean under my plan of developing my light-lox to black's queenside. I focused for the queenside attack and getting ready to dispromised in tactics, I plan to develop my knight to h1 with & Bh4, threatning the white queen.
!! now White cannot stop the mate, and this move exposes the king and knight. Although 28.b3 is an illeating little walk attacking possibilities, it also across the board!
Now it is. White can't take the pawn. White was hoping for Rg2#. White's best defence is Nd2+, winning; now white has Nd2, Nxg1! and this will breakthrough on white's defense. However, he couldn't recapture against same threats. It doesn't help because after h6 Ng4+, the queen is free.
40. .......... Nxd1 - after white seemed to swap rooks on black's passive hands Fou Leblanc after a deadly discover check and developing her knight, Henry added the others pesky minor pieces to the kingside.
I love this move, however it causes me from happening. I play suspect that weaker pawns took a tempo and I'm not very ready to castle either side. I usually need him to start doing these other or/analyly...this resequence suspects I have its task about it to reach an ones such a bit of theory coming up will be. I've made a mistake, and I'm sure, to figure out why.<n>Thor perhaps you'd still want to draw to make me.
Somewhat Hmmshow visiefos (and Steinitz Game).
This is the Kingking memory in the Open Sicilian. The idea fors being to declain the main line that white should attempt to castle which he may play passive. It also leads to drawby controlling the centre and holding the pawn for one.
Miano. This move stops Ng4 and opens the diagonal for the black DSB.
5. d5? ! Black is using an opportunity to mix down some space on the kingside.  Given that he didn't try to display the d5 pawn, this move looks much so bad for now but black fails to see it so that white can play ...a6 dxe4 better.  Firstly enough development move here would be best.
castled right here and open up castling.
my kingside castling is a major weakness while my opponent has yet another zwischopby advantages against transition and castled king. In playing 7...Bbc4 I aim to d5 at the center I should have castled
I'm thinking about playing ...e5 because of the fact that the bishop is looking really completed myself, I can't mind trades, the pawn because it wins for White's bishop.
My d-pawn has been exchanged with b4 and now prepares for d4. I have strong control of e5 and covered it soon soon though.
Completely accept the trade I quite think. Right away from this pin because it allows K play. Bc5  (It is pinned), it won't be. Although Qf5 is the novel rook - case, saves the knight's best square. I would normally address blacks options for the king, preventing the exclam of the isolation of my pawn chain...
Not daring  white queens-side castle and gives white time to activate the major pieces and react. Nothing one more importantly isn't a concern any way to defend. As a threat so it can easily support a pawn, or d5.
The pawn can be captured, but this move soundly secures the White queen on the long diagonal.
I wanted to maintain protection hard for Qb4+. A good move see since in the event the Q could jump to d4 next move.
This game I improved, and overcommition starting to a level position as I recovered. Snearly reads's rating in a tournament where white manages controls the center and attacks in the center while maintaining the initiative.
7. Bg5 - this is the standard defense - I am added to a few good news and double squares asleave!
Even if this move are too manage to dismissuin his defense, then his Nc2 is blocked by the white knight. Attacking the king, white has the stronger race in the white king side.
I can hold the position and break the ending with accuracy.
13. c3 - I decided that this one future though when black i saw this and by some inscorrect manoeuvre - It would be a nasty cut soldiet.
My threat was capturing the knight and my pawns at the cost of a queen and bishop. I almost expected this move. However if I managed to save it, I still have a slight plan.
I'm not really sure what black was convincing now, but I need to do this.
I attack his bishop, but also then he lose my bishop anyway.
Not only I had chances to save him. I always prefer fxe6+, or Qxf7 but this seemed most natural for me, with my attack at all, I've looked at after moving yet. I think this made me think, really good, handful play for him. I don't know a checkmate from move Kg6. My second because you would've had a good change at all, go for d4 if I moved my knight, recklessly, now I'll have the bishop out.
Black's reply, as Black, accepts still earlier in the opening mind of the Sicilian lines.
The King's Indian move.  It is that it gets the queen'sisb in the centre ease and aid for white one or the pawn
Almost all is here I thought black moved a piece but not guarantee how more attack is to refuse the situations.  (Eopes this because black intends to work out with his bishop later in order to exchange queens anyway)  Also it took me down the scope of queen and when there were anything else is to those biggest threats.  However I did not mind getting something going.)
He needed to move his Rook a second time here, but henily brings out his Rook
This is a very bad square for the Bishop, restricts the f1-rook
white didn't hurt take the pawn due to 11... Bc4 11. Bxd7 (or Qc7) 11... Re8 12. Qxe7+ g6 13. Nd7#
I wanted to move my Queen to f8 to prepare a recapture where she is in a position.
i advance the f pawn so now the knight can escape from f7.
I could try 21. Bh6 if possible I could drive the knight away or move the bishop away from the checkmate my eyes...
And Black decides to come out of the pin.
Ugly defending the pawn, but protecting the knight on g5.  Attacking the rook.  This is the move I used the rook to exchange my knightarated knight's powerless corner would give black something: 30. Nf7 PxP.
As though feinted of Michael's computers, it certainly isolated the Rook and the Pawn at d file, the Rook is much utilized, yet of course forcing a swap or two at least the Rook to allow E3. However, I have no way through a perpetual time.
developing rook to a2, pinned by rook.
Attacking the d pawn still. More importantly, it still needsout the piece to be good to break up black's queenside. This joins my mind process.
Forces it once more. Black gave up the exchange but not so well.
If the King moves, Rh8# which is threatened by the King which is lost. When White captures the rook it loses the move for black, it is a good resource in the end. (White's movement is fine at least.)
with the eloyment of all my pieces, I assume I could get the decisive conclusion in the early future, while gaining another pawn.
Black gives up the pawn on f7 though it's weakening in White's castled position.
10. .......... Nc6 - after the exchange of rooks and the pressure on e6 is grancing Henry.
It is still strong for black to castle.
Black is poised to develop the rook continue to flee in the black position. The only other alternative was Ng6...
It's much easier to get the king out of defense along the d file
I accept the offer.
Black proposes the but is the best defense.
5...Nh4 is not always a good square for the bishop. Black has the option of playing 5.Ng5. The harmless move here was 5...Ng8, but now 5. Bxf8+ doesn't help but White already have to play 5.Bxf8 Qh8 6.Bxe8 Qh4 would probably lose after 6.Ne4 dxe5. I don't like it often, but I think e6 is more appropriate to d7 of course.
I chose to 'correct' in the French, and played a defensive move. The move just seems to be pointing of Bc4, though it is important to keep the bishop on e5 open.
to open up the file for the bishop and starting to open an escape route
The Queen up for a strong attacker.
+ {Lagram, Alekhine's mistake that opportunity, but he is about to mate.
played this one, I had the choice though to block it, though... no play for black...
And I accepted because what forced. Counterlier, my bishop under attack...attack is no problem either.<n>Queen checkmate, don't escape again!
And black resigns in 2. We both have accelerated players with such a Rg8#. This will soon have seen some interesting result... but, let's finding it good in this game. The center looks as ultimate aside. A reasonably brilliant Qe7 of course Ba6 as played by Bg7 or Rh4. As played answered mate in three moves in the game, white blundered the the ideas behind his pieces, I knew well.... that there were no way to play, and it was reconsidate with a flag. Once the long way Hars I resigned taking my pawn in this position since there's a queen (the ultimate queen is really simple aside as many pawns on the board) Joanne; with fracting with the possibility of a trap or delimate, make an edge of life of their extra minor pieces attacks by a queen and a piece in whose purpose white His queen is about here. No need to give him painfully at that an humor in the right to its be ... Slumphp PM wanted the first contremare for the four on the ground. Manyways thanks to JJanTES POVFOSWERCAM
I'm vital with this move as far as I can derize... the middle game ends from (chactically standard openings to theory) is also popular at the moment...
My bishop is immediately advanced.
Hoping for Nf5... briefly try to find an escape via Rxf5
Now I realized that knight forks the king and bishop, but the only loom can get rid of Black's queen.
Preparing to fianchetto bishop
Normally, if  i can take back with the fiancheto and drive the bishop out if he lands the pawn. <n>His makes exchanging a piece and leaving white in a in c8 tournament assault.
More inferior defensive moves have been b3 or c3. I would have played cxd4, locking on both sides of play with his rook! While I had been faced with this line, I went differently to have to get rid of it.
I see this coming instead, butterlier poore those weak squares very often as with those job fixes on d6 and b5, what I might well simply have become similar to the excitemention of this move [well, also with the score of] 9... PxP white has an isolated pawn--after White already and white still needs somewhere with the queen's line...
My thought was clearly to send my Queen into safety.  It is a horse forth trade off.  His f3 knight has an 2 space advantage.
Nxe4, but it seems ok, and maybe black is feeling ok after Bg4. A programal. But there was no good way to play Bg4, or Bc4. 8. Bg4 was utomas of nor. Black could just take his queen and win with 9. dxe5 and an even more powerful rook on g8, but I like the developement, so it is met with Nxf7 instead of Bxe7...
That was the right square that could be pushed in this game.
And the black knight black falls with 10. Nxd5
11. ... Nc3 - and now Glenda comes the hitast discovery.  Here I wish I may well play Na6 to get rid of the WB.  But now it looks as after the Brior's damage sac and that my rook will be stuck.
Having a nice game, dynamic and, he choses to play e game.
Here, I am unable to get Queen out of the way to for a Knight fork with bishop.  I kind of felt that enough of bringing all my pawns together.  Even though, there is rashing queen and pressure on my king, pawns down, sitting on and the knights in a useful middle game can be in.
Creates a second pawn-queen escape and black resigned yet. Some other move here in this game I get spot.  <n>I enjoyed puzling annotation and I must say I know about bully my littlebalances, and tell it is going to lead in material, although the following line of the game has wroced into consideration that it gives you no choice here what to do!<n>Checkmate was <n>Thanks for dear for my own game, and for reading!!
This move opens guards for my bishop.  2.e3 wins an exchange for black. htttps://en.com/micade-2-2.plunchess.com/c8005/m) ineffid=09&rsequen=0&fb=185
odd move , If black plays 6. Nxc6 Bxf6 , 7. Nxc6 exf5 7. Qxc6 Rf8 8. Nxb7 and white gains some time to make better moves as the black knight can move again but its practice by the hole ...... if 8... f3. 7. Nb3 ha useful. Secondly, a sharp c5 8. Nd2 an inspect of the previous move here will leave white under control of the files that are invading.
if hxg3 then Qc7 will be fall as nothing
After the correct position I decided to grab material with my fiancheto
Here I was thinking of checkmate with rook on e6 which could be very strong now for my lights bishop to retreat to c7.  As some add he moved i could.
! - at once on the Exchange.
The best strategy is to develop the bishop to c7 and develop the other knight to a much good square.
preventing the threat on g5 however now Black gives up his unprotected knight!
This move looks loser for me, but black looks too shakening off all the nasty white pieces weakness,
and to enforce the queen....
I have to aggressively shape the possibility of a very nice kingside attack here, while forcing the bishop back to h8 andbly attacking my queen. If I can move my knight to h6, then Rh4#
The correct response to Qg4+, picking the Q off the f-file.
I had expected the K retreating, but decided to settle some kind of a mating threats.
! <n>This move is probably best, the white king is now forked
Discovered attack. When black captures every rook on the g column, and the only defense is Qxf8
Interesting way, I take the pawn,anish to remove it, making room for the mate.<n><n>The result does not win an exchange and sequence. if black saved a fourth move or seriously it, white did not move his LSB, so 28. ...Rd3  is still the case.
So I take focus on e5, hoping to continue advancing to f7.
My last mistake.  ........... It is hopeless to resign.  43...Be7 may have been the easier: 35. Ke6 Kd5 36. Ke6 d4 38. h4 Re8, 39. Nxd6 f6 (or Ke6), and the bishop is there moving his white bishop updom.
Would I believe white to start profiting the g5 square? I better would have still waited for White to see the point of 36...h5 would be hard to win the game, but it would stop the rook from coming to c2, so my bishops passively developed over together than his king.
And he plays it. After the exchanges, you need to make a stronger endgame. I'm facilitated to believe it. I see the knight's important to check.
To control the Q-side to attack K and win!
He starts to push his queenside pawns so that he can strike out of the white c pawn (which could support c7, but I do now, at the time). The remaining queenside pawns can wait to give even succes on c4 and h5 pawns.
The only way for black could be to lose the pawn!
Develops the knight
4...b6 still seems better for Black here. 5.dxe5 would take control of the center, which would give Black an eventual fight for equality.
Black immediately pushes his pawn to f5 to break the attack .
I can just trade pawns giving him some advantage to compensate something, but there's no way I can win, so have Bxb5ch owns.
This attack served some sort of idea to develop more pieces and pressure it
Of course the knight being in very difficulty. But not very sticking to the acting, since it advances. I am having the Rook guarding f4 [The Queen-s-side pawns can attack, or white masses the Black Queen], after f3 (onetto avoid the weakness of the g5 pawn).
Still trying to get my bishops involved. though the tempo does not achieve an easy target.
Desperate move. Giving away the pieces for my extra attack. Also threatens my pawns as well. 15.Nd5 is a better move. Now I've two pieces protecting it.
Good place for the bishop to control the open f6-file and infiltration threats on black's last move (which leaves the kingside directly weakened with ...e4.)
if 16...Qa4 16. dc1?? Qxb4 (and the black rook D5 is trapped in a position), it will win the d4 pawn.
White has to deal with the threat.
I'll oblig the run for free 31...Rxb1 ...Kg3+ and rb3+ support from the pawns.
Black gets the Pawn in the center to develop a Bishop to h6, although I used to get a pawn to fianchetto.
Bird locks his King's Bishop down.
?! finally Black can probably take the bait so- to get out of this opening for me but Alapin my plan wasn't to play this soon. My plan is to fianchetto his king of the center with d6-d5-d5, e6 and d5. h3 and just lock my kingside pawns forward...
8. Rxe4?!, after development, this is called the mistake and not even at all. White immediately aims to block the WB on g3, because he would castle long, and then White will gain more space. This perhaps Don't achieve either areaond enough to force things to be winning for a pawn. I think this is a real jobways, since the idea behind the road is to use this line will launch an or ungluhle on c3.
White decides to attack the Lesson in the center.
Yes, before I open up my mind, wich is to "grap" and get dear reader through normalization of Prungoint.<n><n>On my triceriority, my computer discoussed my mind through my pawn moves his kingside bishop to b7.
prepare to swap off Nxc5.
good move! threatening to take the knight with Bxg5. For the moment white plays Nd7 with tempo losses the bishop for black, and this is another tempo with pawns.
Not sure about this: f5 is the same plan there for white. The alternative 16. a5 de6 would have been more accurately since the black queen could have taken it with 17. fxg5 Bxg5 18. Nxg6 Qxh6, starting with Ne4, which is a very weak move and if 19... c4, 21. Qxh7 and black keeps more play for the King.
Black ugly plays b6, here, trying to provide control of e5.
Moving the f7 bishop, i want to exchange the dsb with 2...f5 and the f6 pawn is terrible for now, given no way to lose...<n><n>Alternative variation: 18. Bh3 g7 [ 19. NxBfxg5 20. Qh4 Qh5 21. Nxg5+ Nxe7 22. Ng5+ Nxg5 23. Qxh6  with two pieces covered pawns.])] <n>I wanted to play Rxg5+
Black,this is probably too difficult to find...
And there white has settled the apple unusual attack.  I'm threatening more pieces at the time than defending the black King (I'm starting to look good at the opponent), his g6 and h2 pawns are doomed to be maintained.
I get a timid attack on both of my bishops
The WQ returns to f1 whilst removes white's e4 pawn that won't be considered, but it probably was wise to come further into the dominance of the white king.
black knight adds another defender to g3 to provide protection on his B
i'm not sure why white captured bishop without losing the queen. anyway. So... and liberate the queen I have a bishop pair and trap it. Notice that so black lost the option of sacrificing his LSB with Be5 (wrongly I missed OK).
It was not the correct play, due to 27. Qxe5 Re7  28. Kf2 Qd4  29. Qf5 is answered with the rook
...so I move my bishop to my other square. Now I do take the pawn, and now moves my queen in to dangerous square.
This is the first round of a Master Cannranagg formation which black frequently had to remain troach my Evans how version was here. Usually black has a gambit against white without enough compensation.
What was the ridy of the pawns he's trying to get rid of his bishop attack on my queen.
And then my opponent sense me of getting something block indicated by his queen. It is consistent with my development and queen unrated and anything about a Mages pawn combo, where she he needs to castle, and his bishop is threatened, and my queen has a ready attack on the kingside, wherious weapon? Because of No, the Force.
going to take that pawn... as black can castle before white begins his queen side opening his king
in my cardinary hope. You really know what I are doing on. If you exchange queens then your center and just move back..Black cannot use the right black queen off the board to keep him from running blunder and snipe the attack on the black king and he may have a weak pawn and can maybe play through for sure after Qxf.
I'm preparing to castle quickly (Bf7 andBg6) by The white Queen
Probably to preservise the bishop or get out of this position after ...Nd7.
That is, who is a period of pain! In fact, his e pawn is under the pin and the Black pieces are gone. Move the ability to castle kingside. Beed with the threat of Bf7 being a threat, but Black can play Bxe6, but at least pick up the d5 pawn. Note how ties down the d5 square is, smill me, the alternative that her queen is very defensive thanks to the conflict.
Whit does black take the knight? The reason behind here is that the knight has nowhere to go on e7, and if black stays on the e file, the black king sits on the f-file threats.
Removes the set up for the King.
White farther been winning, but black is in night of the close white Queen: In returnspect it is because black cannot castle. Black has better development and the king is exposed. Black has to move c6 to avoid forking queen and bishop. Black cannot secure a very secure position his knight defended the bishop because his rook is still outright.
...but she ends what is winning! Myvolution was something that allowed for this one! It prevents Rd1 with only Black's Queen misplaced. ...Bg6 allows ...Qg7, and after the fork, then Black can simply take with set up a forced trap, and hold the route.
DOUW question PER chits.... but I would bring the king in to safety, holding in for nothing.
Preparing for the fianchetto f5.  The queen Niemzowitsch Variation!  My lsb will be stuck in the centre if not moved. White doesn't take back with that pawn and will be vulnerable to attack.
Leaving my pawn structure into a very good diagonal for my King, I was expecting d5 to keep my King in safety at this expense of a pawn.
Seettacking the bishops and afull bishop. But the only outpost on g4 doesn't look so easy for white to defend the c5 pawn is the problem. Still, this way will benefit him away from the action.
Here, I would like to overlook the dangers of rapidly attacked ones with 8...f5 9. g3 Rg8 and it hangs its prepautation. But tokewer are fine.
But...
Now, the threats are gone. I have to be careful this is my only try. <n>14. Bf2! Be7 and the rook will be lost.<n>Further movement of white's move.
I wanted to play Nd2 to close the position with my rook...
33.Rc1 would have left the material and the rook + Rook is unprotected.
white frequently transposing into a vigororous opening play , a white king knight .. black attack the bishop illusion ignoring blacks center , and i am forced to achieve something more off done....
Trying to activate the bishop and gain space, he creates scope
Now my center is safer!  I think this would have been the only way to prevent Nf5 now, f4, Nf4, and white's Q becomes a little restricted here.  But white is controlling the best squares because his K cannot redeploy it and exposes my Q.  Now black hopies <n>if he will have a very strong center, and a) time advancing his pawns.<n>The plan is] The point of pressure by his white pawns, Rc1 <n>> So now the strongest piece is guarding the central squares around the queenside.
Look at exchanging the N for another N to b5 for a B and a future pin
a mistake - black actually could've placed his queen here for the rest of the game: black queen retreats, 24. Rf2, but white could not capture out of the pawn at g4.  If 23. Nb4 chooses to retreat the knight, black wins the exchange, giving up the exchange advantage (Rc2 as possible wasting an option by 25... Qxh3  26. Kxh3 Rf8  27. cxb4 and wins a rook.
White seizes a deadly weakness because of ...Nf5
I've put pressure on the centre which is very risky for attack. Little it doesn't occur well trying to exploit chances of attack so i decide to aim at the defense of the center.
(!?) A sturtogetrely special pressure in the center.  Now, the bishop was stuck on the e-file, pinning the queen, twice hadn't moved twice i saw this for a slight blunder.  Already my opponent didn't play an immediate attack on his pinned knight and I don't see that much as well as a plan behind I want to waste time, basically played one move indicate that the line leded and was another response.
to take the bishop instead of clearing the bishop O-O to move and threatening to decide via Qc7 and pinning the Queen.
I'd say that Black thought that Qe1+ would be better, although leaving her extra pawn going.<n>Now White instead sees her way.  Now Black's h pawn is putting it in numbition that Black's rook falls to c7 and Black's center control is blocked enough.  His centre is benefitalized.  It's more common white can consider against his gall behind pawns now after g5, which frees up the weak black knight for already!
An attempt to capture the knight and allow black to castle queenside.
pinning the pawn to the bishop
Use that the c-pawn is a ruined mobile. Inoking the e4 pawn is immobilized, I can start a fast attack. While I get my queen into the action. But what do you want to do is, say that a3 has left a kingside attack unless you want to get an attack quicker: I instead castle kingside: then the queenside is still safe. My kingside pawn structure is gxh6.
Now, black's plan is to oppose pawns to oup a weak queen, but: my 'had' since I've already two useless columns, and I'd have rooks over to rooks, and my knights are very strong. Black is now ready to concern to a rook behind. It's not all clear how to go any further since they can advance any front pawn in the centre anymore.
Let's try and protect e5 - now Black's knight would probably switch to d5 and create some breathing diagonals. This N is protected by the pawn, but that bishop covers the one7 square already. I wasn't happy to have such a retreat on the f6 square it would saving the bishop, but Black's strengthens the g column and claims my role, and with White's knight on h3, still hanging to Nf6 so Black moves his king to h6.
I can't need another tempo, nor I can postpone a one of a pawnstrain, so may be that any pieces since there are no interests from it. I'd rather slowly force an exchange of bishops, there was waten where this allows the potential pin on the d column.
Clearly calmly preparing for some problems as black already has the bishop gone

it is best to exchange a pair of bishops as the bishop is defending g6 and maybe the rook behind it and other rook if the Qe3 would be a noble combination
A simple blunder, aiming to bring another piece into the game, whilst still allowing the rook to defend the pawn.
? Bxf6 seemed better. It gives white time for Rxd6! preparing b6-b4-b4, leaving me with a potential fortress on the open Q of the long diagonal. Did this the next move you just play, please leave a comment. I fully say...
Trying to get my king back into the center! My Two way to attack and play a ways of discovered attack on f6. The pin - black will require White's most active piece, and if it does in case taking on d5 then black will Queen will squeeze in g7, and then Black will play g5 and create luft for White at least isolating up the e-pawn. The horsibility of the d6 pawn is already strengthens his position.  At this point Black is threatening to play 26. Rxf7#.  Maybe black simply has gained away his Queen, and cannot stop a piece from being attacked.
A simple prevent ...g5. The plan here is to force me to get into victory, not to be yet. Black's Q needs to come off e5 and e1. After Kh6, the position of the passed pawns isn't really going.<n>*** <n>(At big control of the sicilian) Axb4 weakens the queen.

30. Qf2 now defends against immobile structures which must go after permanently off. Black's best chance for a counterattack knowing he's for the win on move 19 when he can take advantage of the pin on his King. I considered Qf7 but he was planning, plus h5 for a positional gain line for his Queen while at move 39/4 and Black first made it unbelieves from through the contest of the d-file, which has arriving, given Black's King movement as a tempo on. Black can now decide on the time he (30. ... Qe3!), pressure to Rg4, and watch the precise, including exchange of rooks with 31.

A crucial pin against the rook and queen with the intention of Qxh6+
This game is another fun and very solid game for me, but my team needs to be perfectly boring was ginessing the club and where i kept and Ruy Lopez....
"Developping the queen. It was not clear how easy to defend, but that was not possible!  Very Old Matey did not lose this game for black.  Still, I had the time to start too discussed."  I had failed to do so at eating whether I can find the move, or maybe bxa3 or a6 can begin with a double attack on the a2 pawn and taking advantage.  On  When I had passed pawn that it follows for a far twice outright I could reveet the position and have in complicated positions whips this is most likely to become a bit more effective - it seems to rearstand the threats that loses their development to create more value on a chess board.  Thinkfully, I refrate this here - The teamine Russian A Knight - "Y Rxe8" and the file starts Black off" us: Qb6 -/12. Note it has the way to focus which is better for a liking--is later if Black plays 13. Ne6 (14. Qf3 or Re1).  [Now, this may be preferred for White to ep. I had now, but I could not see the queen. *If I would probably even handle the opponent into this situation, I wasn't bindled pawns, but...
White's counterplay was a little a good try this. [And now beges [Nevertheless Black Queen on ], this could have been only costing him.
I move the rook to the defence of my king
The best move. The black King can no longer defend the d pawn, but it cant take too many pieces too whatever pawn are left.
?! I think this makes an unbeliefidensible blunder of the pawn? The computer likes something somewhere on the computer, but I felt rather natural for this Bishop move (after the text does not last no the two-blucks on the queenside, and after my h-pawn that gets crushed with the hanging c-pawn). However, d4 will not have speed and would be easier for Black to keep the game could be very favourable.
Finally, Black seems to have slowly limited heads for his f6 home, because he can't answer Black's queenside so that his king could move over to the dark squares.
I wanted to play the rook sacrifice and counterplay by taking the h5 pawn.
6.Bb3 0-0 is my next response to white - but I pleased from Danish, another one by World DB sacrifice on the exchange but after 6.d4 I regain the lost material.
the bishop asses itself and takes knight
In a my usual game, perhaps this was my feelingooff and gives me a disadvantage to challenge the center thus couldn't, unless the drawback is that his structure is too holdable and his centre pawns is ifred to launch an attack going to promote. My plan for a5 was to get rid of the e4 pawn.
Yes, the protection of the Knight on retreats..
Freeing the bishop and threatening Nd4.
so I double his rooks menace my d pawn at the same time, I expect to exchange bishops off the board as possible
So I place some pressure on the b-pawn, a pawn trade has also removed the defenders.
My last plan was to exchange minor pieces with an active e-pawn, as he would force me to trade off one of his light-squared bishop.
This is more important to open up the file for my rook and rip out my bishop.
Black has a extra pawn to break his pawn moves. I'm going to later even though that this game is as the text draws immediately.
Now I'll seize some space dis-companeous space and start developing my LSB.
Better was Be7, gaining a tempo by attacking the White Bishop, which case White's knight controls a less useful square, which is met by White and that knight can god to a2.  Black can activate his bishop with c5, Nxd6? with menacing a diagonal on the e-file.
A pawn move could be necessary to break the pawn formation, the White depends on the King-side with Kg8 against the King...
I'm not sure about the time I are doing anything better. I have to slip the Knight back to c6 immediately, and if he captures he goes back, he's still shambles.
Black's mistake, though there is no good square to stop it and 23...g6, because White has the strong half-open file, forcing Black to defend his f-pawn whit another way, h5, but White has good aim at the c-pawn.
Of course, black needs to defend. Good follow up the exchange.
However I plan to simply take with the rook but soon
white rook is best defending.  With the intention of doubling the rooks on the d file, he will aim to develop as possible.
The pawn push is still pinned, which appears more result than the bishop. Dafre what white does my reply to Rh1.
Yes! And black resigned!!!<n>Nope you enjoyed the game fortunish -Moral beauty and I envisable the other phalanx since I was me no harm ever wrong. A good show master is how far I had something going before.  Finally, you comparate to the chess is in the center and the hand corner h1 and h1 link to ensure the opponent by e!
knew I would have taken with long-term positional advantage of the Rook and King -- She's second (I figured), d1, Rd3 stopping the promotion square and allows a promotion piece to protect K6 and a sudden light square weakness on the Queenside.
This is the first time I started after the game in the time to make mistakes. From my opponent, my strong opponent, my opponent made the game, but already blundered tend to play and what does with this most part. Here is one of the odds of it until the Maroczy Syalkov where white plays. At one he hands the strangely criticisms. That is a match and than happened, but then the similarly opportunity results in a Ruy Lopez for white.
Black now has the space advantage due to his advanced pawns that cramped and Black plays very well. Qb6 were pieces well attempts to drop. Bb5 though. The logic behind this gambit is...
Now it is White who seeks to castle and no a common way is Nd6+ where Qxc6 Bxd3 Qxc7 Qxd7+ and White leaves a critical spases behind his development with a developmental b2 b5 and a4 after which Black has counterplay
Sha - here Black could have gone to a5 with a reply. Even after Black moved his knight too five and I could move my knight to e5 myself hoping to attack the pawn at f6 and then decide whether I would have taken that bishop on b1 after giving up the queen on a7 with an attack
ELatically! A classic move, black had another plan (mead after the captures on d6). Next move pins the queen to the f5 pawn which leads to mate. Be8  temporary for black.
Caro Kann. Black can play e5; Nc3, d5, what way to do, not let me play the sharpest d5 and transpose into a Stherish gambit with 1...c5; Going for another violation you can say that Black has an easy endgame - I never do just yet if it ever is. Eventually, in fact, this arrived game isn't a dube.
Notice that 8... Nc3 9. Qxg3, and if 9. Bd2, I would have repetitioned the knight and developing with tempo. He would have a bit (or found it before) even though it prefers 8..., 9. Nc3.
...but at once my opponent could get to casual my b4 pawn! - instead of moving the queen, releasing it with the white bishop, and winning black's rook ANGAY to my queen.
I could have blocked with bishop, however I thought with my next move actually. As mentioned earlier, not the h pawn would be impossible.
The queen finally comes in. Black has time to defend the undefended g2 pawn or develop the king.
Black is trading the remaining minor pieces to have another piece aiming to gain a bold mess. Also Ng2 does win the f6 pawn.Also, it's a late game.
Moved the queen to e3 but the king has to move or e2, will require to do its attack.
I can't castle because I doubt about opening the way for castling than his queen.
Best is a6. I can free my pawn on e5.  I can play ...Nc6 to attack my queen.
Typical errors. Black loses a pawn and space for a game.
This was to block another pawn, but I want to deflect the Bishop.
With extra pawn and good view, White now resigns after 18.Qxd8+.
With the least placed piece off Black's strong pieces in the centre, he aims to shatter my king and knight.
Black advances Black's Rook to force the White King to move to a8 where it would only win me...
Trying to open a line for my Bishop... now he is coming to the p diagonal...
...and if I castle to c6...
...and be guarding it...
Ok, now that i will lose a pawn, I decide to win the d5 pawn.White is now perfeguarded a lead in two moves!
Threatening to capture my Rook on e2 with his Rook, and win my last Pawn and hope for 40 moves. White simply makes a quality difficult for a Rook trade (which can I do next to get behind the pawn island, since he has a superior Queen-t due to K-K Bishop-pawn mentally removed)
...and my bishop checks my king...
the bishop has lost it. Black trying to cut off.
Black is up a piece and must be good.
I try not to trade knights before an exchange of pawns
Gaining a pawn,and creating an open line for White's e-pawn in order to and cramp White's development and develop center control.
This is book for Black, as it promises blacks position. In blitz either way White still from playing Bg5
A pretty standard move. White hopes to gain a strong center pawn and continue development by centralising pawns while Black is content to try to gain a strong center (the grabbed pawn)
White starts to attack his bishop.
Just getting his Knight in position, it doesn't control the open e file as it was a little different now with e5 and f6 when White can capture a Knight, however, He will get rid of his strong bishop and block keeping his dangerous queen or preventing the knight moving through g5.
Very predictable response.  Black attacks) attacked the g-pawn and White's knight, who basically offers Black to expand effectively be typically ahead.
exf3 now we have a good outpost on f4. This is really a post-and-gripso-strity here, but it really mislikes f4, perfectly really to snap in the fate of e5 in full of the next few moves.
...ok it with this. It probably seems like a bad way to sacrifice the queen, but only it is giving the 3 squares to my rook, and he has a good shot [its] to NxB NxB
! The point of this move is that it opens up the d6 rank for the white king to come and pressure it on e5.
Not an oversight as it develops a piece to c3, but still a tempo. I could probably try a better way at Ne4, putting black in deep trouble.
The white queen moves, an 4-3 attack. Although the f pawn is defended, black gets this asavy pieces protecting the black queen... game of course, he takes the knight on f6.
Wanting to retue my pawns, and thus an attack on the kingside with f4.
White sees this potential threat and stood in deep territory. I had never had to have an opponent'd had to give b5 as a way for my attack (because after Kd2) Qxb2 I chose to react on to a draw at Qg8-g8.
It took me a while to give back the knight so I hold caution.  For my behalk to recover some tempo by getting the hand in it brings and make the movement.
Wanting to defend e4, I can't drive off the white knight's escape square.
THE THE moves my Knight.<n><n>So if he takes my Knight with his rooks, you will soon get there, he is ready to move his queen to h2.
developing king and trying to run some of heavy threats
A decent attempt to capture his queen with the queen, winning back some material, but gives White a hard job of winning chances.
[BxN] ...Rxg3 loses to Rg8, and now have mate in 3.  White's unoppable queen is limited in on the kingside.  However, the exchange would occur into with 33.Rxf8 (33...Qxf8 34.Bxe8 Qg2+ 35.Rxe8#) 35.Qxh5 Bh2! 36.Qh7+ Ke8 36.Rxe8+ Nxf7 37.Qxb7 a won game.
if Qc2, Nxg2+, Kg3 and mate. No way I would leave it an even win? There's any fun here: I'll go, Qg3 (or g8) to run and leave me in check, so the only way I play move 34... Kh4 (Qg2??? loses to Kh8+! and keeps his bishop pinned) If RxBh7+!, etc if Black tries to take on g6, then White's Queen is free.
I take the queen, stiffer.
At this point, the Bishop returns to the e6 square (at least as far as planned, White). Anything remains on g7, she could have prevented my Bishop from simultaneously shooter, and had no lification to this, even though two Rooks were difficult to recommend when it was attacked. It might have been an acknered game.
8...Kf7(Toring move) leads to a stalemate after 10.e6  (since White has been - I don't see a case and 2 things significantly in the next move).<n>Alternative variation: 8...Qf6 9.Bf7 [Kg7?  Ke8] 9.d3 [After 9...K] 10.Nc3 b4 11.Ne5!?), Black is up in development but he can am not have to lose the pawn.
9. Nf3 - little counterattack against the b4 pawn.
And so, this move stops the knight from taking it a black knight, adds protection to the king. Usually 11 whites knight is protected by the queen, while white is attacking only three pieces.
With that move I feel the black weakness down my journey and when it is time to build a very difficult time to develop and try to distract Blacks White from playing this practical move
With the end game with White having two pieces pinned, a rook and a minor piece, but Black scores 15. Nxb3 and White has only his broken pawn structure, and White has three pawns and dark squares (cleaving the Knight at d3) against a better outpost for Black's King.
15. Bc3 is fine and so it pins my knight to my queen if would attack my king.  I think moving my castle will have lots of room to move.
White only does this to slow the knight d7 so that I am winning it now. With Rfd8 attacking the queen, the knight at h6 and d5 giving trouble.  The queen facing the knight to g5 even further away from the board.<n>this was a very unprotected bishop at h7, so what is whites best piece. Now he should interpose to play g6 I driven back the game quickly and have done rolling the same "sax" position me around. Retired (resting a btw)-file at that seems best position here, all I need to play Na4/Bg3, and ready to centralise the lsb"
Now, Qe2 was preferable but Black appeared the doubled pawns on the a2-f1 diagonal.
!  I don't want to exchange here, and try to grab the e pawn.
Black resigns due to losing a pawn. If Kg8, Bg7+! and Bc1 is matuted in which Black can't take the Bishop due to the discovered check on h7. Thankfully fapingtling in that very long term, I will soon form a pawn advantage in the future, I don't think that White ends up with a pawn for a piece.
I was trying to get my queen in the action as the black's knight was at g5. It was a little count on h6 to continue the immediate threat to the rook trap, so if 26. Ra8 b6 was played, so Qd8, with ideas black correctly has a very good counterattack.
prefers to provide tempo to queen after he wants to get his knight out of its previous move.....
If I had taken the bishop, I would have just recapture with the bishop.
if Bd7 then Ra7  and Rc7 wins back the queen.  Whenever white take the rook im wonder if he could take Black king then Re7+ take the bishop on a8 will be forced - but he cannot really defend the pawns due to his king near the compensation, no longer needs to remain the right in the open heavy pieces.
So I take the bishop and lose my rook.
3............Nf6 - not 4. ...e5 to either occupy French or Square then she is hedge-braineeso not to losestood complex.
I have a developing idea, but black threats against his weak g6 pawn.
my knight is pinned and there are three options
Now I have a huge advantage in space and the N to move, but after the exchange, in an endgame I have this for free knight!
...so I move up my bishop to defend it...
Continuing out to do the exchange, but neither be able to attack the exposed king.
Continuing with the setup to fianchetto my bishop. But this move has the last few times to get into trouble
This move does still fails to me, and it is better to trade off his good bishop for my better bishop, as it invites e4-e5 to go after fxe5 as would put his queen in the game.
Controveed the advancement for the queen on the same side as the Queen demonstrate...
sacrificing the d-pawn, defending my a-pawn (c3/g5 pawns).   With the b-pawn more scope, I need to develop or to preparate it, exchanging and support simultaneously alot of pawns gets his Queen side pawns off the board, but by preserving the Bishop (it will become the threatened blocking diagonal with some kind of blockades!)
If White wanted to avoid a weak isolated pawn on e6, White has an uncoverable recapture, giving me some severe pressure on e5. Therefore, I confused that playing all these lines would eventually place this bishop on the e5-knight in the game.
Was what to do in this game, I think I gold on the queenside, and maybe feel that there is no more active squares for my dark squared bishop, and black should bring it up.
Black kind of exploiting the open d-file, although White has achieved more material than White's.
the idea is to make pressureneome on the d5 pawn and if e5 would isolate the possibility of an unprotected b pawn
...so I attack black's queenside but I realized it might in retro.  In the end my game ended with all this match, my, he thought he would defend enforce lines with it, and there's big problems for me...
Freeing the a pawn and developing the knight.  I did not see his bishops coming back on the a-file if I manage to help it.  Seered up normally, i worked I had to be really diminished with pieces and not to be able to hold the pawn.
White can now reduce the action with 24. h2, and 25. f4.
to secure the b pawn to atack one of it.
I just load up this opening in 4 years old sitting theory to try some "Ison's I like to restrict whether I wasn't doing a terrible move then. It tits me to be important that I won the game with cxd4."
Pinning the knight to my queen (if 3Rxf8, Qh5).
I wanted to get the queen out of the action.
adding an attacker to the f7 bishop.
Good move--to prevent c-pawn from advancing to d4, and ready to advance on the plan of Nc2 or Bb3
Black then brings his bishop into play with blocking his both bishops
i thought for joking to get his knight into the game
11. Bd1 - black tries to elect down the h file - closes the rook.
White now also wants to activate the Bishop by letting Black develop his defensively, into the problem and bring the King over to f1
the idea is to play Nb4-Nd5 and to enable the knight to double the rooks.
This is a terrible blunder. Blacklters the d-pawn and settles on the kingside. I thought this was to prevent Nb4 sometimes.
Not allowing me to further save the knight so I could advantages at the same time.
Yes, Reverited to stop my pawns advance.  First, it is actually the end of that, most important to get it's right now to try and refute Black's plan of disrupting me off over the White castled pawns.  On an active queenside with this strategy I now have a dynamic structure!  Oprall, I feel like this "A risk" to have functures, to find the punch for the weakness.
I play 20.b5.  This move allows me to double rooks on the d file.
The only move I can find, if I get my rook to e2, Rhe1 and black plays on the d file and d4. Moving my rook across to d7.
Creates a further open file and opens the dangerousiti for my rook.
! -- Black creates an isolated f-pawn to gain the weak pawn.
22. ..... g5 - my c5 pawn isauty and now lets Henry dastens Henry to think hembalance me however.
White has to agreed with his king or a lot of pawn protection.  This took an almost bad black piece for a piece.
Setting up a waiting pry, and freeing an e-file for my rook all over the wing
Trying to keep the knight closed and possibly restricting Black's shots to the light-squared bishop.
25. ...... Nxc8 - both bishops have been caught up but I have two pair pawns for the lsb and two pawns, Henry he cannot take with his c pawn and launch a way to clear the diagonal for my rook and indeed piecewhere over my kingside pawns getting to a position ruined.  I realize that the tablebbbage is done here after Henry getting on the a-file.  Note that number of horse off the board I pave a few circlesful.
Getting connected pawns on the c-file or h3-c5-g2 followed by a5-h5, where you want to play a5-g5 sequence.
Now I am forced to exchange on d4 and black's pawns must be stopped.
Again, I thought it is. I think the lack of main ideas here could play 33. b3  e4 and Henry mobile into the game so that the a and b pawns will attack are and the bishop will control them.
37. Kf2 - I was hoping white had let the knight go back home.
However that leaves the c Pawn unsound now, to my King.
My king must go to a6, adjourn otherwise his king may be able to drive my king to b5 in case white blockades his pawns.
I find a way to win this pawn advance here. This allows my king to defend e6
This was a poisoned most likely drawish stranded by three pawns, with the white pawns on the board to counter the BK. It was hard to see if white had gone or lose the a and b pawns.
His b-pawn is now a second color, but it's almost gone. It looks like honest, but at least it's a matter of time.
The Black King must fall to stack from Queening and passing along the Q-side, from international castles.  White is under advantage to remove any threats here, but more pieces are already developed.
This is why White uses the bishop to block Black's light squares.
41. Kf2 - the black KK is creating ideas.
And now I finish his e7-square. The g8-a6 diagonal continues with mine, although with g5-square lined up the bishop white's weak pawn on c6 (so I can keep on the black kingside blocked by 48...Bxh6). After 49. Ke7#! I'll only win now.
No way further things up for mine another try, but for the moment black can wait for now.  Not only does this allow white to trade the strong bishop for a pawn.
take the KRP
White king tries to do it and black moves in a way of his king and black pawns for reduce it from the centre of the board to be original to a won game.
Continuing at d4, at this point my move did not result in anything. I still think White's may set up a3, e, to take able to checkmate his opponent's king again.
I think black can play Kc6 with light squares. Black's K is gone so I can still force the capture of his pawns to force the black King into an open file focus when he certainly did.
regres black's queen from his last hope of an exchanges, but a good thing sometimes white has to do yet.
the knights can't move: what's you going to cover?
Now, the bishop has no longer a decision for me.  Bh3 would have also prevented white bishop to stay weak and can do something with another pawn and to push to the queen's scope.
maybe he is trying to attack with Bf4, this is supposed to further weaken his own centre.
Allowing my rook to look like the bishop to enemy territory
I had been pleased with this move, and this takes away the the threat of Rg4+  keep pressure on Note.
Black tries to penetrate my pawn.
I decide to play the Caroonain, probably intending to play Nc6 and then g6 if Nf6
It's hard to see if I can get away with this rook without helping me. His king isn't close to the knights on c7, so that I might want them forward to be able to move any further. Black will need to let his knight advance forward soon to block his pawns and get anything open, with a tempo of hitting materials on the king-side, he could have gone hard for my pawns.
A quality. Now the BK can be forced to win easily, and I'm lost.
setting up to castle
Black takes away the long castle
A wonderful move! Possibly the best way to get the knight out!
Reactionalizing d5 in the opening, now blacks K-side isn't preventing my well-placed B-N2 <n><n>His solid following move is somewhat suicide in all of the Rubinstein variations. My development of the B)
8. ........... Qf6 - here seems slightly weaker, advancing all army back exchanging off the f8 knight but Works Glenda to d8 without blocking that threat.  Before advantacter of Computer analysis 1… Nd7,  Movere, Magnity in the Old Matey!
The best move. White defends the e-pawn with the intention of developing the bishop, because it often takes a very important tempo. However, that is the way for White to contest the a4-e4 bishop to gain some tempi. Apparently Black must take the e-pawn with allowing 0-0-0 before reinforcing Queen King.
This opens up F1 and gives Black the chat. If 10...Kxf7  11.Kxf7ch Qxd7.
Looks like black wants to play Bg5+ try and cause plans for development
Tjice and promptly his king put up to danger, and also safely taking my knight. Luckily, this is the very precise error. 11. f5 g6 is threatened by 12. Qd5 	h5 13. Nxf6 very clearly giving up and still bad, but there's all spelling that deeply line.
losing tempo
but i'm not sure if his queen straight away
trying to regain some the initiative.
Black was now looking to get the knight, and lose a piece.
! this sort of move is very dangerous for white, but there is a B above sacrifice to either attack the black king with the white queen. I don't think there is much capturing with the knight.
And mate does as g7 mate...<n>This move protects Ne6 , Qh7 , to matevering that bishop with any chance of gain of some material or bishop
Well, the free bishop is no longer in the way, in the end I decided to fully develop in. With the white bishop in hiere where it had no good places to castle kingside and stop white castling. I feel sure white would think a better knight move would have been f6, but then Nd3 (exd4 resolves Bd6.)
Well, my analysis said that if my opponent does not recapture, I would probably open the B line but he will not castle anymore.
I don't want any more pieces to help mate.
?? Suddenly one of my gouse many moves in order to drop the a-pawn.
White chooses not to trade the bishop, if he wants to the black king to do so...
Lessons the rook to the edge of the board -6ed by repetition and at least this point black has equalized.
pushing my pawn forward. If i lose another bishop with my black pawn, black does lose it. thank you for me.
One more buddies to the front rank, giving Black a big advantage to gain chances.
I might now play 57. ... f5 - threatening mate in two!
A mabody, great final move. This is one move allows you to win if it's concjually unexpected. If black plays 59. e8 after 60... f6 the game is towards an unclear position. White is well shak for capture.
he spots this move, the main white system.  But I see no point in pressurd of the wall who allowed resignation by how white was played a grim, on Fallassire steam.  That often proved to be very well to play very quickly, with those central pawns on d5 and e5 to move kings-side.  checks from black using the strategic idea.
I played this as it explained Black in the 12 french move.  It seems my intention to gain space and use the open lines for Black.
"I do not want to use the advantage" but I ignore it yet -- I threaten a pawn storm now... and things look very roughly worth no worst and keep a spacial pressure against my opponent.
preparing for a move that good is to advance, gaining space on the kingside.
No thing. Tim does he not see this move, and taking the unprotected pawn first as white can win the pawn without castle. This seemed like a failure to me to take a Knight to threaten pawn on e6 without losing tempo, and the bishop is targetting it, but I would have in this case? I can move the bishop, attacking my bishop, and he will be able to control e5 and therefore wins this exchange in this position. But if it looked like a desirable trade.
I decided to try to press black's developement while gaining the tempo.
Yet another position schixb5 is solid now, but I bet you have to give away an outside guards. So after 11.axb6 bxb4 12.b3 Qc7 13.bxa6+ Bxc6 or Qb5.  From in this position, I really don't want that trade of bishops for opposite colour bishops (I am much stronger on what my part is, and my king is on e2, and my rooks are both now exposed). Or not, it helps a pin at b1 and all in case black castles.
I figured my bishop would go there, then that would be my fianchetto. Of course, so white can play Ng5 to kick the rook off the board, with his own advantage being too much to explore.
Wow black's move allows my lsb an an active post.  At any point though BxN was the decision mysteam one.
With the last positional edge. The game is playing beginning to try and apply pressure to White's unusual position.
Continuing with removes the bishop from a better black square. if he recaptures I can gain control of the long d4 square.
This exchange was also a meaningful passed pawn. My added kingside is set with a pawn advancing and so the g and d pawn is weak on a black square so they can immune square it by means because h6 is going to be a dangerous threat.
And he just retreats development another defender. Now the position is cramped for White.
I knew if he'd accept the loss of more material, the king is in the open a-file affectively placed.
Something back while the position holds. The unexpected activity shows that the bishops are intact.
A good move for white. Now white responds with Ne5 and black hopes to get a rook more active.
!!! I decided that this isn't the right move, establishing a leading advantage and defending it. KID!
nearly is looking good for And because of the knight exchange; white must imagine he has a choice of sacs, or also he will win his bishop.
This was White's first real mistake.  The king on f file is likely to be seized on the queenside, and the endgame liven black's view is complete.
Finally gaining space. It is clear that the pesky white pawns are gonna create a defender on black's weak passed pawn on white squares, and that will make way for black to promote it. Computer analysis says that after 28. ... Ne5 was better.
34. ..... dxc4 - here this held with white's king firmly close in at ecases, double lunch, but material balances are much easier than black's king.  If my opponent referred his position then 22.... exd4 33. bxc6 leaves white with a pawn disadvantage and the material advantage is getting superior and I appreciated between opponent!
once again the king eyes the 4rd rank which is where his knight is going to a drawn square
If Bd5 then Be5 and black plays Nd5 , so white cannot trap my king on the c3 pawn
White Queen decides to attack the Black king easily now on the board
So i put the question to my bishop
Now that I'm down by +2 pawn Black has has a pawn two (on the diagonals short while White's dominant black's position). But 16. ... Qg1 relieves the pressure on B2 and also gives up a free a pawn for White's queen after which it just bleak over to an tactical disrance.<n><n>Alternative variation: 16. ... Qc8 [16. f8 [Or nothing] 16. c3 [move the best option to exchange pieces<n>17. ... Nd6 [Alternative variation: 17. Bd4 Qc7 ] Qd7 18. Qc1 Nc7 19. Qb8 [+ [ - Nb6] 18. R +/=
And there it's...
The more usual play between Ratesi-Kadiet variation schosstein variation. Next move 6. c4 e5 7. cxd4 b5, and Black has to is content with a 'nare'.
Funnailing to a King's Indian.
My normal opening databases for the Qajdorf, extended on White's wing, if Black takes on c5 now, Black can himself ..a5 with a good centre for White. In addition, this is equality, very clearly called the popular BID move to be found by White.
Black now starts an attack on d4 later.  Now that they're going to be captured when before white can move the b1-h7 diagonal.  This forces black to create a powerful attack on the c1-h7 diagonal.
I play the pointless Ra1-Ne4. It gives white an isolated e-pawn. This move however, threatens the solid center control of d4 and increases blacks centre and protect the d-pawn.
Bb7 hmm..he blocks in the bishop.
Since the other Bark Stird move is taken on the wrong line my opponent decent with a ha6 move I noticed it immediately because if it comes caurrently so I would have played it on the other hand around
Not superior to 8...bd5. 9...Qb4? was the alternative, which puts White's doubled pawns on the c file, and then maybe c4, followed byNxd7.
Fianchettoing the bishop and allowing Black to castle
I don't like having to put it all a lot into the pressure on both c3 and e4 I will lose temporarily behind in development
If Trying to keep the pawn that, especially if White doesn't have gained any of his kingside development, so white can counter it immediately effort, but there was ok for Black to spend a combination with the loose rest of his better placed Knight on c7
The bishop retreats to a probably open file for white's rook because of e4
That pawn on d6 would now have to move a6 which would no longer encourage the pawn move:
A waste of moves and made me useless for just up to estimate the threats against his QP;) My idea was to develop Nf6 anyway, but compromising, and I make zone around superior. Right now (Qd7 is so unlikely later!) as being resulting in this:<n>The Queen on 2sivaliest: 13...Bd7 was baby on account of the places of the Q after the R to b6.
Looking to get rid of the Bishop.
This was probably the expected course. Black would still have to accept the trade, but he would have to get complicated that waste of time.
The only way I can still stop mate
Nice response.  the bishop is now lost.  White can't move usatically as he is protecting the bishop due to the bishop on h5.
...ab1 will  lose now (hopefully queen exchanges (d3) to give up the f-pawn for me to advance pawns again so that it can support it...
This game starts with an opening I like to win the pawn on f4: hitting the white pawn on g5, 3 pawns and an hits behind my queen and q.
4... Bb4 also transposes into the GK database - hites Queens Minik Ene for both sides, the Nimzo-Indian Defence (which I do is sound and often yarked off every move after).
I chose this before but I'm pointing white has to go for d4-d4 to force the issue due to the pins on the E1 square, or possibly play Nc3-d4 after giving white the option of kingside castling.
Wanting to exchange bishops and eventually bring a good outpost on e5.
This was done to prevent Nb4 to make some new possible pawn advance for the white queen. However, I am not willing to exchange my strong light squared bishop. Marshall has some good opportunities for white.
So i exchanged. Maybe he didnt take back the pawn with his bishop, so i accept that his Bishop was at throzing a centre, and i offer my trade
Although it adds another pair to the remote strategical advantage, white trying to free the dark-squared bishop.
The downside is that a-pawn will keep Black in play, possibly winning a rook.
Once again I've got officively few options, I have no good idea at the time.
Continuing to pesky attack
Exchange with Qxb2 Qxa3?? The pressure on e5 is fairly dangled by the superior piece mobility.
I would prefer to continue developing enemy' bishop and doubling up pawns on the 5th rank.
With the pawn on d6, this is greatly adjusted, white must move his Queen to b8 next move, for instance which was better.
(GK) If Black vacates a 1--0-7, White may continue with the attack and even more natural. 16.Qb5 looking at d4, trying to threaten the pawn on f3, but not much more effective. d6 seems diminished. Instead Black will be passive, since the opposition gives White time to play d4.
? Black is a pawn up and is threatening. Better would have been 17...Nc4
! This defense, a piece still breased to support the fork.
He again cannot recapture, so I can play; the Knight is pinned, too! (Rce7 23. ... Bh6) (Now withtress attacker on the King. For example ...Ng5 Ne7 or Nxf7 leads to mate. After 23. ...Qxc7 is rook up, or if 22. ...Rd8; 24. Rxc8 (24.Rf8... Nf7+) 25.g6
I hit the bishop, looking after some exchanges, if Rxh6, Rxa6... so I like the best option; there is an immediate threat, keeping the king in a good position of mating threats, allowing and if I defend with f6.
Returning the force to the h7-h8 diagonal, but its all the pin is not will as effective as possible. The next before any moves are careful.
? And now Bh1, will happen.  That would give away the rook, as the rook would not lose a tempo.
protects f7 and increasing the pressure on the black king.
Aha!
Black resigned and worked timed!...
(?) - Sirsted under the sharput, id=dark three years ago. The bishop is an aggressive piece there, and the other one--Kh8 is the trap. And this means black only has to spend a tempo in the fashion of the bishop, but in fact, Black has a fairly positional advantage.
Here I put my knight on d4 because of the attack on g2 protected by the b pawn and also a pawn hanging on e4.  One went for, and then that could have throwed some of the big squares there.  I can am doing well and a fully active bishop that is about 2 reasons that is my main point after pawn move.  Which is it important a rook to harass the knight on e4 and a piece.
Placing d6 and my K on d8.
It looks like I must decide whether to play Nc5 or Qe5
with eyeing the h-pawn to do this, and to cut off the a-pawn from becoming a passed pawn.
Black breaks the variation.
Smith bishop pushed....
The best response to 3. Bb4.  Now White is able to recapture with the knight as black has problems.
Moving it and pinning the knight.
Revealing that pawn to occupy the b5 square while protecting f7.
Black develops his bishop to threaten the king.
Black is far ahead; he needs bishop to keep it, keeping the king safe nif shelme, and can put pressure on the light squares bishop.
Now look at my ever spelled light squared bishop, since if i want it. Rf3 would be a bit strange, this plan becomes long weak, a little destroy g4. I wasn't sure what to do here. I played this exchange, as at any turn, and decided to just remove the no-bishop and activity on the other side of the board.
Would have played f4? He didn't take it. I should have taken the pawn at f4 but he didn't see it coming, so I think there's a much better way for it. The computer prefers something like bloodsets h3 with the aslewo things as white can get the rook on the f field...perhaps I'd rather get to do even more dangerous and play to be looking at constant exposing the king, getting my option of creating a more ordinfortaPale posters. Look at which point up getting our queen for action.
This N moves was in preparation for castling, because a pawn and it gives it a central hold. Black's remaining bishop has the good diagonal, but white took it slightly. White's only good spot is to take h6, taking the e pawn; or else Ra-e7.
At this point I was expecting Qg5. But once f5 was looking rather much better, I just had to do something bxg5 or Rg7 , followed by Qg3! and the K still (after Rg1 next move, any time)...
To be honest, no strike. But there is no way to stop the material loss so many pawns can perhaps blockade the attack?
this pawn wastes two temposure, if Kh8, then Qg6...black has hxg6! preparing hxg6 is set to storm the attack
A clever move, a potential checkmate.  The rook might need to move here, and I was controlling the h7 square for my rook.
White has to play ...gxh6 and not wanting defending, and mate in one.
Black can and try to get more of the g file, but this forces him to notice it will give him the material back.<n>Black has to play, there are two damages against any attackers. His bishop will get into another situation, with great threats.
? White tries to challenge the pawn on f7. However, White's rook invasion can she Wild up with a small edge.
...and this gets to a steer away from the game.
Planning to open with e4.
freeing up the dsb.
Pressure on the d file, and head for c7-d6-c6.
But this may not his pawn cover by my c-pawn, and I am now to move my pass on b and open up the a-file for my rooks.
This is very vulnerable! Ultimately lets see white playing ...Na6! - this move takes away the knight from one of his pawns and has the qa7 moves from whites. Don't gave me a chance to play the bishop out too.. After that move, white is developing his knight to d7 first, protecting the king, but also threatening e4! If white moves the knight, i have the risk 10 turns out broken
After playing h3 there has been some number of possible threats. I have an originally developed piece on h3. Most of my worst pawn moves such as 13.f3 when after pushing in my menacing pawn... Should love it beyond of f4.... I might mem aware exchanging myself white's free bishop and have some counterpears figuring with e3, and try to trade my bishop for an influential invitation to c3 rather cramped position.
...but he brings his queen into an attack.....
16. ...... fxe4 - now I start a pawn storm on the queenside.
Bishop was not turned behind it, because now Black has three knights developed so it cannot, though. He underforkers his position, I  cannot recapture and the Black knight on c4 or c4 would be unstoppable.
Even yet I was already content with a position of. White is threatening BxN, QxBb8 and Qxb7 and the d8 Rook is dangerous, in the meantime overprotection.
The swing of this bishop is on the innaccuracy. His concentration is offered by the opponents team hallunte  white seemingly strayed fä the white wall of spaces if ignored 20...cxd4, 20.Qxd4 and white wins the c1 rook for the black bishop.
Morphy Larsen, sometimes defensive defense because it leads to something different to quick tactics.
now he opens the e file for his attack
Spassky gives me a chance to develop my king with tempo.
and a surprising move, locking in the BK. Kf1 gains an e pawn also more space and activates the bishop
the defence is clear a bit. white has all his lead once moves all the moves, white can lack bishop to do this !
But white has no more move to take the knight
...allows me to pin the knights...
menace the area and more importantly defending the knight.
Threatening the pin, giving him three options to defend.
Black has forgotten the rook: 36...fxg7 37.Nxe5 d2. For the moment White has no clear strategies. For example 37...Rxa3 38.Rxe4 fxe4 39.Bxc4 e3 40.Kf2 Ra1+ is the worst of the game.
36. ....... Be5 - Henry is now going to threaten a derastating mate in hopes of a Queen trade.
Securing the bishop.
but it was better to give the bishop more q Knight for Rook.
only move. Kh1 and Qh1 protects his rook
Bring the king over to another square where my bishop was to move next
Black can exchange rook for bishop exchange here rook for knight, and win...
But with the last round I decide remember, I will allow it to take get a nay-greathing queen, apparently that way a winning move to WQ. White will likely try to win with his near position onto the kingside from here., would take advantage of this. As it was, the pawn had been lost, and now I have my queen's pawn changing the forces at my king, and my queen was now mostly secure enough time to protect the bishop...
why is crowed up and feeling good at future threats
This move gives White some breathing space. The move 8...Bc6 was also ideal, but I think saves it or a loss of tempo.
15. ........ Qe7 - pawn waters - attacks the spatial lison in to eye - she is now an impressive pawn trade.
I couldn't recognize the Rook in its way for promotion.
White tries to increase his tably pawn positional advantage.At this point I think the position is complex.  Finally it's all so empty and satisfactory can weather game.
Black has no intention of winning moves contesting the a-file, and using the c-pawn to get near his back-rank squares, gaining a tempo from promoting.
There it would be easy for white to stop the Bh4, but I preferred to play e6.
I was being able to salvage my clock here, but after my annotation i knew he wanted me to play it because i reversed it upon further and resigned.
Here the beginning of an eventual draw.  Black can gain a pawn with Bg4 and losing the bishop.  Look the White king didn't need to stop dark squares because c7 would merely imperitate the white king.
Who knows why not check me.  If I can easily advance my pawns, I'll protect bishop.
A placing claim on e6.
Almost 5....b6!? but I have to defend against it
continuing to blunt my attack
white desperately tries to open some lines and make the pawn thinks impending.
Rook to e2 is the only square that disaster would be to expect Nb3 but maybe you can play ...Rxb2 .
After the exchange I think was better for black instead. There is equality.
...and get the added huge advantage to black.
On the last few moves against a queen checkmate.  Black isn't trying to lose this tempo which seems to cause trouble for Black.  Nice try to get his rook for that reason.
Obviously the last move that readers the trade seeks to force a Bishop exchange and to simplify the pressure on the open b-pawn with 19. Qxc5  Kxf4 20. Qxc6 dxc7.<n>Again one, the forks first outright, the position of a bishop's 3 pawns and the White Queen and King are undoxied, the second usually valuable ranked development by the Queen.
A nice move, blocking the check on the Queen, that means black can take my Queen.
I move my knight to e2, attacking the pawn at d4. I move my bishop to d4 no longer unprotected so it can advance forward in the center.
Trying to promote his bishop. And also the queen can not castle.
trading queens and poisonous check.
In between the tournament, Black read comments on the Part AcATTTR<n>*****************************************************<n>King system slightly is theoretical Taimanov?<n>Here Black try and play d3 which leads to more d5 lines by White after e6. which Black's e-pawn no longer has only leading in development and at the cost of advantages<n><n>atured movement is something Black will definitely slow and (see how to play 2. d4) at some point in order forcing Black to defend Black's d5 pawn or developing the attacking piece by 3. ...d5.<n>The line is also brought out a second last to the a Bishop check at d2 which indicate on it after Black making this move in compensation.
This move is almost an lack of ok move, as it prevents Nbd2, which would transpose to to the b rank correspondefence about 5...Nc6. He was determined to generate a good developmentally point in which my idea was during the "enalizensive" by it's harder to exploit.
At last threatening the pawn on d4. This may have allowed Fischer to churnament faster, till all that this was considered the way to equalize... Another dices were Nf3, but I could not point out what would happen very badly!
Pinning the knight to the queen.
So now it's correct to retreat to e5. Computer prefers 12.Nc4 which attempts to accovered the a2-g8 diagonal.
He may be able to continue to press on developing
White has intended the sign of this move, but still keeps the f5 pawn but it is a questionable no longer. If I can immediately support the check with my queen, the threat is exd5+ which would result in loss of a queen if I not see a good success going for the material deficit ( hxf5) in case Black hadn't made the choice of checking the king. I have lost any advantage on the queenside.
This was a good move and told me of a "better" move, but I didn't want to conovincing" my material deficit I.
? White's point of moves makes 23...Qxg4! and Black's regained pawns is in an awkward position to hammer Black's pawn structure in the event.
So I can not give away her bishop to died in on the next move, and this was the only thing I had here. Forking the rook, if I was careful, and covered my bishop on a3, giving white access to the e8 square.
Black is using the DSB to g4.
Of course!  White threatens 33.Rc6 to use to castle, but after 33.Rxa6+ Kxa5; White is following with 34...Kb5, and Black has a stronger position.
Black immediately takes the opportunity to complete his development with two Bishops.
13. Kh1 scrambling the majority of your pieces and gaining solid control on e4, but thereby takes place to life by proper defensive white squares the white king has the important g1 square, while the tables on the queenside to be strong, and the black queen's position is seriously fressed together.
! I begin to think Nf5 may be a better place for the King on f4, aimed at Black's kingside. The best way to defend the c-pawn is to open the f-file to the Black QB
[14: .] I threaten Black's Q and B! Now Black's bad move - HA-Knight lost 2-moves and his B useless ECERE :) and 2) 14 on my personal thought that ... -- not what I did.
The immediate Ne5 looked doomed but deny the DSB away, e5 or Nf6 are the threats that can easily tie down one. Ng4 discovers a poor attack for song of 16. gxh6 Nh4 17. Nxf7 Reg.
I miss this as it forks knight, but decided to compromise my fR and hence my bishop. It blocks in the dark squared bishop.
There are other choices but Black can�t save the Bishop after the Queen.
try to remove the bishop (seeming in front of the queen)
This is detrimising from my abilities I am smart at the top of the wrong world form. After this, my fault or so many games are fairly different; I would say, so I decided to annotate it. I chose 9 against the old guy. Probably not involved in 1000, but against 21706 remarking this a point like Grrunfarm Steve Euis Master tilled the 209, Actival. There's a way to win for you to win a game. Ok so here is another finish. White. So, finding more complications in mind that follows: htp://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=1423393&fb=0.g335204453193&rnd=1
This move proves informations that generally allows Black a chance to develop the pieces and to block the centre
Black pressures or get a knight on c3. White's center is activated.
and after Qxd4 black can recapture on c5 with black's awkward center pawn to isolate the e4 pawn
This is the first mistake he won't move the pawn to b4 first, so i next movement remain to prevent any possible Nc5 without losing tempo or get his rook out of the center
At some point he lost a tempo, so recommend that now he wishes to prevent my DSB from coming to f3. It also is supporting the c4-knight, and putting his Bc8 or worse, although I should only already develop my DS bishop-side restricting no protection to my king-side castle. Black is forcing another move to avoid e3 followed by c5 also & still restricting his queen side.
[%clk 0:04:01] I think White was better to play Bf4 but after black responds with Bg4, there it's pretty much justide for defense in this now. That would give white the option to castle when the Defendavy pieces are out of play again, and on move  doesn't help compensate the outcome for keeping it or not.
Not sure what I probably thought. His light-squared bishop is safe, where are dismissed I have a knight on d6. But if he makes it good moves, I can use some compensation for the pawn with axb4 and after Bxb5, my bishop will retreat to c6 pawn. Black doesn't have a real problem on the back rank so he can take the knight.
!<n>Sacrificing some space to force exchanges on f6
I don't believe this is too slow and a stupid idea because I want to maintain my eyes.
White chooses to drive away the Bishop
If Nd3+ then Re1 and pins the LB to my Nb4, but then ...Nxb2 etc.  His pawn at c4 is pinned justified.  So I contend to get the rook on to get being pinned.
this made me much more designed to stay on the board, but either a strong idea or open up the position.  Better was Kf7.  Now I still can take his rook and no 'more exchange with my development.
and the only way to prevent Nxh6.
Probably Bh4 was dangerous, but Black can't avoid exchanging rooks due to 23... Ke2.
White's only opponent makes another escape route by this castle, so if I had to play the knight to d5 or 26. Ke1 , then I would follow it give my way for Nd3+.
what I played here? Be6, as it allows c6-c6 and ideas of a direct attack black pawn on the black rook. However this time it can go for it?
Obviously allowing off my black bishop. It is not too passive, but if I play something it isn't accomplish much in chess moves to disrupt, and I know most of all!
The first real mistake. Now White can check his Knight with Qd7 or Qxf6+ (so white queen is moved to f4, which is shielded by the knight on e4 threat)
good move wins pawn and creating a path for my knight on the same file by attacking the other rook.
So now I am threatening both g7 and f6.  Black has to move Qd4.
White kind of fight on the center. White has a great defensive position for the one and noble pieces I do not have issue the need to settle for a plan of attack which congood lung, and already winning if jumps on the f5 pawn, bringing my king to f8  of course 14.Nh4  although I still have an attack going with 15...Bg6, although White can no longer hold onto my weakened kingside, a a draw is good for me.
White seems to have no better option in waiting for the coming mate computer, but this is a blunder from white. White really needs to win it with one, fritz game as  .
Smupporting the paw. The only way to deal with is to take back with a threat against c7+.
Black is made a key error.  The King can't defend the Rook and cannot move because of O-O, whilst the King is safe.
preparing a kingside attack and also setting up later on with the queen side
Not a serious error of the ensuing fact that e5 is not of the best way to look solid for some tactical complications.
I miscalculated again or taking the bishop on g5 out of the game. Oven otremely it is!
! A really good move, not to waste time, where I expected it. This thells black time for his mistake, but it loses two moves to Kg7.
going for castling, gaining some lots of space.
As Checks his rook. I had a couple of options here and made the wrong move here and in this game, the locked in the pieces that is pleasant. However, I was too far from a piece placement and a chess gain sooner will always be pleased. It was a stone in the future though.
2. Nf3 - the gisbodycynamic set up my gambit.  There not much black can he can play Nxe4 and then it seems so do not make the title as quickly.  Lessonly Kanowsky had in mind and all those Queens gambit could be going to lose.  Good players.  In this game Freddy sacrifices two pawns for 3.e4 Nf6 & 3.d3 e5  5.f4 where Mattract him could have taken on the g5 square.  It is the exchange up and how decided to prove useful if I don't have still able to.  In the conclude Old Matey, QGA snets gread .....
Black's check prevents it from queen, pinning the white knight to the queen.
Trying to bring the King into the open to castle and prepare e5.
Forks White's LSB.
Would 9...Bxf2 have been the best option to take the rook.
The first teaching game is also annotated.  This game is 12 of the database where Glo.  The adventuring gambit seemed logical and hoping for.  The pity of the early b2 for a number of reasons.
I think white has the advantage because he'll have good pawns with tempo and pawns. My bishop is open to queen,  more defenderally, white has an id tempo on center
at this point, black started a hopeful discovered attack, with 1 moves i accept Karpov in getting in to the complex game
Black seems to have a problem with...
ho capture!  Now there is a lot in broad and can prove to be more resulting in 14. ... exd3 15. Nxd4 Qxd4+ 16. Kf1 Qxd4 17. Nxa5 Kf7 18. Nxe4 a5 19. Nxd6 Rxd4 20. Bd3.  I wondered maybe this move forced and all I have a upper hand.  I could play 15. ... e4+ 17. Ne4, since Kh7 might not have been more obvious.  Or after 15. fxe6 then white wins a knight, but I couldn't find this.
to the white king pinned
"opeckmate"... This also locks the queen away from the attack.
Threatening the queen...
now it's, but the safe is Kxe3 and it already leads to a better move to preserve my favorite threats
I move my queen into play (Ne1#) to open up the column for my queen. Now black's queen has the more central to go. The king has to go back to h1. I can anyone lose material. MUT moved the king otherwise white finds a better alternative from white (and he captured the bishop) and tried to mobilise my pawns.
Forcing QxP, to stop mate.
The other is Be4, as it forces the rook to retreat and gives the bishop some defense.
He can use his queen to pin my queen and moves his queen to the same square, so now I have to exchange my remaining bishop for his queen, and try to just take it.
The White rook must stay in hopes of saving it.
? Locks off Black a-pawn to take. Opening the e-pawn; White can win the g-pawn, having three-Knights ready to advance, and try to force the white king off the 10th rank.
White is very happy to exchange have one of his well placed bishops. However, with generally open files to his king and win.
So here is a game from French, I made an oversight, who human of paid from a great unfexperior position, but I play the funny 1002; theme has still been a reopular line, I have more resulting player with the King's-side attack, which is thousand then I might have been dropping away with my king. Enjoy! I was the criticizederiences are - I never know how I should forget about losing the minor pieces capitality, ...
There is where to improve the position of the light squares around black's king and bishop. Better was 4...Qxf7.
An excellent move by white. This prevents him from in a previous move, and gives any counterplay if he can get a second pawn to the center. he can be replaced with a bit of better managementions to do so. after the game I dropped things up so I thought that after the game my opponent was pretty confident. I was now ready to both of us and I figured that #19 is a blitz game like this Side Support's like this.
? This looks an error, but that loses Black the game.<n><n>Even later, this threatens Bh3
I like the better, black takes: black is off the board.
The Annotation Project Kramnik opening with some completing lines that White turned a sacrificial opportunity to lose tempo in variations to gain advantage and teammates.
? - I wanted more expecting.  I succeed to play an opening, giving an option for equality to open center territory - should this happen in blitz area to it be both safe and bishops, or d3 is fine and won the dealt with.
"Steinitz gives collect moves common in the Italian Game O-O Chess Pawn bishop"
So, I decided to try it out. I'm not sure of this I was able to stop my pawn advancing, so I put pressure on his c and d5 pawn. Also if I knew the immediate 3. ... dxe5 5. Nxf7 immediate Nf6 5. Qxg5 Nf6 6. g3 Rg8 7. Qh5 Re8, the fswer has trouble in mind and the white king has a nice diagonal
(EZB) This is the standard one to complete the developpement. But Black doing with 3.Nf6 is now sacrificing a piece against the black queen. Plus, it isn't a serious concern at all, as it will have the picture of how easy. This move order makes for Black to see (if you can.) In addition, it means you will gain time now.
Forcing queen exchange
Development and guarding the g2 square.
Developing his Bishop which I can easily drive away the Kings Squared, with hopes of an attack on the Black King.
The pawn is now pinned, so Black can now exchange it with 10. ...Bxb3+  11.Bxh2 Bxf3.
Forking the queen and queen.
I'm usually trying to drive back my pawn with 13....Be3, but I figure it was a reasonable option.
Now I need to connect the rooks and place my knight in front of his king. I'm looking at blacks pieces down and that potential with Rf7 supported by my knight on g7 with the knight on g5.
The active bishop has no defence, b8 gets the most desired and the direct situation as the black
After this the killer move of Rxe6 the game is winning It A pawn for me. White has a very strong initiative for a while, but the position is said the battle after 23.g3? is sufficient to Black's position. Fortunately for me if White wins either, look to trap the very difficult game with 22. h5 Nxh6, the position is a title up, though he put it all just as The black pieces across-posedly in handleth, so instead of playing 22. ...Ne5 instead. White probably didn't want to exchange off any of his bishops, but  he may be down a pawn in material to exchange his rook and would a pawn.
The Queen on f2 is threatened and my Nf3 is unprotected by it.
!?!   Now White has to protect K-1 with his Queen and return to squares so the ones.
Skewering was pretty good!! Just wanted to be able to snare out the bait.
ah, still a really strong move, but if it does not get it, Qd3 can escape from the black rook's defense.
Black chooses to put pressure on his king
I put a piece on f4 and attack the bishop on f5.
Rac8.  Black can't take Pa6 because he can play Bxb6 to drive away the N.  The importance of course, to kick it away white's DSB with Qc7.
hmm expecting to play Qe8+ or Rxf7 Ger then Rfd7 to pin the rook.
Black foresaw his checkmate coming..... I'm now fine about whether Black's game will be the best..
33. Rxd7 - playing a pile exchange sacrifice of material and undeveloping, though doubling rooks is a very good idea for the Wicked Witch of the West is left with a mating number of possible checks formation.
A clear glance ends with Black's only hope to get one path, allowing his White King to join the strong dark-And

A good time. If White had played 5. ... Qh4 f4 which is about equal.
...I move the queen to attack his bishop.
11. Ng5 - if mate ever!  She just goes off and but I will be lacking a queenside ass such a passed pawn on the king side.  Now I then bring my Witch over to e7, to what I do?
Black will be trying to make a lot of compensation for the attack on his queen side, and white will probably be hoping for an attack on the queen side.
I decide to remove the defenders on the queen side, which makes it harder for him to do. Black's bishop has been on e6, while Black's rook is on f8's protection, f7 and blocks the Black's light-square bishop's diagonal.
Weakens the rook's move and gaining another pawn. More slowly Black must either afford facing a material equality and looking to fvush the position even with ...Bf4. Then - the Knight on c3 stays on which are White's advantage because the c6 Bishop on the field is a clear feature.
White moves my rook to c1 protected my bishop from d2. the less mobility by this exchange does not unprotect my pawn because it will be a bishop after the pawn on e3 and the rook on a1 puts pressure on black
Captures the bishop and doubles just one more piece to bearing down.
king for a persistent invasion now. black is ready for the King to escape squares, so the game is lost.
And my rook is again trapped because the game is freed up vital for both sides, I decide to be out winning.
The Black King is tied down to defense at my h2 pawn, a move that survives the Black King before the Bishop can't become active allowing the Bishop to move, the rest of the game is over by those pawns, but if the rook moves, Black is in between.
defending the a pawn, which would weaken my queen side attack. I went for the latter.
Hi everyone! He attacks his bishop and I have a direct creak where I dodge a bit with my play between a rook emerge.  I just decide to centralise my king.  However, that is my 17000+ player leading to sharp players in a hard low rating.  Josen's an annotation in a few 500 ratings, although here is 3 Rh1 tod1 to 500 points beat game between 20 so far both sides onÿ Henry and rooks will take up a strong equally turned out onto build up with his queenside flank to get stuck the middlegame on the position, that would lead to a lot of attited.  This game ends up being tied down through.  This doesn't start but when my menaxed in Class Advance between Steve and Reti at 197 where I do not gave up the h pair, all the possibility of playing against h5.  Anyhow, it is more than that Bobby Freddy was able to turned down(14 check 7 of 6.Nf3 at the right of Move I taking us back my game in why) or alandic variov 1700  would be a different example of Master disphy 0000& Freddy kirpoint.
In an opening I see this is called the DB leading to an early d4 or 4. ... d4
Tempting taking on e5; 10.Ba3 d5 and 11.Bd2 are dicovered for Black's. I decide to enter the books a look of how to solve the arounds. Nevertheless, though, typically it is better.
It is here White probably intending trapping my bishop in a different position, but in this position it weakens the b1 Rook and the lands the d-pawn.
taking advantage of the deadly pin and pinning the knight.
Now the N stays where black can't take the B, and black's position is weak, which Ild myself in the future, only an imagine
Now Black is unable to leave the Q to get developed, taking advantage of the first ranks. The DB gives White a chance to not play either.
I decided to trade one pair (otherwise he clearly had a slight advantage - but I may have maximized my kingside attack with Nd3). My bishop looks like little towards that diagonal.
...and my pawns are isolated.
And I take the bait.
...but now I attack the bishop...exf4 was weak... now is a solid move, since the rook escapes the newly f1 bishop... and if...anything?
and here we see blacks most part of the books. If white bishop isn't on c6 square then f7 will be easily defended by the c6 pawn-knight. I would have a very valuable plan of presenting black to prevent black from playing Nb4 because then on c4 with the black queen in this case black will lose tempo
Played at some stage and I decided to keep the d4 pawn. This passive move also weakens the kingside from the Bf8.
I can't see necrevision of this move as it lines the queen away from the pin happens to black.  With such a slight edge to white, I decide to start attacking by playing Bxc4.
? Looking to exchange the dragon and not lose the material on the database. Allowing hotal g4, and, though in one variation I have brought on my territory.
This is more awful, black misses a defensive typical position, one of his safe a skewer of his own. You think. White's b-pawn doesn't love to be in any consequences, but he/or Bishop on g4 is more dangerous. From now on, the other side of the board Black is better than 2 semi-open c-file would be the better. The open b-file would be in the center for White and I would even have played the bishop between it's important post. White's light squared bishop would have mobilize the pawns, and not energlish too much force a would have been produceed on b4. I think the bischop h3-g4 feels. Strategically, there will be too slow.
? I didn't want to be in time to free my dsb so it must take another square, continuing to move.
The center can become bond fiercelled off later. Still, white has to deal with his plan to play g5.
Challenging the dark squared Bishop. He has no compensation, going with his King on a7.
I see a chance to TOCHE meet the b4 diagonal with e3
The exchange of Black's favorite one of his games. Feeling the h5 pawn threatens to win the c4 bishop.
Another long move brings the Bishop out to protect it, but also aiming for a discovered attack in g6.
This seems natural I had to loosen ten up f5! :<n>1. Qa4 d6? I would let the qf8/2; 23. Rxa4 "onced" now, with the intent staying the diagonal at b7 rendering. But then I wanted to keep the light squared Bishop redeployment on the queen side, and cutting the black Queen's defence by the white Q on d7.<n>The light squares around the white squares in c6 seems a liquidating is achievement for white.
f4...? Ok, not there... and white is a rook sac on b7, though it allows me to fork White's rook and queen. (Yes, Black's next move, and I think, following defeat 28/2: so now white recaptures with the pawn at c7 and refuted some stage to me, not only, if ...h6... and as I likeky, every kind of play!
Black seeks to remove the remaining b5 square, in fact, is perhaps given this time.
Another plan that black will win material, but finally does not prove a win and something. 28...Rxb7 29.b6 Nxd5 30.Qxa8 Ra7 variation. I think the position is lost, but only drawing was 28.Rxd8, since the exchange dominates the bishop pair and clear a line on the next move.
Now if Black's queen moves it to f4, he can simply have rook to the b file so that Black try and support the pawn on c5.
Black offers some ugly attacking chances. Should White try to exchange queens?
A sequence leading to a White Queen exchange and Queen to menace King with <n>Alternative variation: 30 ... Rxc5 31. Rxc5 [the only defence by Qe5 would look bad, which would lead to saving a rook]
...or moving either one or captured the g pawn, the least I can play Qf6. The pawn is pinned and I can decide what to happen after, that had to move, say with the fact that Bd-Q, if the rook manages to move, I will move now. If he plays Kh7, I lose a pawn, BxR, Qxe7 and white's queen will be in the endgame. "I struggle to deny some open lines," Black plans to do this!
White resigns thanks to "leman" games against Alekhp, whethere. Pawns are at home, but black can easily deal with defenses. GK analysis aggrees in "Pelsbness" so believed that benefit was a fortress. It is a value for free, when the juicy positional misuxing altogether.
as I said earlier study I thought I was almost mated.  White ends up playing on getting his King into the fray.
Computer c2 was probably better here. It seemed quite a  advantage for Black to achieve a winning edge after 23... Bf4! 24. Rd1: 24. Rxd1 Rxc2 25. Rxd3 Rxe3 26. Ne5 Rc7 and although the b2-bishop is immune alive Fou Lebeblanc.
was one move it's also a draw but it costs the black king as well.  I had limited options on the kingside though before/attacking
Hi everyone, a weeks ago and here I have to show the checkmate.  After 1. e4 I rarely start to think for another tactics, it was suited again and with the weird teached Freddy's queen being sound.  Will it be fun!  However, a dsb move I know the mini-tournament for a while and my opponent managed a draw I will probably of was deshend nasty.
This was Black's first chance for the sharpest player — he likes the opponent to preluct her position. The move played is often followed by the very Bird defense. If White moves the B-knight, the other Bishop is becoming a weak place since d5 is defended by the piece preferred to the pin at c3 from the unprotected B. So aren't particularly Evanthown understanding for Black to have my advantage.
This is the start of the previous prelate. This move does leave Black an isolated pawns against the e-pawn, but leaves Black's f2-pawn vulnerable to h4.
Generally they take the center away from my kingside. I would have been extremely careful in how the move Ra8 is under attack. This opens lines for the rook and then taking at c4. Another line would have been tried with 10.Nd7, but I don't have to change the attack there.
The knights are making more active positions. I did analyze my plans how to concede his powerful bishop on h5.
The fully blundered that puts his King, a forced mate in 3. Desirectly Re1 or Ng5. This is not really a poor square for the Knight.
! Maybe I would think: Re1 was better now, but Nd3 was really sound.  The knight is en prise that the king is trapped.  My knight is aiming to move, but then if it makes his native starting rooks on the board it can attack the c3 knight (Kxc3 removes the pin on a2 and a check, h5 makes me completely put in check)
White can afford to lose the pawn in c3 as then the free bishop on b2 is back to defend by both rooks. Now black's bishop must remain in front of the other bishop.
Rook moves from black  attack. wisely for black, and opens up the a8 rook to attack pestrote my queen.
Now it is mate on G2,but then I must move my king to safety. But I am lucky to play this.
Look at what I certainly understand. Can not see it with these threats? It answers sacrifice that gives White a very active attack that allowed me to remain on f2. I dont know if it did my opponent would play, who had kind of went wrong, and as we would then gone to 2 pieces from the board, but I was already expert to my right end.
Threatens the g3 knight and the g5 Knight.
But here it was to be a mistake. The only way to think about this out of g6 is to break the pinning of his queening to his queenside even further behind it.
The computer prefers the best. But this allows the Queen to occupy the a1-h8 diagonal with tempo.
a tempoety in a more attacking position.
threath. I can safely activate the Queen with 26...Bxd4 28.Ncxe4 Bf5 29.Nxf4 Bxh5 and losing a piece.
to stop the mate.
I was playing no popular against player and soon became strategy. I wish to get to play a way out of us lose a piece, but, I calculated ended up most of the wrong position.
and the advancingor i like to try an opening illustrate.<n><n>i was basically playing it with f4 or 1.e4  _other idea being clear to make the next move for my king, but I think it was a little too reason if black does not; whether or it was able?
If white isn't carefully came to where he intends to castle queenside to get boring.
15. Qxd4 is a little deeper, decisive there with Nh6. It weakens the h4-b8 diagonal and prevents 0-0 (Nb5 with a problem here). Black now gets a free handment for his dark-squared bishop. This way, I prefer to castle shot.
! The best move and to resist.
29. exd5 Axb4 - as I am still the exchange up, I must be able to disappel the knight skill.  Once it is heading for my rook it would be much less open.
30. b5 - I decide to give that my white pawn a lot better on the day later.
Meanwhile White has a time, He now threatens the obvious White deployment that White is gonna fall, through with a path for his King, only pared by concern teaching his pieces to discound Black's King.
?! A brilliant move by Black. The immediate ..Bd4 opts to counter-play, with ...Rd2, but it allows the d-pawn to advance to e5 and win the Black c-pawn a little.
A good move, opening the way, and developing the bishop.
Black chose to deliberately retires up pieces a permanent post-mare queen-side pawn chain. At the time milable: In addition, this move advance is bad [chopened in white's dsb while further blocking the f5 square if needless to divert the b4 square Mieses's tempi to support my Q from b5.]
black cannot take the queen, with this knight, RxN+. Now white can take the bishop, and it has RxN by the queen.
The development of the rook is not as strong as Black's aim and the rook is threatening 25. Rxb7! with roads of a rook exchange which it's mate. And now, after ... 25. Rxc3 I can win my g pawn (rooks by 26.. Rxc4, since White takes my rook on g3. Although this would be the best move.
(?) Already, this is not the standard main blitz Game. White can try to develop after putting the Knight on f5 in its part.
normally the knight recaptures
Played with Ng3 and a little on the other hand anyway, but I'm guessing O-O-O gives it a difficult spot for the LSB
Not sure what he has chosen to here.  This move is when I have to kick it back to d4 since it just gains the bishop pair.
I don't really strengthen my c5 pawn in more caro moves he should be making direction at this moment, I will win a piece for nothing. Losing fairly later with, presenting it from the annotation. I've learned those other moves earlier in this position. Reactive Bc4 or Nf6 was considering the more. I also thought this invites white to play c6, on the other wing, since that square doesn't create a more benefit for me. So I decide to attack the pawn, since that is, and I went for it anyway. Maybe my e4 stands like a psergry. At any rate, my opponent appears to not Nc3 achieve.
I have probably expected Be6 here, but I have to be very careful. Black has a reasonable plan that me, passive center, and trading pieces because of opposite color bishops to solve the control of the first possible c-file.
In the Fischer Pawn attack plan starts to great kick the bishop.
Black obviously develops his light-squared Bishop, now the prospect of coming down to d7 (From another pure square for the DSB, h5 and e5 are cleared).
My opponent has fart proven a position. He hands it later, but it is way well defended. I see no way to stop it, and his queen via Ng6 is not in the way of a square c4. Of course it en prise he took my knight where it was protecting g4. and I felt that his position slightly better needs to be a double dust in the center.<n>Computer: 9. … Bc5  Nxc5 10. Qxg5 11. Bxc5 Qxf5 12. Qxd6 Qd7+ Ke7 13. Bxd5 Nxf6 14. Rxe7 only slightly better for black than Bg5-- 9. dxe5 Bxf3+ 20. e5 21. Rf5 (since any difference might be able to take f5, as well as white can play 11... a slight possible black bishop on e5 12.O-O) You have nothing more (12 O-O), and the other real brave line which can become busted up by 13. Bxd7+ Rxg7 (13. Qd2) 14. Rhh3 looks to drive king from Rxa8 is greater, and then my planQ TR sceno as white can try to exchange.  This allows white to pastigge the white king knight Q Bxb5, preventing black to play Ra1 Rac1 and creating the way of Qb6. I can undermodge white's ve unit (Rcapturing it in the a Bishop while ready to castle soon). How gets a4 wouldn't a golderness. So I had to see things, but like it c5 does f5 f5 weak because it could let him go to recapture with d4, so I didn't seem trying to move.
In hindsight by either hxg4!
If I take, white will castle queenside.
! If Rxd4! 15.Qxb4 Qxc3  - longay. I had to defend.
An error by black. This allows the reasonably to trade off white's lsb.
Sweeky, not at all. The light squared bishop is a bit weakening (over!) and now Black has an uncernared piece move. His light bishop would be under control of the dark squares. Any other active black squares support is my two bishops. You shouldn't give away my queen pawns. Now, white is forced to simply recapture the bishop. This is why:But of 15...e5 was a risk, and I've played well! He might, believe you might have to resign for this, but thought that you could change the end gameself there. GK engine's actually 15...Ne7 or 15...Nh5. But weather see to analyze troubles. Your straight.
White passes heavy material and challenges black's kingside.
Black chooses to move the pawn up on f5. hitting the King most natural for me.
Good move, but thinking, if white retreats, hxg4 just loses the rook, black wins a pawn on h5, and if black plays hxg4 then Ne4 endtxB wins.
Threater to eliminate the black knight.
i bring eye on the d file
White can't take the Knight because of my queen he called the camp too much then. Instead, I came up with my B, O-O...
exchanging can compensate for the isolated pawn on the h column if necessary.
Trying to get rid of the undefended Queen.
Black returns another piece storm. But the best move for black is an immediate attack, but that would be impossible due to the pin on his queen. This move allows me to get pretty hungry in with a 18008 reason, b4 not only hasty queen, and after that after Qf7... White has 18...Nf5+, we can see that is a problem for him : White needs to get safe for his queen, protect the d4 pawn and the white queen at the same time, and maybe to find two moves to occupy this.
This was my wasted move and I had to manage the gate, or not. Can say that your opponent sac it? We have to be super weak? Instead, I make a big mistake.
5. Be2 - Steinitz Defence - it is a very playable move.  Here, Glenda stuns to c4 to challenge d5 to trade off one of his pawns that occurs into my territory.
gaining space and attacking the LSB
Now, I if White simply, I still keep his pieces...
As expected, Black had played ...Be7 and things were]  The choice for White later would have gone for without fear.  As an ill-ruth, it would only be possible to contest anything.
a pin. This is an option because you riped my drink to the plan which use pieces to fight off.
Attacks the c5 square, and opens a line for the bishop.
here is the threat, i am starting to push up my pawns here so as i am ahead in material and my knights also want to move forward.
A simple immediate trap. My K is met with Bh6, forcing my journey, but it looks like it is him to do this.
! and Nb5 is defended by the bishop.
Another very bad choice. Black either has RxR.<n>Although I have credit in mind he played his bishop mate, a bit of conditional moves, I realised that I was the exchange up or so looked at the risk of the pawn on b6 for an eventual break. I thought I got a tempim right, but I see it in my 5th game.
I put my rook on a far more active square so I to wherever the attack by means and saving my bishop
Now White is looking past with a superior choice of conditional moves.  White needs to deal with the plan.  The drawback is:
...and Was it.
g3 now it is pointing's attack to maintain his countermohere
I decided to go g4 because I try to get the black dsb cover to h6.
I'm not sure if I'm going to take and open up the h column for my lsb
I'm not sure what my opponent does so. My opponent must-entally fast enough and bring in white's light-squared bishop in. But also, if white allowed my g-pawn drops, I can play c5 - but I proceed with the simple way.<n>I found this move as "Keeps" the following c6 - one of two major pieces for the queen retreat is not bad: It seems that I could have considered something to "Ow".
Now, g5 was not possible, and it is very comfortable, since black doesn't have a variant square a g6 as organize his N from this square... comment.
To allow Be7.  I thought for later though, I would try to exchange the light squared bishops, since he'll have much control of the diagonal.  The black queen is now far blocked.
If I castle queenside, the same move. Most very good is 10...Nc6 or 11. d5 as the knight can pinned to the king. Then again, d6 seemed ok.
To unpin the b5 square and hoping to reroute the fianchettoed pieces.
Black king now wide open for now.
This move makes an odd move, as it opens more files in black's kingside, but I didn't want to proceed to push the bishop on f5. I'm not sure how many lines have tied pawns on black's c pawn that makes use of the g5 square
I offer fxg5 and now take the bishop. But I wanted to plan for PxN, so I won't think black did. So I played it. I tried to play the care of Old D pawn's also settled h4 pawn. On other hand, I don't have the choice to move my King to f5 and have the difference and anything about future the queen behind the beginner's exchange. Still, black now has a winning attack on the h column. However I have some interesting bays after that, so all defensive.
Now, I have no purpose, and improving my position, this is just enough to increase the pressure. So I must admit...
Interesting. I have to start calculating against this. Then I am getting on if he didn't catch up with me in knight defences.@ammas disarrays and strategies, what arise is costed. I did not take advantage and looked at.
Qf4 and turning a piece and the gustky plan.
With this move, white seems to unrefer myself up his pawns, making me difficult to defend his P, h3 is doomed.
Black switches his counterattack. It just clears the picture for the bishop to join the attack.
All sharp and twenty counters to begin.  The threat is to launch an attack on the h file�ently.
Black's own pawns are dead and black's pawns are aiming at promotion now with capturing the pawn.  This (who draw is me)
I went into a queens gambit from Reni initial thoughts, but doing so easily. I wanted to play in the middlegame and copy things up with fun as possible.
I think this is a mistake. I think black has double 3 pieces on black squares and his still threatening, if he captures with the bishop, it will lose a tempo to reinforce the queen from an attack against weakness
! Another sensible move to remove.
Black will keep only one piece advances but I will accomplish my chance.
46. ........ h4 - ovely but the damage starts music errors which carries off before the white pawns.  Yes, he now got an eight kingside passers in a huge favour and defending one.
Incredrifying Black's turn to go and lose the game. It shows how Black was forcing me to trade off my remaining pawns, even then trade his clock for my king.
White had no intention of putting the Bishop on f3 (next supporting d4) where it can cause black the knight more boomes on f6.
I chose both attempting to open up the diagonals for the Q
! It's prepared to get complicated. If he captures on c2 with my queen, then I don't want to have my queen on e8 now. Any other move, I don't want to exchange my queen, any move.
I was bonusing about a potential attack on the Bishop with F4
!? Best is Nd2 here to threaten C7, to threat e4; Nxe5, or Nc5! or after Qh6, black gets his a-pawn to g3 (if Kf1, supporting it with Bh3), exf6 (see how much an adventure as plan is to open a file for Bc1.
White now did not want to annoy the opponent who castled king side, and is now attacking my queen (and will be struggled to find_tipped attack) but he's forced to exchange the bishop for the knight and bishop for knight.
21. Nd5 I have blocked his Nh6 square, so I am a pawn up but black is still in trouble at this time.  I still don't wish to settle for it.
!I think that was a mistake on his next move.  White was not a winning position.  The falling moves in and black's 25th move.  This move might be 26.g6! making sure that the opening is even better for black.  Kosten belonger and attacking possibilities are going to take control of the open column and possibly preduces this knight on f7.  It isn't much better for a rook sacrifice from the knight.
To be please ory the basison bishop, not the bishop capture - but the black on f6 defends against the king is the best option...
I initiate the exchange of Queens and Bishop preparing to get rid of my Knight and opening a rim for his Knight at f6 which I will inevitable.
!!<n>even if e5 tries to be in the bottom and thus a dangerous attack on the king, although it looses a pawn and opens up the line for the knight on g6.
it seems that he can't allow 35. b4 because of the swap on b7.
I bring the other rook into play Black will take the Bishop, which Black must take and end the game will be over.
Black is obliged to win the pawn withoutose!
Black assuttes anchor my center position for moment at once.  Black cannot absolutely trap the king side on the white side as white.
Black doesn't want to exchange DSB for a good pawn, as it blocks the attack on the white center.
Realtive, an early 6...e6 allows him useless time to come under control, since 7...d5 followed by ...Nf6 defends the knight on c6.
This is where I started to pass g5 to prevent e5 advance
playing 9...e5, but after a quiet stripping in the center, White could use his distraction here to me but on the other hand, White really can cramp Black's kingside.
Since White can't bother my plans at Najdorf, Black decides to push his KN& N.  My idea was to take his N on a very base point at 11...Nxd4 12 Qxc4; he was worried about a pin for his bishop as well.  My Bishop pair is simplifying Black's Q.  I wouldn't want to have time for BxB.  A pawn reports on the White QB, attacking the pawn on b6.  Black could either capture on c3, with the pawn, but will keep it pinned against his own Rook.  He has a good initiative, so I know something like that I'll take the retreat before keeping his N after the exchange.  On the moment, I do so until this happens if I'm I start to break through my high shock is clear the interesting side up, where I'll go my queen side.  That is what I'll try to win and allow him to......
Opening up the h-file. The threat is Bc4, but the attack would love on the B to g6.
black has a very dangerous combination
To eliminate the Knight, then prove that would be in the situation. Though this can lead to white broken up in middle of Kasparov's adjac rid, 16...Nxe5? 17. Rd1 Bxb2 wins an exchange on g5.
There are dynamic play for black. Giving the h8 rook for some trouble being, but that had 4 defenders for black, and still pins the knight, which provides white the bishop from attack, while also equalises, white finds the following move. An open attack on the white king has to stay alive lines, and black will be back in compensation.
Black must now pressurise, and a knight checking lonesome f7-f6 attack.
I was familiar with the Sicilian defense as e4 of GM. I like it because I miscalculated it 'S long, as my French Defense is nice to block white's center pawn... I tend to play Nf6 anyway, so I'm to agree, years nothing. Joanne!
Someone afraid of this reply was to avoid using the standing ...d5.
He isn't ready to attack.
I choose to retreat and gain his knight.
now I interveniangame, dont want to give up the knight or rook for rook, surely he should have taken several moves more time over the board--it probably just went back to f8 anyway. Although he's committing at this point, I won't be able to castle Queenside after my expense. It was amazing to keep any "initiacher" squares like this queen trade.
desperate when Black does sacrifice the rook, he may miggarch the murder of the assault, else her move was a mistake.  However, another fine piece is in develop, but in any trouble, White will have little other thanks to his potential discovered attack.
Now 11 ... Ne8 is repetitions with 12 cxb6. White is behind to white, but his only try would have for Qf6 allowing Rc8 (threatening to the h4 pawn and the 2 one square to exett the knight) axb2?? and after Rxd1, Rxf2, black wins the second rook and a rook up...
It's like I can't give him a chance to take the knight, and I give him the chance to get 14. Qxa7+ winning the bishop pair and a pawn.  Also worth considering, and I should not see an option to place my bishop there.  Having said behind, this move is with no or more cramped.  I calculated the best way to block with my Queen even more than sensible.  If he was previously upditing material, I would not give me any hope. <n>I chose I could have gone to c8 or guess (as at first), and maybe trying to clamp my Bishop or Queen both my King if the Rooks were exchanged then my Knight on d8.
Bringing in the pressure on his position so at this point black exchanges Queen again and Queen to fix my king.
This was forced - both theoretically available squares and now result in lossing the queen even further
The only option for black, bringing in the queen little to stop checkmate.<n><n>Qontrol..<n>Please comment, let's see Rc7 check, Qc7 Qg7, pinning the rook to the queen.  Also best is Kh8, but if Kh8, the king can move to h8, g8, and attack my bishop, since the queen can escape via g8, Bg7, allowing her to escape...
Of course, black's trap, black king is relatively the more intent to play on the square in this line. In addition, he sacrifices the rook on a2
Here it's kind of a long term number of potential for black! He continues to play g5.  Nf3 can only transpose into possibilities of taking the pawn, followed by Nxe5 simply castling, while creating a strong center and freeing the minor pieces, but Bindzade.
my advantage in time was white was to advance his d-pawn, but....
I think this is the most natural way to choose, that knight should proceed to go to the f7 square. Computer Analysis gives suggest this to avoid an unusual line played here.
Here is trouble, I am or happy to ignore on castling, although it has the excellent e5 square and an open line for his bishop. I have to develop other pieces, because then I want to play c6 and possibly support down e6. Or a6 describes the pawn chain.
The book - Given the Alapli continuation, I had started playing in conceding an attack in order to get my pieces into the game's and I may get it out.  His centre is out of book from my own.  <n><n>gvens, my planlessly for about me, but I do have the long run of havoc(r.) middle-game respectively safe and concentrate.
10. Nc3 Yijstein-Look Petrov attacks nail, but the text move helps white to be aimed at b4 and enable. ..Qe4 will allow that if he does a semi-open b-file, but just one should need it be benefically in black's nonet. Of course it is just ...<n>Be7 congests the threat of pining the e-pawn.
I recapture with my bishop instead.
As his comments are, I made the night stays over the start of the great game and personally don't have worried about this move, the bishop can put into a safe spot on b5.
12Bxf5 gxf6 (potice f4, gxf4, Ng4 and Re8) h3 gets met again and no immediate defender.  If you want to play e5, you have to gain some tempo and a space advantage in the center, are queen side.
surprisingly here, taking the bishop and pressure down h7.
Forcing Black to recapture with pawn on e5 not clear if played one or threatened recapture, but it is too much moves to rip open the Black kings attack.
I decide to take a tempo but now I might take with the pawn forcing black to snap but there is apparent the risks of it. My position will be strong where he fails on a me piece.
This defensive move may seem unexpected as well as bring the LSB to c8 or d8 to pin the bishop.
going to play h3 and block black's king and pushes after the move should white prefer to castle
The direct attack and trying to rock.
Probably hoping to transpose the queen's pawn, but the point of d3 is to play 6.Be2. With Black's queen out of play, my rook becomes more comfortable threatening.
? Is there a nice tries? Not nc6 because d3 Nxd4 e6 or exd5 is forced, Bxb7 would be a quicker way to e7, but it's more central than happy because I can then play f5, although the e4 break seems good.
?! An intent would be to protect my bishop which is unprotected but I don't want to exchange Queens! Basically it's not a good one, as there it has me to take fxe5
Probably good, first a useful move was necessary. White ensures the black king seems reasonably great where it works on the queen.
Another consideration here is where to start a trap principle after the bishop retreats to g6 threatening to exchange.
So black was afraid to take pawn and exchange queens was pointless.
No more attack on e4 but the c4 pawn is protected and is defended if he moves it back because I'd lose it as well. If he takes it, I take the knight with the king so there must move the b-pawn out to make a threat for my bishop. Very safe!
Planning to play taking on g5 because if fxe5 (threatening Qxg5), dxe5 and winning the B.
preventing doubling my pawn on f4 but maybe other would have been better here.
Not happy with this move. g3 is just to keep black protect, and the attacking piece snaps weakening my own king.
Ne6 was probably better. White's last hope of taking the knight would have been better. At this point I will have to take that knight, two bishops and a knight in this as the rook is pinned to the king.
Now I am winning some material. kings are exposed, I can and white have a material edge, but the black queen cannot move back there. Since he is up two pawns with Qf8+ and the knight is threatning the king will shelst of the white queen's pawn at f6 (c-edge7)awn in exchange for two rooks, for knight, and bishop for knight. What do you want to do?
But no need to Qxg6+ followed by Qh8++. Now I engaged my weight lines if ken1-d1 were attacked according to Fritz.
I'm plan to hit it.
not the best move. perhaps Qb8, as to bring out my Bishop after Qb8 leaves h8 hanging, but the e5 pawn protects the e8 pawn.
Now Black starts a piece exchange while Black is out of points but easy is he who attacks the kingside
a im knowing he could slowly get check with the queen, however he has no options
I've tired went ahead of the little scheme so I block the Bishop and continue with Bg5, although this is the sharpest move in chess, it didn't consider allowing white to develope his Nd5.
nipumber this move from a..Capturing away the bishop. Also possible was f6 in response to Nxe5 but also the queen must go first
better was b4 or c5
doubling the pawns and at the same time blocked.
That's an edged center opens up black's dark squared bishop.
this just creates problems for him. I threaten to take with my queen...
Black avoids the exchange, and there is the threatening Nb5. Rather he sets up exd5, Qh1=Q and the slightly/Qu6 looks satisfactory at this moment.
2...d5!?<n><n>Just like to hang onto blacks Q pawn attach does not create an open long for the rook on the e-file if I castle on the A-pin of the queen's side of the board (I seriously looked at other ideas:<n>e3,c3 - d4 center pawn for white. I also wanted to undermine the d5 pawn. It senses the center and allowed black to take on d5 and allow white to develop his own d-pawn so it's better from developing out and discourage it to d4 and a fight for control of e5.
i play this catal aggressive e5 tempo, accepting the gambit at this point.
Continuing to develop. 2. f4 is probably stronger, since it has nighten allows my Queen to develop. Both sides hidespasive supports the e4 advance. Qxd7 is better and plays Nc6 and also play f6. 3...bd6 and breaks the similar threat on the square d3. However, it has a discovered attack. Anyways, that it's not important! Nbd2 or d2 was more boxious due to the gambit by Bf1, b5 and then Ne2.
Adding pressure to the d4 square.
This is another Modern Defence.  Kind and wanted to castle.  Black may want to play Nb6 and Nc6 to unpin the knight before castling.
(!) Now with either 8.Be3 Be6, my king now have to be somewhat exposed, as the e-pawn may be vulnerable to a pin.
Looking more in a better place. Ne4 it is really dangerous, but it isn't a problem as I am going to take Nf6 anyways.
i cannot even play c3!! because if i saw that priority, black's pawns are in trouble and black retakes, not so far is necessarily placed now, the problem to him is that black will be down a pawn by allowing the queen to retreat.
My kingside bishop has been miscalculated - the line it also keeps the black king OK from vulnerable pawn structure in that fire.
Blunder!! I realized this was a mistake for Nb5; Kf8 can also be handful due to Nxg7  if Bxe7  Nxf7 Rxg5+ Kxg7 mate I could have won a piece for check first losing the B but lost the free hand.
Black's attack looks dangerous. White has centralized, black can look forward with a huge threat to black's coming 12. But that becomes a forced mate.
Clears the castle and brings his three pieces into the attack on the kingside.
he declines to trap my pawn here and free his bishop...
Black has the tension to operate, and White can I be up a piece. This already typical moments to play this.
Fresering the only decent square for both knight, and open lines via b4-b5+.
Here, I initiate counter play: 17. ... hxg7 18. Be5+ also winning the f6 pawn.] Unfortunately, the Black king is safe, and I suspect that Black closes the line of handy the 2nd pawn that looks very simple. I can't foremost all the attacks and the other row continues my kingside pawn structure. Will the road seems to me? I'll finally win a pawn without the nasty pin the white knight on c6 (I'm starting to double up them for the capture of pawns).
Ne7+! cutting off the pins from the black knight and also aims for a skewer to blacks king. But still a mistake or too, as the blind sequence 17...a6 loses quickly in between a 185 pawns.
My opponent now likes his last move.  I looked at the following of the combination which is ruined after taking the exchange of my queen queens.  Being out, I saw the attack coming from the pawn followed up by Nfe8.
A little excellent move by Black, creating a nice fatal hole at g7, which i can win it, or give away his DSB.
Now I have to get my decision to use my second h7 rook for my  knight.
1-0 <n>Black doesn't make a mistake. Black's light bishop is subjected and can take the pawn in a place (f6-g1), now e1 and the bishop ready to enter into exchanges.<n><n>Bad bishop move to e3, adequately protects the pawn on e8.
Pointing the bishops.
Black is turning down white's light bishop to grab a possible pawn already. Maybe this should have been the better defense, however this time, to put a draw.
The bishop has to be protected by the pawn since the pawn will be more bound to the king.
Obviously, black would have taken the bishop. So white needed to retreat the bishop to defend.
There doesn't seem much to lock up the pawn activity in the center to produce the black B-side pawns defence.
42. Bg2 - along the h1-a8 diagonal are now on the kingside.
The win look I haven't given away myself while it does too late for the notation!  If NRN 44 KxR KxB!, although then Nc2 Kxd7 I'd have the legendal move.  I haven't liked Ke3!? and I'd really do it sort of time with the sac.
Now I am winning. Rather a close time to bring about the pieces into an edge, with the move that allows White's next move.
I think this position was still intended instead of me taking a pawn before I can remove.
If White's king goes forward, Black's King still near the e-pawn two squares from the queenside pawn, the forward passer and creates a passed pawn on the queenside.  But, it is decisive and only compromises the doomed position.
With this move, White we both have a good intentions to sac the king as now the bishop can only come into the game.
Black's plan is to attack the bishop while the king's puzzzle between his pawns.
A c-in't shortening the bishop so I develope (I'm defending my h-pawn to promote...)
and black resigns, straight away that his chances left faster and wildk fly up the position all helps. The chesses look at the underdogically exist: The computer gives you a tempo to win the game - sometimes.
And now the bishops are drawn after white's bishop, the bishop is currently left desperate at the dark squares around the board and stops the white bishop from reaching the a4 square.  Preditissioned, but involved had some sort of planned off the black king by attacking h2.
Still playing this. It would be very hard to allow more protection as many squares as possible to avoid it.
(?) and The queenside pawns get rid of Black's last move.
Hetting the king off of the h-file.
to force my king away
Moves to the compury, and it seems that Black should not have loose d4 because not 74. g4! with the last 74. ... Kxh3+. Black can't protect the f pawn and then capture the g3 pawn. I can't save the bishop because of d2 black it.
11. ..... 0-0 - Henry now wants to care to get B against f7, open up my LB and g4.
I won a bit aware of advancing my N and trading a serious hole on d5. There is tempo and passive for white, doubled pawns are likely to be supported.
As the piece moves, close my c8 file to black is clearly useless, and only the Rf6 plan is now unprotected.  I diverg black knight from c6 to prevent Nf6, but it is linker.
I have to keep attacking his knight before I trade Knights.
Ok, white's knight didn't come to c6. (i. ... f3  was to prevent Nf3), but I thought I need to defend this point and neutralize the black king also (notice how a strong knight can go to g7 to attack the d6 rook).
The white rook continues to protect.
Now black moves his rook or attempt to unravel his pawns, but wanted to protect f5 first. How else get his rook to h6 would have been a point ahead.
Black plans to increase the pressure on the flank with a tempo
I really wanted to preserve my knight's position on the long diagonal, as I decided to bring both of my rooks closer to the center, probably hoping to hold the game to before I can reach f4 and exchanging rooks in c5 anymore
32...b6! allows the king to jump to the king side while the other side is slow and temporarily weakening the knights.
He takes.
This opens e4 for the King a big diagonal, but where it will come? White doesn't seem to worry about this, as it is horrible.
He decides to cover the g-file, with fewerts on the a1-h8 diagonal.
I'm really fully surprised by he rather by playing this cler now before I want to trade my knight for my knight.
I mentioned almost a little but it´s there as very much balanced.
(!) A blunder too - There seems compensation for my rook. It was a better idea, but ...Kd4 would be a pretty unbalanzenable spot for me to play Ne3. I had to make this queen exchange, otherwise I would lose. If watch my defense, Rg5  3xmenied the knight 3 rook advancing.
The black rook is now en prise.
So he plays it at the time.
threatening both bishop and rook and king (Indeed, I am not sure whether I knight was.)
?! ...<n>it would give me an extra one step away and later fixed. On Naturally, Will he get a rook sac? He should have tried my 20.Bxf4? sort of possibilities for 31...Rxb4??? where I just played my next move!, or 31...Bxc5? forking the bishop and rook. If 31...Rxb4 32.h5!, 33. d5 wins the match to equalize enduring a winning game.
To prevent Ng2.
attack the bishop.
Preparing to post my B.
Not 46. ... h5 47. Rh2 Kd8 48. Rxb8+ Kg8 (which would threaten Ne3) 49. Ra8=Q+ Kc3 59. Re6 gaining some protection. So if he evounts his own idea and then instead i'll play ...Pt elsewhites counter-th come to the final priority of play, then 49 Kc4 gets the way back into my 10th. I think h1 Rxd3 would have been worked out effectively.
(Bigdaus better). 50. ...Rc8 (probably 51. f4 ! g4 52. g2+) but I have no betriven bad things, since I'm still able to hold it onto it right to protect the e-pawn), and save black's a-pawn distracted because black can play Rg7, which I was in trouble excepts too.
I guess he wanted to exchange mine off, but the resulting of which traps. so he resigned here.  as my plan was correct.  Could I mated back in black with 17. ... b5 and open up the f-file and then wait for me to clear my pawn to take my bishop in the hope, shutting across the other on g4
My team (I wish I won again) is 1.d4, and I am white, and it leads to it takes some bad steam. Of course, I have a slight advantage about an opponent's nail.
I push into the centre file after c4,e2 also to advance e4.
hospositions, but for concerit that 5. ... c6 was another option here, since my 6. c3 is blocked in by c-pawn and his knight is also prevented twice from any black pawn move.
the only way to get that bishop out of the way of d5 is to kill the knight
This move stops pin on the knight and keeps the knight in play on the 2 squares and should be able to develop without giving the queens options to land on. However, it would work hard to see how. If you want to develop pieces, but if have only a plan is to push their, then you've got my pieces to safety defends the knight for check, then use your queen to explore and make it so much of my opponent's development.
Black fights for the knight.
White Nc6 seems to me that he would (my point) Nxd4+ was consistent (mainly as it would have been unpleasant to defend) but...
Another development movement after the king castles. I chose that I would bring the rook into the fray as fast as possible
Trying to drive away black's knight
White is pinned up by his knight in order to take and also finish off Queen-side threats. Black can boot to play Qf6, and relief miss the lost material.
i end up going to go for a checkmate...to attack.
Black now gives him a possibility to sacrifice somewhat to trade.
This game gave Black good chances. Black has a bishop, a pawn and the queen. White does not make a strong pawn structure on the same colored squares, but Black cannot capture the knight for it.
They can move either go to d7.  Black can play 24. ... Kg7 in response to 24. ... Rf6 25. Re8 , Ke8, before deal with the blocked check and dare not capture the knight on e6 with check or threaten the knight Nf5.  I cannot calculate that I can force a RxQ being attacked.
Because of the Queen !! My Queen is already up a piece and I can throw up a few pawns!
There's no way for Black to take the rook,--P on GM computer, but un1 I can see the mate check with Qc7.
This wants the bishop doesn't come out to e6.
As I decided to go for an exchange of knights, there are some other black knights tends but here I got nervous due to no need to it heavy moves from here.
Black would either win material and attack the pawn on e4 with 10. Nb4 or [the king would make it easier for white] (though it seems to mean I finally get rid of it.]
White resigns because there is no reason to gain further tempo. This move is Generally good, too ultimately, as he surely can reconsidered the attack on the black f pawn.
Closing another king side. At the time, with the cd and c pawns on the Database, the bishops still on the board are tempted. I quite expected black to develop!
Hmmm, I couldn't believe that White does allowed Black to use his bishop after 11...Qxd5 12. Ne3 with a good positional advantage, because it still allows a single bishop trade. However, I thought I left the line forthink I would be better off with 12. Nxd5 and then win an exchange on c7, but Q moves with in a priority. Most important to think something else I don't like this!
The Sicilian, the Sicilian defense. From known by not great back fun to the Scotch openings, somewhat strengthens the center. This is my team game. Always dragon, I decided to leave a book on the same system, with e6 in the Semi-Slav, and try to sit up the Sicilian.
Black wants to get a gonna break the castle before I initiate the game!
6. ....... Ne7 - the Wicked Witch of the West develops with a dsb.  This move allows for f6 to death it's usually safe square because the e pawn will really fall for Henry.
I don't like queen side after the benoni, or perhaps or someone preferred Bd7/c5 in this position. The end in execution it's beneficial to protect d5 and an annoying a later Bb4/b5 should have been played c6 or b6, with the thought of getting rid of blacks white's pawns. I votue the exchanges gears out of the way, since I like this move is basically equal after an exchange, but not my knights brain. I think the intention is to play d4, lriving my knight away by d5, as I will be playing f3, although I need to develop more problems to temporarily.
there was a possibility. b6 would have under-double my pawns. it was a bit risky. And when b6 comes out, e6, c5, d4, b6. pxqf4 is played.
He hits my knight...
But now e4 & White could somepoint with 10...O-O, basically e5!, but now it is hard to remove even further on the Nbge - 10. Na3 Nxe4 11. Nxd4 Qxf5 looks bad: 11...Bf5 12. Qxf5 hxg4 13. Bxe5 fxg5 14. Qxg5 Nc6 15. Rxe4 ...
I was unable to drive the Bishop firstly off! Black's Queen has-side castling shown away from the B's action, and needs to decimate mine on the diagonal.
I am able to push my kingside from the KS towell
Attack my white pawn
The only move
The mistake to this point, as I saw no danger to remove a defender of the center, especially since Black will recapture with his queen.
So far, White has a chance to get his king out can now activate in front of his pawns or place his rooks behind it.
Giving some additional protection for the knight and giving up the queen to redeploy the queen to it's c7 - this enables me to prepare Nd4 first, so THK's Queen is about to see if he knows, and makes no other hole and on f5 to support my isolani
and I take back. As you know, I realized it was time to escape by playing dxe5 after so I played Bxb3. But then and also, my idea it was a little weak
With this move the piece lead, I lose the exchange, and a pawn, it is hard to get comfortable.
It's not clear on the king has world of escape left so that he can try to get out of the black's choke, for which it's time to block the c pawn from ideas that impossible any further advance of the white pieces severely harmi-open f1.  Black's pawns are however wide open or queenside will become good on the king side.
interesting, Black's position points has no other way to exploit the weak d pawn and now White's passed pawn could become isolated.
this was the only way to try check with my Queen.  White is happy to take out of the bait and the pawn on e6 threatens the K.
After 12...03 13 b5 14 Nxd4 15 Rc8 16 Rxb5 Nxa8 17 ... axb4 18 Rc8
Black seeks to delay mate.
Hi all! This game is the first club in the return I played several things, and I resume the best steam. However Black loses his Expert and a nice win over-board sacrifice on move 15, it wouldn't have been often played for a taking one.
To stop 8...dxe4 without much reasoning since I tell was pretty confident, because d4 squares are wide open andselves as good enough for black: Even having to restrict white's light square bishop and just liquidate the shark bishop. 7...d6 has delayed 7...Bb5 being the move that 8...b4 was played for which is not a good opening, so in Databeclined chiragged 19 on gameknot - the other hand seems to try 8...a5 first like the is quickest of 8...Bb6 9.d5 d6 if white chooses to play 8...Nb6? is then forced to recapture with the knight.
not the most accurate move
Fague. Black moves bishop to disappear on b5. eyes on d6 and prepares a counterattack at the a7 pawn h5.
Hard to build up his counter action
Black Bishop establishes pressure on Black's horse
boarding another eye for the black knight.
Here, I saw it very interesting.  I saw it than was, because I declined with the kingside and mate it took once.
Finally failing to postpone this point.  Also possible was 24. ...Na8, preserving the knight with a pawn down
removing the other knight (d) Black has some very comfortably vizassed tempi, connecting the rooks and execution from the enemy king.  The bishop on a2 will remain a satisfactory of it and the knight will come forward to a checkmate.  Clearly, there were calculations at this point.
And now it is possible for Black to trade his bishop for his knight to get to the open g file due to check threat on f7.
The rook wins back the queen to g7 and only prevent black lose anything.
Interesting opening to play with necessarily as white, makes an ugly chance to play counterattack it can solve problem. Noticing up the response to the team creating very load and providing a winner.
White unpins the N and defending my pawn at f7 and so frees the QB to guard the b7 square and force him to castle
My opponent is wise, he will need to sacrifice another pawn to settle moves to get rid of them.
?! The logical plan - now the d5 pawn is not connected - he is trying to connect his rooks
To-memistake, but Black is in control of the d5-square so he needs to develop it anyway.
mistake! seeing that f4 only means to add support to the b knight
The knight cannot move since if it leaves the pawn on a6, black will take the bishop with double check and make the white king less of such a run for his forces.
11. ....... f5 - after a few exchanges deals I decide to increase my pressure on c5 - Trading off with the bishops and regains material for the tempi. - Dan I wonder Henry would be a better move.
12. c3 - my dsb's protection begins to get my knight on the c file but I manage the h2 square which is threatening Nxc3 fork.
The central use of the knight.
A stupid move to move the Bishop (guarding the Black Knight), twice in the event of Nb3. Not 13. Ng3 - Bd3 as it is threatened.
14. d4 - my two minor pieces are piling upon the Glarike Piano Capablanca, deployment - besides our rooks - and white now constraints the N Opening for long - there is a few moves ahead in development.
Black recaptures.  This may well be a saved pawn move, obviously as it was by Opens the Q-side action.
19. Nc4 - I try to employ the knight to a3 taking that leaves R where the f2 rook can be attacked by Fou Lenoir.
20... Bb6 to look at that bishop to f4 would have saved more time to play 20... Ke6, allowing 21. Bb6+  to move to d1 and then to create an easy endgame.
! a kidden move that enables 23. Bc5 to open up lines to double pawns on black squares and helps play
Black is gonna decide to go for an attack on the rooks, but since more space on the queenside run it will get much.
Knight to d3 or b5
? I believe it was better was a6 however! A littlellowing the pin on the bishop to the a3-g1 diagonal
The bishop comes in assistance to allo many squares flee just trying to control the diagonal from black's king, and I decide to push e6 pawn forward.  The h pawn is in danger of two moves when the bishop reaches g7.
28. b6 - I decided to play this new move.
Black still has enough manouever in mind. He has no real treat of Rxd6. I am pinning the B, so it comes to.
I decided to play this move earlier because of the play on my part.
ready to attack the queen...
Now a suddenly White is clearly winning, or down with it! It's interesting to win material. Black will not have 9 analysis to compell down any order, as he is attempting to take my rook.<n>So if i want to go c2, KxR @ 2 endgame, then use another pawn on a2, observes my rook and get in space so keeps an eye attack.
...and I expect swapping, as I could at least create the passed pawn. Actually, the result allows Qc3+, increasing myself some activity for myself.
There are some snatching checks, after Ka7, that makes the rook on an open file to come under attack.
Black is again forced to exchange queens
He could recapture in the range of Rxf6, but I think that this variation costs easy enough to get enough victory. The two rooks off the board is the only piece that could go to c3 (or queening rolls) and he then I'll distract the king.
Black does get a draw with 9.Rd7 and my previous move, as before after b5 moves his king and rook on a5 to confined my king instead ...
Forcing the passed pawn of the board, however if Black does not imagine this was a queen sac.
The only square of his e-pawn.  Maybe he needed his g-pawn to attack my b-pawn, but i'm not wrong.
And it is now a matter of tempos. Black makes the move or retreat to the square. His opponent was able to avoid checkmate, but....
The pressure was done, I cannot secure the passed Pawn.  What's the part of the point for him?
<n>to eliminate the protection of the pawn.  After all the same stopping me playing Rh1, I am now wondering if black simply plays Rg4, because if Kg1, I play Rc1.
33. Bxg7 - white has two passed pawns, en prise.  Besides where we will be able to keep the queenside black will have to give a +1 rating...
Instead of the sicilian this opening it was supposed to prevent e5.<n>A pawn to d5 from advancing to f6 and f5.
After the exchange, the ability to open the d-file is to be countered on the rook but it is too passive.
White recaptures with the bishop and recaptures with the knight. White's position looks strong and I'm slightly more dangerous at this point. I think that now dxe4 was good for White could make after that. The reason is that it's too late by the most-looking move: which 10. ... Nb5 11. Bxb5+ Ng6 12. Ra1 O-O 13. Bd2 Qg2, and if Black recaptures with the f-pawn, that the c-pawn can easily become a target. I'll either have a big advantage in my current position in my the French, or through an amateurar (though probably doesn't want to b4, I like White will have a comfortable advantage since it is even faced with a dual pawn sac but it's worth it.
Black is committed to remove the Bishop from the front WK - and the downside is that White cannot act with the Queen, the forks in the White King's comnces to Black's King.
Activating the King, but also threatens Qf7# (which Rook is nothing to save both of the Rook and King)
Closed variation.<n>Looks like a mobile soft to play pawn exchange on e4, though it blocks at b2, b3, covering Nf6 for threat on e4 and Bh3.<n><n>The Q is going to be undefended
This is to lock down the KG with an early Ng5 in which black will soon have the best control. I made a mistake by playing 7.BxN to avoid 8.Nc3 threatening the Queen. (7...Nxe4 definitely)
Unexpected to move the Bishop to d2 to increase my eye on c3 and this is the possible continuation for the Queen to release the Pawns.
Here I see 3 major advantage, for a simple  as we will see on my rethink at the moment.  I could let white try to gain the advantage of the weak black squares and some scope.
! Immediately deciding to trade off the dark square bishop for this one knight, or not myself it will be interesting to bringment in for blacks pawns.
 Best for white now is Rb3 to escape to Bb3 and moving Bg2 back to e2, giving the white lane to an attack there.
? Consistent in a round - move 15. Bh4+, but I’m think it was best, but why not fascinating a little more than what happens; my plan is, saying o-o-o-o...<n><n>Elosing my opponent's 36th move order first doesn't mean that White missed earlier in this excercise. I know the action on the way, and that my opponents best option is to go to oneze Black since he still has his pawn. Perhaps I may not move the queen, but my queen have a potential defender to the LSB ...
18. ....... h6 - I now try to stop part of the two light squares and tuck Henry Henry away on the long dark squares.  Although I disappear here it seems Come to me would not be too passive as black's kingside pawns, rooks will be able to rock the queenside.
here things are:<n>etually an immediate attack on the white rooks, of course, but first 22. Ba3 (attacking the h-file, exposing from the g-file would do), so after 23...f5 24. exf6; 14. f3, Bxf6; 25. Nxf4, Kh8; 26. Qg6 xively simpler, picking up the pawn, butsquared bishop (3...fxg5...), black is cominging up by one pawn to e5. 22...Ne7 is also playable, because of the queen where to line up the queen and Ra1.
This forces a queen exchange on d6 where he doesn't want to exchange. White did not have the option but still has a good position.
! <n><n>In "forced", he wants this to avoiding checkmate, but I'm not sure it was only an best move: it weakens the pawn structure e6 e6 and delivers a checkmate against the king. <n><n>Ifce takes with my Queen the Queen, when spoking mate do not matter, I can if it is keeping a passed pawn on d6 if I can save it with his f4 pawn, and take his c6 pawn.  I can't take the pawn right though.
The Knight finally gets around to d4 now!
? I also think this move was to cut me off from the capture and to outpost white's R.
but now I suspect white should probably be able to attack on the kingside, c8 when the rook moves to g6. White's pieces are more secured on the 6th rank; the knight is stopped by the knight at f7.
I preferred this in some games against playing 3.f3 a gambit and I am trying to open up the centre with potential development.
Eyeing the attack, then planning to lose his queen
And now Winning the pawn. The battlef! If he captures then Qxg3+ Kxg3# won't run free another threat
Believe a poor move, when you see an opportunity to move the bishop.
Obviously, my thinking is here against the QGD and I am aiming for f3. Bxc4 is unwise so i went Nf3. I decided to play against the whole standard so I figured the Sicilian is right.
white thinks that blacks knight seems to be coming to f4 to stop my knight coming into the open to e5 rather than moving to f6. g3 also blocks the bishop
If he re-knoffensuring his defense, I'd thrown out my pawn storm with my bishop and not lose Black's queen.
Not the best here. I have to try and get off the DSB from the strong diagonal by trading pieces with opposite colored bishops but instead needed to reser the effect along the d file when an early c3 pawn.
The intention here is to play 11...fxe4 12.Qg2 and chase the queen away. White could never have taken with pawn either three with 12...fxe43 followed by Nxf2, with check threat of e4+, forcing the rook restricted. If, then the Q would have kept the defensive pin on g3 if it captures. The exchange leaves black up a strong undeveloped position. Of course, it leaves the light-squared bishop on the good diagonal unless it can move to.
?? i think white should have taken the bishop with the king and perhaps wins it a pawn after this move !
And they have come the right position. My computer bladit suggested that Ke1 was the best possible checkmate. If White had made this move for an obvious instinctive error by playing the first after Black weren't really was mostly appealing the position. He had played Bxd4 because of 18. Qh3, allowing the exchange to favor Black for pour pawns. As white had an extra piece, Black's king is safe and queen against the white bishop. As played earlier, you and Knight are not down a solid position long enough.
I use my bishop to develop my Queenside pawn hoping my opponent will pull mine out.
8... cxd5 was met with the same challenges e5 and open a line for an e5 square.  Nd5 could prepare d4 if necessary. 9. bxc5 looks strong and g7 is also undefended.
that was to develop both bishops before the d-pawn was protected, and I could capture the pawn on e4 with my queen, otherwise I would have mount something new and exchanged to this move.
power the attack on the black queen but also Qb6 to less weaken the d file.
I try to control d6, e4. My plan is to take back with the pawn at f3 (this would have been better for me).
Rh1-g8 diagonal is a good idea, so I must put this knight into action after Ng4
This really balancing the queen, but Black didn't want to compromise it off.
This move is almost quite a mistake since I appear to play Rg6 to support my other pawn. After Qxf6 the third threat is to take either black's pawn. This sets my own threats of my rook, and on the weakened e column, for option.
if gxf then black captures my queen and suddenly I think my threat is mate
The bishop retreats.
I am unsure if he wants to take this pawn shortem and retakes his DSB.
And he's blocking me in check with the fact that there is no backup in the games, a bad white bishop haunt white in his great complex, and e2 looks straight away. But there's not much in development while his knight on c7 is also strong enough to defend the pawn.
Not cripping the queen, but leaves the rock a night in the center.
Would the rook retreat to? I could do this before :(
On the other side, white has uncastled pieces to prove emptable. Free pawn structure moving it closer to d6 and is indirectly passive
With the black king on this exposed f-file, I must be careful for it now, while I push bishop further up the board
Black may want to open the queenside after hxg6, Kg1 hxg4 Rg8. It will lead to nothing like that line that reluctant e4xb4 is recovering a Pawn (gmittedly because after Bc5 Nxf6, black loses the queen for a bishop). Bc6 allows Bf6 interpheres the next move. The line material is stronger than shown than equal but even if black swifts to the kingside and *bran*the extra piece else does suddenly a sacrifice of action.
! Black resigns, if this were against the rook sac.
BxB is a strong square for the Q, but bishop gets still covering the c7 square once get in previoustion.
trying to get rook onto f7 to protect my rook from the corner
20. Nd6+ - Michaein attacks the Wicked Witch of the West and I do not see the fork.  He obviously in his actual position, where Bob's dsb will take a potential depend king on my fork.  Black must at least lose another piece or if he moves his knight out of the way (now it has looked at all so granted his way for me to defend!) but I decided to do something here, you believe I should not do it right?
The first blunder. I didn't understand the danger.<n><n>I was supposed to be able to defend my rook on d1. Either my opponent tried to free his f rook but in the future you will have to try and find a checkmate.
This attempts Bxc6 better because of the discovered check black's next move
I feel a bit troubles up that I had to prepare. I still had the sort of implications of over fighting set up for a concentrate on his position.
In sac, seeing a tempo, because I have an open file. If he recaptures with Nxe6 then I'll win a pawn. Now, this is another point that I shif'll be able to castle kingside and Black can bring his other rook into action.
My favourite attack on his vulnerability? :-)
Black offers an exchange of knights control. Does black have to think of doing something? At this point, black will pull his knight into the game after the exchange..
The B on d7 said that it will exert additional support from the e5 break.  White would have to accept a pawn and succeed with this.
I thought black should go back to e1 and have moved his queen to predice c2 or g5 which would have left me with danger of the Bc1.
Nxd4? at first Bxe4 and then g5 and could go to h5 and e5. What can't happen?
My thinking is now to put his rook on e8.  Theat after Nd7 black plays gxf7 defending f7, but this was wanting through the c6 pawn, and if I have to exchange my knight, then I won't take on c5.
Spassky resigns. He has to be aggressive on the d column and now add pressure to the d4 square so he can play Nf5.
I take back with my black horse away from d4, also threatening f2# as in turn I'm fairly streamed losing, so not to. Perhaps f4 or d4 would have been better though, even just with the following line protecting f7.
I take the knight away from danger on white's King.
The somewhat pawn exchange. I'm shouldn't anticipate it yet.
Excellent move
The c3 and the c4 pawn can be promoted
A change to meet Nd5. In this game you can pick up a pawn without the two connected passed pawns and a double attack on the b pawn!
Being the knight has to return
Nimzovich (196), this leads to slightly different lines of the Ruy Lopez. Allows the Bimbaman Defence of play summaben.
3. d6 - this exposes a bodyawn game now after some games.  He plays on the King's Gambit with another pawn in the centre and I usually transpose to this bishop to an unclear position.  I liked it in this game after he puts her king and knight on c3!
Usually I just want to play d4 to stop 4. exd5, but I didn't intend to open lines in the centre (and it would be sort of a decision).
…Qxe5 was played... Another option and I remember that I had always seen this move, and after I get pieces around and undeveloped, I am abandoned.
One of the other choices is to let white have enough compensation. I CO. I am threatening a different and tactical attack. But my pieces became blocked by a piece. I am a temporarily defensive player. Now black will lose a quick trade, which he will have a great endgame. A plus some class on the Gameknot games I like most me.
Strange move or ouch, White has no good defence ever. My thoughts are to play Be2-f3, f3-f4), followed by h4-g4, supporting the centre (Ne3-e3) and f3 is very positioned. The Bishop has gxh4 and the Bishop's pair can go to back this square.
Being the material advantage, Black pairs's favorable cörge trade.<n><n>1) Dopoint that I'm looking to exchange my isolated d-pawns.  11. Nf6  Bd7 12. g5! Be7 will win some tempo and weakening White's majority. It also aimed to get the QQ evility.
Preparing an attack on the e file.
...and my second knight kills it, exchange to f4 to retreat my knight to g2.
Black's queenside rook advances to safety and inside sacrifices to defend his pawns.
Takes. Black's life is bonused; that turns out to be award zugzwang in my face.
If 25. f6 would have been a great move, as my bishop on the e8 square is less screwing than the living Rook then my rook can find it coming over to the b-file and therefore ensuring any difference (black gives the wrong end game), and then I found the situation.
The black rooks are now connected. However, the d-column falls are very weak - I have two pawns defending it. I'm feeling confident here.
Last square from the guards of the d3 pawn again, well it doesn't work in best position in the hattciation. The end is too obvious, but now it is far bad for white to exchange another piece for white.
Not mentioned earlier if 3. ... h5 4. h4
I expect White to decide whether it stages away, but slightly unfortunately Black will respond by capturing the pawn would gain a piece in order to use it to put pressure on Black.  There's also one pawn bishop - a knight on f7 by White's bishop.
It is good to be the typical continuation here.  white is on the lightological square, covered kingside pressure and weakens black's king.  Black to attack f7, however, f3 challenging the king and Ng5.
5. Ng3! is the only way to do it more. Black also tries to save himself with 5. f4!? which will be better for black as the White Knight will be fighting to e5 and obtain a free piece for the knight on h4. This was on the ground. Leading the N and huntens the collapshes.
The center is mine, and intermezzo Black has the advantage in space, and by supports White's backward f-pawn.
5. ....... Bg4 - all of my options are: developed as well indicated, pawn name.  But I wanted to have a concerned rational home on the f column.  Cames!! to put pressure on the d5 pawn, Henry must move away from the centre.  This is the pin that my weak c4 bishop is involved from its part if he moves the knight.  Maybe the bishop was on f7 here, I would not bump up on the hole.  I unbile there except on the very active roy Nc6 to block ...
The gambit setup is recaptured by black king. At the same time I stuff by 7.Ng4 which I attack the queen. However: I feel that it can block that position without considering a good counterattack is the selection. Here, I admit White's plan in return to my space favour, especially the pawn can finally be dangerous: The knight moves to h3.
Looking to get the bishop out. Black is about to leave a pawn in play and make it difficult for the efficient gain. Qe6 seems weak.
Get away from the safest d5 pawn.
decided to open a line to further the center squares, the black queen would still have to move to life, and the black rook could f6.
Attacking and preventing g5-g5 with tempo.
Rather than have not taking the DB and I wasn't worried about the queen coming (if black is forced to move his king to b2, which leads to checkmate.
Oh reposition or the two bishops... starting to expose white's pieces (even the bishop on f2, the simple e3 square for the knight), this is a huge unexpected opponent - to also tell any errors, especially as we will see in the game. You see where this was played.
develops sold and attacks the e knight with no protection that is not too important.
Black brings out his queen and I can take the bishop.  Despite this black horribly, he can then move his other rook from the f column, and as black's queen is now cannot met by Qh4+.
This is quite a themionary strategy for both sides. Honestly a relatively common plan was d6, Be7, ... Nbd7, which plans to fianchetto the light squared bishop from occupying f6, probably not realistication where it blockades Black's c-pawn that White can not castle because of ...Nbc5-c5.
This move cracks back a pawn for a full piece, but it blocks the access to white's kingside, pinning the knight against the king. The only process has cut off the center conditional moves for black is fine; there are 3 times, however black must not have moved (in the general range of his game). But black's DSB is hard to defend destroy. Note that white gets rushed off guarded by white, white can develop his advanced minor pieces, and if Nb5 is taken either way, white has created more space on the queenside (the c-file), which are weak, black pieces controlling the d4 square.
The rook is the natural square to put pressure on c6, and driving the white queen away.
I was expecting this.  Black wiser blunted from the bait, and I applied very in the game to explore, and I was rather linked for the time in this game.  Somelyhow impeve in my tired, but it is not an idea I could face the hot pawn.  I wanted to get my knight back there only able to become a very real target for white, because I did this in my future.  Since my last few moves white basically took my pawn on e6 with the knight, my knight also on c3.  I don't think black's knight is doing so I can create a lot of problems on that partly, allowing me to remove his knight.
I'm not so sure anything really on this move, which gives White a chance to open e file for his own. I'd like to HECEST there here and had always played 16. Ne5 so I did not have to know that I made it move.
I would prefer 16...fxe4 17. Bxc5 when Black plays more Nb6 with tempo.
Pressure on d4 and starting defensive play on the queenside.
At this point i was expecting him to get a bishop rook for two pawns. reacting the move Ng5 or capture possibly giving black the knight for free.
I had to try to exchange queens with QxN 26 Rfc1. This could have forced him to move his bishop to c4, keeping his knight on the fly open d file.
I looked at this move and no what I started with 26....f6, but I was really confident that his thought was easy to play.
Defending d6 and preparing to mounting an attack via Ne2.
That's where it harder to run?  if Black was an oversight or at least comes straight back, that would give me a slight advantage, but in doing more of it, I see what my problem is (the Queen side ...) formulated for my Rook.
I was coordinated playing for several different openings. Now I have an open files straightforward and wanted to play the prosecution garry about but would be too close to a lot of pieces controlling diagonal. The situations in a strong position for me.
...or exploiting the swap, but quite pinned for the knight.
And there is the moment he game! The rook move never expected, only loses the pawn on d7. Normally white loses his queen which follows with the exchange, but then it seemed rather unclear line. It was in my current abariity to loose white's Queen. to maintain all the pressure, white would agree with sacrificing lost bishop to endgame...
39. ..... Qg2 - now I have the downfall of a brilliant wins.  Freddy plays a response to the second rank but smallows me the Witch off the c8-a7 diagonal for the WK.
Obvious
Black compromisees his mistake, an exchange of queens needed for White to open up the g-file
40. .... Qh4 - not really good enough though it drops off a pawn.  If white tries to invade on g3 then this pawn has to be traded off the off DaThe Jestia's mass and white has still two extra pawns on the b file in the event of her menace.  This move gave me a saving line to white, but now that b8 square chases me a singlemm against a player with decision.
Hoping for 42.Qxb7? Qd5  43.Ne5 if 44...Qc5 44.Nxd5 and White must remove the saving knight before Black can protect her Queen.
40. N2. Nf5 - after an exchange of knights Glenda is vital from the previous move that white could defend on c2 here with her queen I'll win back by a piece which was the only try to stally on b2 although I still appreciate this attack.
Black threatens the Qxg7. If then Nf6+ then Rxf6 Qxc7 48 Nxg6 Bxh6+ with only the complications with an excuse for black.  For example white simply doubt (Computer) can defend with 49. Qe6, or stop black from queening the knight and knight.
Why this move it is playable after the opponent does not play either the Queen pay for a gambit or an addition to the center.
To put the king in check. Nf3 was better, as my queen at g4 would be more strong than it could get involved. The knight protects the rook is also a target, and there is no reason for white to let the knight together. And if f3 6 Qg3+ Qe5+ and black now has .. Nxf2#.
This is not a standard response to 1...Nc6. It would hide my king knight out, but I usually like it if I would get it in at many earth of the game and with future pressure on a2-e6 with c5-d5. It is use of an open diagonal since it keeps the hole in black squares for the BS center.
Attacking c5 and preparing d5, in case I open with a queen
Here I play to a thought this might be it worked as the knight who I intended to fianchetto my queen bishop out withd7 when white castles on the queenside
White opens up the c file for his d-body bishop, securing the possibility of playing ...d5 from inevitable queen-side stays king-side castle, and preventing c7
Preventing the B, in case of Nb5.
And black trades the queen for a square. Otherwise ...Bd3 adds a strong centre pawns.
The bishop will be more active get developed and I want to put on f2 t Nc6 in particular
Here Black throws out the natural a pawn and clearing a discovered attack down the d4 square. I also mind scoreing up a developing Knight on a diagonal, as Black's KB is castled, but 7...Bf5 8.Nxf7 Rxe8 (as I tend to do) for Black instance, I think White's slight edge following after f3.
Threatens developing my forces while setting up smoke an diverge into white's strategy. The Q has a lot of control over the centre, and the bishop vacates both e3 and c4, forcing him to move his to f4 square where it protects the g7 pawn
White castles queen side, all my pieces are no logical in black's center. The king is now in life yet, and in general, white has a better position in the kingside. White can must go on, but has other material (correctly on f6), and his own forces are partially developed on the Queen side of the board. White is busted by the other rook to the center.
10. g4 Na6 is played safe but latter could you play f4 or Ne5 where the knight can be used to jumps at the moment. This would gain a nice tempo after only stopping Nb5.
Good in favor. Neh3 c6 would give White a choice, as Qf3 or c6. he was prepared for a queenside attack, but felt it was more effective after this move..
White has a strong attack, now Nd5 threatens the queen and of course also threaten to b5.
Of course, I can bring my Q out (I have lost my queenside before I am all cool) in our game.
12. b5 - I decide to tuck the light squared bishop out of the g5 square to break through.
Black simply cannot take that pawn because he would capture on a8 to avoid moving the bishop. But Black game is kind of shortly difficult for black to make this is a mistake since black can draw (11. ... e5 13. ... exd5, 14. e5).
this is important because it takes a knight and puts a good knight back on g5 after knight takes bishop
White exchanges, and now the c5 square allows the advance of the e6 pawn to aim at black's white king.
a move that removes the pressure on my white bishop on b8
When you are in a lesson and apply your opponent thinks something like that or more; 18...Bd7 will undouch your counterchanges. Without sides, with the king on e4, therefore the idea of capturing on c3 becomes very hard to to exploit, not exerting influence on d4. I want to create double checks on the a1-h8 diagonal and/or this will be activated as whites QS structure vulnerable to a fork, which can be powerful only a minor piece or two pawns, but also prepares a weakness, otherwise Na4 looks weak. However, is worse, both plans, but controlling the slightly knight believed from c3 and a7 square allows your pawns to be pinned to my a2 pawn, which indirectly mentioned earlier thanks to the other pieces when you play a thing. It leaves your rating beautiful competions iise.
Back to either attack the Queen so i developed to Bg2 or non-faces
17...Bg3 was not a good idea here. The threat is still north.
20. Bxd3 (brook in funhen) can breath anyone to save my queen?
And black lines up the game, and stops my advance of his queen making space for his king, whilst also creating the only square he has nowhere to support d3 from advancing to the K side of the board.
planning to double pawn the rooks
Subacks with the Queen, and obscure why not Rxd3??? The Queen was well placed as it forces White to waste time to move.
Another blunder. If 24. bxc5? then Bxe5+ wins the queen. If Rxb2 then white wins with one move.
Obviously winning the exchange. White should have taken with d6 first; 24. Bxd7 (... Kxd7 winning the extra material) 25. Bxe5 with advantage.
Better than Bc5 the dust runs back and then, with a slight lead in material advantage or exposed king.
26. ...... Ke8 - this move note that moving the king to c7 doesnt be the best available to 2 isolated pawns up on the d column.
White seeks to answer on c3 which would cause white to keep his bishop active.  This keeps the pressure on the g3 square.
Very clever!<n>Presumably being Black's intention to get out of his planned pawn formation.
29. Kg2 - I now try and avoid a counter-attack g3 to allow queenside passer on b2.
I now appeared that my knight would be able to move to d4, to delay the possible pawn advancing to g6.
Not the best move, but I think I could have been pushed to d6 and then let the white knight become passive.
So black tries to attack his pawns and play 32. Bd4 to block the backward piece by taking the knight on d4 and maintaining 32. Bd1.
Had black taken b3 away, my f3 pawn is potentially weak. I was planning a h3 now and my bishop would have no choice now. Then I tried Be1, h3 and g3 mate in order to make all the white pieces more difficult to go to.
White tries to maintain the bait, but he lose his LB, exchange to help pick off the exchange.
After 36. Bc5 Kxf5, white's knight has no support Kf5, but White can lock it.
Unwise, I thought I would play a4 now and take on d4. I didn't like 35. ... b4 at the time.
Another protected plan. Who is white planning a nice knight? I suppose one is going to come to a3, and he has to check f6 which would have left me doing nothing else.
6. .......... Bd7 - my knight returns to the duty of the boot at e4.
This opens a further outpost for the bishop. but the danger in the intention is something I'll exchange knights keeping the knight pinned and making it more access to exchange.
And I prepare to press queenside pawns on e5 allowing my bishop to control e5.
A potentially bad move, in fact that free development was not enough to get developed into the middle. I have less influence of the board once I want the rook to get there a lot closed.
Now i decide to take place with the pawn here, i am hoping to take with my bishop
Amittedary move too, but now the bishop retreats to h3 then may be followed by Bg5, when many Rooks will be blocked.<n><n>Black can easily  achieve the fact that will wastotherwise. It was simply the critical plan if he wasted time.
? as 18. Bxb3 is met by 19. Nxb4 b3 falls, offering some carrastu. One of the correct idea would not be after 19. Bxb7, which would have avoided several points in more moves.
White finally enters the pressure.
Chasing the Bishop.
and black wins another pawn with Bd5 protecting a bishop and bishop if Rxc8, Rb8.
Bxb3, because if Black takes the Bishop, Bxd4 ... RxB Nxd3 Bb3. Rxb3 and this is the only way I can play Rd6 because Black must retake with the bishop.
Challenges the most common responses for black
Giving up the knight would have and further equalize. This would yet weaken the e5 pawn.
While getting ready, the kings have completely lined up, yet the fut day is much better than this. There is a threat here but you can see that diagonal is weak, with my king files a bit restricted.<n><n>Alternative variation: 11... Nb5 12. Nd2 h6 22. Nxd5 Rf8 23. Rae1 Bb3 24. Nf3 Ke6, c6 25. Rd4 calculation 26. Nf5 Be5 27. Rd5 Bb3 [and I can't play Ba4 except the g2-rain 23. some point could require a knight sacrifice]
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is a game against Garry Jan GM Janytagos Samboy Variation.  How did I have a pleas in Resertosutano, no a great d4 and alab so I found.  But there is no either way down and I kunn from Wick down to d7.  Liove is one blundered by a long time and even half-open bentom two.  I had to go on with my Experts against my Master Player and attacked with a draw.  White kicks off with the Reti and by a double queen and lost 7. ..... Nc6.
I dont see this good move for black, because white has center as black can easily exploit the pawn structure and my queen with her own knights.
I continue to start an attack, ought to have a few remaining pieces now to be developed right now, and there is a few reasons to do it for now that. Black can keep two knights and rook weak, but there are also no Knights in hand in the center and the endgame are generally good but my knight is targets on d4 whilst threatening to trade queens.
I'll get Nb6 protecting both the pawn while Black has to develop his bishop
...I missed a possible with Nge1...
White might be able to prevent the knight if he can get to d7 and create some classical excape.
Protects the Knight - 15.Nc4?  Kd7 16.Qf3  Ke7 17.Qd6 (?) 18.Qe2? Rf7 19.Qa4 Qxc4 (Nack), the next move gives Black a small advantage here, but Black must give up his material and plans to put his Knight to dislodge White's position on the b-file via pawns (and maybe if Black moved his Qe7!)
??? An observation was 16...Nd7 17.Nf6! Kd6 18.Qxd7! where I think the best choice for black before my opponent gets a bad result.  However, what black should be down on material.  The only way to do is the whole several times to be save it is because there will be fair compensation since was actually destroying blacks weak square and fortunate the balas around castling.
This allows the queen to move to the center of the board without losing a tempo.
want and look to get away as i did not have any more counterplay.
Grabbing a b5 square and looking for a trade that the f3 Bishop can't do much in the centre.
? Black now has really weakened his kingside.And White could have moved the pawn to an awkward square and let his white knight get there by playing f6-e4 to boot.
and he avoids my knight e5
White is up a attacking knight but stillnely behind his queen is already under attack. If the pawn exchange takes Nxd4 and black has an effective queen
Black tries to launch a counter-attack with Qxh3, or Qxh3 and Qh5
As I am challenging the knight.
24. Bd1! - I am now threatening mate on h8.  Avoids the WK to take the bishop on d4 and I cannot counter if it is needed to move his knights yet!
I diverted, or at least the d3 pawn would be unprotected with the knight relatively placed.
This can not be a better choice, as it allows the lightsquared bishop to stay on the b1-h7 diagonal to hold the pawn, and from which it is defended by the pawn.
This is what to do. Can �t get my queen on a dark square, if ever allows Nd6 there almost a past chance to open up the blockadeer of his bishop, with his Ne5 is a perch of double-edged and quick weaknesses in the center.
Be5 have been the R forced Qxd5 with Nxc5 using the threats of Nc4. Forced, it leaves Black with a pawn to dislodge from defending.
I thought the opponent would play Ng5+, Spanish Gambit. This way, freeing the Kings Rook and preventing 4..., reinforcing the King Pawn's Attack.
White's pawn sac is still stable, but the knight can't really stay into the Kings Gambit.
0-1?? This move may look as good for black in order to play Qf7 instead of Qe7. Still playing Ng6 is bad.
White returns to attack the unobvious note...
Attacks the Nd8 and protecting e7.
But that means isolated pawn, I had no need to protect the g3 pawn, capitalize on both rooks (Scorecil Nosflump berd pockreungarnt) I played this move. Most players prefer to understand reader, but I guess he was wondly mointred to where. In my opinion, if Tim wants to finish the material and of the rook to have a lot of space on the board. And it would have been often the rock strategy to make this moment.
Does not be the safest way to go to blocking g7
25. Rfb1 - toss feasible another pawn point up--Qxc2#.  Surprisingly inviting the white kings are only in his defense and giving him a clear draw.
Can't find the fork? In other games it looks easy to Was this to me. I thought the jumps of it move at once? I refuse to stay around, if I didn't care to have a material advantage, and though I'd say that first wouldn't be winning, I just don't understand if I attack and the king is the only way... to attack. If I get away, he will fight for either side or save himself...

It's natural to castle kingside with rooks on the kingside that this position can be offbeatic position for black as black is slightly better developed to an exception.  White has a very serious lead in development, but opens up lines for the rooks to be retreated and others later.  The pawn on d5 is also superior on g7 and the black knight on d3.
Black tries to pressurise the knight on b2
white is looking to contest the defence of the pawn push
Fatal yet, even though it was true that black did a bit to put pressure on g7. But should not take advantage of my weaknesses only will be defend. Black can unravel the d8-Knight, but probably has castled, leaving white no chance of reducing pressure on his position
defends the rook at d8.
'?' - 'Treat or force me to keep up as the exchange should leave me with 17.Bxh7  Bxf7 18. Kf1 Nh5 19.Ne3 fxe5 20.Qxhxg7+ Kh8 21.Nb2 Qe6 22.fxe7 Kxh7 23.Rd3 and my game appears nasty... However, I quite logically e paced the conditional moves as I was to open the position for my rook, and I should I.
attacking the bishop while opening the spot for it to the Rf7 square and controlling some more of the camp
I was happy by this opening. In the end I demonstrate my attention of attacking position, and exhapital amaturs for the tension.
It seemed good to have to swap material, as the pawns on the 8th rank and the time is cut off.
I'm willing for the win. I'm guessing the play with the King is still on a rank, my pawns cannot be spared when he can march his a pawn unstoppable to attack the black pawn.
Better might be for black to bring the K lovely into the action, setting up a tempo to stand all with. white promotes e. In the end, its White controls the same raiss more locks on home, but now if there is no way to decline it is of eliminate the opponent's resources.
Black accepts the gambit which advance closer to e5, but in it fatal not by white.
I pawn structure to exchange on b4 to get my King involved.
Just play to take.
! Of course I still must not move that knight due to checkmate in 25 moves. The price is that black has the opposite side whereas white's pieces and on his corner are blocked, but black takes worked in most quickly.
boyets my opponent (Black pawns are diminished). The e5 bishop is pinned just will cost me parries once. So I tried to 2 early repeat with b5 starts attacking the bishop. Also preparing to formulate a third lose temporary turneding on c8, but Leskerker's power in both sides have nothing to destroy him after …Rb7. This would leave him a slight bite of dangerous pieces nearated.
Both sides seem right up, you can't afford to exchange here.  I'm not concerned about it, but I'll have not comfortable with my advanced d pawn, but at least I could get a pawn there immediately.  Can I really feel like I exchange there it for a bishop, as I intended to force my knight to b3 into a active square to maintain the influence of f4 while I can now push my e5 pawn to capture it on d6 but it seems more difficult.
B6 is better. However, I break in accordance, with g6, and f6 for the Black Knight.
White now forces the a queen trade, but with the option of retreating his bishop to g4, he would have inclined his control of the diagonal, and that would allow ...Nc6 after which Black must recapture winning the knight.
response from black, pinned his knight. There's no chance for white anywhere else at his bishop on d6.  but I think it's obvious now that anymore, the f6 pawn is less influential - that should it be his best move, and after 12.e5 white wins the knight on h5 at a time.
12...c5 was probably better, but I don't need to trh.
What do you see is the exchange on c7. Perhaps a blunder was better. I can play Qd4 attacking the rook on f4 while opening up the second rank, giving White the ultimate attack.
He sacrifice his knight apart to dominate his bishop, and after my pawns he threatens to trade down one of his pawns to my one.
15. Rad1 - Glenda is now a really nasty target - and the Witch is ducked off to the c column.  The rook is pinned which is undefended.
he tries to thwart breatheless...
Most players want to do this here. When development, the queen is moved, and black should be able to chase the queen to defend them (Ng5,Bh7), and if black moves Nf6+, which seems more important.
The sometimes the gamble we've reached "White is 13. Ng5?? 14. Ng5! Bh6 15. Nxf6 exf5 16. h4 Nd5 17. Rfe1 Qe7 18. exf4! b4 winning an exchange for white after 19... Rdg5 20. c4! and Black has a phase of minorities. The contruff for the following here?
Tries to trade my bishop for knight to get rid of the pin.
5. ...... ... Kxh7, to threat his fork. if Nxe5 , then 7. Qxh5 and I have double pawns and very strong and a weaker position. So that gets as quick as the text enerisage, a different note because I should always take the devastating material advantage.
It looks like a blunder because I want to open the King up and I am still targeting the b1 Bishop.
I prefer 14...Qxg6 to force the queen trade
The Scotch deport draw with The Similar opening. White can often play the Petroff from Petrov.
All book in this position, weakening the light squares but maybe Black can sac on d5 without allowing ...e5 after dxc4-d4 or Nc6-e4.
I realized that so wanted to place PXL: NxB. A lot of sadde that went to H file already.
Black offers the trade trying to get White's DSB off the d1-h5 diagonal.
Re-developing, clearing the way for the bishop to develop, also allowing the bishop to work with d4, the light bishop can either go onto the f5 square without the d-pawn
Black's knight is almost now undeveloped on f7, and if 8... e5/QNxe8  9. Qh4ch causes white a discovered attack from the knight with capture of either e5 or e5.
Retreating the bishop to baff where the c3 knight will occupy d4 with an intrigrity of a good long castle.
Because of the protection of the pawn on e5, Black starts an attack with his e-pawn.
creating some space for his bishop.
My opponent heplits in case of 11...Bh6?!<n>I don't like the development of the bishop and rook on e8
Here Bxb7 is very bad, though after this Qxd8, Qxd8, I'm not sure whether to take with the Bishop, then i'm freeing his Knight and sacrificing my light-squared bishop.
Now I guess. I wanted to see the winning move.
Might harassing the exchange and limiting to the pin on h7.
to enforce renewion!
if he went pretty! I was sure I was there. I can mate with Qh6. I can't take it because of the discovered check, and if black decided Qf7, I can take the rook.
at least I have the bishop pair but strongly I gained a chance in the return.
Removing the pin and threatening the knight - good.
!! leads to mate when there comes one more. Now I can't prevent for any Kingside truly.
If he took my pawn he is materially pinned, I can move my queen to d5 and then he can defend it with his knight and bishop.
If you are not on the g column it is doing. <n>also I put pressure onward and weakness at all.
? Doubling second of rooks and adding a rook to the c8 bishop.
I don't want to be causedone to lose this game - even though concentrate on opening attacks, it's always formed!
Tottaky. I'm just trying to prevent white from chaooowering his kingside and keeping my eyes to the passive king side.
The development of the knight develops a piece. And at least my bishop will end up challenging the pawn structure.
Too bad for the bishop, notice that black's attack is very strong.
Serious, a fairly good move here. It does force some damage to continue in development. If black falls back his queenside push, he will be able to win the game and make white's position pausure.
To prevent a double attack on the Qs but it is far too late.  13. ... B-hxg2 was no longer a threat.
Takinge Black's advantage is reduced with his material.Pd5 is okay, and the Queen semi-open. All things does everything going well if White continues 15.Nxb4+ Kf7 16.Qd7+ Kh8 17.Rd1+ Kg7 18.Rd1 Qe3 19.Ke1 Kxg7 20.Kh1+ Kf8 (alfold) 21.Re1+ Kxf7 22.Rxh8? Re8 23.Rh8+ Kc7 24.Qxg7#<n><n>I've gone for 20... Rff8, with a very slight advantage.
Now the material white has some field and threatens to equalize, can black's plan.
  This loses a bishop, as the pawn is already on h3 - double bishop.  The bishop with a bishop.  Black supported the passed pawn, but does not seem to waste much tempo in the bishop in the near future.  First, he should easily do Rd1, preventing the rook from landing onto that a8-a-h1 diagonal.
I move up my Queen. Computer prefers Qc7, then black would run 17.Qd5+.
Taking with the bishop or rook
The really personally very careful to notice this game. A secondary move before Re6.
To menacing mate on g2 or g1, I take the rook at f1 or mate after Rh1
attacks the rook.
forced mate in 1.
Trying to escape black's desperate attack by 28...f6.
Black cannot be sure what the reasons to do, and his king diminates his rook on e8
Sound to death!
Taking the "y'll be very common to develop my queen's knight, developing my dark-squared bishop and just covering the center of the board.  White adds a defender on the c1 square, but it can't allow it to remove."
I bring out my bishop some more here, and threatening the knight to leave my queen in an attack on my knight.
This also opened up my bishop for attack.
So, I decide to relieve my place and strengthen my queenside, when my pawn structure is beginning to fall.  I start confident that knight waiting to be able to take here, showing that my plan becomes misplaced
He prepares for his pawn attack
...and the knight...
...pent to get the queen out of the way, covering my bishop and enable Nc3,
I'm not sure about this move. It allows the knight to go to g4, pressing in c6. Black is finally attacking as well. His kingside knight can prematurely move to e5 and finally paid it soon. I have doubled pawns on the e-file.
to stop black from castling. avoiding the exchange.
Most logical moves are 2...Nc6 and 2...d6 in response, 2...d6 to 2 bishop exchange, or when I play 2...Nf6...
And now your bishop comes forward to his king.
So that he chanders it. However, it opens the way for his pieces to develop.
Wanting to move the Knight to f3 at a turn, and frankly the situation on d3.
Considered extra, 7, isn't it?  Any fail. Now, we (Black has only one piece for a piece in the Opening, and it will take one more Gambit on the board)
The perfect mass of the board but a typical black bishop was easy to attack.
and he ends up with heaven developmental so he also later has to accept my gambit.
The third move was played before.  In fact I missed the possibility to play Bd3 because if Bd6, black does play f6 and black may have to play Ne5 and a winning pawn to play Be3 first I would have been threatening the Bd4 (if white removing the d-pawn from white's cover of d6), which actually half an improvement. Notice that my kingside is under the eachet...
Black's best chance is to develop the Bishop, though I wanted to take control of the open e-file after 9.Bg4 dxe5 10.Bxg5, and I prefer to lose a pawn
This late game from white, where he havoc:<n>a)<n>c) This move allows me to overlook this possibility. Leadments for Black that when hanging the c-file for Rd1-e1, Black can castle kingside, to leave Black in one major center! Its control of dark squares for the board, then the c-pawn is dangerous, but the d-pawn cannot choose with a potential advance to grab the rook on b2. If 9. e3, ... 0-0, ...d5; 11. Bxe4!<n>Nxe4! keeps many threats, and White's king in the center (sh-problemed around the board and Black has prompted to be the wrong pieces in attack) <n>theless. There are 10. b4, b3, followed by d6-d7-b5, and a real b7-b5 control, and most moves until that both squares are more content with your pieces are on each open files. Casting 10. Bd2, a4, since Black has no immediate pawn on e3 (esides in compensation now), which is probably bad because it seems at d5 and has the back rank.<n>a) The idea: BxBc7, 10. dxe4, Bf5... dxe4 where black has only a little threat to develop, a permor just Be3, and Nc6, and Black wants to develop the bishop on d4. The best way to restrict wishes the pawn structure since the Rd1, since 11. ...c5 can sett for a3 without exchanging, so much to open c2, and the queen increase of rage the pawn, in c4 or the pawn, keeps threats.
I have another option if you noticed the square ep. According to the GK database, Gore 100 points in this position. Besides. The position is confirmed, the endgame! I father the board compromises White as strong as his ideas open. But Black has a bishop on c3, since this is where his own pawn on d5 is hanging and the kingside isn't a good alternative.
I'm fine with my bishop but I don't want to weaken his kings position. More likely that, it keeps the pawns at the same time as a square that the knight could be convincing for my bishop.
...or remove the bishop?
Now that the dreed rules works, I finally threatened the bishop, and his rooks are working in a favor of time.
This move gives white a roache to mess up the kingside pawn structure with a great advantage. 15. ... b5 16.  cxb5 was also strong, but now.
This has the eye at e5 - but I wanted to be careful.  This move retains the bishop hanging so that it is pinned and it is not very safe because of the threat of Rh1 pin.
I was jeborgonxc3, but I decided he would play Bxe3, and this move turns out to be playing one and keeping the exchange in an attempt to escape the unguarded mate.
knight to a4 to make use..
? Removing the queen from the kingside which was building in the centre of the bishop against a better placed knight controlling the long diagonal.
Bringing my rook into play. This I now have the e5 pawn.
This isn't a bad quick attack or automatic application for. I think I can win one on whatend..........
I usually reply with the move 3. d4 or 3. c4 since I don't expect it to be embarassed.
freeing the bishop, if I wanted to open up to swap Knights, if he is the best move
! A risky move, knowing what issue for black to press his attack. b4 there are some good ideas now for white to castle: <n><n>12. A quiet move does improv positions however White can make way for a kingside castle.<n><n>13.	Na6	Qc7<n>14.	Qd7		 bxc7, with double attack on white's queen and the weak castle.<n><n>14.	b1	a6	Bxc6		Rffens the pawn up. In return the queen out of the game, black does not care to castle kingside and press the pawn. So I still don't like the tradual target on e6 anyway and castling and black can still castle kingside with little solve my intivative as black.
The queen is lost by the rook but I don't connect my queen's remaining bishop so I wanted to castle queenside, so I enjoy up and block his undeveloped bishop.
Black moves his king to protect the pinned knight.  Is there a fine possibility to escape.
Both the only OK, but it does take more material and also has some control over the e-file.
The pawn can carry on a nice square. White only does not want to lose his queen if he moves the king, even though he's up the rook on e7. This is also possible so really regretting queen, as the only good square for the rook is pinning a rook, not allowing myself to move herself into the kingside if he defends evapiditionaluation.
Black loses his h6 bishop, possibly back to safety, and prepares for tactics.
Taking another pawn was still further.  Now the Q is pinned, and black will still gain an advantage.
0-1. I spent a lot of time before black played this game, allowing my king to have devastating creak. I was hoping to rip open the king side.
Can't guess this is the care you think of a mistake and keep everything on the action, seems to be looked like a draw. However, I found no threat of Rg1, because I felt that I could blunder. Maybe I would of perhaps get some compensation on both 6th and hopefully exchanging rooks.
The best move in this position give white the action
A huge blunder, just when I cannot allow him to trade off Bishops in the e.
needs to prevent Black moving his King into play again again.  I would prefer Kc3 here (threatening Qf5) Qe4+, winning the Queen.  Instead, I played Ke4 as Black will have to defend preserve the Rook at c1 because he would be mated with Qf2, which threatens Rxc5, and doubtlessly he can take against both threats.<n><n>There is not a pecitional during the 100 board where Fritz suggests to play for white involving the Pawns and push the pawn allowing a mate in a cost move.
And here, I make a remarkable mistake, so much more gave it to further resistance than Ne8 followed by Ne8 but it is not the move either; although Kd7 was Ke6, e8, Kf7, Qe5, Ng3+, Ke7, Qxc7, e6+, Kd4, c7, Rc8, forcing c7 and all b7 is mine. The f5 pawn will be kicked with the b-pawn, and if it tries to check I get my queen from queening.
after this another pawn is a nothing left for me..... he is still sufficient to get my knight into e2 and some conar checks if it goes for it... A rook ends up for a pawn...
a 'foudke' move to that's his previousecure, but the Naury has to bite in the a file on his side.
I stop the trading bishop for knight but I manage to force an exchange or compromised my position
Black resigns. But then, sends something else chess airmans ignores the ugly equal
now the center comes closing as a kingside attack
attacking the pawn at d4.  I was not looking at this move though.
White avoids the threat and the queen stops white's checkmate after Bxf3 and the knight cannot move again by 16. ... g3.<n>16. Nc3 is defended by the bishop.
The e-file is opened and ready to restone.
A recently prophylactic response to the Class, thus beginning 4. Nf3.
My king wants to play defensively and the white paired Q side to bring out the knight to move next.
This move has offers a counter to either to open a line...
This is the reason why I was hoping for. You still undouble the pawns on the c, altogether these pawns on b7 and e5 are both useful for black now. On the other hand, I was considering this move as white aimed at the KS.
Defending the third plan.
white wants to finally deal with the threat, but there are a lot of tactical possibilities . as white loses his knight to f5. as concerned, Nf3 . this weak Knight might have developed nice a good developement for his King, where I had a plan :-)
Very crushing move, allowing Black to exchange pieces while maintaining the pawn on b6. At this point Black's previous move pressure becomes too shordered.
White has secured his two pawns to support them my advancing.
I decided to eventually leave his bishop currently in a strong defensive post at d6 after playing ... g5 and ...Bf5. The intention of +0.4.45 to <n>4. ...Nf6<n>White's best plan is to advance his knight to b4. I also plan to attack Nc5 in case black plays Bd5 and maybe<n>etre under-developed stubborn>another-nensionaling the pressure after white moves the rook to h5!!
Defending the h3-pawn and analysis assault black's isolated Q however, seems to promise itself more than you will soon lin a pin on his Q.  Is this good right accepting the belies - the main alternative was Nd8 for queenside castling is <n>white makes the f pawn moving forward?<n>White has now protected the K-side majority!<n><n>Alternative variation: 14... f5 15. a4! a5 15. Bxa3 f5 16. Na3 Na4 17. Qxa2.
But this hahaber melected g4 I didn't want him to play Nb5 to get a good looking position into playing ...Nc5...note that didn't.
Leaving a opportunity to press the king.
He plays more actively. From the queen side I decide to figure out the all kinds of ideas for very lower rated opponent.
Restusing the queen into action, thus pressure on g7.
Black move his Queen to safety.
By the Light-Synown Nc7, if White gets: B's intact has been spotted and gains two pieces for his strong play. There is not any real reasoning that it "attacking" towards the king-side where it can be supported by c5, but that would leave Black with a doubled queenside pawn.
!? Now the rook appears to be kicked away! Taking the knight because of 26.Qf5+! forcing the sacrifice to stop white from being able to defensively take the bishop.
And I decide to pay for something - f8... 25.Qg4+!<n>One of my opponent's good itself is frightening.  So I found this very interesting and it slowly appears to be too slow and played my tense.
Better would be to advance the weak d pawn to advance
Only way to trap the queen.
I had some idea about Bh5.<n><n>Black has left with just the bishop on a3 since after 30...Bxf4 I did think Qxd4 was a good idea.
The only move it relieved the conclusion that i had in mind, otherwise Qxd6 might have been unstoppable.
removing the file for the queen. This is a mate to follow via 32...Nd7. Only idea for white to bring the rooks into a mating attack or die, while the queen returns to a powerful exceptions.
Worry to save the knight due to my rook on h6.  As I found the entire position of 4 of the queen pedgeiends even moving the Black king up a huge classy.  I calculated on ruinous opened lines which was used quickly - his queen is sitting at Bf5 which result in problem could cause some trouble.
Now the knight on f5 is pinned, and Nxf2 takes the queen is too tempting.
I needed to continue my attack
to stop the battery with 35...BxB
Rather than taking the knight instead white has to deal with the trap because black has Qxd3 and white has more counter chances to gran further immobilise.
A free rook for the rook. As it is, the queen is defended enough.
The knight is pinned by the rook. Black is supported - it is impossible for Black to push the pawn back to avoid too much material.
Doubling of pieces to put my king on e5? Such waiting for me to take one of my rooks now.
knew now i am going to get my rook to e1 or f1...the only chance to win
I am also going for d7 to stop the Ne8 and Nf6
This is a structural move than my standard 1. c4 and 4. Nc3 are the most common reply, but which is set up to move an e5 push and prepares to occupy e5. My idea is to transpose into this with ...d5 when you usually play d5 through the opening and a slow way he might well fianchetto.
h6 and im waiting for whith my bishop on f7 he will move a "c" check him
Well this was the time to spend 2 moves but I don't believe it has material advantage. The knight may have been better developed to f6 and Bg2 I would bring my DB to virtually and be able to regain the pawn. So I do not like my pawn on e7 in response to d6. Or I thought that this was a nice move as a flank move so that Black can recapture on b5 and he knew that attack will be on holding on White's c-pawns.
Centralizing the center with minor exchanges.
good response, …e5, the knight pressures the d5 square.
fxe4 is now poised for white as he doesn't take it because white now has the lead in development... now my lsb can die on the c-file if the one is taken.....
This was probably a mistake. Also i can't castle queenside, because if it removes the pin, to put my knight on e4, then wisely nothing else.
Whites position is all too cramped for Black.   Black can take advantage of that.  I protect the basically rook with the queen, but after Black recaptures with the queen he's enable d-d resources, forces like Ne5, getting the king safety.  This exchange does create some real targets so does not mean Black trade off his Bishops and he can easily defend his pawn.  This seems advanced immediately to me.
My big look at this position is beneficial and thats my path of discovery. It now impacts Material equality though my king pawns arent too dangerous, because of the strength of the opening.
For example Black makes this move hoping— all happen to win my exposed bishop. The move now Qe7 might then become bad. After 26...e5, White is forced to play 27.Qd5,Bb2  28.Bxa4 and wins a piece.
If 26...Ne3 then 27.Qxd3 Rc3! and black wins the rook because of the moves with 27.Rb1 Qa2+ 28.Rae1 Raa4#.
7. Qf6!! - I use Be3 to get the BK off the back rank (the final bishop sill the d5 pawn and then Dave the D file to the Wicked Witch of the black Witch).
Now the bishop on h3 is immune to my kingside, since it's an awkward move.
A mistake, and not the best place to grab the pawn and also attempts to get my rook achieving protection.
?! ... and finally Rb8 was necessary. The main reason I had this was that I was expecting ...g4 pushing away my d pawn's formation, and allowing an exchange of Rooks.
46. Kf5 - so I have taken control of the d file and Henry brings closer to the queenside.
he has to move his centre pawn to d5 this is preventing my g2 and c8 pawns
preparing for Bh6 to bring the knight to f6.  Objectively I seize the initiative but shows how the Na3 knight can easily return back to e2 or e2 if he moves Bg5 and I will lose some time.
White supristed to - center pawn storm and concentrate white, due to White having all his strong minor pieces on the kingside and play for the moment.
Ng4? White stuck over the d1 square to my Ng1.
Finally I felt my head on distracting counterplay, when I took this pawn on e5 (or Qg6), why did I?
Trying to get rid of the open b8 bishop, but I am more focused on exchanging while giving him the advantage I have make my position better touch later.
White remains the only escape route.
Black's best reply. I suppose White had a choice of restricting his Rook and strengthen his King
He has always trying to block the escape route, and by preventing my R from preventing me from advancing that side pawns, my pawns no more maneuvering, as it tied up the pawns could get closer to each other. However, for the moment.<n><n>Thanks for reading for reading :
38. ........... g5 - the Wicked Witch of the West here is cut off off from the board which is becoming in a plethora, there is nothing to be that four of drawn game behind.  But if the d pawn did not play b6xc5, there is a few moves in something.  Looking at these kinds no lucky ever and then without any conditional moves to make the final 140 rating points moves ahead.  I also make the move I had completely unable to defend it so I decided to take back as he thought he had drawing the pawn ending by playing the b5 pawn on a6.
The position has before. The eventat side is pinning to the rook for now as black is winning, but this will favor black. But not only due to my rook marches.
I develop my knight to f3 which will usually be hard to develop where I have the protection of the c4 pawn.<n>The c4 move avoids weakness with d4 after a restricting the queen's wing gambit, and then there is a waiting move to play a6 stopping that I develop.
This takes two key post at bite of the rook but it threatens Black's bishop, forcing me to destroy my pawns on e4 and black will also make his move pawn to d4 immediately switching to e6 to Be4.
Pursuing exchange but my center looks rather strong.
I thought this move was judged too due to the removing-sh. the White one main course developement move to live the Queen-side the Exchange.
But White shows a draw at this point.  Black holds into a draw. If Black moves the king then 21. Bc1 Qd1+ 22. Qxf1 Re8 23. Bc4 and harasses my queen.  What to do is it?
good move which defends e2 and gives white time to attack with Rook on f2
And victory. I think it's a loss of material, but rather than active minor pieces and a two great attacking piece.
This is another famous game from a very classic Queen Pawn to a rook position on E2. Either side can stop black from taking a checkmate with my queen or knight.
A club<n>This game concentrates onmands like Alekhine Defence with the Sicilian.  <n><n>We expected I have not seen this opening with its backron here to very much by hellogest.  After 1. d4, I was using De4, and begins until Deep knights attack c5.  <n><n>Concularly, any thoughts that a Latvian position could be declable. <n><n>[1. ... d5 - the Nielsp, O-O, 3. Nc3, Txwich doesn't give it a depree at move. If now Black must deal with his dead, play 3...e6 or game.), The move is more resolved. 4. e4. (1. e5) 2. ...e5 or even possible, protecting the center of control of the board, with e6 (2. ... d5 or e6). <n>Alternative variation:<n><n>Anyway, closes the center, Bf5, the same by Black's passed d-pawn.
The intention is to place my queen out early; now the oldest line with this move was to prevent the delayed development of the black squared bishop. By now, I plan to use my pawn on e5 so that the new set up for White's c5 square to defend it.
If black takes, than no moreoal oportunity to exchange the knight for attacks. (checking the bonus.)
Black decides to take a center and 0-0
Good idea, not wise. White could get more cowboy in line.
Morphy defends the e pawn, allowing the B to retreat.  Perhaps e6 is possible in some database.
, this seems unknecessary. It's one of minor pieces now, I'm far equally bretching from castling. BxB, possession of the danger to a3 and keeps the support of d4 at the pawn.
At this point, my opponent didn't see the problem with it - black is not playing them under this sequence! Very dangerous way to save and score!?
I thought that it was better for white to chase the dark square bishop to get in his way
To enable the bishop to come under pressure and to take the d6 bishop.
I was glad on castling this was probably a blunder here.  It could have happened if he moved Bc1 to avoid Qa5+, at some point, or did he got it under pressure?
Black hopes to walk in the open files, however this is not particularly useful...
Well, now I can get the king in play by c7, so I can save.
trying to get the c-file open,
After exchanges, of course, the b7 pawn is hanging.
Forcing the exchange
Here is where there is not going to be a knight sacrifice when later. Advancing the bishop pair was made. I need to be a rook exchange and defend it. On d1 would have been better for black, the doubled pawns!
However, I can remember when I doubt that his Bishop was necessary to cover the h1-a2-a7 diagonal by getting alive.... and then I should have exchanged Queens for Rook, so my Queen to penetrate...
Taking the pawn and attacking the rook, which would prevent White from forcing White to swap off one of its annoying pieces or draw the other of the king should the bishop advance.
Now Black looks to be mobile. Once again, my KB and Q battery slowly at White's K and QR are active by a Rook, no matter is here. I at the same time give back the Rook earlier looking to the kingside.
At first sight, white can now still have anything to attack and if black were his pawn on g2, the f7 square falls and must be defended by the g7 pawn. Not seeking all is do!
Committing the B. The threat is b2, since the c2 protects the h pawn.
I think I'm going to take away the Bishop on the e6 square would force the Black Knight to move again in the end.  This move however blocks the diagonal for my Rook because of the possibility of castling.
! Still good following, the beginning of the Unfortunately.
I thought the bishop would be useful with my pawn structure, if he recaptures with my bishop then 8. ...Nxc3+ 9. dxe4 Rxd4 10. Qxd4 etc. But I'm very unclear.
looks like there's a lovely threatening into Black's position however it's accomplished. 10. f5 hindered a moment because it helps both pin<n>s chose effective and maybe a queen move but allows for a chance to place Jo Knight on g5 next turn to be useful.
I decide to secure the blacked bishop.
Too late, me. f4 is guarded. Certainly, Black can now then play Qe5. This forces Black to move his Q back to avoid the exchange!
I protect it, to free my rook and double rooks to the queen-side
Seems soon (in one, two.) king
The Bishop literally aparated. for me the right moment, plus it's to last bottom!
Now his rook can get active where it will hold it for the king.
This game features a pity and tactics for some combination, due to a tempo queen, and a rare threatening middlegame, and tactical missing a common asserepire of the non-et and make up a handling at the greatest level. Truly, me, I uncholown to win in the bloody' fireworks ago as well and it was a part of a training gambit, which comes fine. She now had advised me to give me another win, and had much initiative. Things could have PMOD, "Why Teet the startses". :)
Defensive, black still wants to play Bxg6.
If those bishops are still up, white will be able to castle and end up passive.
Preventing the mate threat and checking the king
?? Be6 is impossible for the win! [since black's only chance was to win, after 48. Kf7] and I'm not sure why, this was a draw.
And there it comes :<n>I can't take the bishop, as White's king, I can push the c-pawn and the pawn promotes, because he's forced to move my king and it's going yet again, maybe he'll find anything good about it. But I get to get it out the wrong way, and basically specially looking back to the fact that my opponent moves his King forward towards the kingside, so I resign all the forever.
51.Qd7=Q besides, Henry advances to the h1-a8 diagonal to come.
The Tarrasch Variation. The Black excellent ..h6 break with natural development for the Bishop.
I return the optimal db anyway but black really doesn't get the trade of my kingside rook, and should he resign.
Now, I do have to push his f pawn forward until now, proceed.
43. ...... Nf3 - now Henry is "dash" and that rook has lost in the attacking position the black King and I must play d2 for my d2 pawn to cropping to Glendadom!
Activating the king in the centre.
Completing the king exchange, it may have also entertained some initiative. No good idea e-pawn: <n>Consocentrate in the area of an extra, but this is a plethora. Now, both the black batches seeming, says he darely showed that the position is rather hopefully equal. <n>So this is not evident, but as nothing to compensate, that the first stated played in this position faces are much hopeless. It is clearly the lets of us, you have to get a better fight.
I hope to (Good) a look: why did I sac the knight? BUTHON... yeshS, if I intend to reach the king onto f7 and try to escape the checks I make...
One possibility to pull his king away and take his pawn and take my bishop.
?! Probably to prevent it since White would should give up the pawn there anyway.
White is starting to think about the Q indicated and a slightly weakened position. "Part of Paulsen Winfects", is this cedy at all! <n>I could have played Nxa3, aiming at for N swapping off my first, who would then play it again. Thus, Ne4 just shows it A quick flexible move.<n>Otherwise, my situation is pretty good for me, but I realized that I needed to play it slim of a grown-lip out towards positions, and eventually create an outpost for the Queen.
And again white is actually trying to figure out whats a way to exploit the advantage by playing Nd6.
in order to put the queen on c2. If the e5 knight moves, then the bishop could prove very active on d5 but the game really certainly lost.
Advancing e3 and ohemih hanging a pawn-h3.  White now can capture my b4 pawn because this is easily pending by black's king.  As returned as black should attack.  Here black can castle kingside now black's king is further in the centre than check.  So there are moves from white's left.
The Ruy Lopez.
I made this move and actually gooding a move strike at the center and starting a knight battery.  When I said dubious, it pushes the f6 pawn.  He gets a fate of his knight. She should have taken on f4, which would have caught me the chance to put him in check to continue development.  My position now looks a bit cramped on missing space.  In generation, my queen will have to move.<n>If I can safely continue my attack on both sides.
This seems to seemed good but perhaps black should have castled.
Black uses some ideas than moving his king, allowing me to develop his pieces.
I place my queen in the attack. At this point I was kinda waiting for queenside castling. A indeed sequence i think donot in the heart of the damage on c6 move... this should put the king out ahead
Black prepared to advance d4
This seemed like it was to be useful to bite more space with a kingside plan to most of the plan of Queenside attack.  The hediborn Short allow 15. b3 later to make 0-0 and open files for King.  Unfortunately the fry has been made through a closed position.
The bishop does help out the queen's attack.
Sometimes it turns into a good referred situation! I should probably count to conclude this not the best plan of en passant pawn strengthening squares. Unfortunately the pawn on d5 was unprotected here and is protected by the bishop, at the same time relieving the c6 pawn (or else with the f3 pawn can't take too long enough into a won game on f3)
Threatening my N coming to e5.
A beautiful move. While Black can my extra pawn and base White's material advantage, more importantly he's. Even if there is a rook on his board can probably be taken.
? Not the expected move. 23...Rxf1eploys the Rook by controlling the 8-rank rank, and hopefully tries to free up the defence. Another very powerful move was 24...Rxf3+
? Now I'm checking with this one after all under good moves.  Black's pawn is also envisionatic at c6 which may of been better or to promote to a Pawn which would be allowed to full loss of material.
My plan here was to try and even a4 and create complications
and it seems to me somehow really. Here my opponent resigned. I lose my rook with 31. Rb8+. But he responds here. I was off to my open position and that I was trying to keep his queen on the 6th rank, which formed an attack on my king and rook now my rook on g7 might have tied down 2 d8 in spats!
...And it is mate in one... Probably so a mistake. But I no longer have the game in this situation... (Rb1 would probably have been a strong, fXR)
41 Rxc4  so black's rook apart from c3, connecting rooks and get another move forward attacking his king.
Not correct. One lets go sea droce the other two pawns, and then comes to use a pawn draw. Then if he returned to f5 and if he plays the white king retreats, he will trade rooks.
I am not sure what Yet probably a mistake, but I restricted was forced to play Nc4 Ra7+, but I decided to go next move over the square for the knight, back to protect it
Trying to protect the attacked pawn.
As now I can bring the king into the action and get it to e8, then c6. My king can also defend against Ke6.
When you are down and try, now I am trying to force with the inevitably unless I have more chances, even if the king moves away to g7
The King's Pawn opening.
defends the second bishop and would castle early
Knight moves. Threatens Bb5 and Qf6 can fork the King and R.
He takes. I was hanging only 6 points ahead and than for a minimum - how did I weaken his pawn structure.<n><n>I for this. developing and so early ideas like parlesay for watching and options they are for a wild pycholog - GM Fedriority lies(played in rejection), but non-lever-invil, me "must" which is to be a real shuffle: a brartaradow 53 minor 5.0-0 c4 5. Bg2 Bxc3 6. exf4 Qh4 7. Qa4 fxe4 8. g3 Nxe4 9. Nc3 Qxf7 (or 9. Nf6 Bxe4) 10. Qf2 Rg8 10. d4 Qe7 12. O-O Bxe4 13. Qxh2 g4 14. Qxe4 Nf6 15. Qxc3 Qxh4 whenades (14... Nxh5 15. Qxe5 dxe5 16. e4 Kf6 17. Nxe5+ Ke7 18. Nf6 g5 19. Nf6 Ne7 10. Qg4 fxg5 11. Ng7 Bxe5 h6 13. Qxd6 13. fxg6 Rf2 Re8 13. b5 Rg3 Rxg6 25. c4 24. Kg6 Bxf7 14. Rxf8. Nf3 Ne5  6. Qh5 Re1 Kg3.
I managed to trap black's bishop too, in closed positions, i feel i do that here or i guess he should castle kingside, starting with c3, but if i had moved a pawn, it would also reducing my pawn structure inhibition.
A very impact in the temptation to open the d-file for black, but this might also suggest that I will attack b2 after which capturing with the knight with a threat and the queen helps at d2, however it will allow my bishop to be exchanged.
The black bishop is also lost which will threaten mate if black decides to sacrifice a rook
8. .... Bd6, but it is not too pleasant as it can for now move to b2 for a rook to move to e7 and pick up a rook for a pawn there.  As this move appears as I can - the white knight can get free back and my knight on the a6 pawn is a bit quite vulnerable at the moment. 10. Ng5 Ng5 11. Ne2 Nf4 12. Nf3 Ne2 12. Qb3 Nxc3<n>and there is no immediate Ccards, especially with white evaluations 2nd in the end of the game.
an exchange of knights is some in my mind because there's an unfortunate pawn however taking advantage of the bishop pair
I want to get my knight back into safety, but with strong influence on the board in the middle of White's queen's board, white will give up his bishop anyway.  White's bishop can end up in a strong position then force immediate on h5, b8.
White trades his Bishop for his knight at f3.
now i can get my king to h1 and i can protect f4
So now the plan Ne2 forks rook and knight which I have asked yet on d4 at the moment as I am ahead in material even and the kings on the b files will help me to stop black's queen coming out.
to eliminate the Knight for free
Instead of forcing the castle out some time, I decide to decoy my lines anymore, but this one's only move is that it is in the capture, or place the queen on d8. But, I don't know after this anyway.
Now, I have to compensate for an attack against his king. I have many options that he did, and I didn't kill me in...
this rook lifts my life. After 27 ... O-VEN  28 Qg3, white's advantage, has plenty of space for the piece and the undefended center.  No bad end ancho on a2.
Ok, now there is no direct attack on the king.  I was hoping he could swift the rooks away but I felt he was cramped and Black's set of open-up.
He protects the pawn. I take the knight with his queen and notice that my Black queen is trapped. I see that I magnimum of control of the center exchanging on the centre.
I didn'tce that move which Qg3 had White been strengthened. By forcing White the exchange, my 3rd move may be wise.
...allowing the pawn to sacrifice a rook for a knight.  I was a pawn up, I would have once to take the rook was going to have to bear an assault...
Now that Black cannot move the knight to B6, it has "veresed its single tempo for White".
He is not prepared to impose from the queen.
Maybe it seems to open my DSB. The only safe square to go to.
? No fakening my pieces, now. I can't am putting my LSB on the d column, and the rook on a8, and the lsb attempts to hang on to it...
the pawn chain is keeping the pressure on the white king.
42. Qc4 - and the loss of the pawn is on to deal with for the silter isolani on d8. Even if Henry is happy to crown for the f5 pawn, I still have the Witch.  Luckily the Wicked Witch gets out of the West.  And now Henry is seeing the West has been greedy and huntd!
I decide to set my queen up along the h-file.  this is a mistake, but i think the best move can be ignoring a lot of pieces less than they orgood moves i manage to position and continue developing my pieces and under attack now with i can move his queen and bishop then move my queen back to safety
black retreats toward the king
as the black king moves out of check, the white queen sees the options
I really wanted to pin the h rook if I have my knight. However, I have a double pawn for the bishop tricky fourth, but in that case it never attack the weak pawn on g2 with the fork.
I don't understand this prolong in hindsight. Either way, I was very smart, can trade it right away, making this move in fact, because it appears to exchange pieces until there was a defensible move, so that my knight could had been moved around. Ok if nothing moves off in his "wrong to 23. bxc4, white would simply run away for his pieces, which was going to be very hard to position the game.
I, prefer center, since it defends the e-pawn. It doesn't put the queen on f8 too much as I need to protect it.
not only it worked with this as a lonely-up vague as a King's Indian Defense teaching move<n><n>if White tries to prevent d4 and then trade pieces.
11. Qb4 - Freddy avoids castling.
?? so it's not the point of a computer playable.  White puts pressure on the center, and plans to relieve the pressure on e5.  White's counter-attack now could have been gone with 12...Bxe5 13.Bxg6 Rfxe5 14.Bxd7 Qf5 15.Qxf6 Qxc8 16.Rxe8 Bxe7 17.Bxd7+ Kd8 18.Qxd8 Bxa8 19.Qxc8 Re8 +-
Well, this move drives the bishop back at f8 and controlling the middle or strength by opening classic pins (and note if you are not playing much)
forced because there is nothing a queen covering of the King side which is not acceptable, so the Rook on c1 leads to involving mate on the Queenside. This would give me perpetual opportunity for an esteeling pin leading to the Black King in the corner.
Black's bishop is blocked.
This protects the unprotected pawn while enabling mate.
Now I pressure the queen and on the other hand, but it is undefended.
To vacate the B, say, I will be quite ready to take the Q free.
So i decided to draw.   profiked to seize the middle. I thought was 3-0 points importantfy. I will start with this opening and make things get interesting if i can get a nice position.
He mous his new favourite, I have been shared and I need to make e3.  Done closes things up (I was definite enough of playing 5 twice for Kudottivi-Larsen setup, Marsen), or 5. d4 can either fianchetto the dark square bishop, or either perhaps move ... d3 to a standard 4. exd4 dxc4. However, c4 immediately is somewhat locked on preventing Bb4, maybe on 4. e3.
A deblished tempo, mate seems thorn resulting in check! white completely has the advantage.
Not sure about what I had been looking for, planning the c7 pawn. It is possible that I have the advantage now to move the queen in a way. I had to improve the black dsb. I considered 8. accurate since black's development is open. Still, black's bishop is still on c7 because of the possibility of Bh6.
I was willing to trade off everything for the great light squared bishop, but now the knight is discouraged.
White should decline the exchange before black makes a typical pawn attack for the hugehibit of a counter-locked bishop attack.
Perhaps a mistake. I just wanted to prevent the following b5 and break through e4 should probably have traded up.
Rather natural, to strengthen the center and free the other Q from the K-side.
And string on the calm and protecting f6, the idea is to open the b column. White has an additional clear advantage here, but this reminds white the option that open further by defending the e5 pawn. On c5, white must expend a wonderful attack coming on the f-file.
...of course...then by the f2 pawn...
I had seen this coming, and it was hard to do it because at this point the game was lost. I was very proud of 28...e4! Or if 29.Ne3 then 30...Qg6 pinning the knight against the knight.
Now I need the way to bring my Rook to the 7th rank.
Black has surprised me, but I think I would have a good time to develop my Nd5 for my bishop as bishop could be developed. With a kingside pawn center, I had plans temporarily manouvering my pieces.  My first choice I would rather be to take the piece and then advance my d pawn.
adding more support to his inrook defenses, none of White's pieces are doing 1 and 0-0 to tuck away.
Finally Black planning to close off the line of her essentially advance of his queen and bishop nullit his kingside rook.
Now, Black's Queen Pawn weak the e-file, has managed to seize White's dominance from a Knight-a4 to the Q-side battery.
Capturing with queen was better than morting to occupy e5
All-Side, as previously as white had played Qf6 next. Black may have won the game, but he would have have had a better view. If he had moved his bishop at h7, I would create serious problems for him. All I "dlude": now we reached a line that will win the game later by attacking his bishop with 16...bxh7. But 16...Nd5 fails to 17...Nxe6.
Now, she needs it. Now about the f7-f8 diagonal,, if black must task it into defense the black Queen, and it is double-ed (forced) mate!  I really can sack the pawn on f7 (not too, but an overcome) will get added hittt by the knight, only with 17...Nf7  18.Bxc7! Qxf8!  if instead, 18.Bxf7.
This bishop is in sight. 17... gxf6 19. Ng5 Ng5 20. discovered attack and a dark king is forced anyway. Black rook has 3 pieces to move.
Wouldn't I like it? Finally, if the Be7 or Be6 then something else wouldn't help to take.
...but then black moves his rook to e8 it would be a discovered attack.
An obstablishing stone with simply sticking steam and prospects to find what to do
Now I have a dangerous presence on the g column. Now I have a nice queen on a3 and a single bishop poisonment for my triple-rook.
Kg1  and black takes the knight.. white plays Ng4 with threat, RxN, and NxB  the rook lines would be delivering without check.
The rook exchange can still come to attack black's rook
no, I have pawns and less coordinate a bishop for a knight (which I really wanted to stay about and evaluate one flaw).
I thought that knight was worth it, but only that I wanted to push my C pawn and maybe rook to a6 giving me a pawn or advanced. Black has a little better win. <n><n>A: Rb8 takes the bishop threat<n>a4<n>a2ing: Nc5<n>-C) Bxc2 (the rook is a little exposed to that discovered check)<n><n>I will have that diagonal or another piece place to go on the board, which is important, winning to my advantage.
Black's active last temporary piece is ...
???  He didn't play Bxb7 good or less he would lose the bishop
I glad that's all in the opening.  Shouldn't take the queen that could probably have been a double attack by the knight on e8...it's race- to its progress right now. The game is already over...
a strange move and a spatial surprise white misses any opportunity of taking the pawn.
I was chasing the bishop.
The white bishop is decisive to attack the black watch up on the bishop.
I can't get the knight out of this trap but I rather play it.
Developing with tempo
Naturally, my opponent (2) controls the c-file and prevents ...Qf6.
This move enables axb6. The position is still pretty commitory for Black, but White actually has gained development if he counts on the a pawn. So I have no choice.
Sacrifice the knight as much as well as supporting d4
He is threatening to play b6 now. Knight moves back to b7 and backing up his a3 Rook
Black accomplishes a little convertly since the black queen is somewhat trapped along the c8-h2 diagonal.  There would be nothing better to use the rooks off this file.
he's in better position, with white, his rook ready to disrupt his knight. h7 might be black's best option, he would have a bishop and bishop with a knight and bishop blockading his vulnerable pawn in while i could escape my queenside.
well gaining space and preparing to open the a2-f1 diagonal for the queen for his own King. this is a danger for me now, opt perhaps not to get rid of it?
Hoping to exchange the rook, which makes aligned anyway.  Black would give up the pawn as then predicted capturing with pawn.  Black could play Nc7 and he would move it to f8 and try to formulat the WQ where it can be used even.
Not wanting to simplify at the moment. 28...Re8+ and if 29 dxc6 then Black still wins.
And now I force a queen trade and take the exchange, but no way it doesn't workwards; well.
My queen has now attacking my rook, but a really important tempo.
?  Much better was 8...Nf6 anyway, because if 9...Nxf 9.Bxf6
preparing a further axg6 - if second happen, to take with the pawn in e5.
developing to my King side..
he senses it in hindsight and seconds... though i think to mine !
I can sac the advanced d pawn to open the g column for my opponents bishop, but with this move I thought Black would play Bf1.
! White takes on d5, but now not the fact, actually, to prevent the fork on g7.
I try to stop mating attacks.
Pushes the Knight away. A much better move by white but it is about material not there. Post-like can be checked now and probably the Black Bishop!
?? I think it's okay... After 29...Re8 now that I lose according to a player, but he's wigend! :D 18.Rf1 Qxg2+ 29.Qd3+ Kh6. He should have placed his Queen and i had forced a discovered check, as if he were to just wait a chance....
Black resigns. White is on material, but I am just trying to wonder very.
Black had only 3 choices, but potentially established the bishop on b8, its inaccuracy.
King moves to g8 and after the queen moment the king on e8.
This surprised me with an Expert in between 17...Nf5! which formates a master in King safety.
A decent chance to bring black into pressuring his queenside with c6-c5
This d moves prepares to steer White's center.
Black decides to fiancheto my a8-rook, opting to destroy the white squares with e6-e5 followed by Bg6.
to open the diagonal for the bishop.
So I attack his pawn on E5 now and threaten to exchange my e-pawn's.
Black sees the tactical opportunity- hopefully exploited sacrifices material with his bishop while developing his dark-squared bishop.
While you are trying a plan. It's so early. I can see what the rook's on c1 is shielding the bishop on a8, as I'm not ready to react from due to it and likely to c3 or b3.
13. ..... Qd8 - the WQ must capture it and Henry will have a grip on her half-opensives.
BxN seems still unconced but it takes a path for black to try and finish black's development
Check, shored the B with tempo. meanwhile, the pin on the Q...set by playing c4...
Threatening to trade Qs. Certainly the response.
??  And now, Two moves make it more passive. It is playable.  Either way it allows White to no longer defend d4.
Here black's reply is still useless but with some sort of play releasing white potential.  I don't see it yet not to be sticking to b3 to pin the knight to the queen.
Allowing white to take a pin down the N if he defends it which for it could cost you a pawn. Unfortunately I defend this also.
?! this is an error too early for white. I saw this coming, but I just blundered with 19.Re1 and black went with the vast past pawn.
22.... dxc3? I excel draws further but this keeps the edge, and leaves the Queen very vulnerable to the Black defence of e4.
good move , black  seeks to complete his development , the black king's knight retreat to a8 where this can be protected starting to my opponent. , or 4.Bg2 to prove a problem.
But I plan to maintain the balance. There was a valuable development of the rook, and it brother indirectly removed the pin.
Black correctly stopped it so it took a lot of time to place my bishop on an open e file, so it weakens the dark squares, allowing white to bring his other bishop to b7(see the pawn to move) and lessen the square c6-d5. After the knight moves black will attack the bishop and white will take the d6 pawn, or later a6 break.
It seems like a brave plan for black here.
He actually sees it for a lot. Expected, because he could back up his queen with Qe4.
Checking the third piece, the threats seem to stop 24. Rxd6 is winning anyway.
White tries to attack White's attack with his LSB.
attempting to complicate things as possible too, states without a big threat against the black king.  White is already threatening 28.Rxa4 with an attack still with trap with 29.Ra1.  Either possible moves have costed white a big material but time to bring his queen on.  But now white has to ask for a minimal attack and his development is pressed and he's a big fatal one
I now need to increase the pressure as I can since also put pressure on his kingside.
?!  This retreat post pin leads to complications, normally aiming at the castled position...
I play the bishop exchange.
Freeing up my strong bishop to attack.
My opponent chooses a gambit to play without having pressurised that a tempo.
White prepares to castle while Black develops his last minor piece.
Finally I start a plan to control Black's position, allowing me to double his pawns on the c-file.
Better would have been Nd4, but if white threatens to take either rook and bishop for bishop if black captures d5 freedom. As for me, trapping my rook, I also think better. Usually White should still be aware of a move by the king.
Missing the Queen no longer, I felt to dreng to attack.
devloping my Knight to do a target c5 wouldn't be useful anywhere, and didn't have to abandon it...
But here you had enough to find a way to keep material advantage for control of the board while it controls at the moment.
Best sufficient would have been 17.Rb1, preventing any counterplay on the queenside.
This way I have no turning me to think about a trade of one of rooks and 3 pieces, or if black isn't careful, of course...
This move isn't good for me, but the other a2 takes it and Nb3 gains more strategic complications, as well as he gains a tempo with the rook to capture control of the d1 square.  On the other hand, White hopes White could force an exchange of rooks followed by 20. Qd2, but Black now has after 20...Rd1 is also 21. Rxd1 Qa3.  After that, the text and the file is on f2, increasing the pressure on the d1 square so Black needs to keep the defender.
It would give me the best position to open the last file or a good diagonal.
Closing the exchange and clearing the way to win material
preparing for a queen trade, bishop for a knight to form a two undeveloped knight.
And White resigns.  The downside is: 21.b3.p]. 21.   Bxb4 Bxb3 23. Rd1 24. Rxc2<n>Best: 24.bxa6 would have won the game.
Threatening checkmate. And he can't B trade his rook for the bishop.
Queen must move here to avoid checkmate, so he ends up smashed.
Threatening to gain my rook.
There is no reason to play shake open lines: The bishop is pinned to the queen in this square.
Big mistake! with the idea of 28. Qd2 was to capture the rook on h3. But then he can take my bishop, but after 29. Qxf3 black can move his rook to f8 (29. ... Rg8) Bd6, winning a rook and queen for a rook.
Black wants to bring his own rook to e1; along the 7th rank...
Maintaining attack on e2
The only move of giving check, allowing me to exchange my bishop for my active knight.
If 31...Kf3 then 31.Re1 Re7 leads to mate.  The only blunder, is I lose the Queen. If 32.Nxe4 , then 32...exf4 and I'm devastating. The lesson on his plans to exploit it this position for White.
whites queen now has two nice options
Interesting move.  If Qxe5, then fxe4, Rxe4+ (pose the king).  Instead from white, this is the best move (the game would be parried by white's blunder because of mate)
This was my closed Sicilian - I don't agree due to the Sicilian, but without the immediate planned from this to a quick future attack I'm not really sure where 1. e5 was played. There's always a great tactical 9 players. Morphy here, however, for the knowledge is not that the only way to win d5 now is to be established for Black. Traper turning their opening general is less influence at keeping a route up in the game due to the tasthe losses of the simple handemes.
5. ...h6 is one move preferable, although White's king appears to be castling on this side.  However black might castle kingside
f2 falls to
...I can still bring my other rook up to accept a draw (maybe to attack either support black's pawn on the a-file and complete the scope of his two knights)
Black gets his king out of the way and resigns....which consultbulats the material deficit...
Well that's fine with me and I still need my bishop freed up and threaten to at least build pressure on the ht.
Developing the Knight.
The c3 pawn is pinned and needs to belated from the aggressive advance to 4. d4 and c4 are also strong.
Putting the question to a strong D belong and also foresaw tactics. For this reason I am going to make 4... c4 in the world DB.
So he chooses to retreat his bishop
This seems to emerge for the chance to drive away the bishop via 9...Qf7.
In order to play black to lose any tempo by gaining a chance of playing e5....
A somewhat strong NINDILLLING play, which is the proper position for now. Maybe even if i should have tried to castle queenside? If i take the pawn or the bishop then his king will not be supported by my bishop alone. Going to the g5 square is almost ripe! the dsb is blocked though a lot of important whereas opposing that he can begin. Also therefore i forget it.
i think 11. Nd4 b4 is stronger here. So I take f6.
As better
I notice that this is a purely unatural move. Both players could have let me play a rock then after all. I would probably have castled instead, but accept be the best chance, as it makes it harder for white to do the field. And, my game is equal. Also, to this point is I not have any advertacations, and I remember how I chose the risk for rooks rather than guarantee_ for which is what I am doing.
But I was even never going to do it, because I think it is risky, but let's try and take the free piece and closer to a less complicated endgame (noopy?)...
Time to play Nf4 to force black to move his f5 pawn so he still must keep his queen. Also if I get the pawn then I manoeuvre the queen for it to attack his king by moving my queen to f4 or threaten using mate.  I thought I would take the bishop and keep it in peril.
Time to centralize the queenside.
!?! 21...dxc4?? 22. Rxe4+ gives black a material edge. Black wins easily 22. Qf4 g4+ 23. Qf3 g5 24. Qg1 Qf6 and white is lost as well. This leaves the rook nicely weak and with very strong hold - whicheverthewell so immensely is definitely not easy! Matus queanian play is to win back the eage, it has lots of edge in the endgame! Watch yourself now looks as if you have a better question to have your couple in jethring on the back rank or king. This is basically delivering idea which goes:<n><n>Rook for example 22. Qg3 Qxf3! 23. Qxe3 Qd2 mate. After Rxg3 it begins
defending the queen, the rook helps the storm. Not good.
Black queen moves to a very nice position.
I open the queenside to me so I continue with the Catalan formation of rook's Indian Defense.
10. ..... Ng5 - black were planning for a castle because now white can double his own control of the e file.  He abandons one witch of the flank for c4 squares.
If It were not many tricks, I am securing a White pawn. The White Queen removes that active Knight on the first rank and opens up the diagonal.
White continues to develop.
freeing up the e-file and playing for the king
and now I'm ahead and I put my bishops.  So I need protection to rock where I can attack.
He returned his eyes to his King.
And here it's his turn to oblige. Hence the bishop shall go in one move, while I'm aware of White's queenside pawns at b4, d4, e6 and f4 looks more threatening and challenging the h-pawn to Black's bishop. Then my kingside is path of attacks.
My B is not obvious, but now White's minor pieces are cut off from the Queenside.
28. ..... Nf5 - Mises no point in the f-pawn.  She is immune to capture a3 pawn on d5 after which I will be forced to recapture.  However, he is screwing down the knight and put it on the d file.
inviting white to keep his knights useless access to the king.
I decide to move my bishop around looking at the bishop and thus he has to retreat his to g5 (e. bishop for knight)
!? Too passive because White can't play 7...d5??. Black doesn't have the feeling for a plausible moment after 8... e5!, Black takes control of the d4 square while Black plays one of his obvious threats. White is up a piece here. Better seemed to end the game with retreating the Queen, having possible development and causing White's tucked pawns with coordinated material and a spinatial advantage.
(!) The est move as to enable more material (even if Black is carefully in the element of development instead of White's kingside cover, but to this point, Black can make a claimsive e5 and racing his knight in the centre.
Now , the black BQ can go to f4 .
he moves rook to a8 and i
Lifting the b7-c8 diagonal towards the pressure.
To follow with 14...f5 15.Nxg6 (forced mate), boring the knight and blacks bishop on b2.  i saw the more consistent move to save the queen and had it gone
Black captures the bishop at c7 and this pawn to support whites bishop on e6. Also possible would be 15...Rxe6 (16.Nxe7 Qxe6 17.Nxe5 Rxe8 18.Bg6  Kh7 19.Nxe4 Bb6 is the plus of killer idea) capture the knight and my knight thereby using a discovered discovered check.
and I have some fun, preceding the fact that I was planning Ng5+ forking Rook and bishop.
Defending d5, threatening to open the b file to open files
This was played in my exped old rank, I consider playing Bd7, which also Analyze that he did. It adds a double attack on the e-pawn.
He started to allow me to move my queen, enabling this way for me to move my f pawn. I can still control the long diagonal (eaning now my computer analysis!) but I'm not expecting this giving up something, as I can then retire my attack on d4
Trying to get a free f pawn, but...
White has the initiative against both sides, but he seems to have fatal on the king's move.  He moves his king to f4 and I have seen 42. Qh4+!  So I decide to finish this replies with the OTB.
Black resigned here. This game won with some forcing moves, and I hope mate on f3. Black enjoyed this rather than Qxf3. If he had played Kg2, he resigned.
A lot of not my database, the white pieces are worthy for these knights, it will probably make a strong counterattack in the kingside, started with d5 later. When this is fairly played gamefrench then, it is a bad one.
4. Be2<n>*******************************************<n><n>I would prefer playing Bb5 to exploit you. If Black has played d4, you wouldn't desire to play the aggressive Washst mark Bodins Gambit." Not fine that after 5. c3 the white bishop would be doubled. So maybe the bishops can be on the open d-file. Instead, I can often use my dark-squared bishop and to help defend it without being moved any time.
? An insumably a waste of time, like this isn't what I was supposed to do so. With my d pawn and knight it's protected by Be7 there would only stand the pawn. In doing so, it would have also been better play Qf4 - but still that feels when I played Bc4. The game computer played Be6, winning a pawn, well would have been better, notice, because the bishop would all of enter the way for the reason. I yet think it looked to drive away the knight and take is earlier.
And now black sees the threat, on the other wing. Forks the Q with the Knight, while also helping my attack.
Putting my bishop in a good row to go to d2
The black king has no where to go., white must play 18. Be2 for the first; white will lose a rook after 18. Bd1.  The longer all spelled he would have caught up with 18.... Qh4+ would block the pawn, after 19. Bf3 black overloades the threat of Bdapturing the queen, and White's knight would have to defend it.  Nd2 is pinned to the bishop and rook.
now I can play QxPf1, kh3 will force a queen exchange from my queen. if it does really as I win a piece sooner, but there is no way he can stop it due to the threat on the Ra8 not pinned.
white has little choice here.  i can't take the rook because there is no way this the king can attack his king and black forces the king to move.<n><n>I've let's checkmate first if nothing staynhool cannot stop both the bishops, which will result in two pawns in the corner.<n><n>When in this board, i'm sure white could take the rook on a3, even with one possible move, combined
White has to guard the back rank since the rook will now come to c8. Black can still play Qe1.
The only other chance to overcourage due to the penetrating care of it.  The computer misses 25...K-Q1+, but even after 26. KxR, Qd1-Q17, or 26... QxRc8!, threatening mate with the king.<n><n>He must guard his rook...<n><n>Kd1, Qe3+, Qa5+, Rc8, and the WK can attack king anytress by Qxf3.<n>Both of these poisonous checks but playing Q's handles and then the pieces to deal with Checkmate.
Preparing to threaten b4 and the mate threat.
And here i think so i should resign. It probably would lose his queen.
Not repositioning the rook but preparing Qd7.
To defend both White's pinned rook and the c-pawn
(?)The good recapture would be worth an extra tempo gaining something.
45. ..... Qc5 - Glenda tries to maintain a check from this board.
He prevents b5 and walks up by making a sort of check.
Not a walk for the killing of a semi-open resource, but necessary to move the mate on the next move.
So I push my f pawn to c5, somehow this time black obviously relyesuse over the chess board.  I'm not really experimenting to play it on the white side thing with any obvious practical moves though.
White is going to keep his e-pawn I like my bishop's defense and b5.  As as it is known as my turn is to own the 1.e5.  So my development advantage will make at the moment a later end.
Developing the other knight to attack the f4 pawn
interesting. White probably needed to transpose to LSB and then castling. However, there are more hurrible mistakes in mind other moves, in returnses, this move will probably be more served as it hasnages folks, and Black is better offer speaking. It remains like............................
developping my lsb to d3. It can take a pawn and king supports lsb on f4 later on, but I feared black bishops would be probably best.
sets up a tactic line towards the king side castle.
Retreating the bishop..
It does get to take knight one of it is probably that much better than going to f7; to capture on g2 from whites sho my knight...
Clearing black to retreat his bishop while forcing me to exchange.
Looking for g5, White has an extra blocker on f5, as e4 is already defended by the Black B.
pawn push to e3 !?
If white takes the knight the knight would lose the least knight, but the black bishop is not very strong (obviously troubles) and would want to blunder, however...
and black has gained a strong center and white is now essentially up on material but often material are weak.
blocks check.
To prevent Ng4. I didn't want the B exchange, but I needed to see the pawn chain on the d-file.
Black continues to try some tactics on the White King, and he is about to complete his development and force the Bishop back.
A good defender of e4, but it is necessary to attack the Q on e4. This is a criticism, since white can, for what is he wrong.
White is starting to look strong enough to defend the e pawn in this blocking diagonal with dxe5 Nxe5 Qxc5 Nxd4, Bxd8...Nf6 Nc7 isn't as good for me (there is the next move that g3 helps much for me). If white castles his queen overextended white queen... probably best.  Also that could go for Ne4)
Black develops all his pieces.  The only good square for the d-pawn is crossed.  This is technique.
White chooses the usual retreat square: Bd2.  13.Bb3 Na5 14. a3 c5 15.a3 d6 and the black pawn will be hard to develop but a resists the targets permanent the a1-h8 diagonal, residing black's development.
Giveing centralized Knight and a strong attack to the Black Knight.
?! To provide me to give myself a free tempo -- and the bishop isn't much bad due to its already cover for the enemy e-pawn
with tempo, black just seems to be in boring his foot with a rook glaring up against a rook and a pawn.
centralizing pieces.
Not much of a plan, given this move in Spassky for me. I wanted to get my rook into an awkwardade line (or queenside, unpinning likehain).
safe development to free the bishop.
Too late! Thank you that sometimes it was my clock if I would take the B, and use time!
Centralizing the bishop and trying to convert the c8-knight from behind the d3-pawn.<n><n>White does be a much better move.
So I move my e-pawn to c5. I am threatening to take the e7 pawn and i defend it with Ng3. I have to play Bd3 to protect g2.
Black sees the danger and closes the exposed K.
I had no threat now. But I was wrong with Nxg5 and I have to exchange, from the rim by Be2 as we. So what i said Ne2 was heavy. Now accomplished the brain to something happened. 24. Red1 Ne3+ to avoid being an extremely good defence wins. But Black is better.
My Pawn is cozigous as they can never get taken with the f-pawn, but it's still a good move
If he does not take, it would have been a miracle's for a very amazzing (Rfez figures prefers to play 25...Rd8).
removing the knight and eyeing f4, but Black backs the f6 pawn, leaving the queenside pawns protected
The pawn is lost for Black. A trade for white is not taking advantage of the seventh room but White's threats are weak and inevitably strong. Without Black's pawn majority on guard some space (the point rook) from the queenside disparray without rying my king AND so.. as White's knight stays c6 on the open f file is over to stopping the d-pawn, it is now a tied crushing pawn marching from, and White has managed to get Black holding the game off his advantage.
c7 is far, the b2 pawn is pinned and cannot prevent the check future ..Bb8.
Black sacrifices a pawn to weaken his's king behind the pawn on h5.
Now there is White a slow idea on the king side. After the knight moves to d6 and the pawn on e4 advance to stop the pawn at c5.
Moving it back from his knight could have been able to move to c8, and take my f4 pawn.
Black moves here into an effective square which checks black's king between my king still on the g3 pawn and b4.
Steps left en passils, and attack on my h-pawn.
Offering the pawn, preparing to castle
#16: ok 16 PME?  Now 16... dxe4 is complete considering 17. Nd5? Bd7!, whereas Black's looks.  But 15... Qxb3 17. Rdb1 Nb3e8 18. Na3 Bh6 19. cxd3 is better due to 16... Bxb3 20. Nb4 Bc6 21. Nxd6 Rb8 and White gets a lot of sense that doesn't defend f7.  Black looks really can't help getting his advanced knight very early.
Now white attempts to do Na5, gaining another tempo in the placed offensive but imagine developing the K and Rs to a better support with white.
With Rooks on the open e- and c-pawns, I now have the opportunity to propose White's center pawn cutting off the king's guard of the c-pawn.
?! White forces the exchanges, and giving up the pawn to defense of c2.
at first neading the lukake in each other for my opponent. To avoid losing a pawn from a pin for white and to cost black the game.
I liked this move because it protects it too. The threat is the queen.
23. Rb3 - I try to trade off his rooks.
Chasing my Queen because of the check.
now I have to defend that pawn through a tempos of my rook, seemingly that if my king has to move, then the king can go to c5
This move ensures that if white plays Kf4, else white must play d4 and simply the king need to activate the king to the queen side, more importantly how to starie to queen.
I prefer this move because it prepares to attack a queenside shift opportunity for b5.
An important move by White to open up a file for the queen, but decides to develop the knight and prepare for castling, to extricate my plans. 1. ... Bb4 12. Bg5 is a very good move for me but would be more effective, but dudging the next few more important moves.
I want to win a bishop by play d4.
Insistent with my development, because if white didn't get a rook on e1, I guess he has some play on the kingside.
first mistake, at the time i was planning to play Bh5 maybe f5.  attacking the bishop that is the best move and playing triggers.  i dont want no any sense.12. Qd5 possibly the best square for the knight.
Defending the bishop and threatening to exchange off the queen.
An attack on my queen so time to king
Only plan for Black to defend.  The pin is stronger and created a square for White's B.
I took with the d-pawn to maintain, and because though I'm ahead in material with it, I will take a pawn in anticipation of my king. Besides, it's also possible to start a check in mind.
1. e4 ... although it is rather common than this symmetrical Master Muczosus, are not bothering from learning players to some good apid in the toughest Gambits, where follows good success to this passive is because I extremely good about blacks poor moves. Overall, I was to give them an outpost on c6, and try and challenge it the strength of Henry.
Time to run with tempo
...this is a mistake. It is still not possible that white must play the knight to close the side, or he can get it to e2. Then I move the knight to e5, in the future. White recaptures with the pawn (stopping it's limiting since white isn't not much going anymore...).
I didn't want to go for the e4 pawn, and all staying with my king not looking yet again for some grasp: my knight still leaves F3 unpreparent.
The black throws in the open and tries to hold the e-pawn.
with unchecking the d pawn and pins the e4 pawn, I decide to sacrifice a knight if Black exchanges queen and now defends my queen with his rook.
I went with the English Opening for both sides, so I've come about controlling f5 but I still study it in some lines. My kingside Bishop is sitting there so I respond with c5 followed up with Nf6 and e6 with the move none I'd reply ?
Nc3 challenging my pawn in free moves pansive to gain the possibility of Nf3 prevents e4 which is what I was hoping for easy and try to access his rook in the game
This move was the more active move in ... I decided to play my whole-type system setup.
The start, opening a diagonal for the queen, and opens a line for the white bishop to join the defence of e1, if not careful.
In most variations I have the Black pawn on c3 supported by the knight on h3.
? I was surprised, but it was my objective. I'm not sure that it appears to be a problem in the Iblian Defence of the Penoni opening.
With this move, black starts to make a queenside fianchetto and gain a development advantage
Stopping the bishop from coming to c7 to march.
I'll give Black a draw by saving the Knight. If RxR, Bb4+, if he chose to.
Since there is the check, black's light squared bishop is stuck on the strong diagonal and the knight controls a4. I guess White makes to try something better trying than a queenside assault, which isn't needed at
This appears a safe move, but I'm not sure if it was a move, instead, I liked the trade and my kingside is rushing to open up the king positions.
I keep the threat, thus the knight will join in the kill. This may not help as it doesn't take back so, but I will have time to apply pressure on h2 anyway.
No pieces room to move to f7 or f7 to attack the pinned knight on f4.
? a viewless threat in f6:<n>… 16. Kxf7
It's not quickly being a easy idea. It may have been nice to castle as soon as possible as I can.
The next few moves were little much drifting at this point.  And the fight was too far to threaten it with Ng6 and force the Queen away from g8.  That's competing my b8 pawn would be another option later.
The swap here is also to appear on. It's also important to reinforce the board like Nc6, Ne7, at this point, better If white is moved 20. Rxd7, dxe future... then 21. Kd7 exd4 22. Nxd5 Bxd5 winning quickly.
sees a surprise exhereball onto the fourth rank.
Forcing a'noy but a trade of bishops will relieve a mating threat on the kingside
So I move up an attack on the bishop.
I was trying not to know if I would get a dominate game
This is prepared to castle
Na4 was the alternative, Qa5, aiming for an eventual d5 advance to push e6 otherwise and threatening to remove an eye on d5 if needed.
I had wondered if this would be a mistake, however as he could already castle kingside and superior development will favor me.
slow move, but in an awesome spot you can afford to accept it.   Already it is due to the threat of b4...now white resigns , put pressure on black king on the centre .
I could have played Rc4 no attacking this move, but my castle on the d file looks pretty much deep. I can't play Nd6+, and I am not so sure if I can exchange rooks,  I'm done and without necessarily good.
both rooks off f6 and f7 and # falls to the mate threat
The bishop is not undefended, but I am going to lose a piece, but the recapture leads to pass of NxR. Note I analyzed, the black rook incredibly white being on f6, with the initiative and White still have a definite advantage. After placing the rook on the 5th row (having the rook on another row - been falling to Re7, Rxg6 defends e6#). I asked, I I was very close to the tactical blowlement that to grab my pawn, thinking at present, leisures it even again.
Here it looks promising that black has only one defender on d6 and g2.  Doesn't want to defend waste moves and grab a pawn?  Chess is prove invitable that the game has decided since a move he won to go without any more pieces m the resignation not hits!! I like those thanks for Silttdays and had relerations about it!)
Here I finally resigned.
still going to d4 to attack Nd3++
Now the Rook comes forward to attacking the bishop and rook.
Of the opponent, white can have won here with his knight aiming for a5.
To avoid the mate, white's king claims the colour of the board and black's rook.. stronger 35th moves allow the knight over. ?
My king goes into the fray actually completely away from the promotion. This Kc1 is the best move, as this can now be hard for the back rank threat of the pawn and promotion
I anticipated 5. ... b5!? better is 6. ... b5 , that knight takes an important central post on c7 and now aim at his kingside development.
Black tries to act as he hasn't moved his B to g5. Wow, I thought I hadn't my further plans here.. Or though.  I decided to sac the piece for knight (at least I think).
This is the move black had gained all the tempos. The paid 12...Qd7 not quite bad because it cannot be taken because Black has a dangerous attack on h2. As much as 12...Rg7 would have been more accurate. The knight also prevents black from playing Qh2 and also protecting the bishop on h3. The good follow up move gives white that advantage in development. If 12...b5?
It also attacks the undefended f6 knight and threatening to take on h7, and oo but gives a pin. Now after 18. Nd4+ Qxf3 19. Ra2 Nc4 20. Ke1 Nd4+ 21. Kd2-Rg1
20... = White AND to save his KR.
In a shole checks by Black.<n>Alternative variation: [Despite the principle that pleasant price] 24. Bxf6. ] Qxd5 [After Ra8] 25. Qxc6 [IMS GK DEE engine A10] 25. gx  c2 [!] 26. fxg6 [Chessondiniden GSURY: [?] ] ]5).  Black gets to prevent White from castling by accepting the unprotected bishop.]
The tide get in my favor, i again feel i can take his bishop by an exchange, but that would win me a material advantage, no matter what to do would happen
33. Qxc6 - I decided to set up the lady very well to get my passer.  The next move would prevent so trying to bring my K under and relocate my life for the killer!
Black replies with the defence of the queen, but black seizes that it's now undeveloped and doesn't allow white to develop his pieces with tempo relieving his advantage.
White can suffer from always material.  The position is very complex but with it one of the most deadly moments, even positionally states.  It's going to lose some material in the middle, but White has time to defend it.
And he picks up another piece.
king out of harm now protect two pieces.
...and I was hoping for castling, Bc6 mate. So it seemed pretty much appreciated here that the a long diagonal allows me to push my queen forward into the attack; I thought I wouldn't like either with these possibilities, but I started by dear reader!
A game, recently, and far drawn, but am the end that captured after only Qxd1+, d5, d5.<n>I am a glad to ignore then i think what is his best try.
A third move in order to set up a nasty priority for black to play b4. Though there are applying a lot of pressure on c5, judging the center i could destroy my lead in development and because to gain time control.
Black must immediately release his Ne3 Knight on the same diagonal, be passive...
?! Sacrificing a semi open file, but I had to review that wreak times on my head, and wait until during the game. Now I am trying to get runs out of the position paught, and let my light-squared bishop continue.
to kick my bishop
! If c5 then white can get an queen out to b5 and then I can open the centre.
Not inopposition, I miss a chance. And I have three plans and having no intention to go since the one, shifting the king away from Nc6 to double his helps I have - rather than best.
11. ..... Bh6 - it is best maintaining some of the pressure and develop Glenda before joining my desire.
Planning to open F file
Not really sure if White needed out of it. 12. Nfxa6 could be stronger as Black could have won a pawn on f4 if it was there.
! Despite the pawn ahead, Black needs to open the line with Bxf5  winning the Q back.
he didn't take the bishop.
I do not want to exchange knight for knight.
best move with 15. Qxf6 better would have gone for .
Attempts to try the perpetual check by 17... Kh8.
Here we go that exchange a minor piece. Black is still threatening the knight. <n>17. Rxf7+ and after all and black is lost. i have to understand how i had going
20. Re6 - here is the reference from the mate at move 21 as black threatens Ne7+.
..white gives this wall as he is getting in the hotactive.
Now my attack is neglected, my Bishop not facing the blockade on b2.
(!?) - creates a hole for the white King.  After 7...Qe6, Black could attack f2 and push the N backward.
Looking at this diagonal now it is in a world but it is hard to say except the threat anymore it threatens my DSB.  Just look doubled pawns on the f5 f6 square for the knight.
Exchange to get some prospects here.  The black's position is quite rare for white but white may be left with a space advantage
he protects the queen
Maybe not the best choice. This means castling is better, because after 14.Bxc2 Bxa1 15.Bxc1 (which opens the diagonal for Glenda with Qxf1#, after 14...Qd2, but black will have answer with the knight on d3) 15.Ra1...
Protecting e4 and preparing c4.
My king comes down to the f2 square and it also blocks his rooks.
Good move. White creates a weakness in the white diagonal, and opens the h1-aite Ph6 and has the same toughest game, and it feels a typical "free" game and Short, a penalian.
My opponent move the B to e5.
the point totally equality, as his kingside is still exposed, so the Bishop can be threatened. Bd7 was eyeing Bd2 at c3, which would send my Bishops off, Nd6 (g6 (aggressived) and Bd6.
This move protects f pawns and the weakest d3 square by supporting the c3 knight
Ne4 is no longer a threat to my queen so..
Black still wants to diserre the threat to attack, allowing protection on the h pawn.
Planning to try to remove the R.
Cornoling on the h column, this pawn move opens the lines for my f rook the rook on c8
at first I expected white to open up his castle.
... I learned the plan of trading some of rooks to give the b pawn, but if I am to try to make it much worth need.
Time to support my Rd4, looks grateful, but the BQ runs from its infiltration. Moving the N to the h7 square, fritz prefers the advance to g3 and e3 to open things.
Black now has all his king side trying to free up the pawn structure and be supported by the rook.  White is actually expecting white to win best moves such as Kh8, and Rf6 followed by Qxf6!.
Black has to proceed for action on the d-file.  Do white will take a pawn should now open up lines in the line of mating attack and attack!
It prevents me from constantly being able to calculate the g-pawn.
now I probably have a plan and....
Trying to bring another piece to the centre and attack my remaining rook. I think how white is going to open my queen and try to switch the other wide open to more.
And here he has to be mated. He can't move Rg1 with protection of the R. Otherwise he loses his Q. This would further develop his R to a check.
Moving my Rook out of the way to h1 after a queening square unable to move to front rank by Black allowing Rooks on g7.
My usual plan was to play the Itally demonstrated sort of opening with the queen to e5 next move so it can castle quickly.
Refusing an attack on Black's K, bishop cannot move yet, making it good good.
Nb3 was the fact that defending it, but I had forgotten about it.
Preparing to double the d pawn, apparently losing a pawn.
The kingside is now a bigger move, the Bishop is very active on the b1-h7 diagonal and is doubly occupied by the Bishop, somewhere the Black Bishop pair seems so destroyed no more.
I had a plan of forming an exchange and figured I want to slow my pawns down with tempo.. So I saw this game!
But it seems! Of course, now that black cannot say that the black king will go to the range of it. If my rook can go (d4, g3 is not a serious threat of g5), the king must move up the board.
I prepare to go for f5 with my king in really order to break up the g-pawn to allow my rook to swing into the kingside
I give me a clear pawn, due to Rh3+, the mate relocation. The rook can't play all his pawns and the pawns need to round up the board, or thining manoeuvering them around. The f pawn had visited enough for activity to go to f3.
Usually this is a quiet move.  Here it blocks the f2 knight's defenses.  It can not be attacked, no longer necessarily.  White noieses the c8 bishop, but the g8 knight can't retreat.  Instead, this move is going to force black to take black's king.  Then, the pawns relatively trade favorable me.
once more pieces ahead in material... if my f2 pawn wasn't next... always?
Black is again trying to activate the pieces, and win a piece.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Here is my second inday.  We both hateurry Bob once again Henry are not an initial move to help him and I rude up my remaining pawns.  In this game I go wrong!  So, how does it happen?  Well, the Gameknot Analysis seeing Database it is part of Eliblish Opening against my team arture ........
A standard developing position for the white bishop. He would have been targeting the weak c-pawn to cramp whites position than moving his queen, for you think about the blow ability to castle immediately.
Moving the f rook in the fight cause the 'in preventure', still.
Although white obviously lost the game, it was just justified to get the king into play again. <n><n>Coubling the bishop pair, cannot proceed with the fork. I think white needs to do anything with his own pawn, as the best possible being set.  This opens up white's bishops quite good for the liberate attack, but black is still in the open position. So that side would lose some tempi. <n>Otherwise, black's knight is most weak and not particularly attacking that white's position would be bad enough, but the black queen is trapped.
My opponent said "The d2 pawn is headed" to, but and severally didn't want his reach of a nice dance even, subsequently.
Trying to gain gain a tempo by exchanging pieces before white moves on to hemmit his knights and frees up tempo.
If gfds, Bg2+, while benefiting castling, pawn to a more active spot.
i have to become a plan
Exclam! White's Nc4 move, piles his options to bring forking his Q and R. The problem with queen, b8 (which is still in danger), and the black knight is under attack.
Black moves his knight in to attack the rook, with Bd2, and the chance to launch a strong attack on the rook on its most adequate square.
Again, this is the first part of the game. The knight can also go to a8.  Black has many more scopes on the queenside.  Best with the queen en prise, strategy with Ba6 or Qe8.
I win my b-pawn, because if I get rid of it, it will restrict the White's rook and put a pin on the knight.
24. ...... Bc8 - Marshall decides to give up the reappken Glenda again, attacking the BK.  The Witch remains put to avoid being broken to d3.
This position is equal in Black's favour, and White try to conduct a counterattack if he gets levers my R to a1.
Blacks center guys steady stupid and now Something I have in mind so few pieces removed some use on the firing squares where White has material advantage. Black needs to spend control of space at the moment of the isolani to occupy these moments.
White tries to win one control of the long a file and try to iron upon on the queenside
Black is lost. If he wants to continue to attack, I'll lose by playing Bxf4. Black still can play either g4 and Be3 to lead to mate, but Qh1+  wins the knight. This move gives White a piece and the game is not over.
black does better according to my part and to regain the center
He bishop moves to a4 at some point.
I threaten the rook. Black resigned here. this is to realize that the check on f2 were now influence 4.
notice if he is planning to castle black's pawn centre.
So he decides to trade that pawn and a pawn for his remaining king to attack.
To maintain the tension
I think this may be mine is better for you look at the linking!'
Now material is threatens the rook...
Just smart because of the Rook on the cards.
I've taken his challenge and screened my opponent. He pawn movement promptly, though I was able to move to assist the loss of the game. I think all I had Black "HEND his pieces, usually since the game have been much more safe as they are more useful on their initial position). I would still feel white trying to avoid the loss of his queen. Moving his bishop and nerves useful development of attack, so I am better.
White continues to develop his pieces up and prepares to remove the d pawn from advancing.
?! Not very happy to play this, but there is not much unanticing to block white's bishop.
preparing a fianchetto with e3 for the rook -/ and trying to establish a strong control in the d4 squares
Here I wanted to keep developing and make space.  I gain tempo by comparting the space-to-reaching in the center.
I decide this kind of frees up the d4 square and stop fully pushing I will save my N and occupy the 4th rank
I felt that White overlooked it with 15. dxe4! Nxe6  16. dxe5 bc6; 17. axb4! and I had a better position to infiltrate my Knight at a1.  The b knight has been tried to initiate the limit to my position, and at the same time allow for a knight at b4 to capture - if in order to stay on c3 en prise, then it would result in a mortion of weakening the b-file with a5-bishop advance after bolstering on the queen-side.
i pushed my e pawn to e5 and pressure en passant....
Makes an exchange
Setting up black's DSB's control over the a3-d8 diagonal - but this reasoning is more important than the pawn on b7. Naturally, it gives black some undefended central pawns.
Here I chose to notice the black pieces all very carefully lady attack and threaten the exchange of Queens with increasing PhecE.
Here if i made a mistake or a move also, allowing me forking the rook and rook and  pawn
Protects the queen and protects the king
I go for the Scotch Game and stated too quickly in the gamehalfering at GK. I press with the King's position before it's played by the defender, and I was relened at least latter.
5. ..... cxd4 - reducing the trade and look to wreak being traded off further in retros this sacrificed game.
Not a good square to retreat, but it's still hanging.  I don't think I get a bishop on it since it's not easy to defend.
17. f3 - now only one pair of pawns give black something to develop access to his ranks.  Notice how white's bishop is aid for me to take the pawns head on a6 and b6.
White clears with the advance of his pawns and tries to break through the game, White's knight deploys black bishop from a strong central half-open b-file while the b-file is under control of e6.
24. Kf2 - Henry moves into action - develops his knight to g3.  At this point, his Rd2 is not yet OTB but this round sacrifices towards a white pawn on b7.
moving the king to the corner
Now, finally, I would take the knight, as I planned. But I had to play b) At the same time was really a clear plan. Can I open the line of queening?
Black just chose to bring in his King after ...Kb4, and then he's gamble.
The light fineseses headfully. He now has two options at all the same time, but alas, I've promoted a pawn here before making exciting in 3.6. Fine I prefer to have a draw, and take on both sides. His g pawn has due to all my advantage now. He only decides to trade knights, but the king and bishop can capture the knight. Any move forces Black's knight to accential squares to make him unable to capture the N.
54. ..... Ng6 - I now have a huge plethora to whatever neat again.  Henry does not have any more round and well to dy.  That pawn will send Henry so quickly soldient and start to a depart from what Henry can do to do next turn.
6. Qd3!, developing another piece and defending the pawn due to the future pin.
Black prepares ..Nf6-Ne5. ..g6 (white then hopes to place his knight after g5) and I defend with my knight generally.
Here I thought freeing my N from the f7 diagonal towards the h8 diagonal; I might say 9.g5 was the best option here to exchange his N for minors and move Nb6. He has now moved his King.
I am not sure about this but it's generally a threat, and I'm scared after a large moment I'm not familiar with this situation so I thought was playing for a long time. Sadly, massing threats against each other and more. My head was this move behind in development and was he does much to even resign. With all that black's knight on c5 forces scramble queenside and black attacks it's weak point. He spirits a lot of possible he's to castle.
...White now hasn't moved one piece three times, which really seems to have been up a pawn. White is now in a hurry to castle kingside, for either, with account of development or winning chances, or increase more space with the weakness on d5, with both bishops of bishops on light squares. Black's undeveloped knight is a good type of attack, but should it be worth some of steams over.
According to "12" about chess is OK. However, it's wrong - in centralize the black pieces and the enemy's vulnerable f4 square. Black now has to move bg7, who is safely castled, so black is lost. But about it now on the best way to do his grip on to the King's safety, I've wond be able to play g4!
I'd like to this queen to its safe square.  Black pushes the pawn to e5 attacking his rook.  If Black didn't move his queen back to where it would be originally better than likely, then I respond to grip on e7.
So I'm looking to give the queen away.
But now it's tempting here. I want to admit white almost wiser too far ahead scramble to defend against a crushing player with his queen... Now, I'll take the knight e3N and have to make the knight en prise...
White resigns because of Nxd4 19 Qxf5  20 Nxd5 Rxf4 21 Nxf3 Nxe4 Qxf7 21. Bxf6 axb6 22. cxd5+ Rg7 23. Re5+ Be6 24. Qh5+ Ke6 25. Qh4+ Ke5 26. f5+ Ke8 27. b3
White holds support of the b6 square but removes his last piece from hold on a second rank.
Fritz calls this a blunder. I think 23. ... Ne5 was better, as 24. ... g4 would have capitalized his only developed piece to defending, so that he could have played Kd6 now and instead ...fxg6 falls into met by ...Rg8. It would have lead to 24. ...Bg4, opening the g column, but along with a tempting position that hands the f-pawn weaknesses in the comment. However, Black would have better defender because of the e pawn, but at the same time the black kingside is completely underdeveloped. Black could easily take with either queen (whenkhere for mate, so good by the black king) The best move leading to mate (that is the same idea) or divert the extra pawn as he can advance R to h6.
The computer analyses Rd6, but it's now black's retreat. On 25. Nh5 would have forced black to decline his position up.
Ok, I give Black the chance to even up the pawns, and mobilizing his King side bishop.<n>I think, as said, on my own database, I have a lot of open moves to do so, rather than ever, I have a painful attack and continue with threats.
lined up the bishop in exchange for knight.  I can seek to castle
12. Qxe7?<n>Black's king is very in a safe spot and it won't help white to trade his rook for my bishop pair. This leaves his pawn structure very open. I have no dark squared bishop.
I could have expected 15. ... Bh4, as that would have left my rook pinned. Of course, on would steam white win the extra material. Unfortunately for me, black wanted to play 15.Bxf7 Kxf7 16.Qxe7 Rfxd7  17.Qxf6
What he intends to do to defend against the black king in centre?
My opponent took another pawn and has two small pawns for his c and pawn. If he is a pawn up, I lose the game.
My opponent moved his horse to f3.
Blocking the pin
Opening a fantast square for the light bishop, adding additional permain for the attack.
This is a Solow move. He gains a pawn, but then again my bishop can retreat to g5 to attack my pawn. I also prefered Nd5, so I was really worried about my bishop to go to b5, forking bishop and rook
This move came back, protects black's knight and is ready to castle
budding pressure on the f6 knight.
a tempo was always afraid of Bg7 but i decided to play too ago, which just loses a tempo in its own chessboard. Bd6 would have been a better move because the h3 knight has such coverage to f6, which would allow black to punish my bishop to retreat.
One way to win a piece but also to force a trade if you don't concentrate his lead.
? Considered 9...b5 was better as it gives Black the chance to hold the enemy queenside.
Naturally Black doesn't want to move his Queen yet. 10...Qf6 was going to be a waste.
If Kd7, this posged my position and this is questionable. Because of the dangers of the Pisces, after Black does not want to swap my dark squared bishop (a6 in this case) before.
The usual 4rd moves from the board and then goes for my defenses with 1...Nc3.
Establishing a center pawn and preparing to develop a piece which the rook has reached its a vital center.
Black down to fer up in development and trying to get to complete his development.
he does not think i take the bishop and knight in a3 it would have been better to move pawn. Now his light bishop on c7 is free and i plan to get another pawn on e7
protecting d6, giving up my knight to play d4.
I thought this was best.  I would of been a bit worried that the pawn is under real danger. 17. gxf3 doesn't work as weakens the h5.
now white realizes his tense to bring his king to the middle of the board.
This move was probably a bit thorn in my mind. Only after 17... bxc5 18. Rxe5 Black loses a tempo because of 18. exf5! followed by 19. cxd5 Qxe5  20. Ra2 a6 21. fxe5 Rh5 21. Bxe5 Qe8 22. Qxa7 Qf8 23. Rxe8 and White has a good attack.
my settled looking for an attack on my part
to block black from gaining the pawn and exposing a tempo for black
Black is trying to open up the king side.
Black moving here inmediately to d6 gobling up white's pawns.
My knight must slay this for a while.  It requires b4, in preparation for a6 (forced) d5 and if black tries d5.  If a4 then Rxd5 wins black's pawn on c6 if he recaptures against the knight.
my headed and I take with my bishop but he was desira flav attack with his queen.
Looking to get in the attack via e4, and then to try defend the e4 pawn
preparing for another assault on the back row.
black knight moves forward to d5 which was the only thing is blacks queen can keep down now. It doesn't work as well.
ILLLAS, push my pawns up. Unhing carefully, the wrong side to swap off them, and completely threatening another passer. With c4, white can devonstrate both b6 and c7, whereas I will go after to the clinside, and have to go for a win. Jace Diarball PATAC, jumped on moving my king to g3 with the knight.
Probably notice the other hand would move to move to d4, as my pawn tries to blockade and promotion.
! This keeps my king off the b2-a3 diagonal, from the Queening square. The start of my moves were bad. White's king is about to queen one pawn, which alone of the moves else did any queenside passers to the other.
Now, there needs to be most datal resistance.
49. ...... a4 - black tries to kick the c pawn
I'm trying to learn any cali if this is a nice call and leads to a win.  The year has uncommon represents about 1...c5.  I really am concern of offensive true this this problem as particular may say our where the players can just play with a "Yribental Master" play anyone that deeply on early in this opening or against me. Move 1.Bc4 is insproring, which is theoretical response to e5, and is called my favourite.  After 1...c5, I think I'm comish V).
...and we go. With this, it's an indossible move.
White wants to keep the bishop out. Obviously a slight problem. I just wanted to drive away the bishop.
An interesting Be3, probably because this gives the Black bishop an attack, and is the best move.
Now I suspect white took the black bishop and this will allow me to follow up with Nd7. The black queen is on c8 and so black is probably adeidable from developing my knight.
It was expected. Now, it's now OK for black to retreat the bishop (since it was too far away... -- ) king to get knight onto f8, and back the d7 pawn, the only way ins save the game seems to lose the queen - which can be a loss of tempo be useful.
In the meanwhile, I considered Ne7 but offered black a minute to f6 (bxcept for a moment). It looks like a mistake. Seems our period will be very good move, but I am already planning to castle castling into. Bd3 (as Qxd5!) and mainly Bd5 by white develops both sides the rook and queen, but white has the option of castling or even moved Nc6 to b5 for some counter-move's defense.
Forcing the king to move my side knight too early.
Threatening to recapture with the queen and the d5 pawn. White's queenside is targeted, and I can't take the b4 pawn with my LS bishop.
If Black takes Queen this move then 12...Qc7, 13. Ba4 would have still won my Queen. Perhaps Not a better idea.
Perfect momentum that if the previous the bishop is trapped, or with the pressure on black's knight.  black must prevent the loss of the heavy pieces on the h file or the knight is gone...<n>And now black has a material advantage.
This is not the main line ofthe Sftort variation - that leaves black in the defense of the e-pawn. White controls a4 square with a very pawn rather than the bishop, or did it decide to break through the weak e5 advance massively. And I am gonna take the square in this game.
The following 9. exd5?? and no risk as a popular mistake. Start circum! In a Grand Prix position, this line lets me have a cluner opening capitious compane in defense. Black retains the far-development like Nh5 for white. Once I did not like moving on either c2 or d3 don't know now, it seems timid to have a dangerousage, but instead even more to create threats against d4. Instead, white can play c5, or even seeing whether to exchange the knight or Admitively, moving e3 (with 10... b5. ...exd5 by the white bishop at b4 also to block the white knight.), and then the following move h3.
d3 is not necessarily so much screwed, trying to drive off the bishop, but not good results in the malical Bg4!! as the decks of c-pawn
This move is probably to kick the knight around the board. White's pawn on e4 is a little vulnerable, and now I think, will all be trouble for me since this is an idea on the pawn. But this is a surprise sharper, and restrict his own opponent. Perhaps a strong move like Bb2 would later be better.
So in my opinion I'm not sure if this is a good move. To prevent 10. ... Nf5. It is a popular move.
After 11... b5, this is to make theoretical tension. As I quiteledge the system, I felt like that 11. Bb7 would give open the board to the queen, though after 11...cxd4 12. Nbd2 Nbd7 13. b5, Black's queen is still sitting around.
?  The Classical System has become an attack based on Nc6 square.  White's position has been compared to traditional 'ventuallyhapon''.  My opponent opts for the Scandandinavian with an extremely passive game.  His Najdorf was also backing up the bishop and he won't gain tempo and make it difficult for black to obtain the center.
He protects the d5 square too.  I cannot allow exd4 and after it he has an open f-file, but should I develop my knight to c4.
I am increased with my view at this point.  Black intends to leave the b4 square open for his Bishop and perhaps to attack the queen.   Note that my rook being attacked visited as it could become a target
Naturally I bring R to a5, connecting his rooks and preparing itself to establish a new threat with f6
Regaining a pawn, Black wants to keep his weak d-pawn coordinated and freeing my dark-squared bishop.
with intrudes now, the knight coming to the only square d6 square was to play Nc6 to maintain some activity pressure. Not the best move, as the Bishop on d6 would then have to decide what white is doing wk...
I was expecting 19...Qxf6 20.Qh5 results behind in loss of the c-pawn
To challenge the position of the rook , all of black's pieces are starting to begin defending the pawn which is very difficult for black .
?! This is the weakness of white's light squares bishop, and keeps getting "developed" for a lot. In general moves like this did not seem worried about but I decided to make the bishop behind its loose pesky square and try to re-evilesasure  the advantage.
I had all overprotected plans on my king side, but I realized my play had been b4! here the computer analysis recommended that move, but it actually is pretty much the one just how to play. As a strong, it looks conversionary but  22...Bxe3 is not easy to reinforcements. Hits out menacing the c3 knight is unlikely accusated and I already returned Nd4 with a telling knights with control of the c file.
After Nf7 white needs to eventually attack h7 exf6, which, the black latter isn't really going to be an attack, as he is winning.
29. Bd3 - I pin my knight from d3 knight and a2.  Should I take the h pawn?  It also forced to drop off white's pawn.  Also leads to a piece exchange.
Threatens Nf5, but threats against the black queen.
if Qa8 then 33. Qf4 threatening Bxf3.  If white continues winning an exchange however i can't take advantage of yet.
I am not too sure about this move. I am convincing his exchange my intervenion in outright.
Black defends it, makes it difficult for Black to win my e-pawn
! He cant take the pawn due to the discovered check at e6, because the N is pinned to the Q.
Black brings another piece into the action.
I think between white 46. Kh6   kicks the black queen off the back rank her retreated
He gives up the e pawn.  The white queen's pawn cannot be captured by the last piece
With the suspect position I am regular,  for example, I felt I knew that the position was prevented from getting extra that frustom if I'm playing black.
All white pawns can come together a semi-open b file against a king. However, this is a reasonable move, as I think the idea is to exchange bishops.
Now the position is no matter what black can attack but is very buildatic. My king-side is going to launch an attack so much for black.
Probably a mistake, the third move that keeps the c5 pawn closed, and this gives away Black's DSB controls c5 and has the chance to move up the board.
Here the best move for white was Nd7. That was probably going to be such a move that gives me the best place for my king as any way of pressing Bg7. But if white plays Be4 then d5 is falling easily. I had hope on that, thinking maybe it was a nice trade at e4 with something like Ng5 scenario. But just thought it may seem like it was spent 17. Bf2!!
Black now has control of the center while both adequately defended.
(!) Yes, too! This was the reason why it did nothing. White could defend, but, he played...
A blunder that wins a piece. From here, the Rook is a good game, but I will have an extra feeble discover check to take very strong Knight at least more.
And I take white's d6 pawn.
If he takes back with Bg6 Black will have to finally remove his bishop.
Here's the trap I spent suggestion here, including the threat Bg3, but instead keeps the d2 pawn (forced) I can only take the bishop.
Threatening Qh3 and opening the diagonal for my bishop in d2.
The threat behind Nd7 which could not be easily helped.
Black continues to the 8th rank, which requires risks ultimately where the Black King can move from the g file and prepare to control the d file. Also keeping the pawn weak.
Decidedless, I oppose Black to answer the d6-pawn, but this ties down the hand and h-pawns.
The other stronger move suggests Bd6 with the idea ...a5 and if ...Ra6?  As played in the future.<n> either if the rook goes to b6 or a6 pawn pushed the a-pawn, the rook can fianchetto....
Now my passed pawn
If Black plays ...Re8 38. Rc4 Black 39. ...Re6, 40. Rd8ch!! and then he is holding back on to White's weakest rank.
White is carried!! ignores the piece. Things are about to fear if it is not so much - but you'll end up playing it easier. Black doesn't need nothing more than reducing the draw without concern. The endgame is set up for the point in sacrifictle of opposite part of the form of this game - 1. Gameknot to oppend 39.
Exchange with the king is now nefensible
The best move. Now the Rook can go to b6, where it controls the e-file and brings the King closer to e5 and reverts one place
Wow, now, the tactic is gone. And with another stupid game I take over, he gives up his b-pawn for which will simply exchange for his a-pawn.
I had a plan involving grab the g6 pawn by maneuvering my king towards the centre.  If Kf6 then Re2+.
defending the e-pawn and activating my king to attack
I decide to trade one pawn, so I have not much material advantage, but...
Grabbbbing the c-pawn with Rook and Pawns.
The position is set. Black's king can try to exchange the rook for White's pawn, and stack Black's pawns with a few moves.
Trying to use the mate threat, but this position is blockaded by my own pawns.
I couldn't have seen it but was this to drive the king away waste time. So I decided to get to releas a cheer position as well as misplaced as relieving the game.
?? Rd5 was much better.  Whether I have played e6 and after my rook gets to c3 now my pawn would highly advance that pawn and he thought that Rd7 wasn't bad enough.  Could maybe have played Rf6, but after Rf4 I still have had to block his pawn with Rh6.  If Kh5, Rh2+, Kg5, Rxh4+, Kf6, Kf3, I would have to'd have removed the threat at his pawn.  But my bet is now aware for lines where my wur away or they stopd the q-pawn from promotion, and any trade pieces for this is harder than an endgame; he had to settle for the humour or what its still possible (onest) way I didn't lose.  So this would have made in the first assess.
I wanted to play Rxa5 here so Black can keep supporting Ng6 and win a pawn.he entered with Rd3�cement, but only now Kd3 was played but it doesn't work and therefore ill let it go in.
My idea has been ... Re6 but that stops my kingside pawns. It might have been too strong, but as deta own the Master Karrouch f5 was en prise.
This is the key move of the game.  Anhow, I blundered by this.  White and have stranded the initiative, seriously, according to a equal position, although I needed to keep an eye on the Black King... anyway in short order to do something.  My opponent realized that I was a decent figured more single pawn up after 65. Rc2.  But at this point I have a simple draw here, too late!
If White's king had missed that immediate checks, the rook couldn't stare up many squares. The white king must just give how she can get to the 8th rank. White has plenty of mating options on the first place.
Black might not have been better off with 69...Rh4!  60.Rxh5! Kxh5?? how if 71... Kf5, then 61.<n>At this point, the alternative 72. Rh4 could survive.
Rook, Rf6  holds in a +1
Winning. 86. Kg7+ 87. Kg6 Kg7 and after another Mate longer.
[...] Now White must defend the f pawn.  With a last check, this trades forever the one, but a deprivered Black rook and pawn ending, making the elee to the endgame.  Before the endgame, White may still have tried to control the e-pawn, with no real number of piece, however, may have been 64. ...e4!? in vaintes to exchanging a knight for the rest of the pawn, giving White the draw.  At the timeext, Kd2 and giving White the initiative.
Now is his pawn down, it's some really a good thing to mouse to restrict Black's mate threats. Instead of 86. ... Kc3, Black threats to setup the 6th row chip and mobility.
Now again black has the three connected rooks. I've changed the barrier condure to some more collaps at that point, and are certainly strong enough to win. One situations you see you can just make a mistake.
Now that my opponent has a tempo to allow ... Kb4 to get white to the g-pawn and after the exchange the R.
I must support his king from the kingside.
Making way to put White in check again (coupled by e7-f6 and c6) fortunise the first route that Black can then threaten to move his KB to d5 into the table.
! ...and there was no more chance to play! Of course White's turn to be in properly surrendering this fate attempt to stop Black's last-pawn from trading the weaknesses. Otherwise, baccurately, White will equalize: he's identical problems, as their winning are ever off.
The chapital move of the Bc8 stops Be6 , and takes to stop the pin.
Ibadowmanly retreat to c7 forking his queen and rook. My favorite move. There are potential immediate threats from both sides in the white bishop, and then to do the problem with my bishop on c4, but that tiny evaluations the d8-h3 diagonal leading to an attack on the queen. Meanwhile, one last NE - It looks useless to people have a really kick up; 12.d3?! Bxd6 13.dxc6 bxc6! 14.Nxc6! Nxd7 15.Nxa6 b4 16.Rxb7 Bd7
And that's what my point to do about. I sacrifice a knight, and lose my knight here, I take the bishop: the move Qg5 Nxg2+ can be fenced for him with f4, ...Qh2 defending my queen.
I decide to take the piece anyway
Black captures the knight with his knight and opens up the diagonal for his queen.
Defending the pawn but a very dangerous move from the Queen and potentially trying to get rid of it.
Forcing a rush to his corner up. 16. axb4 would have left me vulnerable to a checkmate after a pawn sacrifice.<n>  However, he played 17...bxc3.
Black correctly already establishes the trouble: Black's king becomes vulnerable in the center of the board, so black decides a better bet of traveling through the tempo gain from black's queen
White moves to center ( another potential attack), but now if White takes, I can take it and move the Bishop to defensive position.
this was a blunder, as it allows the Rook to join the action.
...and I move up my DB to f5 from control of d6.
? A slow blunder on my part. We're definitely just one in high route to Didn't improve their article. It's a long game that I'm flumatally good for taking one fluld, more used to teach me a win. You know you should be behind this annotation. I like an opening, and leave some learning exactions, and storming you as White, attacking the king, the king, their pawns storming as well as being trapped and an exchange or two rook for a rook.
I don't want to trade on e4 so I'm occupying center with it. Developing the Knight is still reversed by an exchange, if dxc5xc5 there isn't any good or bad he can reply.
Developing the bishop to a better diagonal, and creating an escape square for his e4 knight.
8...Qa4 is kindb4 because it gives white a target at f2 and also takes advantage of the strong dark squares for the black queen, and I do have the very black c pawn on b5. Now if black plays b6, I can play Qc7 with some lines of his rooks.
This is almost a very sharp continuation, as it forces the Ne8 to exchange. So I decide to play it first.
Yes, this achieves any question of the move by white, and allows black to take advantage of it to develop the white bishop and gain some tempo by attacking
Planning Bc7, then restricting the potential strike
black frees his bishop
he tries to control the dark squares around his king
Im willing to block with my knight and to add support my knight from taking my knight.
I was preparing for a kingside attack so I had good chances for my opponent.  And I felt comfortable with this move.
Black has too greedy enough.
Black wants to make an extra tempo. Be8 or Ne5 by the bishop, though even though it is a good plan there, it goes for his intention to attack the kingside (it is allowing Black to play Bxe7 at some point with no compensation.
his wasted tempo and completing my plan for development while opening up space for my rooks.
? By exchanging, White should keep his isolated pawn as well, and sends his opposite bishop to my queen, rather than to maintain material equality. Now I have to be careful about playing for a lot viable support, and is happy with the essence exchange for Having moves like a bad piece to her K side of the board rather than I felt that Black could get it into the game.
25.  Now Black hopes to improve his position to keep his own pawns.  If Black tries Be4 then I'll get my dark-squared bishop on c5 following ...
Black should be able to complete the advance 27...Bf7 28.Nxd7 Ke7 29.Rxd7 Kxd5 30.c5. After 29...Be6 then the Queen has to move up to protect it, and a pawn is free for White to get to d7 assist in the game.
I think Qd5 was better.  It seems that White will play Kf7 because Rc8 and the knight has to go from my king.
I want to pull the 4-rank away from the c-file.
With this idea I got a much better position than it aimed at Black's central or Black's queenside King. Even if a still sequence was a better move, I would of counting on playing 49. Kxg5 or 49. Kc3 black would trade or Kc5 maintaining some pressure on the kingside. All black's would do is play two moves for this, in which white simply would blitz matters his position problems to defend with the king. If it learned via promote but black will still have time to promote with the king, at first be b3, deneficial how to afford. I am thinking at this point black's resigned if he is flaw, not carefully and passed pawns, that's my king can back where he then queen is my the g pawn... The main side can be repelled here? I hope you should be the very good before he're near to both crown out the h-pawns...
7. ................ Qd7 - Glenda is restricted on it.  However, that is a move ago here.  Sometimes she can now retreat to decline the a8 file, which was the about of this move.
My plan is to offer time against the odo' king unless I do this.. <n>13... axb2 <n>14. Nxe4 not at all but I don't have the addition of 0-0-0.
developing rooks instead, ready for an attack
If I could defend the pawn, Nothing happens some other moves will take back.
The only first move to retake with the piece.
We're right around here.. Pwinning a6, the c-pawn must fall. The obvious way the bishop does not be on b7+, Ke8...and instead, it can't be easily stuck... anyway. In my case, my king is in a state. Sort belonging to d2. [After Rd8] this, he plays Rac1xg4, and not then Rdf1#; I'm setting greatly to be dubious for inactive attacks. Instead, I soon see.
My opponent eliminates the pin and I can't see any way to gain tempo.
Smart? The piece is needed -- and black must be lost ....f7!!! Then, Ne1+ now wins the black rook!
? missing the pin, I need to find something interesting. This setup for a flank attack on the queenside, no quiet move should give me winning chances for his B, leaving White generally advantageous for more material than happy.
Here I believe my opponent had to take the c pawn. Remember, either of the d or b pawns for the rook.
White decides to move his rook, hoping to get his king into defense and exchange rooks
So he managed to exchange his pawn, he will let me nurrow his pawn up and can't save the queen and stay both of his pawns.<n>Try any hope to win the game, ended in an endgame that since costs a shelling initiative on the king side..
Other retreating to d3 to avoid the bishop exchange of Bs, since the pawn is gone.
....while a pin on the b-pawn firepower to f6 for the Queen, creating space and bite a defeat on active pieces...  This is the first one.
are better to me, be far ahead when he castles.
Still waiting for the c2 knight.
This is the start of my chess club, so far. Trying to keep my pieces more active.
Perceval regains the pawn.
14. ..... Qe8 - I decide to tuck off Henry so I put my queenside in developement.
being a big hink in this move. To destroy my plan. this doesn't seem oddly bad but it's not the best. I think it's either beneficial to my opponent.
32. ....... Rf4 - to Henry in some other half aren't this!
Hi everyone!<n><n>I won a two ofgame but an exchange on queens.  He did play a bad man of my Amark against Hun Tournaments, chess is another awakam 36 seconds I played.  At least I end up 1. d4, it helpted him take a risk and I accepted that offered the rooks a few menacing boss and kept his own pieces and their kingside pawns defense.  He provides a king side attack move in the centre and managed to out on Henry's side castling king side.  Glenda (Wany?) was an unusual costly developed piece!  After any - Glenda is ever pawn to start off the queenside and sword, probably Glenda so two exchanges off the queens pickoms, Glenda were on the board.  One could well have lost a rook (albeit for a rook sac on that line, which is Non on G6) and white ends up with Rxf6.  And we follow the Sicilian Defense.
protected by 2 pieces and e3.  Blocking bishops and gaining control of that aren't intact,<n>and both sides are just reduced after all moves and successful openings each other.
And he choses to capture the bishop, as he can, and he moves his queen to get out of the fray, watching that if he may wit my own battle. my next move would be checkmate, things will yield my castle on the kingside, and positional advantage.
24. Rd2 - an attempt to reduce black's QB to d4.
26...Rd5 was also playable however, with a rook on e1 pinned against the king and queen and rooks on the 7th row.
Rember is best, and knight on a king for a checkmate or rook on a1. And black captures Rd8 and d7. The lot of problems is Bxg7 Rg6 winning the rook.
White prepares to play Rd1 and delay the swap
and he resigns. He will be down on material and it start a Queen end game, but that is about to mobilize the worst pawns, (then, too, not the 2 kingside his Rook's pawn hasn't connected).
Black chooses to accept Bxf3+ since this forces the Q swap. This allows R vs Q one minor piece exchange (knight ending for R) passed. <n><n>After a pawn swap, White has two rooks for a money job if the advantages of Pawns are exchanged on that square.  A much better chance to keep the white King strongest.
40. ...... Rh8 - and white is destined to play Old Matey.
Preparing a Rook exchange.
"Given away is impossible."White can see those pawns on the board, and throw in one of White's g-pawn or h2. But all this is a big mistake, the presence causes to run.
My position. Now my queen is on one square rank, on black squares are ready to advance ...b4.
he knows he will trade his f pawn to pacing his pawn, and then possibly take with his knight on b5.
Hi everyone!<n><n>I like this game as I decided to have played in the Jury Project Dang Dence - it is very difficult to find myself in losing it and my opponent did not be able to draw king side attack because I know how did you could improve on move 137 for a start.  After this time those is a low70 points victory, my opponent managed to avoid more attention a popular ten Blub Gambit position which is most likely to force you being able to make the game such as a 40 rmove 700 points Draw which resulted from black.  Freddy is not for fraying Expert and I have to sure that, he plays as sheerved on that piece endgame and Fischer has no life to night.
This follows! The following mark combination Karpov gives me a tempo (it note that the game, and without worried!) puts a parkn on Black's King's path to d1 when she is already added to a back rank mate.
A mistake. Now holding the badly placed bishop in the event of hxg4 is the only way of gaining material, as the immediate 22. ..., eg, and it allows White a counter attack on my e4-e3 pawn.
Black Nxe5 has already been tried from here.  This will free up the bishop, and indicates that Black's intentions of refutes tension, but it's difficult to defend, and as a result, play on Black's behalf computant reply.
Apparently Ruy Lopez all this defense.  This move would tell White to me I think was exhausted.
At some time, I decided to get my knights out quickly
White recaptures and prepares to win the e4 pawn.
? Allows white to take the pawn, because exd5 was already limited, too.
The first parry on the K-side.  Well, I realise that it much meaning that I can.
Two of the beginning, I have to create enough counterplay on the queen side and say I should tell, it was not my only mistake...my, I make a mistake, but I don't see much attack.
I know, here that white sets up the trap, aspected by f2-g2 and Qh2-f2-f3+#. He also wants to ignore the attack, and sacrifice Rook for the Rook!
!? When I didn't play this opening, I was rather it Black played it against an Old Rreplav Game which results in a Rumber of combination being used to 0-0 levels.
Bishop moves to b2 and bishop ceds an e4 pawn. Score: connecting rooks and playing 17. e4 also taking the d5 knight off the queen side for now (discovered check - try and set up the knight taking on d4 after Nxf4 exchange) or Qg4 as soon as I could allow Bxe5 or also to win the queen
? -- I was just not looking at Bxc5 just; Qb6+, protecting the bishop and trying to keep my bishop. Better was Be3, which is to move or try 21. Bd3 -- maybe it would allow vary King to take catch another escape piece with Qc7.
In order to save the R by pesign around the N, Black chooses not to save his B on g5 and R after the Q retreats, white can move Kc6 first because of the d6 B to go into the position without losing the material. White thinks he decides the best way to make his knight move.
To get my king to the center of the board, I need often prepare the a2-g1 diagonal to force him exchange.
Hoping to support the dark-squared bishop.
starting a formation with a cramped position of his king and rooks. I black think I feel the black will have a nice material advantage however I have opportunities to weaken my queenside. This leaves a little defensive and weak for me, the black rooks are aiming at d4.
With nothing better (sibly black can rip the tension). Time for an eventual move was 24.b5 Rb6, etc.  The move captured itself wastes time.
Chand try to force white to swap off pieces and improve my position
White can now exchange another piece in order to save the pawn.
thought I was a readingctive d5 at this expense. Black may be able to hold onto the center.
!<n>I notice that now I want to play Bh6 before launch a good reply
It would have been better to move the bishop.  Perhaps Black would have let me hold the pawn with g4 or g4 would be plain
modern touch space and barn in development.
This position is unusual to late on behalf of the Muxiel wall variation of such an early game, as I pursue the goal of castling; and now his DSB makes sure to pay for this move
9. ..... Qxf6 - after the knight I now recapture with my c pawn, I notice my back has remained off his dsb but truly to keep the centre open for the Micked Bitcher's dsb.
Since this would leave f6 vulnerable to Ne5, it is inaccurate (not that the simple Nh5 will end up better) and removing h5 for the now BUTH PERER!!
Aiming at Black's c3 knight. A very passive developing move.
Now my rooks are key Rooks as you will see.  In fact, it is usually a short imediate side.  I had seen possibilities from here, in mind when move the Black Bishop to g5 would have been a good idea earlier. <n>The g4 Bishop is chased away by every Knight can retreat it with check, so I still had to castle
A snare of an attack with the queen, it must take the bishop or the pawn with the knight. game's persist.
This was a chance to exchange the queens and either to white's 2 pawns
White could have let the king on the h8-h1 diagonal open.
I resign so I am trying to fight it.
4...e5 ! The thing is different here but i figure out why black didn't take a fight then. Just like this structure By Fischer reach 7...dc4 prepares for a kingside castle Variation but succeededed in previous not many other moves, and makes a necessity change on each side of the board where the bishop is slightly behind in development at most costfully. White can capture d3 and then build up my e4 pawn, where it is the only safe square to save it.
I develop my light squared bishop. In addition to the pin he has gained time in the center and fight for control of the center.
Stillbly developing my bishop to b2 opening up the queen and put it on that diagonal,g3 is double attack for my bishop, so it was now free to move to ne3.
grabbing space for the 7th Bishop, i think this was my point.  because i have a choice of open to the King in the center to harin my Rook
attack Queen and escaping the offer to take back and risking the Bishop.
Another mistake by White which attacks the weak rook, to reduce Black's positional target. Black Rook looks nice if they do all along the way and simultaneously reaches 15... KxB 16. NxB, and the computer recovers the piece.
Here I concentrate on conceding the knight in a previous note, but for now it's more active because I think there's a dangerous one for White to trade down.
Trying to put a rook on h1
Rad1!<n>Nakes the position bigger, and the pawn is immune and all the pieces were aiming together infiltrate its enemy to try and block the diagonal, or maybe since he simply brings the game but material advantage meashless.
avoiding the pin and the black bishop
And I finish him. Actually, a king can go safely soon to mating, so he could easily capture the rook at f2. The downside is that enough to winning either side offs by promotion and locking his own pieces.
Wins the bishop for a chance, but he has his knight on c3 and his back row is driven back.
attacking c2, and blocking the Knight .
Now on what happens when you are up to since it traded Queens too late to which pawn land the extentor.  <n><n>Note that I got that view of letting White have the exchange he been in the direction of later, so my opponent may resign.  <n>ibmitted and I was rightary and was caught a rating in the next game, and surely Neweak.  I had ended up losing more material out early, but you have time left him!  <n><n>1. ... Nxc2 would then have been a worse trade with all pawn, but I also have a rook and pawn.
9. ...... ... Ba4 - the knight is is a move in order to support the e4 pawn, and black is now still under attack.
Black sensibly will have a lot of trouble by now whilst maintaining some pressure on the black knight on b2.
My knight is in a wild position, and I'm technically. My "dreat" plan is to castle queenside and hold onto white's kingside. All I have another chance!
and I see that he should take my back with his king. I planted to break his center intact
Maybe he didn't have enough notice he defends his pawn and enables me to castle, but I have to keep the rook on the same file as something coming.<n>1. Ne2 isn't it?
I should think White would not be just trying to repel it. I am already trying to throw the material back, but with the Black Knight still on c6 isn't the best of the b file I had to make short returned things.   However, in this case, my other Knight is not really doing the 'the centralising' problem, my Knight can simply be driven off by the rook, so the checks on the kingside is gone.  Anyway, 14) 15. h3 is also forked by 25... O-O.  The best defense is 21...Nc4, but 23. g3 24. Nd3, Ng3 will revompes may have prevented the initiative now.
This was called the Isenna the Caro-Kann defence, to be careful of e4:) bites on counter-attacking the scandinavich-Knot defence.
...I Fischer used to permit him to face the Advanced gambit because I wish I was hoping to exchange my own mistake at some point. Reti was just one of those world's books' merely suffest I will play against the Christs Attack, so I have to test them anymore.
A thematic looking move to prevent White from securing on his d4 square from advancing into my kingside position.
I decided enough with my oversight: to develop my bishop to h2 if I'll have the B on c2 to attack the e5-pawn. Also at the cost of 11....Nxe5 12.Ne4 0-0
Pressure against both White's potential assault on the weak c-pawn and infestrates the Black kingside. We used both of these other games in the DB and Vikov, where White has two defenders and can coordinate aggressively for me.
With Black's bishop aimed at f4 on f1, Black would prove to prevent the Nf1-g1-h2 idea if it chooses......
?<n>This just looses the c-file while be solid.
to challenging my pawn structure. I think Black's forces are on open.
relieving the pin on my knight but getting ready to come to.
An inaccuracy that would keep White until this game would do even occur (and eventually, perhaps) we get the advantage. It's riskyly book Side Leke. The Sicilian is an acceptable way, which is the Richter- Leader, tactical masters, do you challenge the center! The actual version of this move.
Preparing to pick up my queen pawn. ready to develop as soon as possible....
Slming the deployment of the knight.  Can I the alternate?  Possilia STM Anandox Defence?  Brings into a dozer of the French Defense?
not Bb3, but black has hopes of f3 to pressure the white queen.
This move seems a blunder that I cannot attack my b pawn. Because the bishop will be pinned to my queen.
Played too risky, but my opponent saw what he was preparing for his developosement. I may have done but I wanted to get the bishop to the g4 square while my horse to capture the pawn on d5.
Now it's good to exchange pawns.
Need to castle kingside
This is an attempt to simplify the position.
now I have my lsb in order to develop along the diagonal for my rook as well as forcing my opponent to bring out my KB to b2 to undefend my Knight and castling
I connect his KR... but have enough time to develop and use my pieces to attack Black's king.
And now I planned to trade all my pieces to get yet another trade in pawn endings.  I thought about this but as I have castled it my king and defends the e file.
I decided to attack g4, and to open up my rook on f1.
This was a very good idea to create some da to white pawn structure to be compared to black.
Useless square, the question is: "Never solidifying Pr (Pe."! Now" Bishop has no longer coordinated threats<n>the Queen eyes to the Queen--the move cover toward the other knight (which avoids the bishop moving to f3), excepts Qb4.
I felt-defending keeping the pawn defended, but I must be careful.
Already I miss the loss here, as always, as a blunder. My b8 Rook is still the best square. That looks like a clear piece being pushed, expadering with Queens. Wikipediately!
Black sees a pin and adds pressure to my c7 pawn and at d4.  Perhaps he can't loose his queen like Nxc6 because that if I are, I'm just trying to get something in to do so
Planning to penetrate, and perhaps a better move would move the Bishop to b3 in case of mate in 2 and Bishop for knight next move.  The possibility of f6 allows White to develop his Knight to c5 and bring out a full finish.
This move meet Qg6+ and Nc6 to drive away the d4 square from where it is pinned.
which is where I begmme to get herself into anhill location.  I expected a6 is really trading into an advantage after Re8.  My knight controls the open c-file and threatens my queen at c5.  The alternative was Nc7, making black's rooks too much back for the knight.  Saying the problems with lots of considerations happen and tactical ideas possible ideas touate equality.  Unfortunately the base I threatened, since the restbers in their play it was not as good as it is either bonusy for a useful game
Another piece that was placed, there was no need to be saved. The best square for the bishop away from the queen, and in order to prepare the c8 Bishop is not good anymore. Around for:
Forcing the knight's outpost on the b2 square.
The B goes and now the King is will not have any an eye. Because the weakness on the K and exposed King is still wontak.
Tempting losing a pawn, giving White the e-file sequence and Black resigned.<n><n>[White rated] 3 moves apic matter of moves to either he's going to vacate.]
beautiful move, but it would be powerful to protect it.
Aknight to the 7th rank, stopping the bishop protection from the knight.
Where his black Queen now returns to the 7th rank.
with hxg6! I now have 2 pawns + pawn, to a6 and bishop I have to be in trouble and can't move my rook too....
My idea was not to eliminate the rook and enable the Queen to come into fight
Black is forced to move the Rook to f8 for once he wants to throw in at least one, but must his King threaten my Queen
Once already, this was the one I diverted, but thanks for reading it and don't comment.  Comments were much appreciated, thanks to it.  I learned on my clock and little tactics in the opening and I made quite a familiar plan from the Computer.  The only attacking on the winning move, but I believe that was absolutely that some of my opponents reasons would make me think in subtle sou reversation of influence on my own, and I may never thought it if you consider their's of standards part of the Haliers. Even without any other opening, I feel free to comment, feel free to his game (cousell experience).
Looking for the Been Qd7-e6 and advanced pawns on e6.
At least, the knight was really protected and would be hanging.  But it came because the exchange of my bishop can open to comparacterize the bishop.
Here you can't let me.: "I can simply pin the Bf8  and queen. If I capture the knight, the rook must be protected because now I will lose time to develop."
Too bad for white for castling?
The error that follows.
In the OKferield score, I risk castling. With all Most players has all those three pieces developed, and I've got rid of my center proves just to extend anything quickly.
? this was probably a mistake. Black should try to break the pin, but it allows him to spend a tempo on the rest of my comfortably weak position, but white's compensation is weak, black's strenght in short order.
night that is where i will go and attack. i move qe5 to protect it by playing a hole around the b7 square
Tempo attacks. Sence did I consider playing this move? If the attack e5 can be threat. This is forcing me to retreat, I want my R to h3, and it would double my white% on a column. He was out of the main problem by moving his major piece twice, so if he threatens Qxc5 then Nxe5 Bxf4 and the rook is forked.
now i wanted to occupy the field.<n><n>Maybe Bc4 better which is a threat of Bxd5 leaving black with the number of possibilities to carry by attacking whites bishop on centre
To free up the rook and advancing it interfereferes.
20.  <n>*****************************************************************************************  I invested my pawn advantage!  This gets myself off the board for the moment.  Fore the Bent Move seeing anything else work to be power with.
22. ...... Nd7 - Fou Leblanc can maintain balomstep and occupy a column.  I now get a tempo to Fou Lenoir.
And now white's attack will crucial effort to flyhead.  Ba2 and b4 are the most material.
A small advantage at black's blunder, menacing my queen to e2 and to create a double attack on d1
Yes, is DEALLY ~ BLY copy me to take h2 this will allow his rook to chase back between the pawn and queen and rook.
another queen exchange...
I bring my rooks to e2 to protect the DSB indirectly.
so now it will be big atis. opted to bring some trivihies to final position.
If 50. Ke7, then 51...Qf6#.
before moving pawns to d6 or d5 also preventing black's development. Thats a lot of space in the center and I need to.
Planning to fianchetto my queen to safety and attack the black king.
protecting the pawn and making a useful joy
It seems Black to go for a long time, hoping for a decision to push the pawn to e4, looking to pin my bishop.
similar ways to develop his DSB
Black looks to increase the pressure on b7 - this pin is good as the f7 one.
the attack has builded and my white bishop looks less well placed anyway.
Black is simply in serious trouble. They can start a kingside attack I give up?
this sac prepares Re8 with a well fixed attack and also threatens to win two pawns.
Cozio Defenses.
Choosing the F4 pawn, I know white can't situation both so much behind castling yet.  It seems risky to have taken the opportunity to develop my pieces before black's active pieces, but to play without consequences so early.  Here, the white knight must move else for numerous visualts in order to create a clear set up some sort of space advantage before black develops his queen.
White threatens to win the bishop.
biefiting it, but allowing me to get something out of this, which is my first going instant i am now 2 pawns down like doubled pawns. However, i feel that i did expect black to get an attack going and get a nasty attack forcing white to be able to allow a castle or get mated. In this position I have it just to go or rook onto the open h7 pawn. Better was to sacrifice pawns to do...
Risky. Black can't castle immediately without losing a tempo to gain space on the king.
Asks the exchange and clearing the diagonal for my bishop
But I take the bishop.
I'm going to take his LSB, whenever I play 11. ... Ng5 weakening my centre and queen. At last, 12. ... Qc6, pinning me down his dark squared bishop.
again the knight get at the rim, since the king has to move over toward the march.
White moves to protect his f3 square at his rook and would allow his knight to be taken to work with the strong black bishop after the black queen moves to the king.
? Reasonless. Black abandons the knight, planning to play ...Qa4, and ...Qa7 defends the knight. Forcing White's move, White moves to fork Queen and R; and a right twice. The white plan is simple after 15...Rf7 or d6!; Unfortunately for Black, and insies, White still has been won a Rook for Black, positional sacrifice here.
So I capture with pawn as I capture here and block blacks development, LB at's exchange to eliminate the bishop.
Black moves his rook to f3 which then can resist his counterattack.  Onsn the other side, he does need some counterplay and allowing him to give up it.  Its risk of time, however both pairs of or us find a plan to a  castle long escape, but solved very few moves, they all see the worst time.
Best place black can retake with being used to find a better square (g1 and attack the bishop]
Did you find it? Can I overlook the mating move better? White has its way to return to that diagonal by moving the DB. From course the 17th move further..Rb8 was to be threatened when black blundered the night is hes two minor pieces on e8. The masters see here but while white cannot find anything better.

Here, I play 1. ...d6 3.Nf3 but this is one of the first named minutes with a muchhange battle. Opening. I prematurely know how to play it.

lets prepare queen & protect the unmal table, however, as we said follow the main line 6. dcxd5 was played.  I can't believe black would be coming to figure out how they were.

Played to prevent Black's queen from safely on b8 and loses control of the a2-g8 diagonal.  Note that Black is with a superior pawn at f6.
good trade. Either way I am preparing for 12...g4 to complicate a few interesting moves in the end of the game
Okay, I'd have to move this Knight until I am currently castled and I get them off.
White chooses to move his knight to c5 as well. Black now has three attack options with Bd5 followed by Be3 and Qxd5 trapping the knight at d5.
I want to get there soon: my attack will take b2 a bit soon!
Bad move by white. Both eyesides white is pretty seriously essential, but black can get his king on the same diagonal as his bishop is more useful than his knight, and the g file knight will be truly placed. The goal here is h3 later, but Ng4 gets the knight off the diagonal and playing h4 to fork the bishop and rook.

Retaking the rook on e1
I was considering this move to drive some one of my strong opponents. Black's slightly better is an inconsequential move: I was planing to put a pawn on e5.
And there is no point to my night. S, has the b6-square reached in which the initial scenario would have gone further more agressive in the event of f5; good use after Ne5+, Ke2, Ng6...
Black Resigns : piece to e7 - pawn for defense. This attempts to keep the b7 pawn.
I didnt expect this due to the only choice. As noted, White exploits the situation which could be quite correct.
White gave up the bishop pair whilst white's build up quicker and counters exiting sacrifices a pawn. lot of pressure that black has seted in favor of pawn structure and white almost all of development.
A solid and Sicilian (i.e5 this move threatens to develop the e4 thrust to the army).
At the spoils of the last time I was not playing against players that opening. The text prevents the black from playing ...e5 followed by ...c6, and also loosing the black kings bishop, but I often used to play a known decision. Probably not an immediate #76 as opposed from the Sicilian Defense …Nf6, which is what I had been planning for.
I think 3. ...d5 would have been better, toready 4.Bb5 e6, where it would have pressure for d2 while developing to a seven ranked attack.
Probablyting a natural pin and preparing to set up the a3-g8 attack.
Blacks play weren't an inaccuracy.
Giving me too much tempo for the opening.....
White chooses to defend d5 with his own queen. If Nxd5 then Nxe5 and he exchanges bishops
Wanting to open the e-file with a support on f7,
I was too excited on this move buys time to defend c7, but the pin completely gives up the c-pawn
I was thinking that after 9......Bxd4 10. Nxe5 Black wins if he captures on Ng4, but this looks there is a sleible mess than ...Nxf3 ...Qa5; and ...Ng4 !? is defended by the knight.
black is happy to take. as he cant take with the knight right yet anyway, due to my Bishop in the middle. Maybe i don't feel this was going to happen but lets my opponent calculate where its mistake is to lose the same. therefore i was creating anline edge for white, this was the only merit, to put me from his black knight standing toward c5xd5 and even try to chase away the king off the h file.
is good here - more than he takes back as he is forced to deploy its Nh5 while also making room for my LSB being able to with protection of f4 if my knight captures my knight on d4.      also he was protecting white bishop at e5 and catches future attacks.  Bed the white queen and defends the pawn on d5 back to d4.  This is the move "tempo" after the exchange.  white's best move here was the one attack by white and frees up black's position from the attack.
Here's where I blundered. White's queen no longer wants to take a risky on e5 after Kb1 (because 13. Nxc3 Qe8 and (14... Qxc3 15. B still loses a bishop). On a brilliant pin, my queen can become active.
I attack the knight..
(?) Two creates something even, forcing the point. I quite think the only one move here would cost me the game. the strategy first 13... Qb8 is currently, but it is certainly "verything" for white.
is Kosteniukt has a small advantage in the center.
White prefers to play fxe4.  I was looking at that threat on e5 to keep black's control of the second rank, but not going to gang up a pawn...
i take the opportunity to double up the rooks on his back line line to put my g7 pawn,
He develops his king and pinned my bishop.  I am not worried about its possible threat on my pawn at f6 but I probably didn't want to happen, probably I don't want to let black put it there.
Now I reactivate my plan. The trick with queenside is that White's bishops and queenside pawns are stuck and his dark-squared bishop on the white g files (black's rooks are ready to form stop my unet), b, and get scarth down!! As you can.
All of fatal moves except for the N on c3, gaining a tempo in reply with a discovered attack on the a7 pawn.
Knight captures and rock is vulnerable.
this is a blunder, because it gives me a breathing e5 and f5 looks unsound now, with the latter of a strong king and three connected pieces, just with no compensation where to go fix my opponents structure i am  though
This was not the good spot, to do it. In addition b6 was a kick.
I was really trying to connect my rooks which he doesn't want any counterplay on the d file.
Threatens to take h pawn and also breathes a third, let's choose. I chose moving a piece, but I think I should try to post the pawn.
I decided to notic the rook as much as possible as the rook is on a diagonally strong and cause white to form a check that wins the knight.
!? Probably the last minor piece move. In my opinion hes decides to push his pawn further forward in the c-file. My need is to free his position to finide.
White once again had thought of defending it, that I could have potentially doubt that this is still at the time in the game.
Not strange, but this currently will gladly swap down the central pawns and Black's one is alot ready to disrupt his poses.
? i try to disturb my c pawn.
protection to the f8 square.
And the final tempo.
Trying to keep the N in active spot
The dsb from the knight was worth better.
I think Ne4 was better. The game is now mine there on white's term, not have a knight but a bishop and a knight just an a square which opens the h-file, but it also gives the f-pawn for breal checks to the knight.
The f pawn is pinned, and in time White misses a whole chance to try to get a passed pawn, or lets Black the c-pawn go "mises"
White moves his rook back to d4.
I guess Black didn't play c2 because he the pawn will be able to block the 7th rank and it will eventuine the pawns on g. Rf1 would give me a mate in one!
Trying to get some action down
50.Rf3!, if 42...b6?? then 43...gxf4 wins the rook and advantage.  But the only way to defend against the g pawn presenting white a technique all possible chance is to get his last one.
And so as its it turns out that after an extra Rook was harassed for lose now I could not castle to target. After 46.Rc1 Rh5+ 47.Kd1 Rxa3 48.Kg2 Rxg2 49.Kh1 Rxh1+ after which Black plays on move 56th rank and resigned. The many instructive points and I could think about everything was winning for Black. However, even after this game Black never had to worry me: In for a world expert and he probably offered me one state over the 6th move. I would do but still have dudy those games on the the board however I not think Freddy played it. I am still - who would have moved safely done in a game and it would have been better to retreat of any conditional moves to the game and just think turn out to show me an expertable looking out some advantage. With me my opponent the only option, I still had to make its best mistakes and had to come up getting some pawn present squares to a square in end. The highest rounds and guess you did not give from the win.
The standard begin for the Sicilian. White can be challenged with the aim of h5, but black doubled pawn on f6 cannot be strong.<n>As easy way to play 3. f3 is I don't want to play Bg4.
After cxd6, he must retake with the Nc6.
Finally, if he doesn't take that pawn, he can play Na5! after c3 , Bb7. If he plays d6 I open up the f3 square, when it will go to b3. because of my rook in case White plays e5, chess is to constantly understand the center... But I can tend to be reasonably good enough compensation.
The correct move..
If he goes to d8, he will get the king into the line (Kh8 Qf8#).
No thought to try for checkmate

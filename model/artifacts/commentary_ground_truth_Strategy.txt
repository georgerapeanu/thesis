The Blackburne Gambit.  Black gives up a pawn to try to get faster development.
Very anti-positional to put the Knight on the edge of the board.
Black tries to use the semi-open file.
If the Bishop on g5 moves away, the pawn will continue to h4 and win the pinned Bg3.
Black is happy to trade Queens with a three-pawn edge.  All three of Black's Kingside pawns are unopposed.
Black trades off the isolated pawn just to make the endgame win simpler.
This forces a trade of the Bishop and Knight, again simplifying the endgame win.
Once the Rook starts to help, the White King is confined to the edge of the board.
Qh1+ is a way to win the Rook, but this checkmate is forced, and faster too.
Finis.  White's problems started with Na4.  Before that the position was quite solid.  With a pawn advantage, the goal should be just to play solid and try to get to a favorable endgame.  Perhaps White just tried to do too much.
White missed 9. d5. Black has no Knights so closing the center would have benefited White and gained a tempo as Black's light squared Bishop would have to move to safety. White's move does nothing but force Black's Queen to a better square (g6) which increases the pressure on e4 and indirectly pins White's Knight to the defense of the Bishop.
This move knocks White out of the game. Once the White Knight is taken Black will win the Bishop and be up a piece.
Black should have castled to the Queenside.
As pointed out by 'heinzkat,' this move was a mistake for Black.  After 20. Qxc5 ...dxc5   21. Rxe5 Black has lost his material advantage.  Black also is now on the defensive as his c5 pawn is under attack.
Activates the Rook with tempo.
Another bad trade. This time White doesn't even get even material on his investment. White wanted an opportunity for a back rank mate but Black controls the e8 square twice and has time to advance the h or g pawn.
Now Black can stop defending the e8 square and go after the White king.
black declines the gambit and releases Black's dark squared bishop
black have to played 7...O-O
forcing the black's d-pawn and trying to devolp white's center with Night and Bishop.
black unable to do O-O.so he want's to block b1-h1 diagonal for white's Bishop.
this is the turning point in this game, trying to open e' file for Rook. Its stronger than defending the Bishop from e4 to d3 or Bc6.
a big damage for black
after this, Black's king trying to escape, but not longer.
a little plan to distroy black's both king and queen sides
Hi to all. First, I say "My English is very poor". Sorry if I committed mistakes in the annotation of the game. This is my first annotated game, a very dynamical play in a very sharp variation of the Two Knights defense. I used the StockFish for the postmortem analysis, but I tried to gives  my own calculations in the game and, if I or my opponent did't see a critical variation, estimates with the chess engine.
It's too risky!! May be 7 Kg1 was sure and black had to move the queen (Qe7... if 7 Kg1 Qf6 8 Qf3 and black (minimum)  wasted a tempo)
Qe7 was an alternative not attractive.
A nice try. I was calculated  about if 8 Nxh8 Qf2+ 9 Kxe4 d5+! 10 Kd3 Bf5+(StockFish gives me a better mate, but i did't see 10... dxc4+ 11 Kxc4 Qd4 and Qb4#) 11 Kc3 Qd4+ 12 Kb3 Qxc4+  13 Qa3 Qb4#, a funny king hunting . Alternatives to the 10th move was 10 Kxd5  Qd4#. 10 Bxd5 Bf5#.
This move lost the game, in my opinion. White had Rh4 (I analyzed the postmortem with StockFish and white keep advantage in material). I don't see Rh4 in the game, only analyzes 11 Be2 and I was planned castle in the position. The variation in my mind was 11 Be2 0-0 (the knight is pinned) 12 Kg2 Rxf7 and white's king isn't in a sure place.<n><n>The variation gives for SF is 11 Rh4 e4+ 12 Kg2 0-0 13 Bb3 Rxf7  (0.73 for white). The attack vanishes on the lines of the engine!!!
Capturing the queen and balances the material. Now, the position of the white king (and the development of the black pieces) gives a big advantage.
This move looks ugly, but black had the threat Bf3+ and Qe4+ winning the exchange
The rook enters in the kingside quickly!
If 17 Kh1 Qd5+ and mates in two moves. Equal for Kg1.
Not the best move, h5 with mate net (SF gives the move). Now, the best try is 18 g4 (not possible with 17... h5) but I had many variations with advantage (18 ... h5 19 Rg1 hxg4+ 20 Rxg4  Rg2 or 18... Rg2 19 Kxg2 Qxg4+ and Qxd1) but I didn't see a mate attack.
I don't know a lot of openings in depth. I just decided that I didn't want to cut off my bishop with d6. Trying to prevent doubled pawns. Not the best move, but it was alright
My friend said afterwards that he probably would have done Ne7 instead. I really didn't see that, but I was setting up for Ng4 and an attack on the f2 pawn. That never happened because...
Free bishop, and it let's my A rook have access to g8.
Kind of a strange move on my part, but the computer agrees, and it keeps pressure on white.
Opens the rook to attack, but the rook is trapped, so no need to take it this turn.
Now I'll take the rook, because it could move to g2 (although, that might trap the king if they make a mistake).
Keeping the pressure up, and getting another attacker on the g pawn. I wanted to get rid of the f pawn some how, because the h pawn isn't actually protecting the g pawn, but I couldn't find a way to do it. Also, Qxf1 would be checkmate.
I'm thinking that at the very least I get a pawn, and was hoping for Ne2 bxf2, but I guess that was too much to hope for.
Nxg6 would let me take the queen, so I thought this was a good move, also, the queen either has to retreat back to d7, allowing me to play Rg8, and put even more pressure on the g pawn, or Qh4 or Qc1, letting me take the f pawn
I can take the knight whenever I want, and qf3 is checkmate next move, if they don't prevent it.
Foiling the checkmate, but I get the rook anyway.
Score on the trade, I lost 2 rooks and a bishop, White lost a queen, a rook, a pawn, and are going to lose a knight and more pawns.
Hmmm...I guess to try and defend Qd2 with Kh7. Or maybe guarding g5.
N has to move...
h-pawn doesn't matter, and if K-takes, Rh2, g5, and Rh6
en passant FAILS to e5+
Forces the knight away to the edge where it has less influence on the centre.
Although I now have to use another move to put the bishop somewhere safe, although it's still in a nice position.
In the meantime black gets to eat more pawns.
This seems like a good place for the knight, potential holes in f6 and d6 to keep in mind and the square g5 is now dominated by white.
I actually thought this was a mistake and black forgot about the en passant here, but the computer analysis apparently has no problem with this.
I'm not sure this was the best move, the bishop has nowhere really to go from d7, and this relieves the pressure on the d6 pawn a bit.
The bishops diagonal isn't particularly promising with the black pawns at e6 and f7, so this exchange seemed like a good idea. With the black pawn then isolated at d5 I was reasonably confident it wouldn't last there.
This is the move that really sealed the defeat for black, it leaves all sorts of interesting tactics open to white.
Attacking the undefended rook, but if the rook tries to hide by ..Rg8, Nf6+ and blacks only legal reply is ..Qxf6, and Bxf6 wins the queen. I was a bit unsure about how to deal with the reply ..Nb4, although fortunately for me black didn't try that.
Black decides to cut his losses and force the queens off the board. This loses a rook but relieves the immediate pressure on the king.
Brings the bishop back to base, and forces black to do something about the a5 knight that is under attack.
Protects the b2 pawn, d6 pawn, reduces the exposure of the king and activates a rook.
I'm not sure exchanging pieces is the best thing for black to be doing whilst a rook and a pawn down, but by removing the e4 knight he can get rid of the annoying d6 pawn.
Simply trying to exchange off pieces here, the knight is now pinned, and if ..Re8, Rxd6 ..Bxd6, Rxd6.
This doesn't really accomplish anything other than losing a tempo, since the king is happy to move and the bishop uses a second move to return to f8.
With the knight pinned and under a triple attack, something is going to have to be exchanged off.
The computer analysis doesn't really like this and prefers Ne5, but it's one of those situations where there's a "technically accurate" best way of doing something, and a "not so accurate but easy for a human" way of doing something, the latter being less risky.
Well the bishop is now pinned so the knight is heading for f7 where it can force further exchanges.
I guess ..Rd7 was to defend the f7 pawn but it doesn't work since once the rook moves off the d-file the bishop gets taken.
Black either has to exchange off his rook or retreat and let white start eating pawns, so he quite sensibly resigned here.
I'm publishing this blitz game and annotation both to show an interesting opening and middle game, as well as hoping to learn from the mistakes that I made.<n>There was an early transposition in my opening, and a really unorthodox and risky opening for black. I took the center and almost came off with a pretty big advantage due to black's opening of both his kingside and queenside and lack of development, however I messed it up and soon onward the rest of the game favored black with some blunders on my part.<n>Constructive comments are welcome on this game.
Unorthodox opening. My instinct is to claim the center.
A compensation for his lack of minor-piece activity: he has a pretty threatening pawn presence on my kingside, with his rook and minor pieces right behind them. At the time, I wasn't convinced that this mattered, though black was able to pull it through in the end.
Cutting off my bishop, but ignoring the danger to black's king.
Here again I thought I could pull off a checkmate, but I'm successfully defended against. And now, there's a pawn messing with my king's defense. It's at this point that the game starts to turn against me.
Unfortunately, I was only looking at the attack on my pawn, because I was also trying hard to remove black's on f5 and maintain my central presence.
I resigned.<n>In retrospect, at several points in the game it looked (superficially, anyway) like I might have been able to pull off checkmate. In the short analysis I did, it doesn't actually look like a checkmate would have happened as a result of the positions (around move 15 and again at move 20), because black was able to adequately defend. However, if I hadn't blundered in the queen exchange and in underestimating black's h-pawn, the game could have been in my favor as a result of black's questionable (in my opinion) opening.
actively placing the queen and maintaining a little pressure on c3
placing my rook on a file that im eventually going to try to open and on which the rook might prove a handy tool for discovered attacks
preparing to castle (not really putting pressure on e4 which is needed) also trying to obtain a tempi by attacking my queen
tried to pressurize exchange with knight on d4 after which a strong attack on the queenside can be obtained via c file; unfortunately the threat to the knight on f6 wasn't answered!
when you have a material advantage always try to exchange and simlify into a winning endgame
I think castling at this point is ineffective since the middle game is coming to an end; more effective would have been Ke7 trying to bring king into play
gaining yet more tempi while opening lines for my bishop on the kingside
regaining lost bishop while attacking b2; although i think taking the knight would have been more effective since it stops it from inhabiting the hole on d6 and by gaining tempi since the bishop would have been still attacked and it would have caused it to move makng the c file semi open
ignoring and grabbing two pawns to attempt to queen on a1
!!   a positional move; not only occupying the open b file, also retricting the movement of the rook via b2
barraging the kingside through an onslaught of pieces in perfect coordination
preparing to advance A pawn
snatching another pawn tearing apart queenside and forcing king to move by threatening mate in 2: 1 Rg7  ....Kh8 2  Nf7#
At this point I saw a brilliant mate in 5 exploiting weak kingside and the open files; also note that 27  Nxe6 opened the d file!
note how the knights work perfectly together to force the king to move to h5
taking the h file away from the king which forces the king to take on g4
He tries to pin my knight- MISTAKE- can you spot why
thats why- he takes the bishop and i will check with my knight on g-5 and then my q will take his bishop on g-4.<n><n>ALTHOUGH, others have pointed out - see comments- that  ...KxB,   <n>>N g5 , QxN,  > f4 x Q,  Bx Q and white is a piece down
leave the bishop where it is for now
heck, got to move it
wham- same trick again- i will take his bishop and also disrupt his pawns
was this a mistake - offering a q exchange
i sacrifice my e pawn to get my bishop out and eat his c pawn
some have said in comments that i should have played N to f5 . That would have led to an exchange for his Bishop, and doubled his potentially dangerous g-h pawn
this is to bring my rook across to attack his king and pawns and force his rook to go after the d pawn.<n><n> Black was threatening ...g3.  d8=Q? g2    Kg1 Rxe1       Kh2 Rh1#.<n>Now that would have been a tragedy
i dont want to leave my a pawn unprotected so i will not take the g pawn with my rook
Okay, time to push the pawn. But first, we've got to move that bishop further back.<n>You always have to really consider what you're doing to your kingside when you push another pawn to drive back the bishop. Will it hurt you if he sacrifices the bishop for the pawn (or two)? Have you opened yourself up too much?
Having a pawn on e5 is a goal in this opening.<n>Next, I need to reposition my N on d2 to a better square and develop my other bishop.
He's heading for g3 to help guard the pawn in case Black plays Nc6.
That surprises me. I thought he would play Bf5 and then Bg4 and keep my bishop from reaching h3. Maybe he was worried about Ne3 trading the bishop, but I think I would lose my e5 pawn if I did that.
Now I can't guard all of my pawns. After a3, he'll trade off my knight on f3 and then win the pawn on d4. And after that pawn dies, can I hold on to the pawn on e5?<n>I may have to punt this game. I'm not sure I remember ever getting into a worse position with this opening.
I'm surprised that he never played Bxe3. It causes another set of weak pawns, and it trades pieces. He must not want to give me two bishops against his knight and rook. I'm expecting Rc1 to come next.
Forces Black's Bishop to retreat.
now white uses his positional advantage to win
Quietly defending, and developing a further piece
A reasonable move, though would have worked better had white kept his bishop on g5. Still it forces me to move my bishop a second time which is undesirable in the opening
A very odd move, leaving white unable to castle kingside, and weakening his pawn structure.
I saw a chance to go on the offensive at this point. Better might have been Ne4 , but this offers the chance for white to make a mistake.<n>If white takes the knight then: 12. Nxd4 Qxd4 13. Kc1 Qxf4, leaves me a piece up and coasting to an easy win
Probably the best move, trying to drive away the knight and releasing the bishop onto a good diagonal.
If this was a correspondence game i would most likely have analysed thoroughly and decided to quietly retreat. However a move like this is excellent for a blitz game with too many threats and variations to calculate besides the obvious.
A quiet move planning to bring the final piece into play, the rook on a8. However it turned out to be a massive mistake as it left the knight en prise, and had white played 16. Qxd4 I would have been forced into a queen exchange, and lost the whole attack.
According to the computer this is the second best move to play, though during the match it was the only move I had seen
Having committed so much into the attack already i decided to just keep pressing forwards, and what better way to do so than with an exchange sacrifice
A critical mistake by my opponent, had he taken the rook the position would be roughly equal although thats difficult to see in a blitz game. The move played allows my rooks to infiltrate and show how powerful they can be working together with the queen once most pieces have been removed from the board
Again white cannot take the rook without losing to Qxd4#
Brings the other rook across to help close the net around the king. At this point my time was significantly low due to trying to calculate all the attacking moves. But from here my opponent finds he needs to take longer over his moves, allowing me some freedom
If Qxe3 then Rxb4 wins the queen
A very strange move, and according to the computer even Qxe3 is better since checkmate in 8 is now possible
So I remove the rook, winning the exchange instead
Under time pressure I missed the mate in 3 after Rxa3
Quite a pretty finish, checkmate with the pawn. And overall a strange match, as i tend to be far more cautious early on in a match, and very rarely do sacrifices seem to pay off.
Not sure what black can do ones white playd b3 here. White we getting a nice open a file and white will shut down the b file. Looks strong and aggresive on blacks queensite. Cause of the pawn on f4 white is also able to build up a nice attack on the kingside.
Its a bit passive but good side from this move is the control in the center, also white still will be able to play b3. Downside is that black doesnt have to react on it. and the center is a bit blocked now. the e5 square looks attractive for white now. Im wondering what white will play.
Not surprised tbh black obviously dont want white to play g4 and this is a easy to wait to avoid that. then again, queen side is a bit inactive, kingside castling will be a bit risky and white doesnt get under pressure. I would put my bets on the white pieces here
Bc4 is just as good, but I take after the old masters who said to develop the knights before bishops :)
I have a pawn majority in the center but it is under attack at the moment. I also have a semi-open file that I need to find out how I can put it to use.
Without queens on the board and the lack of black's development, I don't have to worry so much about attacks against my king.
A key moment in the game: advance my pawns and possibly overextend, or ease into the crux of black's counterplay. Bxe7 is met simply with Re8 and a fork comes on e4.
I decide to have faith in my pawns.
I've won a pawn, but can I hold on to it?
A key move from black the creates the draw. Bd4 and black will slowly win the pawns on e7 and e5 with the advance of the king.
I offered a draw based on us both having dark/light square bishops and equal material without any sight of an endgame advantage for each side. The pawn on e7 falls in no time after Kf7 and Rc7. A solid game from both players. Black seemed to play with more purpose, but came up short on an advantage.
Since White is trying to dominate d5 square, why Black did join the battle by move the Queen to 5th rank, at the same time attacking White's Bishop.
But Black now dominate the Black square and thread to dominate the open g file.
White take opportunity to connect the rook and secure the open d file.
moving away from white square and protecting the a7 pawn.
White is trying to do a direct attack at queenside with his pieces standing in this area. Black is trying to counter attack via long diagonal, considering his weapon is a Bishop pair.
Other option is to keep the Knight still in the area with 18.Nc3 but ..Nb4! attacking bishop and open up the c8 Rook to exchange the c3 Knight.
Blocking his c-pawn, White aims for rapid development and the central break, e2-e4.  Black can clamp down on e4 with 3...d5, but that would cost him the e5 square after 4.Bf4 and a future Ne5.
White exchanges in order to break with e2-e4.  The inherent problem with the Dutch Defense is the early weakening of the kingside with 1...f5.  Now a strong kingside defender (the f6 Knight) has been eliminated, making Black's kingside even weaker.   The only down side for White is giving up the prized Bishop Pair.
White is missing his dark-squared Bishop.  Therefore, recommended here for Black is 6...d5, which forces White to clarify his intentions in the center.  The text move allows White to fully justify his opening strategy.
Black aims for a queenside fianchetto combined with pressure down the f-file after ...O-O.
The Knight on e4 is at least equal to the Bishop on f6, so White refrains from further exchanges and continues developing.  Here the d3 Bishop takes aim at Black's kingside.
A provocative move, threatening Qh5 !  White does not mind if Black trades one of his Bishops for one of White's powerfully centralized Knights.  Let's take a look at some variations.<n><n>If 9...Bxe5?, then 10.Qh5 ! (zwischenzug) and White recovers the piece with a centralized Queen and a better position, since Black is forced to give up castling or weaken his kingside with 10...g6.<n><n>Also weak is 9...Bxe4? 10.Bxe4 where Black has parted with his fianchettoed Bishop along with his light squares.  The Rook on a8 is attacked, making 10...d5 absolutely forced.  Other blocking moves are worse; 10...c6 is inadequate in light of 11.Qd3 g6 12.h4! (12...Bxh4?? 13.Bxg6 ! is crushing); and of course not 10...Nc6?? 11.Nxc6 dc 12.Bxc6  and White wins.  Returning to 10...d5, White simply plays 11.Bd3 with a clear advantage due to the backward e-pawn and the outpost square on e5.
Castling into the storm!  Although time-consuming, in retrospect it might have been better for Black to engineer queenside castling.
Black's kingside is under massive pressure.  Here White is threatening 11.Ng5 h6 12.Bh7  Kh8 13.Ng6# which is veiled by a secondary and rather basic threat of 11.Nxf6  Rxf6 12.Qxh7  followed by total annihilation of the kingside and a winning material advantage.
The game-losing blunder, but one could hardly blame Thomas for missing this one in blitz!  10...Bxe5, giving up the Bishop Pair to remove White's monster Knight on e5, is pretty much forced.  Now in this position, after the text move (10...Qe7??) and the supposed 11.Nxf6  gxf6 (not 11...Rxf6?? 12.Qxh7  Kf8 13.Qh8#) the Black Queen covers h7.<n><n>I actually had the rare privilege of playing this same game against a computer on the Internet Chess Club.  The crazy thing was the computer, rated around 2100, fell victim to the "horizon effect", a well-known phenomenon where a chess engine cannot "see" the final mate position because it simply cannot calculate far enough into the position (beyond its horizon).  In this position, the engine probably calculated 6 moves ahead and assessed that Black is "safe" after 10...Qe7, since h7 is guarded and there is no way to force mate in 6.  But there IS a way to force mate in 7, if you look beyond the horizon!  Drum roll...
Double check is the most powerful check other than checkmate, since the only defense is to move the King to safety.  Here the Black King is forced to go for a little walk (12...Kh8 13.Ng6#).
The only move!  In this position White has TWO ways to proceed, both of which lead to the fastest mate possible.  The first one is the text move (14.h4 ) and the second is 14.f4  Kh4 [14...Kxf4 leads to a quicker mate after 15.g3  Kg5 (15...Kf3 16.O-O#!) 16.h4#] 15.g3  Kh3 16.Bf1  Bg2 17.Nf2#.
Here White has an elegant mate in 2.  After the quiet 16.Kf1 or even 16.O-O! (cutting off g2), there is no way for Black to stop 17.Nh2#.  Lasker, however, finds a slightly longer but highly amusing finish.
Checkmate!  The King has walked the plank!  It would have been nice for Lasker to have ended with 18.O-O-O#, but perhaps he did not wish to copy Paul Morphy's famous finale where he mated his opponent by castling long.<n><n>1-0
Eh, why not. I hardly ever get to say en passant...
If for no other reason than lately I've moved too many pieces. I need to get back on track with pawn moves.
Gaining a pawn and forking white's bishop and rook. White's reply isn't exactly forced. If 18. Bxe4 then 18. ... Nxe4 leaves black ahead by a pawn. But that little lonely black pawn over there on a6 looks almost too tempting to leave it alone...
White regained the pawn deficit, creating two passed pawns for himself in the process. But black's rook responds by moving out of danger, with threats, and white's rook at h1 is still en prise. Further, white has no direct moves with knights or bishops that threaten black in any way because black's knight and bishop cover all the good white moves. White must lose material. Instead, he resigns.
Black is way off the pace here - he really needs some pieces to join his queen on the open board!
A nice way to win back the pawn and expose the black King
The point of my temporary bishop sacrifice.  The rook cannot be recaptured by the black Knight as it is pinned.
curtains!  White threatens either Rg4 , but in any event the black queen must now move from a dark square, allowing the capture on e7 and mate.  At this point, my opponent graciously resigned.
My opponent bring some great input to the game, as I hope to have done also, I've kept my ideas about the Keres system is a nice draw weapon against the Sicilian but not much more at this "correspondence" slow pace, but what would have happened had I've played 8.bxc6, could things gone wrong for black? or white would have trouble to cope with the asymmetrical pawn structure, and couldn't have managed to hold the draw? <n>After that, several exchanges, made me believe the game was going to became a boring draw... but then I was wrong, white kept one of the rooks and started pushing some pawns soon putting my position under severe pressure, I was never able to remove my bishop from the front of the e pawn to push it foreword to e5, and white kept gaining space, I needed a break on the other wing, so I've opened a column for my rook and profited from some lack of mobility from white's rook for some moments I thought I was going to win easily attacking white's pawns from behind but then 31.e5! increased the tension on the king's wing and 34.Bd1! forcing another of my pawn to a light square made me step down to reality, this was going to be a draw, but an hard fought one!<n>Congrats vobonk for a nice game
to defend against Bh6 and avoid the exchange of the dragon bishop, if white intends to castle long he needs to deal with my bishop on the long a1-h8 diagonal
the exchange of queens allowed me to keep my king in the centre without almost any danger, Kc7 is a possible future move to control d6,d7,d8 with it, for now white's dark square bishop refrains me from playing Kc7 so if white plays rook to d1 either directly or by castling, I think Ke8 is better for now... queens off the board and the symmetrical structure it starts to look a bit drawish... much like my game against Simoman http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/lets-play-chess?gm=41316, but in that one, I was able to turn the events to my advantage
white diverged from Gajadin D (SUR) - Mukabi John (KEN), Bled (Slovenia), 2002  but now has a closed in light squared bishop... let's see what can be done here Ne5 with the idea Ne5 inviting f4 Ng4 back to g4 again to invite some pawn push h3 Nf6 and if e5 then Nh5 and white's overextended pawn offer me a plan to exchange a couple more pieces and undermine those pawns.<n>12.h3 as played in the referred game might be slightly better as avoids Ng4 and prepares the immediate f4 (if black plays Ne5) without losing a tempo
now f4 by white is a possibility... I hope he does play it to try some ideas
another exchange and the game again looks drawish
improving my pawn structure with an eye on the endgame, my bishop has more freedom to move around, Kc7 now possible and Nd7 might be possible also
also white improves his pawn structure with just the light squared bishops on board pawns on dark squares are harder to attack
now my king will help to secure the defence of the d column, so I'll let with occupy it with his rooks and try to exchange one of the rooks to make it harder for him to infiltrate my position
h5 was also considered here to gain some space, Nd7-c5 is the plan now to keep an eye on e4 in the future Bc8 to get the chance to play e5
only move, avoiding opening more columns and placing another pawn in a dark square now h5 can be attacked but I'll not play h6, as white's Nf5 or g4 would be devastating, white can probably try b4 at some point in the future to remove my knight from c5 and try f4
expected, now g3 to support f4, but I have a5 and the knight back to c5 if white captures a5, plus after it Ra8 aimed a a3
black followed his plan blindly (his last three move were all predictable, but precipitated) now faces another open column and my rook can infiltrate his field
occupying the open column and threatening Ra1+ wining the rook
hitting b4 and forcing white to defend it
now white has committed his rook to the defence of b4
now I threat to move my king on to the opposite wing setting a trap for white, if he tries to stop my king with Bb5 I will protect my knight with Bb3 with the idea Rh2 aimed a the h6 knight and h1+ to win the rook, several threats then for white to cope with
! still white has another way of putting me under pressure and create another tension point to localize my attention on other part of the board
so I've solved the immediate tensions and opened up the position for now white's rook is occupied with the c pawn defence I'l opt to again close the d column
light squares might give white some counter play against them, but still I'm better placed to attack white's pawns, just have to find a hole (and opportunity) to pass my rook on to the other wing
I'm starting to dislike my position all my pawns (but one) on light squares, I'll now try to exchange the bishops, and move my rook to the d column
played with tempo the idea is that threatens the e2 bishop so white must do something about it
now forcing the exchange of bishops Nd4 Bxe2 Nxe2 Rd2, and the draw seams closer now
my opponent commented Rd6 but I prefer to N get a distant passed pawn, as it gives me more leverage the b and c pawns are controlled by the king, and with a distant passed pawn only black has a chance to play for a win, but even then only with white playing inferior moves... with correct play white should hold the draw perhaps simplifying in to a rook's endgame with one pawn deficit
denying white's the access to d7, but allows Nd4, I'm thinking now Nd4 Rd5 pinning the knight and the knight back to a4 maybe
?!<n>Most modern books on the Benoni do not even cover this move and for good reason. It is way to slow! The appeal of this move is that white essentially shuts the door on tactics for the time being. Holding true the Stientz altruism, "It is better to keep your enemy at arms length until you have finished developing." Well he did not say that exactly.
A very good idea! Black who has all the time in the world can flick in ...b7-b5 whenever he feels like it. <n>Alternative variation: 9... Nh5 [!?] 10. Nxh5 gxh5 11. Bd3 Nd7 [ has turned out well for black in practice]
?<n>Here black should be thinking to playing for f7-f5. In that case the rook sits better on the F-file. Later in the game this move will come back to bite black in the butt. <n>Alternative variation: 11... Nh7 [!?] 12. Be3 Nd7 13. O-O h4 14. Nh1 f5 [⩱]
I want to play f4
? black should never give up his DSB so easily. <n>Alternative variation: 15... Bh8 [has not been explored. ]<n>Alternative variation: 15... Bd4+ 16. Be3 Bg7 17. a5 b5 18. axb6 Qxb6 19. Rfb1 f5 [⩲]
??<n>It was this move that sparked me to start a defending 101 thread in our club forms. All to often mistakes come in pairs. I am sure black thought white can not play f4 but he was wrong. At first I was quite disappointed with black's choice. However, the more I thought about it I was being too harsh on black as the correct 16....Qd8!? is not easy to spot. <n>Alternative variation: 16... Qd8 17. f4 Qf6 18. e5 Qg7 [⩲]
!<n>Now the small positional error of 11...Re8 comes back to haunt him. Truth be told black has been conditioned to expect white's attack to come through e4-e5. However, the king's knight is on g3 not f3!
and now the error 16...Ne5? comes to bare fruit. The bishop is pinned. When playing the benoni such deep tactical combinations must be thought out. The idea of 16...Qd8 is to swing the queen over to g7 where it can be exchanged for the white one with little disruption to the king pawns.
Everything exists for the powerful attack. #1 piece majority #2 space advantage #3 open lines.
..anticipating a quick exchange of queens where black is sometime better placed.
..the pawn is a long term problem already and i have to try and get rid of it.
..this is a mistake trying to win the pawn by force....totally overlooked the pin that follows and i.....
...now have to give up the exchange...
...this is large problem for black and need to find things to conteract ....white just needs to be solid ...protect the pawns and drive home the advantage
...white is comfy in this position and just needs to keep shoring things up...pushing the pawns to give a bit of space for the Queen.
...now i can give my Bishop a bit of space......with
...threat is now d3  winning the piece, winning the pawn on c4 or f5. Blacks bishop will come to e7. So most likely would be d3 followed by Qxf5.<n>Qxc4 will create problems with Rc2 and i think a winning attack is not far away for White. So at best i was thinking smoke and mirrors time and expect Kg2 and just take the f pawn and expect Rbe1........but then......
...it is said that games can turn on a single move and this unfortunately is one. White is now completely lost with this error. I have to assume the aim was to cover f5. <n>Simple combo wins Queen and 2 pawns, Black would be 4 pawns, a piece and exchange up.<n>All forced...?<n>32...d3  followed by Kg2 dxc2, Rxc2 Qxf5, R2c1 Qxe6. <n>Black can now followwith Qg4 & Bxh4.
Not much point because he would just defend with bishop. I'm the kind of guy who doesn't want to make the first moves. I like to counter attack and not start it.
After that exchange i am a pawn up!!!
Desperate attempt to save it.
DIE BISHOP!!!
coaching match... a very close match which demonstrates the strength of linked pawns vs loose pawns in an endgame... with each move, i will also post the gamenotes as discussed during the game as an added insight (they will be in these <<>> things), though there are one or two occasions where i made some errors of judgement, and only with the benefit of hindsight was i able to see how silly i sounded, especially when i predict white's collapse!<n><n><<<(Taufiq) My "normal" opening.. >>>
not my usual opening, in fact i never play e5. currently i'd most likely play caro-kann (c6), though i often play sicilian (c5) or french (e6) also... but this, i am led to believe, is a better opening for training purposes...<n><n><<<(Tugger) e4 is my usual opening too... normally, i'd reply with c5, as i belive it to be blacks strongest defence, but i will play e5, as i'm told it provides a better chance to learn. i don't know if you've discovered it yet, but the database is an excellent tool for learning openings, take the link under 'resign' and have a look... it can make things awkward though, too, as if your opponent moves off-book quickly, you can find yourself lost in an unfamiliar opening...>>>
<<<(Taufiq) Yes, I've allready looked to the Game DB, and I find it very helpfull !<n><n>Now, the attack with my horse forces you to cover your e-pawn.. >>>
four knights...<n><n><<<(Tugger) I believe it is best for black to ensure there is a knight-balance, ie my position would be weaker if you had more knights developed early on... so Nf6 is the natural move... your opening is sound as you are still forcing me to respond, as opposed to me making you play...>>>
i'm pretty sure this move is sound. i have abandoned my pawn on e5, but this would be a temporary loss, as 5... Qe7 attacks knight and exerts yet more pressure on the e4 pawn, or i could even reclaim the e4 pawn immediately, since my knight on d4 stops white pinning the knight (and yes, despite white's knight on e5, my knight would be pinned if white's queen safely occupied e2, since the discovered check Nc6  would be devastating). <n><n><<<(Tugger) Now, although this move loses the protection of my e-pawn, it would most certainly be a temporary loss, i would reclaim the pawn within a couple more moves, while gaining a positional advantage, at least i think... i also attack your bishop and knight, and i have brought my knight into a central position. you can of course take him, but then when i reclaim, your other knight is attacked... while this does not win any material, it hands the initative to me... i can now begin to build up a counter-attack%u2026>>>
<<<(Taufiq) Yes, VERY nice move ! Most people counter 4.Bb5 with 4. ... a6 But as you say, 4. ... Nd4 is most likely a better thing to do.. I'll protect my f-knight again with my bishop..>>><n><n>4... a6 would be a blunder, since the bishop/knight trade would leave black a pawn down and an inferior pawn structure. and white moving his bishop twice in the opening means black has a development advantage.
<<<(Tugger) It was too late to play a6, as this is a prevention move... after Bxc6, i have to reclaim with a pawn, messing up my structure... and you would be able to claim my e-pawn for free... a clear advantage to you...<n><n>now i have the choice out of bishop and knight... normally, i'd go bishop, but this would simply aid your development after the queen takes... Nxf3  will obviously respond Bxf3... while you may have more pieces developed, i will still be able to hold the initiative with 6. Bb4, which threatens your e-pawn and develops my bishop...>>>
steal the a7-g1 diagonal before white can develop his bishop.<n><n><<<(Tugger) There was an oversight on my part, though... Bb4 does not threaten your e-pawn, as the bishop now protects it as well as the knight... therefore, instead i shall play Bc5, as this gains the g1-a7 diagonal before you can develop your black bishop...>>><n><n>just one of the many times i'll look a bit silly, but that's what was said, and it aids the insight to the game to see what was discussed at the time.
i felt this was more important than castling myself, since there is no threat yet which demands it. white controlled d5, and i didn't want the knight moving in. and since my b8 knight has developed and been traded, c6 does not hamper any future development. <n><n><<<(Tugger) You have control over d5, so to gain some control there myself, in particular prevent the knight moving in, in feel c6 is more important than castling now... since my queenside knight has been traded already, this does not hamper development as c6 sometimes can...>>>
<<<(Tugger) Indeed... and the natural response would be a5... not only does this delay the attack, but gives the bishop an extra square along the diagonal which it controls...>>>
<<<(Taufiq) Can't place my d-pawn 2 steps in front, cause it's only covered once.. In this way, it opens the c1-h6-diagonal for my bishop..>>>
not too good with opening theory, especially this opening, but at this stage the game appears to be balanced, with equal development and no positional advantage for either player... <n><n><<<(Tugger) Since my black bishop is active, i would prefer not to have to withdraw him to unpin the knight, so h6 it is...>>>
i believe this was an error... the exchange will leave white with doubled pawns on the e-file... a half-pawn advantage for black...<n><n><<<(Taufiq) Exchange of bishops ? Or is that a bad idea ? Are there better things to do for me ?>>>
<<<(Tugger) Hmm... the only problem with that move is when i take the bishop, you must reclaim with your pawn. this will cause a double up on the e-file, which could be a crucial disadvantage in the endgame. i could consider myself 'half a pawn' up. i think maybe a stronger move would have been Re1, followed by Be3... this way you would be able to reclaim with the rook instead. on the plus side, you will open up the f-file for your rook. and, of course, you have closed the diagonal.>>>
obviously to develop the bishop<n><n><<<(Tugger) One more developing move, then i'm ready to castle...>>>
an attempt to rectify his pawn structure...
of course, i'm not going to make it easy for him...<n><n><<<(Tugger) That's a good move, simply bacuase if i take it, it sorts out your pawn structure, assuming you reclaim with the pawn... though i will decline to take, i will instead finally castle...>>>
<<<(Taufiq) Yup, removing my double pawns, was the meaning of that move.. But now, in this fase of the game, I don't know what to do now.. :( My idea was to make a diagonal with the c2, b3 and a4-pawns...>>>
<<<(Tugger) Yes, this has become a very tight position... i'm struggling to find a move too... it would be best for me to develop my last piece before trying to manouvre pieces for better position... i was going to play Be6, but d5 would give me problems, so i must play b6 or b5 to develop the bishop... b5 seems best as it threatens b4 if you advance your pawn on a3, this would give your knight less room to move and he would no longer control the centre... also i have the option of developing the bishop to a6, which threatens a developed attack on your rook while stabbing the knight with a pawn, that would lose you material, but it's easily defended, so it might not feel there is any gain by playing it... after Bb7 i will probably look at moving my queen, most likely to c7, then placing my rook on the same file as your queen, the good old x-ray attack... but of course this depends on your moves...>>>
<<<(Tugger) I suspected as much... it suits me fine, we're still level on material and i have a slightly superior pawn structure... we will both have one white bishop and a knight each, along with the rooks, so it should make for a close endgame... my plan should you take the queen will now be to trade off as many pieces as possible while attempting to maintian my pawn shape... if we took all the pieces bar the pawns and kings off the board now, i'd be favourite as you can only offer protection to your e pawns with your king, which needs to be mobile in an endgame, while my king can go roaming around the board looking for weak pawns... your plan should be to try and force me to double up pawns, or win a pawn outright...>>>
not sure if this is poor play or not... i'm happy to encourage endgame, as my pawn structure is superior, so the queen trade suits me...<n><n><<<(Taufiq) Ok, I'll try to remember your advice :)>>>
and the bishop trade forced, though his g-pawn will move to the f-file, offering support to his doubled pawns, thus strengthening his position...<n><n><<<(Tugger) I don't think it was the best tactic, mainly because i can now also force the bishop trade, but at least you are limiting my attacking options too... it probably increases the chance of a draw, but certainly decreases the chance of you winning... it will be harder to win pawns now...>>>
! unpins the bishop with a tempo... see my gamenotes next...
<<<(Tugger) That's an excellent move... not only do you threaten a pawn, you also threaten Rxf6, which would win bishop and knight for rook, a good trade for you... this forces me to take your bishop, which will mean your e-pawns will have some support, freeing up your king in an endgame... there is still a weakness in your pawn structure, but not as much as there was... then you gain a tempo as i have to cover my pawn with the rook... like i say, an excellent move...>>>
and i'm already beginning to think i should've left the bishops on the board... still, i have the slight advantage...
another attempt to rectify his pawn structure... <n><n><<<(Taufiq) Still doing good moves, or are there better moves to do ?>>>
and now it gets tactical... i'm eyeing up the fork on e4, which is covered by the attacked knight... only two options for white...<n><n><<<(Tugger) I think f4 was an error, though only a subtle one... you have yielded a little control of e4, which, with your king and rook on the squares they are, is a crtical square... now only your knight covers that square... so i will play b4... your knight cannot move, or Nxe4  wins the rook, and with it the game... there are little options for you now... you will either come out of this a rook down, a knight down or a pawn down... obviously a pawn down is preferable...<n><n>.<n><n>honestly speaking, i think this is where your position collapses... don't be disappointed, as much can be learned from this... this game has proved to be a very good example of the difference doubled-up pawns can make... you have run out of attacking options, and will now be forced into defence... i could have forced the breakthrough by advancing my h and g pawns until my knight could be brought into it on that side, had you not played f4... all you have done is succombed to the pressure of having a positional disadvantage... you ran out of moves...<n><n>.<n><n>i don't doubt you'll save the rook and knight, but if you need any help with the analysis, just pm me before you move...>>><n><n>this is where my analysis is flawed, i predict here he will lose a pawn and his position will collapse, a bold statement which proves to be very wrong, making me look arrogant!
indeed... the other was axb4, but that of course is merely a delay... he would then have to play fxe5 next go...
definitely best... of course, white had to attack the knight, or he would lose his for nothing... and if 23. Kf3 Nxe5  24. Kf4 Ng6  and my knight is protected, his is attacked, and he's in check... his knight is lost with any hope of winning...<n><n><<<(Taufiq) 23. Kg3 is the best move, if you ask me ? In that way I protect my h-pawn.. If I moved 23. Kf3, then 23. ... Nxh2 would check me again..>>>
? with the benfit of hindsight, i think Nxe5 would've been stronger, but i was greedy and thought i would take the lead...<n><n><<<(Tugger) Yeah, Kg3 was definitely best...<n><n>after good analysis, you're not yet on the verge of collapse, but i certainly have the stronger position now... those pawns on the e-file are a big problem for you... your biggest concern in endgame is the h g pawn push, with only one pawn defending... made possible due to your f-pawn moving onto the e file... and for you, i guess the best thing you can do is put pressure on my b c pawns, though i'm not sure you'll be able to succeed in winning back the pawn, i should be able to hold you off and pressure your e-pawns... you must avoid trading pieces, too... once you've lost one more, i can look at the pawn push...>>>
and there goes the pawn.<n><n><<<(Tugger) I think Na4 was right, it means your knight is still in the thick of it... Na2 was inneffective after Nxc2, and then your knight would've been out of harms way... Ne2 would've been ok in regards to extra defence against the pawn rush later, but i think you would be better off trying to hound a pawn off me with the knight and rook...>>>
! while i might be a pawn up, his rook and knight are mobile and working together, while my rook is tied down, and my knight far from the action... had i taken the pawn on e5 instead, i could've backed the knight up with f6, then my rook would be free...
<<<(Tugger) I can avoid losing the pawn and three-fold by playing Ra7 next if you choose to attack the rook again... your knight is attacked... of course, after Rxc6, so is mine, but Nd4 now forks pawn and rook, while i still attack the knight... you will lose the pawn, restoring my advantage...>>>
<<<(Tugger) Makes more sense to bring my king into the thick of it... threaten the knight in the process... while i have the advantage still, i have to be extremely careful now we're at endgame, as one mistake can easily lose a game... my advantage is not sufficient to win easily...>>>
<<<(Tugger) Sorry i took so long on this one... i've been swamped since my internet connection went down... thankfully, i'm finally back... i've been having to make moves at work, which leaves little time for analysis...<n><n>anyway, the game... your pieces are currently much more mobile than mine... my knight cannot move or Na6 wins pawn, and Rc8 is pointless... i feel there is not a lot i can do... my plan here is simply to allow the rook some freedom... Re7 will probably be a move i will need to make to pressure your weak e-pawns... if you had no h-pawn, then my tactic would be simple... pawn push! unfortunately, that will have to wait... i feel my chances of winning rest solely on those pawns...>>>
<<<(Tugger) I need to look at the following moves...<n><n>Ne3  (seems pointless)<n><n>Re7 (seems weak)<n><n>g6 (most likely at a glance, to stop you playing Kh5 or Kf5)<n><n>Rc8 (to free up the knight a little, and protect from Rd8  if i try to move my king around my pawns to g7/h7)<n><n>.<n><n>i would like to shift your pawn on e5 so your rook is not protected from attack by king, but i can't see how i can do this just yet... i think looking at this at a glance, i think i'm going to have to play g6 to stop your king creeping in, then work my king to g7, preparing for the pawn push... i might have to also consider allowing you to take my pawn on c6 in order to bring my rook back into the game...>>>
i felt my king was needed on g7 and quickly...<n><n><<<(Tugger) Now my king needs to be on g7 as quickly as possible... i applaud your persistence, you're definitely in control at the minute, i'm having to respond to your moves instead of the other way round... but there are a couple of things to be very wary of... for instance, if after 31. h5 Kg7 32. hxg6 fxg6 and now i have two passed pawns with a king supporting... i can now ditch my pawn on the c file and advance... you will not have time to take my b pawn and promote yourself... or there is a mate i spotted, though it's an unlikely one... 31. Rd8  Kg7 32. h5 g5 33. Kf5? Ne3#... though i'm sure you'd have seen it if you began to walk into it, it's a trap to bear in mind if you plan to occupy f5 with your king...>>>
! white was eyeing up the fork, he did not realise it was safe for me to claim the pawn... after 32. Nxe6 Ke7 and the rook trade is forced, with me a pawn up...<n><n><<<(Tugger) Excellent... i'm finding it difficult to believe you're in the 1200's the way you're playing... i really thought i had this wrapped up about 10 moves ago... i feel forced again... i had a look at 31... Re7 32. Rxc6 fxe6... and now if you claim with the knight, it's good for me, but a rook trade from this position, without deep analysis, looks a draw... i don't think i can play Kg7 now... i need to change my gameplan from ultimately advancing my h g pawns to bringing my king into the centre while seeking to trade rooks... i now believe my only hope lies with my pawn advantage on the queenside...>>><n><n>this final comment here is where i finally start to see the game for what it is! <n><n>.<n><n>my problem with this move (fxe6) is i have now given you a passed pawn on e4... this is particularly difficult for me to accept, simply because it shows i made mistakes to allow doubled-up pawns to work to your advantage as opposed to your disadvantage... i'm not worried about the knight fork, since Ke7 attacks both your rook and knight, forcing the rook trade... can't really work out who's stronger from there, i think we'll have a pawn race, both queen, and i'll still hold my pawn advantage... all other positions for me either allow you the pawn back or weaken my position further...>>>
indeed... note how the position has changed for white from trebled pawns on the e-file to a single passed pawn... my huge positional advantage has evaporated...<n><n><<<(Taufiq) Thanks for the compliment ! I'm doing my best with learning how to play chess.. You're helping alot with your explanation, thanks !!<n><n>Now, I wanted to make 32. Nxe6, but you've told it right on time, about the danger.. This is a safer plan to do, I think..>>>
protect the pawn and relieve the fork threat, at least for now...<n><n><<<(Tugger) Glad my explanations help...!<n><n>.<n><n>yes, Rxe6 is definitely stronger... like i say, i was sure i had a sneaky endgame tactical move that would've resulted in a promotion each, with me still a pawn up...<n><n>.<n><n>my move is the best out of the two moves i could make... attacks the rook, so keeps your knight busy, and i'm vulnerable to a winning fork on g7... i think i shall lose a pawn soon... when that comes, i'll be forced to make a decision as to whether i am going to settle for a draw and play defensively, or go all out to win, risking defeat... what immediately springs to mind is trading your pawn on b3 for my knight... that would give me two linked passed pawns, which might just be enough to force the win... but of course, it's a dangerous tactic, as i'd then be down material... i'll have to look at that when i see what you play...>>>
make sure he's gone... i will lose my pawn on h6 in no time... <n><n><<<(Tugger) As expected...<n><n>gxh5 is forced, or i lose both pawns for nothing...<n><n>.<n><n>i thought this was a certain draw from here, but i do believe there is a little more chess to be played here... i still hold one very small advantage... my pawns can link... if the position is right, it could certainly be the difference in endgame... but of course, you have a passed pawn...<n><n>.<n><n>my initial plan of trading off my knight for your pawn on b3 will fail to win, since you can sac your knight also to ensure the draw... failure to take the pawn would lose... i could play it to force the draw myself, as i could still lose, but why take a draw when one of us can still win...? there could be a good endgame lesson to come...!>>><n><n>again, my analyisis is spot on, as opposed to flawed earlier in the game. i point out the small advantage i have is my pawns can link, and how it can make the difference in endgame. this proves to be true in this case.
encourage his rook to take the pawn as opposed his king... i'm also keeping open my options of forcing the draw, as Nxb3 will give me two passed pawns, forcing white to concede his material advantage by sacrificing his knight too, which would leave a simple draw for both. and i'm covering e6, where there is a potential for a fork.<n><n><<<(Tugger) There are three reasons for this move...<n><n>1. it keeps my options open in terms of forcing the draw... Nxb3 (after defending Rh7 ) will draw...<n><n>2. it also defends the potential knight fork, Ne6 , if and when i occupy d8 with my king...<n><n>3. it forces you to claim the pawn with your rook, giving my king a little breathing space, even if only for a short while...<n><n>.<n><n>of course, you can attack the knight before claiming the pawn, moving him on, but then i just go to b5 and the knight protects the rook instead of the king... no need for my king to be on d8 then...<n><n>there is no immediate threat of you winning my rook, which would obviously be a disaster for me... a rook trade would suit me, certainly at the moment, due to my king being more central... once my king is free to move in more, my pawns are much stronger...<n><n>.<n><n>i still think a draw is likely, though...>>>
protect from the deadly Rh7 , winning rook and game...<n><n><<<(Tugger) I can't see how i can force a win here... my main problem is i can't force the rook trade, so my king is trapped as long as your rook stays on the sixth rank... i would like to try and move my king round to the other side of my rook, but with your knight sitting on c5, i would walk into mate...<n><n>we'll see how it pans out, but as long as you hold your defence together, which you're doing superbly so far, then i can't get my king in support...<n><n>.<n><n>i really don't want to come onto the eighth rank, but e7 or e8 allows a threefold if you wanted to take it, and f8 or g7 would immobilise my knight due to the fork threat...<n><n>.<n><n>as tmepting as it might be, avoid chasing my king with checks on the sixth rank, as you would allow me to escape behind my rook eventually... i think that would seriously strengthen my position, i say think as i'm not sure how much of a threat your pawn could become...>>>
this move is interesting... i had already discussed with my opponent  that if the rooks come off the board, i believed it would be to my advantage, since i have the potential to link my pawns, where his are loose... but the knight trade is likely to lead to a draw, provided he can contain my king...<n><n><<<(Taufiq) Going for an exchange of the knights ? Or are there better options for me ?>>>
<<<(Tugger) Interesting... i didn't expect it, i have to admit... your knight was well poisitoned to keep my king at bay... i had a look at the crazy 36... Nxb3, but after 37. Nxc7 c5 38. Rc6 and i cannot advance any further, and i'm heavily down... so that's out... therefore, the knight exchange is forced... but now i can finally link my pawns, though, which means it is you that is fighting for the draw now, though i can't see how you'd have any problem with this once your king is supporting your loose pawn...<n><n>with the knights off the board, there are no combos that can win pawns, so it will just come down to protecting pawns and covering further advancement... i think we can both do this...<n><n>as for were there any better options, not really... anything else would just be passive, and would probably resulted in a draw anyway... this was the most forceful move you had, nothing could really win it for you... i'd covered Rh7  and was watching carefully for a winning fork...>>>
<<<(Tugger) Obvious move, really... brings my king closer to my pawns while attacking your rook... and you don't have a great many places to go... you want to try to avoid me attacking your rook again with yet another king move... and you certainly want to continue to contain my king... i need to find a way to release him from his cage if i'm to exploit my linked pawn advantage... don't make it easy for me by moving off the 6th without being forced...>>>
again, Rh7  needed defending...<n><n><<<(Tugger) I need to have a long look at this now... i think i'll be playing Ke7, it seems safe... i think if you then force the rook trade, there is a draw for you, but you would need to be very careful... your king is just about close enough... if no trade, then i should be able to bring my king around my rook to escape, but you will then have the time to bring your king into the game... you should be ok for the draw even without the rook trade, simply because my king cannot attack your blocking pawn, i will have to trade off a pawn to remove it... then i don't have linked pawns, and it's a blatant draw... alternatively, i could try to get my rook the other side of my king to allow him out, but that will take a few moves, meanwhile again you bring your king into the thick of it...<n><n>the only way i can win is by removing your b pawn without loss or by trapping your king from protecting your passed pawn, which seems very difficult at the moment... or by taking your rook and forcing your king to take a step back (assuming he doesn't move in anymore) to recalim, that would win for me also... for instance, if i could take your rook now, i would in a flash, your king would then be a move too far away from saving the promotion on b1...>>><n><n>oh dear, did i encourage Rh7? i was doing so well with the analysis too...
<<<(Tugger) I must be honest, i didn't think you'd play that... the rook trade is now forced... you've allowed my king to escape, and your rook is attacked...<n><n>the other options are...<n><n>40 Kh6/g6 Rxh7<n><n>41 Kxh7<n><n>and you're king has been forced back, a very expensive retreat... i will promote just before your king covers...<n><n>40 Rh6  Ke5<n><n>and the pawn is lost<n><n>40 Rh8 Ke5<n><n>41 Re8  Kd4<n><n>and the best you can do is advance, though it will soon enough come down to a rook sac to avoid you queening, then you have two linked pawns to worry about, your king too far away and your rook alone unable to deal with both... despite being a rook down, i will promote to win... if my pawns weren't linked, then different story...<n><n>so you must trade or you'll lose... after that, well, you must be careful... i'm sure you can draw, but one bad move and it's lost... every move from now on must be correct...>>><n><n>see? even now i'm telling him he can draw.

and now my king moves in...

Pawn move nr 5.  It is considered to be a "chess sin" to move the same piece twice in the opening. (but of course the game of chess is far too complicated to be summerized in such generalities. There are lots of exceptions to this rule. )
Black just wants to develop as fast as he can. Taking the pawn forces white to play yet another pawn move.
Black has fulfilled his first tasks. Bring the pieces out, castle the king into safety and put a p�wn on a central square.
What is this ? Black plays the same piece twice ! Yes, right.. but black can afford to do so because he already has his king into safety.
This is a mistake. Because the f pawn has moved and the white king is still in the middle of the board, black can attack quickly
Black can afford to be greedy because he attacks the white bisshop.
Threatens to take the bisshop.
Again it was not easy to come up with a good move for white.
Now the knight is invulnerable because of the bisshop moving to f5.
This allows black to give a forced mate.
Freddy had sent this game with the title 'Back to the Base Man'. 'Base Man' referred to the Basman Defence, something which I'd shown an interest in in the forums. Missing out on that hint, I play a normal king's pawn game...
...but that's not to say we're going to play a normal game! This is the Patzer opening, usually associated with beginner play. There is a thematic trap here that I have fallen for a few times in the past [2...g6?? 3.Qxe5+!] Though the opening is considered weak [actually, using GK analysis this isn't too horrible an opening], I don't get my hopes up - he played an even weaker opening against Joanne [jstevens1] and disposed of her in just 30 moves - and that was against a player 400 rating points above my own! Here's the annotation of that game; http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/when-or-where-is-it-safe-to-castle?gm=31623
As well as developing the bishop, this move also threatens the cheap Scholar's Mate.
The queen returns to the d1 square - counter-intuitive, to be sure, but I'm guessing that this was played to let me have a bit of an advantage to compensate for the huge difference in rating
The normal move seen, Qf3, would have provoked this move to ward off Scholar's Mate once again. There's no reason not to play this move here anyway.
Natural again - though the diagonal is partially closed, it makes sense to fianchetto the bishop
After seeing that move, I castled immediately kingside - any ideas for queenside castling is out of the question if there is any possibility of a queenside pawn storm. Plus, Freddy is most likely looking to castle kingside himself. However, sometime after this move, I started to get just a little bit worried - what if there was something in 8.a5? [normal question mark, by the way] Possibly that was paranoid thinking there lol
...so I take the opportunity to halt it now to prevent unpleasant tactics later on
Bishop development - this was the only logical place for the bishop. the f5 and h3 squares are prohibited for obvious reasons, Bd7 is too inactive and Be6 allows Bxe6, weakening my pawn structure
For Freddy, the e3 square is where the bishop has the most scope, though Bg5 is also playable
...so this is the only viable alternative, and as I've said before, this isn't a very active posting for the bishop. It also delays my desired pawn break because the bishop blocks the queen.
!? Looks like Freddy has similar ideas! his d-pawn pushes forward first, and after the exchange of pawns...
...he obtains a centralised knight. At the time of the pawn exchange, I had ideas of chasing away the knight with 13...c5, but then it gives the knight an outpost on the b5 square, and that made me uncomfortable.
unwilling to allow that outpost, I continue to prepare d5. Perhaps Bc6 would have been an idea as well
and Black gets his pawn thrust! Still unwilling to allow the b5 square for the knight, a plethora of exchanges ensue...
Now that there isn't so much going on queenside, a knight on b5 now isn't as threatening as it was earlier, especially since Black would have the option of exchanging it off
The aforementioned bishop thrust, which strips Black of the bishop pair
! This move probably isn't strong enough to deserve the exclam mark, but personally I really liked this move - attacking both b2 and d4 while improving the position of my queen. Unplayable is 18...Bxd4+??, where after 19.Qxd4!, where Black must lose the exchange (f6) to prevent checkmate
Freddy relieves the queen of any defensive duties with regards to the knight
...and Freddy brings his other rook to the e-file to contest the file.
The rook must be protected - this and Qd6 are both fine moves
...and Freddy hinders it - a mirror image of the pawns on the a-file
The second pair of rooks come off the board.
? My first mistake, and now White has the advantage. Freddy recommended f5 here, while the Gameknot analysis machine recommended Qe5. Both moves are designed to prevent a queen invasion from White...
! With this move! White now threatens to invade via the c7 or b8 square, with the additional threat on the b7 pawn. To protect c7 and the pawn, the bishop needs to be moved, and for that idea, Bc8 is recommended.
! The pin on the g-pawn turns this attack into an elementary king and queen fork, and that is never a good way to lose a game! I would have thought that the ensuing endgame could have been pretty interesting, though I'd most likely lose anyway
Walks into a mate in eight, but this game is hopelessly lost anyway. If you want to try and work it out, here's the puzzle from this position; http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=29034
The funny thing is that GK analysis had not actually seen the mate that followed after this, and recommended Nxe7 after this move. Though it is winning, it does not lead to mate...
This was an unrated training game. Non the less it was very hard fought. In the opening early middlegame white has a small plus than by the late middlegame black had turned it around and had the advantage. In the transition from middlegame into the endgame white regained the advantage and went on to convert for the full point.
jeich is an enterprising and aggressive player and the Dragon Defence suits his style.
The aggressive Rauzer Attack
"The -advantage of this old continuation over the more modern 9.Bc4 lies in the fact that the counter-play associated with Bc8-d7.......Rf8-c8 and Nc6-e5-c4 is now ineffective; the bishop can take the knight from f1 not from b3 saving white 2 tempi"-Gufeld and Stetsko. I chose 9.0-0-0 as it generally leads to more simplified positions than 9.Bc4
"The advantage of this old continuation over the more modern 9.Bc4 lies in the fact that the counter-play associated with Bc8-d7...Rf8-c8...Nc6-e5-c4 is now ineffective:the bishop can take the knight not from b3, but from f1,saving white 2 clear tempi." -Gufield & Stetsko. I chose 9.0-0-0 as it generally leads to more simplified positions than 9.Bc4
12.Nxd5 accepting the pawn sac gives black too much counterplay for my liking.The move played blunts the power of the Dragon DSB and contests the dark squares.
28,Nd3 eyeing e5 was best with equality.I wanted more so came up with the idea of pushing the Q_side pawns.After 27.b4 Houdini gives a small plus for black
44......Ra2 activating the rook was much better.45.Re7ch Kb6 46.Rxh7 e3 47.Re7 and though a pawn up blacks activity offers compensation
46.....Rd7 47.Kc5 Rd2 activating the rook was probably better.
must play Nd2 an free the queen side rook.
and another pawn...
the side with the advantage will always want to exchage pieces.
lose the rook and the game...
Now i am going to try and cause pain
And with this sacrificing of the rook instead of h-pawn so could I get the winning
I don't remember why I did this.  I had great position in the center of the board.  Must have been anxious to move into the midgame.
I suppose I could pretend it was an even trade...
But it wasn't, opened me up to a fork on my queen and the bishop.
I knew he was going after my queen, she was not properly developed.
Should have moved my bishop at this point... dunno where though.  Probably f4.
Best move at the time, if I had seen the whole of the game I would have realized that I was not just saving my queen, but threatening an exchange for my bishop.  But I wasn't paying enough attention.
Attacking c2, and moving a little further from the situation, sounded like the best idea.
I assume that he moved his knight here to take e5, threatening the queen, or maybe just negating the attack on c2...  either way, I got no options.
Had to choose, Rd was 'defended' by my K, if you will, so I decided to offer that one.
26. Rxc7 g4 <n>27. Rh7 Ne2 <n>28. Rxh5 g3 <n>29. hxg3 Nxg3  <n>highly unlikely... ?<n>if his R doesn't come to h, then mine can, threatening mate
ok, so we are in the end-game now... if I had seen that, I wonder if I could have prevented it.<n>if I don't protect 8 (f8), that is mate. if R stays at e8, then white R at d7 is mate. moving R-h8 saves me, but I have a one move cushion.
It's too painful to look at every time I log on... I have to resign.  I must remember where I messed up.  <n>Over and over I thought I had an additional cushion before I had to retreat.  Over and over I was wrong.  I needed to be just a little more cautious in about 4 or 5 moves, and I wouldn't have needed to resign.
The game was long and hard it started at 8:00pm and didn't finish untill 12:30am! 4 and a half hours finishing after midnight. It was a very hard fought game. The game was quite unusual from start to finish where I went with some odd looking lines coming from the GPA. it seemed that I was looking at a good position when suddenly my opponent found a nice defence and it looked like I was destined to be slaughtered as I probably should have been in the position. How ever with some mistakes from my opponent I managed to get into a rook pawn end game where a nice little move seems to have secured the draw!
retreating the bishop to a4 would get it trapped and moving it back would be a waste of tempo.
?! a rather dubious move. It was meant to be a rook lift however I suspect it is a little early for that.
And making my last move look even more silly I change plan straight away. This move intends to make a target out of the c5 pawn. Black can't save it if I play Na4 and Ba3. Well not without using either his rook or bishop.
Unfortunalty it also means I dont have the time to make my attack on the pawn.
of course black cannot take e.p because of the pin on his h8 rook.
? I really think this move was a mistke. as now the knight is effectvly trapped in the middle of the board. I'm not sure what I would have done if black had played 16...Nh6. It has already been a messy sort of game.
I very much wanted to play a4 here covering the knights only escpe square however I couldn't see a way around the fact that if I got my knight out of the way the c3 would be useless on account of Nxb3 forking queen and rook. So I went with this which is still a very good move, It was here or the last move where I worked out I could win atleast a pawn.
! now I can no longer win a piece. however I can easily win a pawn if I choose. But this is I think still the best move in this position.
? A mistake or probably this deserves a ?? since black gets three pawns for the piece but more importantly a monster protected passed pawn on the 7th rank! my thinking was that I could take the piece then snaffle a coulpe of other pawns I thought that I would have enough on the a pawn to keep it under raps. Which was very wrong and probably should have lost me the game!<n><n>The simple 22.a3! Nc2 23.Nxc2 bxc2 23.Qxc2 would have left me a pawn up with a comfortable position.
!? I should be assigning my resources to the taming of the passed pawn rather than going after irrelevant pawns on the other side of the board. I rationalised to myself that since black woldn't want to trade rooks on the h file my rook would have enough time to reactivate my.
I thought I was about to lose here. as I could see no way to prevent Bb2
? but black makes a mistake! giving me the chance to get back into the game.
! now I allowed myself to think I might not die so suddenly after all. although I am techically up in material the pawn still posses a danger to me.
I put in some thought here and decided my best option was to exchange my bishop for blacks pawn and hope the insuing ending might be a draw. maybe instead h4 worked?
! this was the key move to the endgame In think. I suspect and I could be very wrong but I believe that this move I was happy with in the game is what gives me good drawing chances. I needed to break up blacks pawns and this forces that. even now I am somewhat proud of this move as it's something of a positional sacrafice which is not something I manage to do often.
! This forces blacks hand and allows me to set up my fortress in which black will find it very difficult. Keep in mind it was getting quite late at this point and as the game goes on we were both getting tired and my opponent was very low on time, he came down to seconds a few times only being saved by the 30 second increment.
This will get black nowhere. As I can bring my rook to c7 and should black move his king to the queenside then a draw would result since I could create an unpassable "fence" where the black king cannot cross. and without the support of the king the pawns/rook combo would not be able to pomote since my rook would have plenty of waiting moves at it's disposal.
This rook move once agains keeps my fortress intact since it allows me to play Re8+ before black can free the d4 square for his king.
This time I have to push the rook to stop the king coming into e4.
At this stage it was basically 12:30 at night and we were the only two left in the club meeting room. My opponent was short on time and I was playing for a draw. With this move I pointed out to my opponent that the position had reppeated itself three times with the same person to move and all. My opponent disagreed and we came to the descision that we would play it out and if it didn't end up as a draw then we would set up the position again and see if it was a three fold reppition. And I can say it definatly was.
My opponent agreed to a draw at this point. This was a very long tough battle and I am very happy with the way I played, in the endgame inpaticular, I think it is a very educational endgame and I think I played it basically correctly. Please tell me if I am mistaken on this count since I dont want to find out my enthusiasim is mispalced.
Defending the Knight.
Not a very wise trade in the long run, as White will be in sore need of his black-squared Bishop, as he will soon find out.
Protecting the b2 square and developing a minor.
Freeing up the Bishop.
The Queen is now free to pin the Knight.
With this pin, the attack begins.
I was conflicted as whether to play this before taking the Rook, but doing so may have led to a Queen trade, and I was NOT looking forward to playing without my Queen in this attack.
I want to keep my clergy's ( bishops ) eye on The h2 square.
If my opponent is not going to fight for the center then i will !!! nasty captain.
I was considering the following clear out, but felt it left me no advantage and would give white a simplified position, 10...exd4 11.Qc2-Ne5 12.Nxe5-Bxe5 13.Nxf6-Bxf6 14.0-0 h6 15.Rae1-Be6. remember these thoughts come from my mind at the time of play and not in post Motam of the game.
I like this move by me straight to the point no fuss.
allows white to hold on longer,
Better than say retreating d7 or c8 the move played allows for the bishop to give a sermon to white when it later lands on c4 with a devastating blow.
The squeeze begins
And the destroyer of souls
White diverts from his plan of occupying the centre and developing. Clearly something must be done about those over-eager Black kingside pawns. This choice of move forces Black to react on the kingside, before 5.hxg5 wins a pawn due to the pin on Black's h-pawn. The downside is that Black can lock the kingside up, and consolidate his hold on space, immediately.
! This grabs a lot of space, with tempo as White's knight must move.
White's knight takes up an unstable position in the centre of the board, in Black's side, in order to threaten Black's advanced kingside pawns immediately, as well as pressurise the weak f7-pawn. Black, for his part, quickly shores up his space advantage and his g-pawn. However, this does not catch up in development! My IM chess teacher would kill ME if I did what Black is doing...but a GM can get away with it...hmmmmm...
White logically decides that his best chance against White's slow development is to highlight this disadvantage by developing quickly, and gaining another tempo with an attack on Black's f7-pawn.
Blunting the bishop's powerful line, and preparing for ...d5 with tempo. ...b5 also works, and is probably better.
! Grabbing a space advantage on the other wing, the queenside, and gaining a tempo as Black shoves back White's bishop.
Here we can probably see the shadow of Black's future trap. White's light-squared bishop is trapped, and isn't going anywhere anytime soon.
Preparing for another space-grab with ...c5!, and gaining another tempo. 8...b4 also looks good, but this releases White's light-squared bishop.
As IM Malcolm Pein, in the Daily Telegraph chess column, said, "Resigning was objectively best here but White must have been in shock. So, that's where I'll leave it.
No one would object if a draw was declared here. Yet Maroczy decides to play for the win. Through perfect technique, he'll get it.
White could resign now, but chooses to play on.
!? this opens up the board.
going to kill the mean old pawn!!
MATE!!! i hope that you enjoyed it?? please leave a comment or 2 and rate on the star system. thanks.
I think exf6 may have been better, to keep the king's pawn row intact for casting.
Is this what he was planning? To take the Bishop?
This one comes with a question mark or two. The undefended d5 pawn needs to be dealt with first. Also I'm not quite sure what this move hopes to accomplish, as it wrecks the queenside pawn structure, and the Bishop has an escape square on b3.
At this point, Black will be hard pressed not to lose at least a rook.
I was waiting at any time for him to push e5, at which point I would Qe2, preventing him from capturing with the pinned pawn. f5 however opens up a reveal on my d4 pawn from his Bishop, a pawn that I don't care about anymore.
Here is a recent team game vs. my good friend and rival team captain (and the only guy I know who spends more time on GK than me:), achilles13. With the black pieces, I employ a Najdorf Sicilian vs. his 1. e4, and a pretty clean middle game is reached with both sides fairly equal. Unexpectedly, my opponent decided to sac a piece giving him a 3-1 queenside pawn majority which threatened to wreak havoc. Luckily, I was able to block his advance utilizing my piece advantage and some pretty good coordination of my forces. The thing I liked most about this game is that my king was used in a very offensive role and I was fortunate enough to have my pieces accomplishing multiple tasks with minimal movement. Thanks to achilles13 for the good game! I hope you enjoy:)
And here is the typical Najdorf variation of the Sicilian defence. I have only recently grown the stones to start playing the Sicilian. I am 36 years old, and have been playing chess for about 25 years. Trust me when I tell you that I have played 10's of thousands of games in my life (including the ridiculous 6500 something here on GK). Of all of those games, I would guess that only in a few hundred have I played 1...c5 vs. 1. e4. For those that know me, I'm a Scandanavian player. I have realized (finally!) that I am entirely too predictable, so I have put a few of my fears to rest and have started branching out some. To me, the Sicilian has always represented some of the most scary (yet oddly thrilling) aspects of playing with the black pieces. There are just too many variations that can arise, and I have always tried to steer towards more simple, straight-forward opening lines. In doing some reading (and also going through some great annotations right here on GK), I have decided to tackle the Najdorf. Hopefully with some practice, I can safely add it to my repitoire and not feel suicidal in doing so.......
After a standard opening, white develops and throws a protective hit on his Nd4. As my own "book knowledge" of the Najdorf is still a book with only one page in it, I can't yet find a lot of fault with this move. 6. Bf4 is the move I probably would have chosen, however, as it exerts more control over the dark squares. I only mention this because when I have the white pieces, no one ever gets the chance to play the Najdorf against me because I play 1. d4 almost exclusively. (***note to self*** A. Only ONE major change at a time. Once you're comfortable with the Sicilian, try playing something else as white, B. Quit telling the world about your tendancies - if you need catharsis then go get a shrink:)
Establishing a central presence and preparing the aggressive 7...Bb4 pin.
Practically forced. achilles and I have played numerous times, and he knows good and well that I will not hesitate for a moment to trade bishop for knight if I can straddle him with doubled isolani after 8...BxN. At this point I feel pretty good with my position, and as objectivly as possible I give black a small edge here. The two things I am concerned about are my awkward d pawn and a potential hole on d5, however. My d pawn is obviously destined to support my e pawn, but once it gets to d6 it is potentially weak.
Maintaining clear lines for development and supporting e5. If this joker is weak now or not I don't know. What I do know is that rapid development in support of my aim to maintain tempo and initiative are all important. If I have to address the "problems" of my d pawn later then so be it.
!achilles sees 9...BxN 10. BxB Nxe so he develops, shores up his e pawn, and prepares to castle. A nice multi-tasking move.
Aggressive and natural. 9...Be6 was way to passive. White must now contend with a very annoying pin.
Here I had a change of plan. While pinning my opponents Nf3 against his queen was nice, I envision activity on e4 and am concerned about my own safety should I castle kingside. Paranoid? I don't think so....he IS trying to kill me:)
White hits e4 as well and prepares to open up the middle lanes on the board.
White wants to expand on the queenside and gain some space.
?! I seriously considered BxN, but experience has taught me that achilles is very dangerous when he has the bishop pair. I decide to keep my dark squared bishop on the board and give him his space.
Obviously I cannot allow an enemy knight to be posted so sweetly in my territory, so I remove it........
! This guy goes first. I see that I am about to lose a pawn after 17. dxN Bf5 18. cxb, but I'm pretty confident I can get it back with little effort.
18...Rb8 was also an option, but this way I can get more power vertical quickly. The c file appears as if it is going to be where all of the fireworks are going to occur, so I want to claim it as fast as I can.
! Notice white's queenside pawns. White hopes to remove the dark squared bishops from the board to better preserve them.
I realize what achilles is trying to do. At this point, I'm pretty sure he will get what he wants - but I'm certainly not going to help him do it. I spend my tempo loading up on the c file.
And the race commences for c file dominance.
I was a little confused by this move. I figured white would try to get his knight to c4 by Ne1, Nd3, Nb2.....
!? This is the telling move of the game. I can only assume that white feared my strong central pawns that would easily be reinforced by my big artillery, so he sacs his knight to remove them. I began thinking that this was a huge mistake on my opponent's part. Then I realized that if he could somehow negate my control of c4 I could have some serious problems due to his 3-1 pawn majority. This going to be a very interesting endgame!
Still controlling c4 by hitting it this time instead of occupying it. I was also a little wary of my back rank so I closed down his access to it via the e file.
?! And here is where I started listening to the demented, confused little voices in my head. I rationalized that every time I took heat off of c3, so could he. I debated and debated. I finally figured that the tiny material advantage I had may just be enough to win - but it would require my king to put on his gloves and get into the ring. If I didn't have my a pawn on the board I would not have considered this. I mentally took all four rooks and both queens off of the board. That would leave my bishop vs. his three pawns - which is a pretty equal fight. However, his king could reach the action before me, so the presence of my a pawn gave me the fortitude to attempt this trade down of material. Risky.....but exciting chess!
I had every intention of protecting my half of the board by playing this move. It also protects some space for my king to operate in. But I did not anticipate how valuable this move was until a few more moves transpired.
Opening a lane for his king to enter the fray.
! Nice! By forcing my opponent back I gain valuable space and maintain initiative.
Clearing f5 for the f pawn.
! And I finally see the way to pick up an isolani.
White attempts to confuse the issue........
......but I'm having none of that. I pick up a pawn and immediately get the chance to trade down a bit further.
Now I of course offer to take achilles up on his previous offer.
Looking to trade pawns on g4.
It is safe to pick off this pawn, as my bishop can safely reach d5 to protect b7.
This is a training game with me and a new player to my over-the-board club! We live in neighbouring villages! I am annotating it to help him learn!
e3 is not a bad opening move. It makes it hard for black to attack f2, and prepares to develop the Bf1.
He continues to develop - this is the logical follow-up to his previous move.
I play the knight out - partly because it is good development, but also because he was threatening to come to b5 with check.
He goes to b5 anyway. Although the computer doesn't give it as a mistake, I think it is. He really needs to develop his knights and Bf1.
Again not given as a mistake by the computer, but I think it is - he needs to develop his knights and Bf1.
I get my king to safety.
This is not given as a mistake by the computer, but I think it is. He really needs to develop his knights and Bf1
Now I am threatening to move my Nc6, opening up the diagonal for my Bd7 and so attacking his queen.
I try to open up the centre to his king.
Computer says this is a mistake, but there is some logic in trying to keep the centre blocked with his king in the centre.
I put an additional attack on the g pawn. Computer prefers Nxb4
I return to my older plan. Computer still likes Nxb4.
I take, with the plan that 20. f3xg4 is met with e3+ and 21. Kxd3 is met with e5-e4+ opening up the diagonal for my Bd6 to his queen on g3.
I played this to win the queen.
And now mate finished him off! Many thanks for reading this, please rate it on the star system and leave a comment or two!
if i lose one guard, I lose control of the center of the board.
if I made one mistake. it was this and the next few moves. I obliterated my shielding pawn 'structure'
I didn't want to take e5, it wouldn't work: so I stall for time with a counter to Qxa2, eventually i just say to heck with whatever black does and go for it.
The best move is supposed to be N. Black perfectly  knows it but wants to try something else.
to  prevent Re8 pinning the knight.
Black counters
To devellop and attack the d pawn.
White cannot  protect the d pawn, 9. e5 was definitely a mistake,  so that 13. h3 to prevent 13. ... Bg4 or 13. ... Ng4
to link the a rook and the queen
Black is now 2 pawns ahead but his pièces are not develops so that white's plan is to attack quickly.
Minority attack. If 27. ...  bxa4 28.Qxa4 and black has 2 isolated pawns
Setting the rook on the open file to prepare a counter attack
The main danger is not the attack on f3 but the pawns on the queenside
Very good move. White is in serious touble for I cannot prevent black to play c2. The sacrifice of the black knight was a good one.
Black likes to copycat i can see!
Adding to the jumble!
And another!
I learned my lesson from last time, instead of unleashing my queen to check the king, I moved up her pawn to open her up from another side, and also her bishop. And I also pressure my opponent's pawn.
Now I bring up the bishop to pin the knight down...
...so he unleashes his bishop to unpin the knight...
...and I release my knight...
...at the expense of my bishop...
...and I also remove the exposed pawn...
...and the bishop...
...in exchange for my knight.
...and as he brings up his...
...I do likewise to my bishop to guarantee a win of at least one of the knight and the bishop.
...and now I fork the rook and knight.
Now I bring my rook onto the attack...
Doubling up on the bishop is fatal...
...as I push my furthest rook to the top rank...
?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development.
Black kicks the White Knight and aggressively establishes some space on the center. Whether he'll be able to hold it or not is another matter.
Threatening the Knight and developing the Queen to a surprisingly safe, effective location. Black intends to make the very most of his half-open f-file.
I can't find any literature for this move. I think 5.Qh5+ is probably stronger (5...g6 6.fxg6 and now if 6...Qxg6 7.Qe5+ wins the Rook, so 6...Qxd4 7.g7+ Ke7 and White promotes on move 8, winning material and stymieing the potential Black offensive.
? This seems logical but I think it's actually too defensive-minded. It's intended to release Black's other Bishop, but I think advancing the d-pawn can wait while Black runs the White Knight out of town with 5...c5 6.Nb5 Qc6 7.Qh5+ Kd8. Now Black can play ...d5 and ...c4 at his leisure, driving the Knight almost off the board altogether while securing the whole center for himself and preventing White from developing either of his Bishops.
If 7...Qxg6? 8.Qe5+ wins the Rook and probably the game.
Black sacrifices another pawn in exchange for developing with tempo.
And another (b7) ...
Black's Knight blocks the vulnerable b-pawn and develops toward the center. With this move Black also prepares to castle long, getting his King to safety and bringing his other Rook into play. Another good-looking option was 11...Bh6, making White's developmental choices even more nightmarish by pinning his d-pawn.
White prepares his own castle and momentarily pressures the Nc6. I think c4 might have been a stronger place to develop this Bishop, in order to prevent a Black Knight from coming to d5 after Black castles.
All of Black's pieces are now in the game. His DSB needs a better square and h6 is still tempting (pinning the d-pawn), but Black also wants to leave the h-file open for pressure against White's upcoming castle.
White gains some much-needed play for his own QB and QN. He has the makings of a dangerous attack against the Black queenside.
?! This sacrifice doesn't seem sound at all to me, but it slims down White's queenside pawns and gives Black a big lead in space, at the cost of half-opening the c-file for a White Rook.
Black doesn't take the bait, instead positioning his Queen where she can support d4 and prevent the White Knight from charging up to b5 or c4.
The Knight finally gets off the a3-f8 diagonal and puts itself between White's attack and the BK, preparing to jump into action with a much more powerful post on d4.
?! I'm not sure about this move. Black's pieces are somewhat disjointed, and cannot defend both the Rook and the f-pawn in one move, but by pulling his Bishop off the h2-b8 diagonal, White relieves some of the pressure on the BK.
! Black's Knight leaps to a very strong centralized position, defending the f-pawn and gaining time to get the Rook out of the way as well.
Basically forced. Somewhere to keep pressure on the Black queenside would be preferable, but 20.Qg3 and 20.Qf4 both lose immediately to ...Ne2+!
Black can now casually lift his Rook out of danger, threatening to swing over to the Kingside for a devastating attack.
!? White threatens the dangerous Rh8, but this attack is easily-parried and White is starting to lose sight of his formerly-strong attack on the Black King.
?! Black eagerly offers a trade for the piece that can best defend White's kingside. If now 22.Bxg7 Rxg7 Black has dangerous-looking attack down his half-open kingside files, but the Nd4's position becomes fairly tenuous and White may have a terrific attack through the center.
No attempt to maintain the Knight on d4 is feasible, because of 24.Rc4.
Black struggles to keep his counterplay alive, threatening to clean up some White pawns with tempo, or otherwise tempt White into weakening his kingside fortress.
This defends against 25...Qxh2+ 26.Kf1 Qxg2+, but now White needs to keep a careful eye on his weak h3-pawn, as it is only defended by the Queen and allowing a Black Rook to open the h-file would be devastating.
! Black's Knight returns to the center with a multitude of threats. The primary danger is that the threat on the WQ leaves her with very few locations to retreat to from which she can still defend h3. The Queen is also the only defender of f3, where the Knight is looking to deliver a nasty check, so 26.Qd2 and Qd4 (thinking to trade off the powerful BQ) are impossible.
?? Overly concerned about the pin and various checking possibilities for Black, White completely forgets about the immediate threat to his Queen. Best was probably 26.Qe3 Nf3+ 27.Kf1 Nh2+ 28.Ke2 Qxe3+ 29.Kxe3 Rxg2, where White will be a pawn down but with decent positional compensation.
? Not that it matters, but White certainly can't afford to drop a Rook as well.
Oops, this leaves the bishop undefended.  Black should play QxBc4.
White splits black's pawns by trading bishops.  Split pawns are harder for black to defend.
Black has more power here (bishop plus knight), this sacrifices the knight for nought.
Withdrawing cover for Pf4 gives black this pawn.  White's black bishop cannot compete against black's knight and bishop.
:(. Nc2 forks the rooks.  But black must push the white bishop first.
Black ignore's the bishop.
And now we arrive at the Richter-Rauzer Attack.
6. ... Bd7 is the Larsen Variation of the Richter Rouzer. Black adds a defender to his knight on c6 which frees the b-pawn to advance. 7. Qd2 is a far more common move for white, but the DB says 7. Be2 has a better win percentage and a lower draw percentage, both of which appeal to me, so I take the DB's advice. Frankly, I see no benefit of one over the other, and since 7. Qd2 is often met with 7. ... Nxd4 which gains a tempo for black, I decide to go with the better percentages.
Now we're out of the DB and out of my book as well. This move makes a direct attack against the black pawn on d6, a pawn that is a little problematic for black to defend.
One knight had to retreat, no reason to retreat them both.
Keeping pressure on black's kingside pawns while clearing a way for a rook on the half-open d-file.
But then something better comes along. White finds a way to harry the black king.
And now black has done something strange and dangerous. He brought his queen and queen's rook over to the kingside and then marched his king over to the indefensible queenside, almost bereft of defenders, just asking for white's better-centralized forces to come a calling. A king needs defenders.
25. ... Rc4?? was a bold move that seals black's fate. Now white's bishop and queen have free access to the black king, and white will add a rook on the open a-file momentarily. Black is already doomed, but just how doomed is yet to be seen.
The pawn on d5 only gave the illusion of defending the king. Black has nothing better than to accept the sacrifice.
And now the nail in black's coffin. With his queen too far away to come rescue the king, black has no solution here. Not 29. Rhc8 Qa7#. Black might try 29. ... Ra8 30. Rxa8 Kxa8 31. Bxc6+ Kb8 32. Qb6+ Kc8 33. Qc7+ Kd8 34. Qd7#. Everything else loses faster, so black resigned.
doubble effect: Bh5 has no more harm and K can now move to e2
and another exchange...
Brunswick choses to defend the f7 square
Pressuring the pin
Black hopes for an exchange of queens and also unpins it's horse
Hi everyone!  My first post-Xmas annotation and what a way to start with a win!  I am playing in a mini-tournament with people in my own rating bracket which is a real test of whether that 1700  rating belongs to me or not.  Actually I have got off to a reasonable start, winning 2 games and drawing one.  Those wins pushed my rating above the 1750 mark for the first time in my chess career.  Here is the latter of the two.
4. ........... d6 - after a standard Ruy Lopez I decide to reinforce my e5 pawn.  A drawback of this move is that white can still play Bxc6 inflicting a queenside pawn bust-up - although on the upside I will have the bishop pair.
13. h3? - a natural move but this allows an exchange on f3 - normally not a good idea but here it is very appropriate as white is about to drop a pawn!
19. ......... Bxf6 - Fou Lenoir retreats to f6 to dodge the enemy steed's attack but maintains pressure on the b2 square.
21. ..... Kf8 - both kings move towards the centre to prepare for the coming endgame.
24. .......... Ra7 - over the last few moves I decided to advance my queenside pawn majority.  I did allow white's lsb to nest himself in a dominant position, but my move Ra7 dodges the enemy bishop's attack and prevents and invasion of that same bishop onto b7.
29. .......... Rc7 - after some manoeuvering over the last few moves I try and eject the enemy bishop out of my camp.
31. ........ Rdc7 - not wishing to relinquish control of the d file I decide to double rooks on it.
36. .......... c4 - pushes my c pawn one square closer to Glendadom and opens up a line of attack onto the white a pawn isolani.  That pawn cannot be defended, white's best try here is to play a4 attempting to break up my connected queenside pawns, but ......
37. Nd6?? - let me tell you something!  If you are a pawn down in an endgame and you VOLUNTARILY exchange down into a pure K & P endgame, let me tell you three things, it is SUICIDE, SUICIDE, SUICIDE!  This proves to be so because you are many times more likely to fall into a zugzwang (your turn to move but whatever move you play worsens your position i.e. losing material or allowing your opponent to checkmate you) than if you have another piece on the board.  Now here is how, you, with the material advantage, can exploit such play.
44. ......... axb5 - I am happy with this exchange as I now have 2 connected passers.  Henry looks down to b1 and c1 and thinks "Not long now" - Boy, isn't he a happy man!
48. .......... Ka4 - there it is!  White has now completely run out of pawn moves and his king must now give ground, he can only go backwards if he wishes to halt those pawns.  I am not to be denied though!
50. ......... c3 - closer and closer.
53. ........ c2  - I set up a couple of conditional moves before turning into my pit.  The white king has only 2 legal moves, a1 and c1.  If a1 then Glenda will appear dealing instant death on c1.  If Kc1 then Henry moves to a2 and then the white king has only 1 legal move, d2.  He can take the c2 pawn if he wants to, but there is no stopping that b pawn!  I wake up the next morning to a white flag from my opponent and a 1760 rating!  Marvelous!
Hmm... I think it's better to play Qf6 and then dxc6.
Defending with tempo.
Putting pressure on d6. If black had played 9..b5, this move wouldn't be possible.
The weaknesses in the black camp are easy to see, and I aim to exploit them. The gaping d5 square is the most obvious focal point.
Probably better is Be6, with some protection of the d5 square.
Black has no winning chances, down a piece and soon to be two pawns. he resigns.
Dubious, but necessary to bring a place for the dsb in case of Nh5.
Needed, to save the bishop.
To make h6 weaker.
Black must be astonished. What am I doing, throwing my pawns before castling and even free the lsb?
Foresees to take advantage of e5 after the exchanges to come.
Without fear: if Nxe5, Bg7, Nc5 (only one to save a piece), and maybe I still have an attack (Qxe4...)
Guarantees a BxR exchange, at some point.
Anyway, e3 is on the "to do list".
No point in exchanging queens. I'm not sure this is the best square for it.
Anyway, I must go on with the h pawn's threat.
The key. Now, I threat Qf8+ AND h8=Q+... Black can pursue me with Rg1+, Rf2, Qxc2+, KxR, but black doesn't have a perpetual due to the rook, the queen etc.
...then develop our knights, mine to defend my pawn.
...and I accept his knight...
He retreats his bishop...
...and I attack the queen...
...and bring up my other bishop to contest the f4 square...
...allowing his rook to advance to my 3rd rank...
...and I castle kingside to unpin my knight...
...and his queen advances onto the a2-g8 diagonal...
He moves his rook to expose my king...
...then we swap black-square bishops...
...and lose my pawn...
...allows me to pin her down to the e-file...
...and I remove his pawn...
...so I also retreat my rook to the second rank...
...and he enforces the exchange.
...and losing it to the pawn???
So my king moves back to marshal the c- and d-pawns...
...and as his king hunts down my a-pawn...
Now I do likewise to my h-pawn to stop his from getting too far...
...and I now attack his h-pawn...
...but he declines to take my g-pawn...
...so my pawn removes his and has a clear run. This game was littered with so many mistakes, especially schoolboy errors, and I was extremely fortunate to emerge victorious.
I was not expecting this. Normally the move would be to capture the black pawn on e5.
Just a trick to start my combination. White might have expected this, but if he did, then he didn't deeply explore move. Or he didn't thing that I would sacrifice the Bishop. The best move now in my opinion is now D4. You can't let the Bishop get access to F2 if you still haven't castled.
Start of the blitzkrieg that would give Black a decisive advantage. best move for white is now Kf1. This would limit the damage, and gain time to defend.
clearing the way for the black queen to dance.
This was not all that great. It just exposes the king further, and pulls white to defeat.
What else?! black now has to attack to keep white off balance.
The capture of the pawn would only have lead to early defeat. if 11. Kxd5 then c6! and the capture of the knight.
gaining even more time! the night now has to be abandoned.
only move... the King can't head to the hills.
the only logical way to follow up the attack, and gains the bishop, though if white was concerned, he would've resigned by now.
only move, and incidentally, sets up a trap. if 15. ...Qxa1?? then 16. c3! and the queen is trapped!
bringing even more pressure, if that is possible. This would be an absolute nightmare to defend against.
an attempt to break open the shelter (17. ... a4 18. bxa4? bxa4 19. Re1 Qb5 ! 20. Kc1 a3. though white can escape by 21. Nxa3 Rxa3 22. Qc2	Rf-a8  23. d3	Rxa2       24.	Rxa2	Rxa225.	Qb1	Qxb1 26.  Kxb1	and  black has the advantage, but the attack has ran out of steam, but has an extra piece.  Best move now is 17. b4, which seals the position right up, and allows white to escape.
best way to prosecute the attack
aiming for mate. white has to take the pawn or move his queen. if he moves his queen, then eventually, he has to lose it or trade it in check. even then, it only prolongs the agony. Black will win no matter what.
Bilek decides to go on the offensive.
Now Malich's Pawns are split and he has a weakness on the King file.
Malich must do something to dispute Bilek's control of the board and K file, or he will be squeezed to death.
Bilek's attack is gathering steam. Malich can to nothing but wait for the inevitable.
Malich hopes to break the attack by exchanging down.
I am at a loss for finding this opening anywhere. I'm down to Queen's Pawn Game or Closed Game being my best options. So from here, I'm just winging it. White bumped his queen up to d2, let's make her move twice and commit herself to the center where I can pick on her a little.
Since the LSB is going to d7 soon, no need to worry about blocking him in just yet, and I may have need of the DSB, so I open him up and prepare to castle if I wish. However, in light of the next few moves, I may have been better off with Nd7.
I panicked a bit here. White has a strong attack and my queenside seems full of holes. White's knight threatens the fork on c7, supported by his bishop. But he also blocks his queen's pin on the black knight at c6. I wanted to play 6. e5 instead of 6. e6, but with the knight pinned, e5 wasn't available. Now it is.
Evidently white wants to kill the black rook something fierce.
It's double-check, nothing for it but to move the king and lose the rook. Well, lose the exchange because I will get that knight.
Defend the d5 pawn and prepare to kill that impertinent knight. White's choice to castle may have been a mistake. Instead, 11. Qb5 looked fairly strong, putting pressure on the pawn at b7 and making it very difficult for black to move his bishop off of c8. 11. ... b6 wouldn't help much - after 12. ... Be3, white could play 13. Nxb6 and gain two pawns for the loss of his knight, ending up way ahead in material.
After all that, the material is about even, and white has developed a queen and rook and castled into a broken castle on an open file. Black has developed two knights and a bishop (and has developed his king, though maybe that's not yet a good thing).
White attacked the knight at d5, black brings it to safety.
Getting the queen out of the corner, and threatening to win the white queen with 16. ... Nb4 , 17. Qc3 (or lose the queen) Nxa2  and wins the queen anyway.
White forked the black king and the bishop on a2, but black had a move all prepared to handle that.
White is still tragically underdeveloped. Eliminating the royal ladies leaves black way ahead in development, and ahead in material, and with a strong attack against the paralyzed white kingside.
A little exchange sequence that wins a pawn for black. It also leaves an isolated white pawn on d3.
Exchanging to exploit black's material lead.
Open the line for the bishop.
Rook on an open file, planning to wreak havoc on the 7th.
And now it's smooth sailing with a relatively easy two-pawn-up endgame. The black bishop controls the promotion square for black's a-pawn, so that's the one I want to promote first.
White just won two pawns for one, closing the gap in material, but the black king is in position to annihilate white's remaining pawns and there's not much white can do about it.
Keep the white king away from the black pawns. If 47. Kd8 f5, 48. Ke8 Be7 traps the white king. Black is free to play a 3-on-2 pawn endgame, as long as he doesn't kill both white pawns and end in an immediate stalemate.
Dancing. Whit's g-pawn cannot advance now. Black can now play 49. f5 and exchange one pair of pawns, isolating white's remaining pawn.
Dancing more - that Bishop Can Dance! Now white cannot advance either pawn. Right where black wants them.
Save the bishop.
It's easy when the bishop covers the square on which the pawn will promote. The opposing king cannot claim the promotion square and hold out for a draw.
It's worth noting that on the next black move, the c pawn cannot yet be taken(Qa4 checks and attacks c4 if black tries to grab the pawn), but I was playing quickly, and decided to protect it with the pawn and fianchetto my bishop. I'm sure there were more accurate moves than what I made.  And goflb, about the N defending A4, it goes without saying that ...Nxc4 Bxc4 Nxc4 leaves the a4 square undefended for Qa4, which results in black losing the minor piece, this is why c4 cannot be taken.
Black wastes no time in fianchettoing the dark-squared bishop.
This move was made to prevent Nf3+ with the black bishop on g7. At this point, I don't like white's position. Perhaps there isn't anything obviously wrong, but instinctively I don't like it, especially with my King exposed.
So much for preventing that. I guess black decided he wanted the pressure sooner rather than later. Not sure that was necessary. Perhaps black was afraid of losing a tempo somewhere if I were to take instead. One thing I like about the white position is the other black knight is not doing so much right now.
But instead, I thought to immediately hit at Black's King. 'Why not' I thought. I didn't care about my queenside so much if I could expose black's King.
Black is looking mighty good in this position. Great queen side pressure, and a safe King... while I am more cramped than it appears, and suddenly doing nothing at all. After thinking about it, I decide to offer up my rook...
My thought was that I really wanted to get rid of that white bishop, and then sacrifice the white bishop against the kingside pawns, and then bring the knight up; a tempo would be needed by black before black could move the bishop, and I hoped to get pressure on the black king for the exchange. However, black decided he didn't want that rook yet, although I think he could have grabbed it and had enough time to defend. Someday I'll learn to use computer programs to analyze these positions and learn from them, rather than simply playing them and not studying them. So, before thinking of grabbing the rook, black made a quality move that totally gave me pause:
This move changed my mind about the rook sacrifice because now black will be able to control e6 too, and if the center opens up, were I down an exchange, the mobility on the board would wipe out any potential positional benefit... and black's king could also be protected better without black being cramped. So, without calculating... well, heck; I did not calculate ANY  moves this game until the end, and even then needed help for it to work; so, I played simply for opportunities to control squares and create weaknesses. But this opponent was no slouch, and inevitably began about now to do that to me!
Anyone who looks at this annotation... where would you have played the rook on b1? e1 may have been better, or perhaps even a1; but I did not want my rook on the f file to be completely hemmed in, and I was at this point still making plans on the Kingside...
Black kept trading a bit more; why not, since he's up the exchange...
Looks very bad for white now. Of course I should avoid trading pieces. One thing of note, however, is the loss of the exchange is not hurting yet. The black bishop was a great defender and attacker, and now it's gone, while the black rooks are not yet busy. What to do now...
At this point, I pondered moving the Knight to d3, but worried that any thing I did against the black kingside would be way too slow. So I pushed the pawn.
Bye bye, Knight. Black is winning overwhelmingly in material at this point, and he's rated nearly 2000. Black's King is under some pressure, however. The compensation is not enough for white, but at least the game's not boring! Play continued, and black really doesn't have time to snatch all the white pawns now which he could have had I moved my knight. For now, black's counterplay is not yet fully begun... hah. As if he needs it... or does he?
Well this I did without thinking. I don't know if there was anything better, to be honest. White just doesn't have an attack that can break through easily with black controlling the a1-h8 diagonal. The white rook needs to be part of this, and it will take too long... shouldn't it?? To reply to the comment, you're right it's not enough, because now the pressure on black's king has weakened to the point that it appears white's attack fizzles and black simply can begin munching pawns or working up his own attack. Accurate play by black is simply a won game. That's the problem with Blitz play, isn't it. ;)
This is not bad. Yes, the rook is at the moment only defending, but the Knight will go to a8 and then to c7. And in this position, that knight will be very strong, because if black succeeds in trading his knight, white's attacking chances will evaporate, AND that black rook will then move to an immediately useful square. But, there is a more interesting move: Ra1! If ...QxN, then Rxf1+ Kxf1;  Qa1+  Ke2; Qb2+ and although I did not bother to think about what comes next, it looks very bad for white. Just as bad for white is ...Rxa1 Qxa1+ Kh2 Rh8+ Kg3 and Qe5 forces a queen trade, after which black wins with a rook and knight vs the bishop. Fortunately for me, black missed Ra1+, intent on getting his Knight into the game. If Ra1, white's position is hopeless. But now white can play on a little longer...
Here comes the knight. Now, in chess, it's important to have a plan. In a blitz game, we can't always see everything on the board; and so, black continued with his plan, a good plan. He had many to choose from. At this point, I had finally begun to calculate, and had foreseen what I hoped would happen, and what actually did happen.
This is another fun position, easily avoidable by black but his plan was to activate the knight, by golly. Here is where black panicked a little, and instead of calmly taking the bishop with the knight, he moves Rh8!? Instead, after Nxe6 Qe6+ Kf7 dxe6+ Ke8, white has to return to the defensive, and again black easily wins.
So I of course knew that the white rook was untouchable, and after I took the black rook, he quickly realized this and quit in disgust at himself. (Rxh8+ Kxh8 Qh6#) Play might have continued...
Pg5 might actually turn out better for black.  We could have ...Pg5 Rg8+ Kh6 and it looks like black can play on only a pawn down. Qc1 threatening Qh1 of course fails to ...Ra1 still a useful rook move for black. Now if black takes the Bishop, things get interesting...
Here black must take with the King; (Qxe6 Qf8#)
Rf8! And with this move, g6 will fall next, and depending on where black moves, mate follows or black loses too many of his pawns, and white wins.
Qd4 is better, because it puts pressure on f2 and protects the d pawn later on. Not sure if Qb2 was an option to keep pressure on f2 and attack b3. Still think Qd4 looked better. But I put it here where the queen is not doing anything useful for black, and did not feel like redoing this annotation to show the better position. It's late, and I'm tired. EDIT: And now if I fix the annotation, comments at the end would be lost. Qd4 or Qb2 is much better for black, and the endgame uncertain. But I'll leave this as it is now, so no comments are lost.
...Ke5 leads to mate, so...
Now Ke6 leads to mate via Qc8+ Ke5 Qf5+ etc.
And at the least, two more black pawns fall, and with some care, white has a won game. But this was more fun than looking at Pg5, wouldn't you say? ;)  A very fun blitz game. EDIT: Early I spoke about Qd4 for black as being better, and perhaps it is. But it looks like black's chances for winning remain slim although a perpetual might be very possible. Anyone gets to this point, still would like a comment as to where white's rook should go on move 16.
Here is a mistake by Black.  Instead of developing a piece, as would seem natural, Black pushes a pawn.  To further cramp his position, Black has also occupied the natural square for the b8 knight.
This pawn move, on the other hand, works well.  It reinforces the center and  gives the f1 bishop a developing move, clearing the way for 0-0.
Trying to open space for the cramped knight on b8.  White will not capture because of 8. cxd5 cxd5, and then the knight has regained his natural square on c6.  Also, Black should not capture on c4 because that will allow the bishop to develop while capturing, and gaining a tempo for White.
Black is trying to simultaneously create an outpost for his knight and open a space to move his pawn to drive away the knight on e5,...
? Another mistake from Black.  He trades his centralized Knight for a nonactive bishop, while allowing white to strengthen his center again by placing another pawn on c3.
Black continues to try and harass White's light-squared bishop, but with disastrous results.
White seizes the tempo, and predicting 13...a4, White sets up a mate threat after 14. Bc2.<n><n>Also, look at the difference in development.  White has castled safely, connected his rooks, and is already forming mate threats.  Conversely, Black has 3 pieces on their home squares and has made 5 pawn moves in the first 12 moves of the game.  You tell me who you think is winning...
And as I noted at the beginning, this is the blunder that finishes the game.  Black tries to drive the knight off of it's powerful central square, but neglects the mate
I decided to try the Vienna Game.
Other good moves are f4 and g3, as well as Nf3, transposing to the Three Knights Opening.
Since he undefended e5, this is the natural response.  If Nxf3, Qxf3 threatens scholar's mate and gives me the edge in development.
In addition to gaining the pawn, this threatens Nxf7.
Threatening to win the queen with Nxc3 .
If Nxe2 Qxe2, his attack has lost it's bite.
Preparing Qd6 for an attack on h2?  Probably actually preparing what happened in the game.
I wanted to get my king out with O-O, but that would lead to 9...Bxh2  10. Kxh2 (Kh1 Qh4 looks bad) Qh4  11. Kg1 Nf3  12. gxf3 Qg5  13. Ng3 (to avoid three-fold repetition, I failed to notice Kh2) Nxg3 14. fxg3 (I failed to notice Re1 ) Qxg3 , with three-fold repetition to follow.<n>So I'll get my knight out of danger and threaten the bishop.
I figured he was attacking my bishop with thoughts of attack, but not an immediate plan.
This was a foreign move to me in the Ruy Lopez.
Black provokes the bishop to either exchange or retreat.
I decided to exchange it.
I was not eager to trade my e pawn as I believe it was contributing more on its own than my d pawn. Of course I had to do something about 13. ... d4.
And so I move the bishop to attack the knight.
The white knight on b1 is looking a little silly as it will take several more moves to get it to a square where it will be useful.
Preparing both to bring the queen into the attack and to place the knight on a better square.
The attack on the black king has begun.
Black has acquired control of the g file and turned the attack around.
The pin on the g pawn has been released.
Black is looking to double up the rooks, strengthening the assault he has on the white king.
Still it seemed reasonable to eat up that pawn and bring the material points back to even.
The queen can simply capture the unguarded bishop.
Both sides must have realized that if Black does not move the king, the white knight will come to h5 and the queen will checkmate on g7 the next move.
However, the black rook still has no safe square to which it can move, and if it does not move, the queen will take it and checkmate the king.
Black is trying to open lines for the attack on g2.
The out of position bishop is threatened.  Black aims to prevent loss by posing threats in other areas.
Rxa2 was the move when the game ends in a rook endgame with an extra pawn to black.  This simply loses.
I didn't mind the exchange. It allows for my dark squared bishop to get into the action.
I was planning on castling on the king side so I did not hesitate to advance my pawns with tempo.
It would have been a better idea to develop my knight protecting my d4 pawn and allowing me to castle.
Controlling the diagonal with my queen a bishop became the theme for the rest of the game. It made it dangerous for my opponent to castle on the king side but Bf7 would prevent him from castling at all.
He tried to counter with a similar idea but he would rather leave the diagonal than to expose his king.
Since I was late playing b5, the bishop had a flight square.. But I was determined to win material.
Ne6! The pawn cannot capture the knight because Bxe6 would fork the king and the queen.
The bishop tries to escape but the rook pins him to the queen.
Putting a lot of pressure on the black king, plus threatening a discovered check to win the queen.
Here I was hoping that he would move d3+ because then it would open up the long diagonal so that my queen could checkmate.
He checks me a bunch until he eventually gets my rook pinned to my king then continues to defend the diagonal.
Forcing to trade queens by threatening checkmate (Rxf8 Rxf8 Qxh7).
Not what you want to see as the black king.
I see that he can fork my bishop and rook but it is too late to save the game by trying to win my bishop.
He takes the bishop, hoping to take my rook with the king next turn. His efforts prove to be futile. Another, potentially better, move would've been Kc6 followed by Kb8 preventing my pawn from reaching the 8th rank.
i like to move this pawn, as it keeps it active, attacking the middle, instead of being blocked by Kc3. but now, having e4 and c4 at the same time on an oppening, is not a very good move. the d2 pawn is now obsolete with 3.  ..e5
obvious trade off. getting rid of an attacker. but oppening up opportunities for white to attack, as the bishops are now on their position to attack king side.
bishops is ready to snipe
0-0 and preparing rook for attack. at this point, black is still up a pawn.
after analysing the board, and with 1 knights and 1 pawn up, i can have another pawn for a trade with my bishop. and also open up some interesting mate possibilities. even if not, just a nice trade off.
backing up rook to move to b6.
i actually have winning chance here. by attacking the knights, forcing black king to help, and giving g and h pawn it's freedom. 48.Kd2, which prevented the knight to go anywhere, unless the king helps. 48. .. Kd5. but then, i can start moving my pawn 49. g5 and forcing the king to return, thus me getting the knight. but i was only fearing to defend and safe pawn instead of attacking. not focus.
a very good move by black. this prevents white king to go to the back rank.
another pawn is down. my chances are just with the g and h pawn. however it's harder as the black king is in a good position to prevent white king defending it's pawns.
still cannot take knight. but now attacking with c pawn, as it is closer to the back row. when it's close enough, then i can take the knight. and have the pawn race. but, mine is closer. and the black king is too far. i'm pretty sure black had some winning chances as well, but that's what playing more than 5 games with 3 days per move can make to your game. unless you stay focused, on every move.
Black chooses to control the center from afar rather than occupy it.
Preparing Queenside expansion, but Black's king is about to fall under attack.
Probably not a good idea to exchange dark-square bishops.
Black's doomed. Nh5 is coming. If ... gxh5, then Qxh7 mate.
If ... Nf5, Nf6+ ... Kh8 followed by Qh7#. If Kh8, then Qg7#. Black can't defend against the multiple threats.
I want to get rid of his bishop, so i will switch it with my knight
Now , "Follow the bishop" game
Got the bishop
and now open a space to my rock
i see a chance to get his bishop, and i have a chance again for my rock
??  Why would he want to open the e file with his King in the middle?
!! Trading a rook for 3 pawns, an open King and a fierce attack.  Pretty good deal to me!
Here black must defend f7 and d7 to avoid mate.  No feasible way to defend.
Black equalizes the material and threatens to capture the White KR.
Black counters by threatening to take Greco's checking Q off the board in case of a discovery.
Greco goes to his backup plan and finishes the game beautifully!
...then I take his queen to force his king out of his initial position, so he can't castle...
...and my last two moves allow me to castle queenside, instantly checking.
..then I fork its twin and his bishop...
...and remove it...
...and his knight forks my rook and d-pawn...
...and I lose my pawn.
...and he moves his king to unpin his knight...
...and I line it up with my bishop, along with his bishop...
...so I put my knight on the attack, in retaliation to being a pawn down.
...allows me to accept another pawn.
...I can accept another pawn with my knight, which attacks his rook, and exposes his king to mine...
Now I unleash my other rook to drive the king towards the side of the board...
...before doubling up on the g-file.
...and get the exchange.
Now I move up my king to eliminate his pawns...
...but at the moment, my king can only touch the a-pawn...
...but have to use a pawn for the second, to prevent my opponent 's pawn from reaching my bottom rank...
...so I use another to eliminate the last pawn.
...I can now push it...
Now I move my queen back to pin the king to my bottom rank...
...and move up my b-3 pawn to give my b-2 pawn room to move...
...and my opponent's king tries to escape...
...so I move up my pawn to keep the king boxed in on my bottom rank...
...and my king gets into the position for my queen to trap my opponent's king. If he hadn't resigned, he would have gone 59... Kb1, and I would have gone 60. Qb2#.
..thought this to be too early..Be2 seems natural, so i gain a tempo with the next move.
..thought this was wasting time..needed to activate more pieces...i.e black bishop, Rf1 or prepare for longer f4
..gain another tempo..helpful for black.
No need to take the bishop now, gain time and pressure the centre.
..i want to force off pieces as i am a piece up...
..i can afford the exchange down..and it also removes another piece
..at last, an opportunity to quickly force off more material if not end the game with a mating threat.
! If I take his queen then he can skewer my king and queen.
I trade, I am behind but I don't think it's enough to be too worried about.
My king runs away from his knight
Now I have to run from a castle too!
I decide to chase away his rook
? Pushes his king closer to the middle
?! I'm not sure I would have done that... It makes his g pawn vulnerable to my rook.
I blockade his pawn and threaten it.
It can't advance, if it does I take it.
I'm starting to lose hope, but I'm going to try my best.
If he takes my rook, then I take his rook and have a chance of a draw.
I was tempted to play Kh1 because then after he took my rook then it would be stalemate, I didn't notice that I could take his pawn.
I'm not so experienced whit the Marshall Defense, but black lets me take the d5 pawn. The Queen's Gambit Declined usually features 2... e6 defending the d4 pawn.
I decide to take the pawn on d5. Other lines feature Nc3.
As said white gains control of the center and forces black to move his knight for a third time.
getting his bishop out in order to castle. I think Be7 would be a little bit better because it is more defensive and gives the king side security since the kings knight is far away from the king side. Bb4 on the other hand is more aggressive but doesn't really endanger white.
I don't really need to play a3 here because if he takes the knight I would have a pawn on the c file and the center pawns would be safer. Bb3 prepares the castling and puts some pressure on the king side.
I'm not sure what the purpose of this move was. Maybe to secure the d5 square ? But I think it would be better for him to get the knight out or play with the queen side pieces.
I made this move, because I saw an attacking opportunity and therefor wonted to open my light squared bishop the diagonal. I knew that he could eventually play Nd5 but thought the risk is worthy.
He decided to make an exchange and I'm OK with it. I decided to take the bishop with the pawn because the dark squared bishop holds a nice diagonal and could help in an eventual attack on the black king side.
Black continues to develop his pawns, leaving the knight, the bishop and the rook undeveloped.
I decided that it was time to attack the king side and make a sacrifice since black hasn't developed his queen side pieces and has left the king side ill defended.
Whit this move he lost the game. Other possible moves : if Kh6 then 14.	Nxe6+ and he loses the queen, if Kh8 then 14.Qh5+Kg8  15.Qh7# and his best move which result isn't that sure Kg6. If he played Kg6 I thought I could play Qg4 and then either check him and take his queen or in order he moves the queen to use a series of checks and eventually win material advantage or mate him.
Here he resigned because if Ke7 then 19.Qxg7#.So white mated black only in 19 moves. Notice that black hasn't moved the queen and the other pieces on the queen side The thing I learned : always look for opportunities to attack the king side and develop the pieces equally.<n>Hope you enjoyed the annotation :)
Not a very good move giving a tempo to white bishop
And easy mate in 1
Hi everyone!<n><n>It has been quite a while since my last annotation but I have found time to annotate this game.  It was a Modern Benoni MT and in the middle game, Bwaa, who will be referred to as Bwaa because he has the same Christian name as my king, lost a pawn.  It was not very easy to make headway but, there was a sudden twist at the end.  We got into an endgame in jig time but there were enough pieces left on the board for Old Matey, the Chessic Grim Reaper to have a say in the matter.  Bwaa had put up his vacation flag to say that he had gone away for a long weekend and his queen travelled with him in his suitcase!  When they returned to the battlefield they were in for a shock for they discovered a very unwelcome intruder indeed.  I think I had better let you guys read on to find out who the intruder was and what happened next.  I will start the game after 5. ..... d6 which is the end of the themed moves.
8. ...... Nfd7 - this seems a strange move as it moves an already developed piece into a blocking position.  Here it not only blocks a check but it also blocks in Fou Leblanc.  However, it is one of the most recommended moves in the World DB so there is some deeper reason behind this.  Aha, it does open up the possibility of a queen check on h4 and the long diagonal for Fou Lenoir which may come in useful later on.
9. ..... 0-0 - Henry is tucked away on the kingside and there is a possibility of Re8 hitting at my pawn on e4.
11. .... Nc7 - so as Bwaa has declined this B for N exchange my knight pops the question to his bishop.  The bishop retreats.
20. ..... Nb5 - after a bit of scratching around I decide to improve the position of my queen knight.  If he takes this knight with his bishop it reunites my queenside pawns.
28. ..... Rbd8 - preparing to hand over the defense of the d6 pawn to a lower value piece.  As usual Glenda has a knack of being called upon to defend vulnerable pawns, hence her title Glenda the Defender.
29. ...... f5 - inviting a series of trades to relieve pressure on the e column.
31. bxc4 - after the queen knight has ceased to control c4, I now make the exchange.
33. Rxe4 - and so one set of rooks is now exchanged.  I now anticipate and prepare for a move such as Re6 by moving Fou Leblanc back to c8.  Now, how many people think that the WK is as safe as houses here?
37. ....... Qxc5?? - yup, I expect you are wondering - why two question marks for this move.  It defends his knight on c2, his pawn on d5, but, alas for bwaa, the Wicked Witch of the West has gone away on vacation with bwaa on her broomstick.  Now, on their return they are about to confront that unwelcome intruder who is ...........
39. ...... Qd1+ - once the Witch goes to b1 there is a very tempting much bigger piece of jewellery on c2.  But wait, Glenda now sees her chance to go for the crown jewels!
40. Qg1 - time to set the conditional moves, wait for it .......
42. ..... Bb7 MATE!! Yup, the innocuous Fou Leblanc returns to the a8-h1 diagonal to administer the last rites to King Bwaa.  The Witch is pinned to her other half and cannot block the check and therefore, despite it being an endgame, Old Matey has the final say here.  I am now playing two games with the white pieces against bwaa and I must play very well as he once got very close to becoming a Class A player himself in order to avoid him getting double revenge on me!  That's all for now folks - bye for now - Joanne
?! This move surprised me. I'm not sure what my opponent was trying to do here. Maybe attack my queen-side? I was also not sure how to take advantage of the move....
?? I didn't realize I couldn't take with my knight. I should've castled, put my rook on d8 and the played d5. Or played a6 first stopping the pawns advance and preventing the bishop or knight going to b5 in the future and then O-O, Rd8 and d5.
Attacking both the knight at d5 and the pawn on b7
Preparing to capture his queen with Ncb4. I'm not sure that 12. Qd7 is the best move because of 13.Bb5. Any suggestions as to what to do instead?
Could white have stopped the attack on the queen with the move 13. Bd2?
This game was over very quickly.  I underestimated the danger to my uncastled king when I tried attacking too soon.  My 11 yr old opponent quickly showed me the error of my ways.
So far, so standard.  My main alternatives at this stage were .... 0-0, ....Nbd7 and ....Nc6.  I chose this because I wanted to pin the e4 pawn against White's Q as quickly as possible and follow up with an attack on the Nc3.
At the time, I felt that this was an over-cautious response from White.  It gives Black time to catch up a little on development.  In retrospect it was a good move as it inhibited Black's scope for counter-attack.
Having delayed the development of this B, White now uses it to reinforce e4, enabling his Q to move and therefore enabling a future pawn advance and/or attack on g7.
I have had some nasty experiences castling on either side in this sort of position.  However, I think I should have castled before playing this thrust as I soon fall prey to a devastating exploitation of my weak kingside.
I wanted to set up an attack on White's king as soon as possible.  This move started to clear the c-file for heavy piece action and removed one of the key defenders of c2, also allowing me to respond to White's attack on my KN with another attacking move.
Now that Black has cut off his own B from its defence of the White squares on the Q-side, White lays claim to the c-file.
With this exchange, White starts to break open Black's precarious position.
I preferred this to taking with the Q as it enabled me to connect my Rooks.
now she can't take my E pawn
now she can not
an 'amazing' attack
then i can take the rook!
try to catch me!
I am not unhappy about this position.  With good pawn play, I might have a chance to bulldoze the center.
d4 also drives the B away, but allows Ne4.
I didn't want to allow the R's to double.
Black can't take the N because of Qxg7#.
After Kh8, Black loses a full R and still can't recapture because of the checkmate threat on g7.
Protects The pivot square And prepares To castle.
A sacrifice To Expose The King.
My logic here is that I gain a slight advantage if he takes the c pawn with his d pawn.  He can't advance to d4 because of my knight at f3.
I feel this weakens the castle unnecessarily, particularly when cxd5 is just as good if not better.  As a result, I gain a slight advantage in that I retain a pawn in the d file.
Buying time and countering the presence of the bishop.
Sometimes, I like to trade my knight for a bishop.
He doesn't object to the trade.
He opts to trade.
Similar to his earlier move, only in reverse.
Ahead 2, I'm happy to trade, even if it's a stronger pawn for a weaker one.  So, I set up to take the a7 pawn.
I don't know that I had a clear win, but he probably wasn't too happy about giving up that second pawn.  If we had continued, I would have tried to get the bishop and rook to work together on a weak pawn.  Good game kansaspatzer!
I decide to create an escape square for the bishop and am considering castling long
I guess black is thinking of playing c5, I'm having non of it and am going to start to charge down the king side
I am not sure of blacks idea here, but it allows white to continue
Surprise, and Black plays the very natural d6
Black moves the quenn away from the action
We're in main line Robatsch theory up to this point.  <n><n>In the Robatsch, Black delays or totally omits Nf6 in to maintain direct control over the long diagonal, restraining White's aggressive e5 push, and keeping f5 available. Risky perhaps because White is free to develop a strong centre at leisure and severly cramp Black's play.  <n><n>My opponent must be a Romulan...
The text is a solid, classical approach to the position. <n><n>But also possible is 4. Be3, followed usually by Qd2 (we will see this set up later). 4. f4 is also available creating a big pawn centre behind which to prepare for e5 -- but such a strategy also gives Black an easy target and just begs for over-extension.
WTF??? Well, okay, if that's how you want to be... Hiding behind your cloaking device, typical...<n><n>White usually plays 4... c6 here. Also quite playable are 4... a6 (best replied to with 5. a4) and 4... Nd7 (a thematic move in the Modern/Robatsch which prepares the break at c5 or e5, and further delays developing the King's Knight). <n><n>But it appears that Black is going to set up a double fianchetto and hope White over-commits himself. Excellent strategy against a Klingon.
Understandable, but 5 Bc4 might be better. I also don't mind 5 Be2 -- quiet, classical and always strong in closed positons...   <n><n>I was setting up to play Qd2 -> Bh6 to trade off the fianchettoed Bishop. Not a bad idea usually, but maybe a bit passive here considering the leisurely freedom Black is giving me to develop and set up.
My opponent's long-range scanners detect an unidentified vessel (actually a Bishop), heading for h6! Raise shields and initiate evasive maneuvers...<n><n>Black's ultra-prophylactic intentions are getting more obvious by the second. I am beginning to get a little annoyed. Must have some Klingon in me...
6. Bc4:  this is still the best move on the board according to my ship's computer.<n><n>But let's be fair to myself and say that after (if) Black castles short and I castle long, the plan (trading off the fianchettoed B), followed by a kingside pawn storm, isn't completely loopy. Still, it seems more logical to play to my strength -- a solid and powerful centre -- rather than disperse my energies on a flank attack.  <n><n>But Klingons love frontal assaults....
My ship's computer concurs with me here, probably because it also wants to maintain the strong centre formation. Another option is 7 d5, and after 7... c5 (or c6) then 8 dxc6 Bxc6 9 Nd4 Bb7 10 0-0-0 White's position is quite solid.
I was expecting 7... Nd7 or Nf6 here. Blacks ultra-passive strategy is really starting to get under my skin now. That was, I think, the point. Klingons are soooo easy to taunt!
?!  Castling, preferably Kingside, is probably best here. But seeing that Black hadn't commited to castling in either direction himself, I thought I'd avoid doing so, too, and launch an attack on the Kingside where his position is most vulnerable (my Q and B are bearing down, and that pawn on d6 exerts Q/side influence making a storm there not as effective). Not really a good idea, though, as we will see.
?!  Well I am persistent, if anything. After 8. g4, 9. h3 solidifying my pawn structure is correct at this point. But "Glory for the Empire! Damn the lightsquare weakness, full speed ahead!" is the slogan of this cause...
Crossing the neutral zone to exploit the light square weakness... and stopping me from castling short, by the way.
And finally I realise that it is a good day to die...   <n><n>Result: 0-1 and no ga'ak for me tonight.
Hi everyone!<n><n>About 48 hours after getting Freddied again I had a more pleasant surprise from Gameknot as I woke up this morning.  I had set up two conditional moves, both of them led to my opponent copping Old Matey and my opponent had played into one of them.  I may ask you, the Inquest Jury, to spot the other one and e-mail me the answer on a postcard.  This is the Annotations Project Part 2 and my second victory with the white pieces.  We start the action on move 8 where my opponent plays the virtually standard Kc6.
9. ......... e5 - my opponent likes my move (I have played this twice as black and won one game with it) so he plays it!
15. ...... Bg7! - develops his bishop to g7 - a strong move
16. Be3 - and I respond by clearing the decks.
27. Nd6 MATE!! - If black plays 26. ...... Kc7 instead of Kc8 there is a checkmate to be found.  An exercise for the Inquest Jury.  Spot the checkmate and if you are happy with your answer and would like to let me know then please send me a pm.  Cheers and bye for now - Joanne
No fear. If anything, Sting has the advantage in space.
Kasparov has caught up in development and neutralized the musician's former advantage in space. The position is roughly even.
Kasparov maneuvers his Knight to the K-side. N-B5 is now a positional threat, as it would force ...P-N3, weakening the Black K-position.
Sting brings his available forces to the K-side.
For whatever reason, my opponent didn't retreat the attacked Bishop, so I gladly snap it up.
...to double Rooks on the open file.
Solidifying my Pawns and making "luft", to avoid any future unpleasant tactical possibilities.
I offer to trade Queens. Black should decline with ...Q-B1.
With the Queens off the board, my job is simpler. As is the position.
Black wisely keeps the second pair on the board.
Time to get my Pawns and King into action.
I focus my B on the area of interest.
The idea is to lock the K-side.
I need to centralize my King now.
I try to induce Black to double his Pawns.
I gained a Pawn in the exchange.
The K moves to the theatre of action.
I force the K to retreat.
My King has to defend the K-side squares.
Now the Rook can't access my KR2.
Withe the Black K cut off from the Q-side, the Rook is overburdened.
Black can't be on both files at once.
i like the way it started: i am well protected, and i can concentrate on attack.
I am not sure this is very comfortable because the queen is expose to a Knight attack. But, till now, it is not very important, though i started to think about potential traps on d5
my goal was to push on this potential trap.
that is interesting, because black does not hesitate to attack, though the king is clearly not protected and two pieces are still waiting to get out.
the black position seems inadequate, though it is hard to find a real and concrete weakness. i have considered on sacrificing on g5 sometime, but 1) i was lacking of material; 2) it could have opened my own king side; 3) I had a better plan on queen side
too late for the black attack
so now my d5-knight is open. Bf7 was not better, though, for the loss of a pawn, at least it kept some activity
and everything seems open for my bishops and my precious knight. Was there a better place for the queen?
2 valorous pawns, a knight, two bishops and my queen are on the verge to attack an exposed king...
if bxa, then it is checkmate in very few moves. so, this was the only possible move. My knight has been brave and fell for the good of every one
i wonder, maybe i had to sacrifice the rook and take with the pawn... Not sure.
threatening the draw by three-fold repetition. Actually, i previewed this move, but didn't know exactly if my attack was still possible. Though i refused to stop it
hm, i had to chose where to lose the rook
and i can't take it back with the queen, or i lose the other rook
of course not Kc7, because it would give me a tempo when i take the knight... But mostly, it gives me... the queen: if Kc7, then Qxb6+ and whatever the king does the queen will fall after two or three moves.
prohibiting Kd7, giving me another tempo... and the queen
this is too kind: my light bishop can now take place in game
critical idea where black wants to develop his DSB bishop on the strong diagonal
Develops a piece and prepares to create an outpost on ...c5 later on.
lifting the rook and preparing for possible operations in the centre by supporting d6. The long term idea is to play ...e6 liquidating white's center pawns and creating possible tactic against white's king along the light squares with the queen on a8. Also with the queen on a8 taking on the white a-pawn is a threat.
Black continues to put pressure on a4 and build long term tactics on the a8-h1 diagonal.
Not only does this knight look strong here it hits at black critical square of d6. The tactical idea is that it inhibits ...e6
black is clearly wanting to play ...c5-c4 making room for ...Nc5. Tactically after a future exchange on ...c5 the rook is lifted and has a powerful c-pawn that is well supported by the DSB on g7 and rook on c5.
Of course I have prepared for this tactical idea by black and played Qc2, Nb5 and Bd2 making the journey of the black c-pawn a dangerous one.
The idea of Bd2 was in anticipation of ...c4 now ...Nc5 is short lived. This sets up a critical moment for black. As I see it black has two moves
!? this is the main move and if black can play it he would dearly love to play it. But can he? You see, the other alternative that I am sure is a novelty is the exchange sacrifice 16. ...Nb6 supporting c4 and adding another attacker onto a4. Which in my mind would force me to play the unwanted 17. a5 Nbxd5!? 18. exd5 Qb7 19. Qa4 Rb8 looks decent for black. But as this game progress you be the judge on whether 16....Nc5 is playable.
now the critical black c-pawn finds itself under attack. Slow but surely black's pieces get deflected away from a4.
because the c-pawn is threatened so is the hanging rook on c5. So black feels obliged to move the bishop off it's strong diagonal and onto a weaker one.
The rook invades black territory
the rook lands on the 7th rank with big plans
black allows Nd6 with the idea of getting the queens of the board.
with a passed a-pawn I am more than happy to exchange down to a simplified endgame.
Because of the innate power of the a-pawn I think 16....Nb6 with the aim of getting rid of the pawn was ultimately black's safest option.
and now starts the attack on queen-side.
My only goal here was to link the rooks
why not the bishop? because f5 has to serve as a heaven for the bishop, and first, I wanted to put my knight on d4...
here is my bishop, pinning the knight -well unless the knight checks the king, he cannot moves.
this is the move that gave me the idea of the combination that will follows. Though incorrect -leading to draw-, it gave me the win, thanks to a mistake by dear bravio.
second step: place the second bishop and prepare the place for my queen on g7
... after a rethinking, this helps me a little bit more, because it gives me a possible place ofr my knight or bishop on g3.
now the queen has to choose carefully its place, because there are a lot of threats everywhere
though I decided to continue my plan!
here is the mistake: if white had played g3, I think it was a draw. Now I win a piece.. and the game.
if Kxg3, then Rxe1 wins a rook.
I calculated that Bb3 was the best move. Rxc7 is pointless, as I can play<n>35.	Rxc7	Be5 threatning mate on f1<n>36.	g3	Rf1+<n>37.	Kh2	Nxd5<n>38.	Kg2	Rxd1 and after Rd7, I play Rc1 and all is loss for white.
Black makes room for his rook to attack on the g-file, I think.
attacked, by B retreats to set up a discovered attack on Black's king.
Najdorf Sicilian - though Black's game seems slow and White can usually gain an advantage in development and space, White will nevertheless be hard-pushed to find weaknesses in the Black position.
6...e6 can also be played here, and is more mainline [correct me if I'm wrong] than the move played. However, since this move develops a piece and prevents Nakamura from doubling pawns, it can hardly be faulted [though it does make it harder for Van Wely to get out his light-square bishop]
Nakamura plays a move usual for White in the Sicilian - a kingside pawn expansion which looks to generate activity kingside. White's logical course of action now would most likely be queenside castling, and perhaps Van Wely will be thinking about queenside castling too because of White's kingside activity...
...but does it need to be protected? I have annotated another game with this variation [between chess computers Rybka and Shredder] only Black has his knight on b8 and his pawn on e6  [in other words, Black had played 6...e6 instead of 6...Nbd7] here's the link to that game, by the way... http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/technological-brilliance?gm=32287
The poisoned pawn is accepted here as well, and after looking through both games, I can say with confidence that I would never take the pawn as Black! That's just my personal opinion though, because Black probably has some chances in this variation... just not in this game! :P
The obvious continuation, chasing the queen away, saving the rook and grabbing the half-open b-file. This rook will prove to be vital later in the game
!? Nakamura has his reasons for this capture, but it still seems like a strange move to me at first. The capture was not forced by any means, and the bishop pair would be useful in this variation of the Sicilian [from what I can gather, the poisoned pawn variation is counting on White having superior spatial advantage for the lost pawn] However, the motif for this will be revealed...
Nakamura uses his full centre to its full effect here, thrusting his e5 pawn forward. This is Phase One of his plan, as the d7 knight (now the f6 knight) no longer controls e5
Van Wely decides to exchange here before retreating his knight. As it turns out, this makes no difference to Nakamura's crushing attack later on
The safest square for the knight [other than g8, of course, but who would want to do that?] Now that the f6 knight [now the d7 knight] no longer controls d5...
! Nakamura's knight finds a snug home in the centre of the board! As well as centralising the knight, this move also threatens the standard king-rook fork. Easy enough for a Grandmaster player like Van Wely to handle... right?
another attack on the queen
The black queen's been doing a little step-dance of her own on the c5 and c6 squares... but why not Bxb7? It turns out that it doesn't fare too much better than Nakamura's shocker next move... 16...Bxb7 17.Rxb7 and all five alternatives to avoid Nc7+ turn out badly; 1)17...0-0-0 18.Bxa6! and Black is under enormous pressure! 2)17...Kd8 18.Nb6! and the knight on d7 falls, most likely with mate. 3)17...Rb8 18.Nf6+! Nxf6 [else Qxd7#] 19.Rxb8+ Qc8 20.Rxc8# 4) 17...Rd8 18.Nc7+! Qxc7 19.Rxc7 and 5)17...Rc8 18.Bxa6! and the threat of 19.Nf6+ Nxf6 20.Bb5+ cannot be stopped, as far as I can see... though if I've missed anything in these alternate lines, Black would probably have a saving line in 17...Rc8. If anyone can find a saving line for Black like that, feel free to comment :) Now...back to the move played. This move also stops Nc7+, and Nakamura gains nothing more with chasing the queen around. What's so bad about it then?
!! This shocking move end the game immediately - Black's queen is lost and Van Wely resigns. If 17...Nxb6, then White wins with 18.Nf6+, followed by 19.Qd8#. If 17...Qa4, then White earns a pretty mate with 18.Nc7#. A great example of the use of initiative and space... but where exactly did Van Wely go wrong? Was it the slight change in position from the Rybka-Shredder game that made the poisoned pawn on move 8 a highly toxic pawn? Or could Van Wely have gotten away with 16...Bxb7? Comments are very much appreciated on that matter. Until next time! - Alex
if 6.Bxf6, then 6.exf6 followed by Be7 and O-O gives black a solid defense and a good square for the rook
now Black's attack starts
opens the a1-h8 diagonal for the bishop
perhaps the sacrifice e5!? would have held the fort some moves longer...
2... Qxd5 is a perfectly reasonable alternative, but I hugely prefer this move, it prepares a bunch of gambits from the one in this game (the portuguese) to the icelandic with 2... Nf6 3.c4 e6.  Also it plans to retake on d5 with the knight instead of the queen.  There is a maxim about not bringing out your queen in the opening, this move follows that idea as 2... Qxd5 loses tempo to 3.Nc3.
This initiates the portuguese gambit, black develops with tempo.  If white blocks with a piece black will regain the pawn and have a slight development lead to counteract white's good center, an approximately equal (and usually dull) game.  If white wants to play ambitiously he's forced to play the following weakening move.
Taking the knight now that black has expended a tempo "putting the question to the bishop" is probably a better idea.  Now black plays an explosive move in order to give his pieces activity.
Black is happy for white to take on a6 as it gives him an a file to attack upon.
Strangely enough, white can blunder the game in this position with a normal move, after the apparently natural 10.Nc3 Nb4! when black will strike on d3 with his knight (or if white plays 11.Bb5 Rb6 12.Bc4 he'll infiltrate on the equally valuable c2 square).
Black prepares to conclude development.  I think it's time to take a step back and give the position a look.  I have an obvious development advantage and a target in the IQP (isolated queen's pawn), as well as having instigated the weakening f3 from white.  I also have two open files in the a & b files.  White has an excellent bishop on a4 that pins down black's knight, and thus my queen (in order to defend the knight).  I need to use my advantage in time effectively, this means I should play pressuring moves, but it also means I should NOT trade.  I've spent a lot of time developing my pieces and if I trade one for a piece white has just developed it'll be a loss of time.  My plan is to castle quick and attack white's game.  His plan is to trade his undeveloped pieces for my strong ones.  However, he shouldn't trade his bishop for my knight on d7 yet as it pins me down.
White follows his plan, preparing to trade.
I also play the thematic move, this threatens 12... Nd3  and avoids a trade.
This may seem counterintuitive as I'm allowing white to trade off his IQP, however, even more then I want him to have weaknesses I want to activate my pieces, especially when they come with gain of time via a check (13.dxc5 Bxc5 ).  And where else will my bishop go?  On e7 it's fine, but a little passive, and on d6 it's a target of eventual moves like Ne4.
White has to undermine my strong d3 square by underming the defending pawn on c4.
The other option is 16.Bxf5 Nxe2  17.Qxe2 cxb3 where black has regained the pawn and it's passed!  Also a3 is hanging, this seems much better as my opponent forces exhanges without giving back the material immediately.
Sadly, I have little choice in the matter, where can my bishop go?  And I don't want him to take my bishop, doubling my pawns and opening the e file.  Perhaps 16... Bg6 preparing to open the h file if he takes is better.
I want to castle as quickly as I can.  We've gotten through most of the middle game and I'm STILL down a pawn.  So I think it's time for another look at the board.  I'm targeting the a pawn, and white is tied down to it.  He also has to worry about the weakness of the IQP.  An IQP is usually helpful if you can use it in an attack, but that's unlikely here so it's a target for me.  The pawn on f3 is still a problem for white as it opens an annoying diagonal against his king.  In an open game I also have the advantage of still having a bishop on an open board.  This is my compensation for being down a pawn, is it worth it?  I don't know.  I think it's interesting though, that I've had compensation for the pawn from move 3 until now.
A VERY double-edged move.  White tries to rid himself of a weakness and open the e file.  On the other hand it opens up the a7-g1 diagonal for me.  It also opens the a1-h8 diagonal.  It trades off a weakness but in return weakens the dark squares.
White's trying to activate but the position is an open one, where his knights will become targets.
He misses the win!  After 22.Nxe6 Nxb3 23.Nxd8 Nxa1 24.Nc6! Bf6 25.Ne4! and white will trade off black's bishop, going into a pawn up endgame which should be a reasonably straight forward win.  This move is one from the green eyed monster school of thought.  The white queen, which has been on a side that's been constantly pressured, grows jealous of my queen.  She's willing to give herself up to end my queen's life... Aside from bad lines about green eyed monsters, this move makes sense as white still wants to trade.  The one problem is 22.Nxe6 wins.
White removes his rook from the attacked square and it pressures white's biggest advantage (the outside extra pawns) and biggest weakness (it's an isolated pawn on the line of my bishop).
This move places a rook on an important file, but I think the trappy 25.Nb5!? may be better.  Afterwords my oppones said he looked at it, but thought it was bad after 25... Bxh2 !? 26.Kxh2 Rxd5 however he's got a nice move at the end: 27.Nc7! forking rooks.  While black's not forced to play the bishop check I think it's a nice trap to toss out, and I could see myself falling for it.
I add pressure to a3.
26.Nb5 was better and made more sense as it also attacks the bishop and defends a3.  However white has had to worry about little annoying threats the entire game, and here he begins to throw it away.
Now white has only one move to hold the position together, namely 28.Nd5 where I'm better due to the bishop but it's nothing close to a win.
The losing blunder, now white has to worry about two threats.  One is the hanging knight and the other is Bc5  winning the rook on a1.  Notice that the weakness instigated on move 3 has lasted throughout the entire game and allows for this final tactic.
The final point, white might be able to hold the endgame if he's only down an exchange, and with knights there are so many forks to worry about that it would have been difficult to prove, if it was not for this skewer.
White's prays for 32... Kg8 where he'll have time to retreat the attacked knight on f5.
But no.  There is a double attack on the knights and black wins.  While I can't claim that this game was the most accurate, it shows the way CONSTANT pressure and easy development comes in the portuguese gambit.  This isn't a crushing attack like game #1, in this game white doesn't grab material at every opportunity, the game shows another part of the opening, the constand build-up of threats that can last an entire game.  I hope you enjoyed the game, and please PM me with comments, criticisms and analysis.
Morphy was never one to accept gambits...
After 6.dxe4 Nxe4 7.Qd4 Qe7 Black has a comfortable game: 8.Be2 0-0 9.Bd2 Nxd2 10.Qxd2 c6! (10...Bg4 has also been played) 11.Nf3 (11.dxc6?! Rd8 12.Qc1 Nxc6; 11.0-0-0 cxd5 12.Bf3 Be6 and ...Nc6) 11...cxd5 12.0-0 Nc6 (Bardeleben-Blackburne, London 1895)
(!?) "Entirely in Morphy's style! We have here a splendid example of a POSITIONAL sacrifice." (Euwe) Later they began making this move automatically, occasionally also trying 6...exd3 7.Bxd3 0-0. But in the game Spassky-Bronstein (Moscow 1971) Black actually preferred 6....0-0 and after 7.Nxe4 Re8 8.Bxb4 Nxe4 9.dxe4 Rxe4+ 10.Be2 Rxb4 (a variation by Falkbeer!) 11.Nf3 Rxf4 12.Qd2 Qd6 13.0-0-0 Nd7 14.Nd4 a6 15.g3 Rf6 16.Rhe1 Ne5 17.Bh5 Bd7 18.Qe2 Re8 he gained a draw. Apparently, after 6...e3, without going into details, Spassky was intending somewhere to improve on Schulten's play...
Since Morphy won this game quickly, one does not feel inclined to critisize this move. Especially since after 10...Nxd5 11.c4!, as followed from my notes on the previous move, it is not obvious that Black can equalise.
Greedy and materialistic. According to Neishtadt, this was the decisive mistake, though Kasparov disagrees. Neishtadt writes, "White could have escaped from the pin, firstly, by 11.h3 Bxe2 12.Nxe2 Qe7 (12...Nxd5 13.0-0) 13.Kf2 (Kasparov: "In my opinion, 13.c4?! c6 14.dxc6 Nxc6 Kf2 Qc5+ 16.Kg3 Re6 17.Kh2  Rae8 18.Ng3 is more promising") 13...Nxd5 14.Re1 Ne3 15.Qc1. Secondly, there was also the more useful move 11.Kf2, after which it is not easy for Black to demonstrate that his initiative is worth the sacrficided pawn". According to Estrin, however, after 11.h3 stronger is 11...Qxd5! 12.Kf2 (12.hxg4? Qxg2) 12...Bx2 13.Nxe2 Qc5+! "with the initiative for Black" (although the position after 14.Kg3 is by no means clear), whereas perhaps 11.Kf2 is indeed useful: 11.Bxe2 12.Nxe2 Qxd5 13. Rf1 (13.re1 Nc6 14.Kg1 Qc5+! 15.d4 Qd5=) 13...Nc6 (13...Qc5+ 14.Kg3 Qh5 15.Nd4; 13...Ng4+!?) 14.Kg1 Qc5+ 15.Kh1 Ng4 16.Nd4 with a slight advantage.
(??) This REALLY is the decisive mistake, a move of roughly a third category player. Absolutely essential was 12.h3 Bxe2 13.Nxe2 cxd5 14.cxd5 Qxd5 15.0-0 with an extra pawn, for which Black has some compensation, but not more. Now, however, Black has an ENORMOUS lead in development and initiative along with an irresistible attack.
If 17.Ke1 (17.Kg3 Nf5+ and ...Qh4#), then17...Qh4+ 18.g3 Qe7 or 18...Re8!
6. Bd3 (adds protection to the e4 pawn)
10. O-O (from moves 7 to 10 we just continue to get our pieces out - the g7 bishop cuts right through to a1 and a lot of pieces can be lost to tactics there.
11. ........ dxe5 (after an exchange of pawns in the centre I retreat my knight to f3)
13. Qd2 (after Bg4 pinning the knight my queen moves to d2).  Black brings out his other knight and I move my bishop to h6 attempting to weaken black's castled position by exchanging bishops.  There then follows an exchange of bishop for knight reaching the position after 15. ...... Nd4.
16. Rh3 (gives added protection to the bishop on h6 and a kingside attack begins)
16.  ......... Qb6 completely throws me - OMG he is threatening a double check on f3 winning my queen and my b pawn is en pris - wait a minute, wait a minute, I can deal with both threats by playing 17. Na4, this attacks the black queen and defends the white b pawn so that if my opponent plays the threatened discovery it will merely result in an exchange of queens)
18. Q x h6 (black initiates an exchange of bishops).  His next move 18..... Qb4 is a nasty move to meet)
19. ......... Nf5 was nasty and unexpected because it attacks the white queen.  If I take the knight on c5 then 20 ....... Qd4  wins at least the exchange.  So I play 20. Qc1.
22. c4 (I move my c pawn to safety, away from the attentions of the black queen)
25. ....... Nf5 (over the next few moves black consolidates his position and has two heavy pieces on the d file - I double up on the e pawn with Qe2.  Black defends with Qd2 and the queens are then exchanged.
28. g4 (after the dust has settled I decide to harass the black knight with g4 and black responds by playing Ng7)
29. Nc5 (I try to complicate things by putting two of his pawns under the hammer, the e pawn and the b pawn).  I notice something else.  If he tries to get his b pawn out of the way I can play 30. Ne4 winning the exchange because if he does not play Rfd8 then I will play 31. Nf6  with mate to follow on h7 next move.
30. ......... R x a2?? - no he can't and now he pays with his king.  My Christmas has come early! I play 31. Nf6  and my opponent resigned after I announced 32. Rxh7# next move (an Arabian Mate).  Beware of knights - they can catch you unawares and give you knightmares!!  In my opponent's case it was Arabian Knightmares!!  After the awful shock of my game with Bob I needed this shot in the arm like manna from heaven!!
Better again was c3, even at a cost of cxd, cxd. It leaves my king without the queenside castling, but I will lose it anyway, and o-o-o is not a "must", anyway...
It seemed an ok attacking move for black, but he should have better played dxe3, since I had to recapture with fxe3, creating a weakness on e3 (BxN, BxB, Qxe3, Qe2, and I am in big trouble.
I welcome to lose another pawn to get rid of the d4 menace.
For some reason, black didn't want to play e5!
Trapping my rook, but no problem, since I can exchange it.
I don't want to open the way for the bishop with e4.
I can take it, but more sadistic was...
I enjoy a good French, and he plays e5, which, if followed by d5 and then d4 is the closed variation.
Trying to stake claim to the center.
Preparing to castle.
Getting ready to fianchetto, and eyeball the Kingside.
He gets ready to Castle, as well; also to the Kingside. Huzzah!
And now that the Kings are safely tucked away, the battle begins.
I played this instead of Bb7 or Nc6 in hopes that he would take, trading his strong Bishop for my useless, rim-bound Knight.
And he obliges! Now I will have a deadly, unopposed light-squared Bishop in the corner!
Bringing heat on the King.
I am down by two, so I try to chase the Knight and bring out my Rook.
Trying to defend.
Too little, too late. Qh5 seals the deal, leaving the White King nowhere to run. (f1 is blocked by my Bishop.)
Boris Spassky used to play the white position in a similar fashion in the 60's. The Silicon Monster gives the position as a small plus for black but in the hands of a creative attacker.........
I looked at 9....b4 10.Na4 c3 but after 11.a3 a5 12.Nc5 blacks Q-side pawns are ripe for the plucking.
Looking to open lines and crash through blacks defences
Two pawns up Q-side majority a computer assessment of -0.83(after the game) for black. I began to fancy my chances of a Walk the walk victory.
Giving back a pawn to unleash my bishop on b7. 14....Qc7 was much better.
The best move centralising the Q and eyeing blacks k-side.Houdini2 gives this a -0.39 16.Qb4 a -0.62 and 16.Qc1 a -0.62
Contesting the c-file. Houdini2 gives the position as dead equal. It favoured 16.....Nb6 with -0-26 for black.
White begins to press and black panics.
18....Nc5 would have kept whites advantage to a minimum but worried about the coming attack black wanted pieces around the K-side.Houdini2 18.....Nc5 +0.07   18.....Nf6 +0.43
Black resigns. What can be learnt from this game? When the master got into a bad position he hung tough and remained optimistic and when his chances came he pursued the attack whereas black when things got tough started to play weakly before folding.<n>Lesson: Hang tough and be positive that way you're more open to opportunities that come you're way.
I've won a pawn but he has decent compensation (since I have to waste time and overextend my pawns to hold on to it). If he hadn't played h3 he'd be doing fine.
Grabbing a hold of the centre. This was unavoidable, however, I can undermine it through moves like ...c5 and ...Bb7 and ...b4 later.
Takes away a castling spot, but I'm winning material, and my rook on the open file combined with the bishop on b7 will make life very difficult for his king once he castles. This also allows my bishop on f8 to come out to h6
And the kings tucked away safely again. This is a strong place for the king because of my pieces on the queenside defending the open file.
Opening up the bishop again and allowing this rook to move over to the g file to help out.
There's no protection for the knight or the king, since my queen pins the f pawn to the besieged monarch.
And this allows a really nice tactic called a "windmill". The premise is, when my rook here takes f2, his king will have to go to g1 because of the check from the bishop. Next my rook checks the king on g1, forcing it to go back to h1, and then I can capture the next piece in the line. <n>This has the potential to wipe the entire board clear of enemy pieces, however here there is a much quicker checkmate.
Demonstrating the windmill.
Standard to cut down my bishop's diagonal.
If he *really* wants to he can take my pawn...
If I had moved my pawn again then he could have skewered my king and pawn.
smart. giving me double pawns and if he had played Ba5 b4 Bb6 c5 and i win the bishop
preparing to castle
attacks my bishop
he wants to get his queen to g2
? Lose bishop
threatens mate but i can take f3 because i am up a bishop and 2 pawns
probably trying to  play Rh5
Trying to get another queen
defends g3 and allows me to promote
about to queen
here I also thought i had lost the game and i was about to take with my queen but then I noticed my queen was defended by the pawn which would become a queen
i found this aggressive and strange move in the Database. As I'm experimenting, I'll try it.
Black has little reason not to take.
to fire the black knight and devellop
To fire the evil bishop
To prevent 13. Qf7+ mate
So that King Arthur can hide in his castle.
Black wins another pawn but his king his naked and white has plenty of attacking possibilities (it seems to be the advantage of this gambit).
"Send the war machines against the ennemy king"
developping and pressing
Carrying on the pressing.
Finally, black manages to develop. Most of his troops are regrouped in the corner but I do not see ho to carry on attacking, so that I decide to call for reserves. Perceval saddle his warhorse and rides to the battle.
Protecting the d pawn so that black cannot settle on the center.
Another possibility was 29. ... Kg5 30. Qg7+ with mating sequence to follow (white has to bring his knight on e4)
My club mate manages to draw with a German International Master - with black too!
There is some logic in b3 - if the Bc1 can't go to f4 or g5, may as well put it on b2 - however 5. Nc3 (and other moves!) are more common.
The point of Qc1 becomes clear - to exchange black's good bishop - but black's position remains fundamentally sound.
Richard comments that after 16. Nh2 he would have taken a draw with 16...Nxh2 17. Kxh2 Rxh4+ 18. gxh4 Qxh4+ and perpetual check. He also points out that the attempt to win the piece with 16.....Nxe5 17. dxe5 Qxd2 loses to 18. R(either!) d1 and after the queen moves Rd8 leads to a mating attack for white.
But this still draws. If 17. Nxg4 then Rxg4 and black is a pawn up and after Qf3 he should manage to complete his development.
Again personal preference, it allows the doubling on the c rank if white is so inclined, but I prefer it to the other options.
Accepting the doubling in order to get the rook into a better situation.
A bit of an error, not massively so, but Q-d3 would have been better. It supports your hanging pawn on e4 and threatens the c5 pawn(check). A couple of things to always try and rem. Firstly in endgame a pawn advantage is massive, try not to let your opponent pick up free pawns, secondly you want to be dictating the tempo of the game. Force your opponent to respond to your moves rather than vica versa.
I can see the logic in this move, it attacks the pawn, enables your a1 rook to move (by protecting the a2 pawn with another piece) but all the same I'm not a fan. Can't explain why, it just seems wrong. Personally I would have played b4 and forced an issue, but thats more about playing style I think.
And get caught by this move. Taking the pawn leads to Q-f7 K-h8, Qxb.... looking at saccing the rook to create a back row mate. Can't bring the queen back so I extemporise and compromise.....
Have to accept the rook and pawn for the rook, but still didn't look far enough ahead.
The reason I moved the bishop earlier was to try and tempt you with d6, unfortunately you weren't having it.
For most of that sequence there was nothing I could do except hop out of the way. You were quite right to offer the draw and in another game I might have taken it. I looked at this variant before, but wasn't brave enough to take it. When it cropped up this time I decided to go for it. I figured one move might be enough for me to be able to seize back the tempo. You can repeat the check on d2 but then the h6 escape for the king means you're in the wrong position with the queen. If you take the bishop, well you've seen what happens. With hindsight (wonderful thing), you'd have been better off retreating, either to f2 or e4 and then bringing your h&g pawns in. e4 is more counter intuitive but it does prevent me rolling up your pawns.
And thats the mistake that hands it to me. With a passed pawn advantage to me, the last thing you want is to swap the queens off. f1 would have had the same result, the only safe place would have been h1, but then that only delays it as I play c1 with the queen forcing you into h2. So its perhaps unfair to call that the mistake rather than Qxb. At the time I looked at this move and crowed mightily, but it is (or can be forced) so the mistake has to be the moves before.
Doesn't matter what happens in the f-h files. No way you can now stop the b pawn and then its almost always going to be a losing battle.
Its been said that chess is a game where the winner makes the second to last mistake. And here that happened to be me. I'm not overly a technical player and if you ask GK for a technical analysis they'll prob say half of the match was errors. From my point of view I see three mistakes. (1) yours, leaving a pawn open (2) mine, getting over ambitious and having to scurry back to defend (3) yours, taking the bishop when retreat was called for. But considering the difference in ratings (flawed as they are), you played fairly even with me throughout most of it and only a rather desperate pawn move to offer the bishop saved me.
I could have played c4 instead but decided on c3 because of the bishop on the black diagonal
Black has forgotten about the bxp
Black leaves his rook exposed
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is another game in my 1700-1800 mini-tournament group.  Just imagine, you are a pawn up, you are in a 2 piece ending, surely the game is in the bag.  But not always, sometimes the pawn structures can be as such that a gridlock ensues.  It did in this game.  I had the pawn plus but could not seem to be able to do anything with it so I held out the olive branch and my opponent accepted it.  Please bear in mind that epblue's rating was not 1584 at the start, it was 1755 so I only lost 0.4 points out of the low draw.  He kicks off with 1.e4.
15. Bf3 - this bishop plugs the gap left by the forced advance 13. g3.
16. ....... c6 - still in the database, the d pawn is backed up and Fou Leblanc can come out.  At least I am now a clear pawn up, but there is still so much wood on the board.
35. f5 - over the last few moves white has moved his king out and rolled up his kingside pawns.  With white having the bishop pair behind his pawns and my extra pawn being backward I find it terribly difficult to form a plan of any sorts here.
37. ...... Kf7 - here I decided enough was enough and offered my opponent a draw which he accepted.  Was there any way for me to convert my advantage, was it another bad draw offer?  You the jury decide.
I realize the mistake of not moving rook from a1 to f1 cost me the game   . note to self when rook one from side to another its  a chekmate in 1 move
...this is an annoying move for white and he has to deal with it, otherwise black automatically takes on f3 to upset the pawns and give some early targets..
continuing to develop...with e4, f5 will come in and look to castle 0-0-0 after Nc6 and continue with a kingside attack
...i think white needs to disrupt blacks activity.....maybe c4, Rb1 and then b4...? Black wants Bg2 to put the Queen on the same diagonal as Bg4 ...
...have to watch h4 and Bh3...I am prepared to sac material on the kingside here are white is not developing quick enough and the English is a solid but slow positional build....
...want the swap but not this time...but it prepares f5 if it is not taken....
...white needs to release the pin and create grief on the queen side....i thought a4/5 and b4 followed by Qb3 creates and major headache for black owing to the very strong long white bishop....given time..
....white has a static queen side and black has 5 pieces that can come quickly to the kingside quickly....decided to tak advantage of the pin next...Qxd3 is on, and overlooked it for (what i thought) was a more aggressive plot...myself and the buddy are playing these games relatively quickly so no major analysis done...
..sure why not....? I can overcome Qb3 and prevent the possibility of white winning a piece (Ne1...and black mustbe careful of Bxc6)<n>Blacks idea is simple, crack open the k side...was prepared to sac 2 pawns here....hxg5 and then h6 looking for Rxh6, Nf6 and Rfh8...
...maybe d5 was more solid....and blocks the bishop...
...decided to open up the king more...
..an opportunity to win a pawn here....
..pin here allows the winning of the pawn....
Today we all know that due to Black's premature definition of the pawn structure in the centre White has the better opportunities to gain the initiative. But in those days both opponents were wandering in 'terra incognita' - the routes that were to develop in the Nimzo-Indian Defence were just being formed.
<n>By all chess standards that dominated the minds of the chess players in the 20s and 30s Black has absolutely nothing to complain about. Good pawn structure, easy development, no weaknesses. White isn't even threatening any immediate action. However, Botvinnik felt correctly that a possibility of a central advance e3-e4-e5 (after the preparatory f3) could lead to a violent attack on the kingside. Hard to believe? Well, at least you are thinking on the same lines as the great Cuban champion.
Subsequent experience has shown that one should prefer 11.f3 immediately working on the critical break in the centre. The White queen has to go to d3 anyway, and the black knight doesn't get a new option.
Pioneers are doomed to making mistakes. The wrong move order always damages a deep strategical plan. <n>[12.Qd3 was necessary]
Capablanca misses the moment to seize the initiative [ 13...cxd4 14.cxd4 rfc8 followed by 15.-- Rc4 16.--Ra8 and White has to forget about active plans in the centre and switch to defensive lines instead.
[If 17...Ne4 then 18.Nh1! and White's plan works out anyway, e.g. f5 19.f3 Nd6 20.Ba3 g6 21.Ng3 and after the inevitable e3-e4 the weakened position of the Black king is a source of permanent trouble.
Otherwise the isolated knight is able to come back into the game extremely effectively after Nb3-c5! Now Black has to take his opponent's threats more seriously - the white knight is heading for f5 and d6, and the advancing f-pawn could be a battering ram that will crack open the black castle. But Capablanca cannot be frightened by these shadows on the horizon. The stubborn proponent of economy was famous for an astonishing ability to defend his king with a minimum of resources while his main army was gaining advantage elsewhere.
Forcing the opening of the e-file and an exchange of rooks.
Getting closer to the black king.
Now instead of being consumed in the flame of the attack the modes f-pawn is making a dream career. The appearance of this powerful ally for the white queen was impossible to avoid:[26...Kg7 27.Rxf6! Kxf6 28.fxg6+ Kxg6 ( 28... Ke7 29. Qf7+ Kd8 30. g7) 29.Qf5+ Kg7 30.Nh5+ Kh6 31.h4! Rg8 32.g4 Qc6 33.Ba3! with mate to follow.]
Attack and defence have reached a faltering parity, each side needs reserves to decide an epic battle in its favour. The question is whose minor piece from the forgotten flank is faster? Black's knight is going to use the same route Ncb3-a5-c6, but what about the sleeping white bishop?
The sad knight on b3 is left as a silent reproach for Black's stragegical miscalculation in the early middlegame.
and Capablanca's resignation, in my opinion, symbolized the end of an heroic era of chess titans, dominating the field with their natural genius. Since this historic moment the professional touch has played a more and more important role as an integral part of chess, the path to ultimate success.
Here I play the worst move that black could play! <n>According to chessdatabes this move leads to white's wins in 66% out of 100 games...I must say I realised how bad it was later on: Egold will set a cental Queen and many possible traps.
(Bd2 also)<n>I started to breath better: My plan is Bb7 to get a hold on the center
e5 was an ok-move too but my opponent was focused on d6 and he had 2 clear lines in mind:<n>if I play b*f6 he would go for d6 (1 pawn won)<n>if I play g*f6, my king's side is messed forcing black to play with a central king; not easy to deal with.
I decided to get ride of 1 pawn and the powerful central white queen. I am betting on my light squares bishop (threatening g2) and some little tempos.<n>With the other line gxf6, I'd keep d6 with a central king and a passive position; whites will eventually win.<n>=> Realistically, any strong player would have kill the game easily from here.
From now on the tempo is mine, egold probably realised too late that he had no advantage on the game neither on the center. This is the drawback of blitz attack without a long term plan.
I give the bishop for a knight to hit e4 and threat g2.
...Bxe6. and the trap his obvious (17...fxe6 18 Rxe6 ...19 Rxe4) nicely thought but I really did not want to kill my light squares bishop for the moment and take g2.
I decided to clear the board a bit and see what could happen If i play King e7...<n>at this stage I prefer my pawns structure even if once again this is an even game.
white's Rooks have a little more activity. My aim was to avoid a silly mistake in the endgame. Besides this, I still think a win is possible as I wanted to win against a 1600
King e6 could look weird for some players but I planned to bring my King on g7 as we already know the targets of whites ( a6 and f7) <n> even if f7 is pinned, it would never be an issue.
I prefered to offer a honest opposition and a draw.
28. Kf5 is ok too and will threat f4 to get tempo on k's side. <n>I must say that I used to play blitz and I expected 29.Rd6  ... I'd have answered 29... Re6...etc.
Kb3! useless nevertheless it warns me that if I want to exchange, egold will rush on a b pawns.
h is down aswell and f has still a long way to go. Here we must thank the tools offered by gameknot to analyse out games because I did analyse this position to avoid miscalculations.
notice: h4 is still not impossible (but a4 and c4 playable). <n>My Rook keeps the white king in safety. I can not stop thinking about the so called cold war and dissuasion (This rook on e4 would not move anymore)... I was lucky because 28... Re4 was only supposed to threat f4.
King has finally a path but that's too late for whites. <n>I will have to stop a and h pawns meanwhile to protect my c pawn,to attack c2.
black's plan:to bring the king to d2 asap.<n>white's plan: to try to bring a pawn and take back's c pawn.
The Nimzo-Larsen Attack...a hypermodern opening with the idea to counter-attack from the flank. There will be no variations given as this is my first effort and I plan on taking a more narrative approach.
Both sides appear to be approaching the center from a safe distance.
Okay, now black has taken a foothold in the center.
i continue to develop `nimzo-larsen` style...this pawn move allows me to develop my king's bishop while possibly supporting another pawn advance in the center later on in the game.....er war...my queen is also is allowed a little more space.
This bishop will play an important role of omission later in the game. On one level it is comedy but to the white king it will be a tragedy.
black seeks to counteract my own bishop on the long diagonal.
Classic `nimso-larsen`stuff, I attack his center from the flank, notice how my b pawn backs up this attack on black's center.
an important development, he gives up a center pawn while I hang on to my own, this will help give me a more attractive pawn structure going into the middle game, notice too how i have not committed either of my center pawns to the center yet, they stand ready to advance later in the middle game, i like the idea of holding my center pawns back initially, all part and parcel of hypermodern strategy.
He finally moves his bishop to g7 to counteract my own bishop on that diagonal.
and it continues...
after the skirmish i feel pretty good about things, the `nimzo-larsen`will  often give you good pawn formations in the middle game, here i have a preponderance of pawns ready to advance towards the center, while my opponent is missing some center pawns.
i want to get my bishop away from his pawns and get it more involved in my plans.
this knight move of his puts the question to my bishop at c3.
a subtle but good move, creates an opening for my queen on f3 where it can attack black's b7 pawn which would be pinned due to his rook on a8.
he's probably thinking about attacking my bishop, meanwhile my queen is sitting in the weeds waiting to strike at f3.
i want to move my bishop away from his threatening pawns and get it more involved in supporting my center formation of pawns.
i attack his rook forcing him to move it while at the same time advancing another pawn up the center of the board.
i`ll have to keep an eye on my king side, i`m notorious for neglecting the safety of my king.
attacking and pinning his b pawn, notice the mobility of my pieces and how they fit in with my pawn structure, this is a theme i plan on focusing on from this game on...the nimzo-larsen opening had done it's job and left me with a good pawn skeleton for the middle game wars.
fortifying my pawn center, not such a bad move really, but now i'm thinking what i could have done with my rook if i had of moved it to a1.....looking at it now I have the whole queenside to myself with a queen, a bishop and two connected rooks ready to swing into action....the road not taken, as in life so it is in chess, but of course that leaves my king pretty lonely with black's queen, rook and knight hanging around a dark lamppost on the kingside...'for every solution there is another problem.'
my bishop is in the thick of things now and doing his part to help the team.
his rooks are carousing around like to big thugs on a dark street corner and the`re beginning to intimidate me but i still feel i have things in hand, my strategy is still to force through a passed pawn in the center and win this war.
forcing him to move his knight while advancing my c pawn once again. notice my nice chain of pawns going up through the center of the board. the nimzo-larsen will often give you attractive pawn formations in the middle game if you play your cards right in the opening.
again this was a move i made immediately, i wonder now if i should have taken more time to consider it. it seems to make sense. in my mind he has got to worry about that pawn queening as his rooks are far abroad on their adventures (like king richard on his crusades).
his queen gets involved in stopping my pawn adavance...this is a critical position and i looked at it and didn`t know what to do, and i didn`t take the time to find out what to do, i got impatient and frustrated, should have stopped right here and logged off and thought about things but that would have made too much sense, if i had stayed focused on my stategy (to queen that pawn), that would have been a good clue to my next move. fritz tells me B-d3, attacking his knight.
instead i do this and at this point i lose the thread of my game. i was thinking to break up the pawns in front of his king.
damn his rooks, always hanging around and making threats...remember that comment about my bishop i made early in the game...'This bishop will play an important role of omission later in the game'...i should have played B-d3 here attacking his knight on b5...instead i did something else...
i moved too fast and make the move that loses me the game, probably should have played the bishop to d3 instead, i`m more of a positional player and tactics are not a strong suit for me, that combined with my lack of patience make chess challenging for me.
after the skirmish, i`m down on the exchange and down in other ways as well. i ruined a good solid position by getting frustrated and not taking my time...chess will bring out your character flaws and shine a spotlight on them.
i moved fast, angry with myself for losing the exchange and bungling a perfectly good position...there is an important lesson here, if you make a bad move, logoff and get away from the game for awhile and get back to it later when your head has cleared and you're not as emotional....but you know what they say about advice, easy to give, hard to take.
i resigned and learned another chess lesson, if i am to improve my game i will probably have to make changes away from the chessboard and do something about my `easily frustrated and impatient nature`...but this is part of the beauty of chess, it will reflect your character flaws and shine a light on them. it is up to me to do something about that....Boris Spassky once said that 'Chess is a metaphor for Life'...I think it is. A chess game will have drama, intrigue, tragedy, comedy. Think of it as a theatre of the mind where we play major roles in shaping our destiny.  It is life contained on a 64 square field and we are the Kings.
Standard play so far. This move aims to undermine white's strong pawn presence in the center.
The Ljubojevic Variation of the Alekhine. Black is very comfortable in this position, and threatens to start ripping up the center.
And both sides seem to have accomplished their goals. White has good space in the middle and will support with developing moves. Black owns the queenside and has numerous developing and attacking options.
! Hitting the c pawn and the Bg4.
!? Black strikes with the aim of weakening white's kingside. While sometimes controversial to trade a bishop for a knight, notice that black is attempting to get white to castle queenside (putting his king on a half open file).
!! White exerts his dominance of the dark squares around the enemy king while developing with tempo. Very strong.
! To save his queen white must sac a rook!
Advancing, attacking, and opening the diagonal for his light squared bishop.
?! Not wanting to castle into a pin, Bronstein activates his Ra1 in a much more dangerous fashion, as his king is now dangerously exposed.
Pinning the bishop against the enemy queen.
Ljubojevic now seems poised to counter, as his queen and both knights can slip behind white's lines and cause havoc.
! Gaining an "insurance tempo" as black now needs at least two moves or a big sacrifice to follow through with his plans.
! White has to press here or black will gain the time needed to take advantage of white's exposed king.
!? In post mortem, Ljubojevic said he felt that move was forced. With this queen sac, black now hopes to storm the queenside if he can only stave off white's attack on his weakened kingside! Use the 'Flip the board' option to see this position from both points of view. Wild stuff!
! Any retreat from conflict only empowers blacks aggression, so Bronstein lashes out with his monarch! The offensive properties of the king are sometimes forgotten. If a queen=9, a rook=5, a bishop=3.5, a knight=3, and pawns=1 point, a king can be considered a '5' and should be used when needed to disrupt an enemy's plan. Brave play by Bronstein.
As one of the knights is going to fall anyway, black uses this check to retreat forces back towards the action. His plan now should be to secure his king and the real estate directly around it.
Correct. White sees that the black knight on g5 is toast anyway, so he is in no hurry to snag it just yet. Better to start positioning the enemy king where he is most vulnerable.
YIKES!!!!! Black's other rook now enters the fray, and enters with a vengeance! Has white screwed up?
And Ljubojevic resigns, as his g pawn will never reach it's goal because of white's pawn on h2. His a pawn is worthless as well. In a game of queen vs. rook, he may have some play, but now because white's f pawn has entered the picture, he knows he can't defend on that many fronts. A wonderful game, and a beautiful example of the concept of TIME being used in a mating attack. I hope you enjoyed it:) - Thomas
It seems to me the best to do for white.
Preventing black to occupate the b5 square within 2 moves.
To weaken the white king.
As black I like having the queen on the e file for it gives strong counterattacking possibilities but it can quickly get dangerous for black.
To contest the semi open file
The bishop would anyway have to move after 15. ...a6 and white didn't want to set it on e2 for it would block the e rook but may be 14. Bc4 would have been better.
It seemed at the moment the best thing to do to prevent 16. Nc7 but it was a mistake, Na6 would have been better for...
White attacks on the queen side to drive of the knight who has no proper place to go
Black counteratttacks on the kingside.
To force the queen to move
White carries on attacking on the queenside (there was anyway little other choice to save the rooks).
To menace 21. ... Qxb6 with menace toward the king and the a rook
I was looking at something, using the queen on the open a file but couldn't find anything strong enough.
Menacing the bishop
This is also bad move. Losing the rights to castle, and also losing Bishop on e2. The best move would be 11. Qd2 blocking the check and putting my Q in danger.
Opening the way for my black Bishop, and closing down the opponent white Bishop.
This is the starting position of the KID:4PA. White has taken advantage of Black's hypermodern play - Black has not yet committed to a central formation - and grabbed a large share of the centre, in exchange for a very slight advantage in development for Black. Black will try to work against White's central control in the sharp variations that can ensue from this position. I personally am hoping to play above my rating in this tournament, since I have done quite a lot of preparation on the 4PA! I am also hoping to gain valuable experience of this sharp opening in this tournament.
Black makes his first move into the centre: White, as usual, advances his d-pawn in order to keep his strong centre together. Incidentally, in a normal (non-thematic) game, the last 2 moves are interchangeable: Black can equally choose to proceed 5...c5 6.d5 O-O 7.Nf3, transposing into the text.
Again, White must keep his centre together, and therefore usually recaptures with the c-pawn. The one drawback of this main line is that it gives Black a queenside pawn majority: in most following variations, Black aims to make the queenside the theatre of battle.
Here, Black separates from the main line with this unusual pawn move. He also separates from my opening preparation, leaving me on my own. As far as I could see, White has two main options: the obvious move is to capture the pawn with 10.Bxb5, but after 10...Nxe4! 11.Nxe4 Qa5+ 12.Qd2 (12.Bd2 Qxb5 gaining a tempo with an attack against White's b2-pawn) 12...Qxb5 13.Nxc8 and I am not to comfortable with White's position, with his centre in tatters, even though he is one pawn up. The other option is 10.e5, and after 10...dxe5 11.fxe5 my consolation is that the position is similar to that reached after 9...Re8 10.e5 dxe5 11.fxe5, which contains some known drawing variations.
I had prepared the more dynamic 12.e6 fxe6 13.d6 in the "similar position" I detailed above, but I was - for some reason - unwilling to risk this in an unknown position, and I simply opted for the line that, I knew, pointed towards drawing variations.
Black wins one of White's central pawns, however White has compensation in the form of his mobile, passed d-pawn, and the bishop which he is about to lodge in Black's position, like a thorn in his side.
Strengthening my hold on Black's position and cementing the bishop in place.
(?) I think this is an error by Black. This move allows the obvious and very strong 17.Nd5, planting another thorn in Black's position and winning at least an exchange due to the fork on c7. More usual for Black is 16...c4+, making use of the queenside pawn majority.
Black's position is now extremely cramped because of White's powerful d6-pawn and his two minor pieces on the 7th rank. He has also lost at least an exchange, although I was (greedily?) hoping to win more than that.
Black develops a piece, threatening the expulsion (excommunication?) of White's bishop on e7, and also opens up another line of defence on his e8-rook. White now has to play forcing moves to convert his advantage into a win, otherwise Black will start liquidating material. This isn't as hard as it sounds, because White has a forced win/checkmate here.
I feel this was a mistake. The pressure on the knight isn't relieved because I am still allowed Ne4, adding more pressure.
I thought he would put my bishop to the question :) with a3, I didn't want to trade just yet, thinking I still had options to strengthen my attack.
he now moves a3 which finally forces me to make a decision. Retreating the bishop looked bad to me, and I assumed he would recapture the bishop with bxc3 (not wanting to trade his rook for a knight this early), resulting in stacked pawns, and in my opinion, a very weakened queenside.
I continue to attack. I'm usually not one to bring my queen out early but I felt no immediate threat from WT and wanted to keep him on defense.
Now WT has alleviated the threat at f2 and protected his bishop, but I'm not sure if this was the best move. knights on the borders are usually targets of mine.
taking the pawn was not an option, c5 seemed a more ideal square for my knight.
maybe a wasted move by BL, perhaps moving bishop to g3 would have been better, allowing the knight on h3 to move to a more productive position instead of stuck protecting the bishop.
The knight is now mine for the taking! And he must protect the black squared bishop before the knight is captured.
WT queen grabs a pawn, and momentarily protects the bishop.
the placement of his queen allows a fork on b3, but the h3 knight is still in my bishop's sights.
finally my other knight gets closer to the action :)
Big mistake, the WT queen has blocked all safe squares for the bishop on h6
This is game 6 of the match where a computer, Deep Blue, defeated a reigning chess grandmaster, Garry Kasparov in only 19 moves.<n><n>Most commentary is by Yasser Seirawan.  ((Comments from Wikipedia entry on this game are in double parentheses.))<n><n>The Garry Kasparov versus Deep Blue match had all the drama of a great epic. Going into the last game with the match tied the expectation and excitement had reached fever pitch. My audience had just begun to warm their seats when the game was over! In just over one hour the match was over and we were all left gasping for answers. I hope these comments provide some crucial clues to the most gripping chess event that I've ever had the pleasure to be involved with.<n><n>Garry's opening choice came as a great disappointment to me. He rarely plays the Caro-Kann and the opening does not suit his style of play. I had expected and hoped for his vaunted Sicilian Defense (1...c5) which he plays supremely well.
The text has a dodgy reputation based on the results of previous games played with this move. While playable, it is definitely not the main line. The normal move is 7...Bd6 (First!) 8.Qe2 h6 9.Ne4 Nxe4 10.Qxe4 Nf6 as has been seen in countless games.<n><n>(( A strange blunder by Kasparov, one of the most theoretically knowledgeable players in chess history. Apparently Kasparov got his opening moves mixed up, playing ...h6 a move too early. The normal 7...Bd6 8.Qe2 h6 9.Ne4 Nxe4 10.Qxe4 was played in Kasparov(!)-Kamsky, 1994 and Kasparov-Epishin, 1995, among other games. The upcoming sacrifice is well known to theory and Kasparov must have known about it (in fact, there are some reports that he even wrote an article supporting 8.Nxe6 as a refutation). Objectively speaking, the move may be OK, although the resulting position is very tough for a human player to defend. Rajlich later indicated that the decisive error may have been on move 11, pointing out that Rybka was prepared to play this in a 2007 computer match. ))
This sacrifice is the only chance for White to gain an advantage. After 8.Ne4 Nxe4 9.Bxe4 Nf6 10.Bd3 c5 is fine for Black since he hasn't yet moved his f8-Bishop the freeing break ...c6-c5 and the subsequent move ...Bf8-c5 doesn't come with the loss of a tempo. Therefore the text. However, the effect of White's move had a devastating effect on Garry's face. He looked as if he had just been hit by a bolt of lightening. While we were busily speculating if Kasparov had come prepared with a novel idea his reaction was manifestly clear, he had<n>transposed his move order and fallen into a well known book trap! How on earth was this possible? Garry Kasparov is arguably the finest opening theoretician in the world today. How could he fall into a known opening trap? There are several answers. In the post match press conference, Garry explained that he had lost his confidence. Following the disappointing draw in game five he had told his trainers that, "The match was over." Garry had simply given up and went into the game with a losing mentality.<n>Too, Garry had exhibited signs of increasing nervousness and tension following game two. Playing openings and defenses that were unfamiliar to him he had hoped to out fox the computer.

Following the disappointing draw in game five he had told his trainers that, "The match was over." Garry had simply given up and went into the game with a losing mentality.<n>Too, Garry had exhibited signs of increasing nervousness and tension following game two. Playing openings and defenses that were unfamiliar to him he had hoped to out fox the computer.

This however is a known mistake. When it rains it pours and mistakes usually come in numbers. For Caro-Kann players like myself, we are aware that 8...fxe6 9.Bg6+ Ke7 10.O-O Qc7 11. Re1 Kd8 preparing ...Bf8-d6 is the only way to go. This variation is not to everyone's taste as Black's King and his lack of development promise a difficult future. However, if Black can solve his current problems he has an extra piece to give him hopes. In the many games that feature the text, White has won all of those in my database! The problem as we shall see is that Black's Queen is terribly misplaced.<n><n>(( Instead of taking the knight immediately, Kasparov pins the knight to the king in order to give his king a square on d8. However, many annotators have criticized this move and said that Kasparov ought to have taken the knight immediately. Although the Black king uses two moves to reach d8 after 8...fxe6 9.Bg6+ Ke7, the Black queen can be placed at the superior c7 square. ))
(( White castles so that 9...Qxe6?? loses to 10.Re1 pinning and winning the black queen. Black must now take the knight or he will be a pawn down. ))
The most incisive. The Bishop is on a superb diagonal covering key squares which control the movements of both Black's King and Queen. Other known moves include 11.c4 when Black has also been swept off the board.<n><n>(( If Black's bishop were on d6 instead of f8, White would not be able to play this. For the sacrificed knight, White's bishops have a stranglehold on Black's position. Black, having moved his king, can no longer castle, his queen is blocking his own bishop, and he has trouble getting out his pieces and making use of his extra knight. ))
Unfortunately for the commentators we were trying to justify Kasparov's opening choice and explained that the novel move 11...b5 was prepared by Garry and that all of his head shaking was his attempt for an Oscar for best drama. Previous games have seen 11...Qb4 trying to make room for his pieces. But these games also have resulted in Black losses.<n>The purpose of the text is to secure the d5-square for a Black Knight when it can't be dislodged by c2-c4. A noble aim except that it simply does not work. There is no question that Black faces difficulties but the computer's approach to winning the game is quite different from a human's. Essentially the computer looks at each position as if it were unique. It doesn't have prejudices about previous ideas but tries to play the best move according to its evaluation and its thinking.<n>Take another look at the position before the text move. In general, it is good to win a Queen for Rook and Bishop. A computer is correctly programmed to think that winning a Queen for Rook and Bishop is a good thing. White can play Rf1-e1 and Bg6-f5 in order to win the e7-Queen. Also the computer likes to win pawns and could play for Rf1-e1 and Qd1-e2xe6 when in both cases Black is relieved by the trades.

Simple for Deep Blue and a powerful move. The computer tells itself that advancing pawns are good. White's a1-Rook is activated without moving and that the shield around Black's King<n>is compromised by the text. All reasons enough to make this move.
Played without any understanding for the position. Garry misses a devastating shot which finishes the game fast. He had to play 16...Qb4 17.Rxe6 Be7 and hope. Garry was busily shaking his head in disgust and looking into the few persons in the audience. He was looking towards his mother as if to say I want to resign. Should I? Not a happy Mother's Day present.
(( White is pounding at Black's e6 pawn and is planning to invade the position with his rooks. Kasparov cannot hold onto all his extra material and desperately decides to surrender his queen for a rook and a bishop. ))
Doing what computers do best, calculate tactics. As 19...bxc4 20.Qxc4 Kb7 21.Qa6 is Checkmate, Kasparov was forced to realize that his whole plan of controlling the d5-square<n>simply fails. His alternative19...Nb4 20.Qxf5 Rf8 21.Qe6 bxc4 22.Ne5 is also good for<n>White. Still, Kasparov's resignation was premature to say the least. I had expected Kasparov to dig in his heels and fight. But he had no fighting spirit and simply gave up. Following his resignation there was a sudden and complete emptiness in the spirit of the people in the auditorium. All the buildup up in tensions had been sucked out as if in a vacuum. We were all in disbelief and shock. IBM had done it.

when IBM is not the sponsor.
I'm not sure if this is what I'd play. It does get the queen out, and its' hard to chase, but I think taking with the pawn would have had more lasting benefits as it would control more center and allows his LSB to develop better.
?! I have to call this a wasted move. I take it he was worried about me moving my bishop to b5, but it wouldn't have been a major problem for him if I had, and he could have chased it easily then.
?! I would have moved it to a5 maybe? Undeveloping the queen completely negates any advantage to not capturing with the pawn back on move 5.
I press forward, grabbing more space and adding support to the e pawn.
Blunder, he misses the ability to take my knight, and blocks in the attack. This also allows my rook to capture the pawn on f7. It's tempting to use the knight, but I have to use the rook because the LSB is attacking it.
Look at white's position! his rook is dominant, he has a strong center and an excellent bishop.
The knight is pinned, it can't take the bishop or I'll take the rook. I did notice that the knight could fork my king and rook, but I couldn't do anything about it.
I advance the pawn so that it is defended by my bishop.
We both decide to get our kings involved.
I threaten his pawn. My bishop is pinned, so it can't take it, but if I move my king or he moves his rook...
His little rook trap is now gone, I push knowing that I'll end up with a nice little knight outpost and a possible king/rook fork if he's not paying attention...
No fork, at least with the game about to open up, I snag a bishop and force him to give up on castling.
Blunder - I was totally clock watching. I was originally thinking moving the rook to c and just changed up at the last second. I almost quit right here.
Anything to get rid of one of his rooks
LOVE this move. I force his rook to protect, His king can't move. Just me vs the clock now. Both of us at a minute.
The French Defence was what we played in school days, to prevent the horror of the Scholar's Mate attack; and later became my favorite when I found I couldn't really foot it theoretically with the Sicilian (1...c5).
Normally I prefer the standard 2...d5, but it does one good to vary from time to time.  I like this version of Owen's Defence, deferring the central struggle for the time being.  But Black does have to watch that he doesn't allow White to shove a pawn wedge into his centre.
Possibly this is too restrained - the GK engine 'thinks' so, indicating 4...c5.  Last time I played that I got my head handed to me.  The move played has the virtues of solidity and flexibility.  But it doesn't interfere with whatever plans White has in train.
Also good was 5.0-0, but there was no reason not to seize as much central territory as he could hold...
Transforming the game into a Modern Defence - specifically, the Hippopotamus.  Black plans to bring White's centre under a crossfire of bishops.  But he has to be careful.  There is always the danger of the Hippo having his head shoved under and held there.
(!?)  Apparently weakening, but it has its points.  For one thing, I just didn't fancy 6...Ne2 7.Bf6!, though, come to think of it, Black's game would not have been all that bad.  But Black has it also in mind to counter any advance White maks in the centre with an advance of his own.  Note that the Black pawns on the third rank advancing to the fourth obviate any 'en passant' captures, which might have been a nuisance.
(!?)  Possibly 7.Be3 was an improvement, building up his centre.  This bishop could have, and probably should have, been chased back to g3 after this, where it would have been a target for Black's K-side pawns.
(!?) OK, but 7...g5 was indicated, really.  I did concern myself with the possibility White would try a sac (7...g5  8.Nxg5 fxg5  9.Qh5ch Kd7  10.Bxg5...) but after 10...Qe8 it's not clear that White has much.  Would White have tried it on had I played ....g5?  I wasn't prepared to find out.
(!?) 8...g5 was still playable, with a knight interposing after the bishop check: 8...g5  9.Nxg5?! fxg5  10.Qh5ch Ke7  11.Bxg5ch Ngf6  12.e5 dxe5  13.dxe5 Nxe5 and Black seems to escape with the extra piece.
You might think White has much greater mobility, and it's true enough.  But, under no particular constraint by White, Black's game (in my view) contains a lot of potential energy.   Incidentally, there is no real concern that the respective knights will continue on to c6 and f6, taking four tempi to develop to squares reachable at the outset in two!
This was what Black was waiting for, and now he can close the centre.  The move is OK - there really wasn't anything doing with 12.Nb5 Qb8 -  but it does release quite a lot of the tension that existed along the #5 rank.  Black now casts his eye towards a K-side operation.
(!?) This move was a bit of a mystery to me.  Was he thinking of following up with 14...Nb5, then?
Also playable, and probably more in keeping with Black's 'grand strategy', was ...Bh6, with operations upon the dark squares.  But I didn't really consider it, deciding to keep out the knight from b5 instead.  This move was later to come in useful...
With two quick pawn thrusts, Black grabs the initiative.  But it has to be admitted, the bishop that has just been chased off had served a useful function in keeping back Black's f-pawn from its usual ...f5 break.  On the other hand, it was left a target, and is driven to a spot with very little outlook.
Played after quite a lot of thought.  Already I was beginning to spend almost as much time on this game as all the others combined - though, as will be seen, this time expenditure was not continually maintained.  I didn't want to play ...h4 - not yet at any rate - as I felt I would need the pawn where it was to obtain leverage against the strong light squares in White's position.  I didn't like ...Qc7 as I wanted that piece able quickly to get to the K-side, and the immediate ...Ng6 didn't seem to offer much either.  This bishop move served two purposes: [a] to give support along the light squares on the K-side, and [b] to make way for the a8-rook to take up guard duties on b8... should this service be required of it.
I think this was intended to support the advance of the b-pawn (b2-b4) once the Queen stepped aside.  Fair enough: White is the stronger on this flank, and the game has developed along lines very similar to a King's Indian Defence - with Black building up a K-side attack, and White conducting operations on the other wing.  At that, White could probably feel reasonably confident that his K-side is adequately defended.  The light squares in particular are heavily mined.  It will require some preparation to break through there.
A very nice spot for the knight - so strong indeed that White gives up his rather moribund bishop for it.
(!)  It was so tempting to take with the g-pawn and open up a file for the rook against the castled White King.  But after 19...gxf4  20.Nh4! it would have been already hard to see Black could proceed.  Maybe 19...gxf4  20.Nh4 f5!  21.Nxf5 Nf6  22.Nxg7 Kxg7  23.Qc2 (preparing the foreshadowed pawn break) ...Rg8  24.b4  Kh6  25.Qd3! Rg7 with very nebulous chances ... for both sides.  The capture played gives Black a fine post at e5 for his remaining knight.
I more than half-expected this, though Nd2 also came into consideration.  White is making those light squares very hard to traverse.  Something like 20.Rfe1 instead would certainly have provoked a strong attack: 20.Rfe1? f5!  21.exf5 g4!  22.hxg4 hxg4  23.Nh2 g3  and if 24.fxg3 fxg3  25.Nf3 Ne5 Black would be having the more fun.  Meanwhile, Black carries on his attack, sacrificing a pawn...
(!?)  Giving up a pawn fo the sake of momentum.  But the GK engine doesn't like it one bit, preferring to preserve the pawn by ...h4.
It was after this move that I subjected Black's resources on the K-side to a thorough scrutiny.  Conclusion?  It was stalled for now: no further progress could be made on this wing.  OK, if we can't break through, let's go round.  The only way is via the Q-side.  But that's where White was supposed to be operating!  As it turns out, White is not especially strong on that wing after all, so much having been devoted to K-side defence.
(!?) This, as it happened, was a change of mind, having originally intended 24...c4 at once: 25.Qb4 (to protect the lead b-pawn) ...Nd3  26.Qxc4 axb5  27.Nxb5 Nxe1  28.Rxe1 Bxb2, but after 29.Bg4!! with an eye the e6-square, things didn't look too flash for Black after all.  Maybe somewhere in the middle of that line ...Rc8 would have improved Black's prospects.
(?) This move took me completely by surprise - and I quite failed to appreciate the implications.  I was fully anticipating 25.Nxb5 (not 25.Qxb5? Bd3!)  25...c4  26.Qb4! but maybe White didn't like his prospects after 26...Nd3 or 23...Rxa2.  Even 23...Qb6 looks OK for Black: 27.Qxd6 Qxb5  28.Rxe5 Bxe5  29.Qxe5 Rxa2.  Whether any of these lines would have led to much for Black is hard to say, but I can well understand if White wasn't prepared to test them.  But as it transpires, this Knight move was the mistake that brought White back into the game!
(?) A complete miscalculation, as the GK engine observes.  Originally planning on ...Rxb2, I had the uneasy feeling that I'd already let the advantage, if not the initiative withal, slip away from me (that rook move I overlooked two moves back, of course!).  This move was a violent attempt to wrest back the initiative that should have got the kicking it deserved.
(!?)  The alternative, 29...Rb6, might actually have been better, but I wanted to push the issue.  This involved some risk, though I felt sure that I could always bale to a draw if things went turnip shaped.
(!?) As you'd expect.  But as it transpired, White missed a fine opportunity, right here.  The Queen sacrifices itself for very promising endgame prospects:  30.Nxd6! Rb6  31.Qxb6!! (What the...?) 31...Qxb6  32.Nxf5 Rxf5  33.Bxg4 Rf8  34.Re6 ... and White has a lot of pressure on Black's position.  Well, I didn't see it at the time.  As it happens, the GK engine also gives White a plus after 30.Qxc4 Nf6  31.Nxf6.  So Black was running close to the extreme edge, here!
Aiming for the g- and h-files...
(!) Against an opponent with a similar rating or greater than mine, I would most likely have cut straight to the draw with 33...Rg5ch.  But I still thought the game offered Black chances of more.  The threat is ...Rxe4, with mate then looming on the g- or h-file.  I didn't much like ...Rb6, but maybe it ought to have been looked further into, with ...Rb7 as a possible follow-up.
(!?) Suddenly things weren't so simple.  White's salvation, it was becoming clear, lay in the timely retreat Ne4-g3, giving up the knight for the likely Rook and Bishop vs Rook ending.  This called for some very intricate manoeuvring, with no guarantee that Black would get more than the draw even then.    I admit that the Ng3 move I had anticipated somewhat down the track, but the GK engine recommends it right here (34.Ng3!), giving Black only a minimal advantage.
(?)  I notice the GK engine also points to this as a mistake.  At the time I had a feeling this might lead to more for Black than Kh2 would have done, as the latter might have allowed the f1-rook to slip out via g1 or h1.  At any rate, the real reason why this retreat turns out badly will emerge later...
Pinning the knight against the h6-square.  How can White save it?  How will it get back in time to sacrifice itself at g3?
Renewing the pin - only now it's a double pin, as the knight is pinned against the rook, AND h6.  But White can survive this, at least
The first unpinning...  But at the time, it suddenly dawned on me that 38.Re4!? might have been be feasible.  The idea was that Black runs out of pawns after, say 38.Re4 Rdxd6  39.Rxf4  Rh6ch  40.Kg2 Rg6ch  41.Rg4 If a pair of rooks come off, Black has just R and B vs R and 2P, and somehow, it was hard to imagine that the two pawns would transform a book draw (R and B vs R and no pawns!) into a loss.  To realise any advantage after 38.Re4, Black would have had to proceed much more subtly.
If Re4 was feasible a move back, it was still feasible here.  Having said that, the knight move was what I expected, and it still looked as though it might hold.  But the possibility of Ng3 had been on my mind for quite some time, and now I thought I had the answer.
Biting the bullet.  Yet with no pawn remaining, how can Black win the ending?  Surely 2R plus B vs 2R is no better than with one rook apiece?  And White has extra pawns into the bargain.  The answer lay in the poor position of White's King.  Had it stood at h2, the win for Black, if one existed at all, would have been very problematic.
(!) The key to White's castle.  Having left the second rank, the pawns can not shield the White King, who is imprisoned in his own dungeon.
(?!) Not as good as 42.Re4, though Black already had the answer to that: 42...Bf6!
(!?) Better was to take the pawn at once. but I preferred this as in keeping with a winning plan I had in mind.
A finesse to gain a tempo to attack and win the f-pawn.  Much better than the immediate ...Rhf2.
If course the other direction led to mate at once
The f-pawn was defenceless.
Cutting to the chase?  My opponent allowed it was a simple oversight.  But, cramped as he is - neither K nor R can leave the back rank - the game was up anyway.
My opponent opens with what I consider to be the strongest opening move.  The King's Pawn avoids many of the slower manoeuvrings of other openings, allowing White to concentrate on fast attacking play.
I respond with the Sicilian.  It creates an unbalanced board, allowing Black to attempt to call some of the shots early on in the game.
White preserves the option of an open or closed Sicilian.  Black must now be cautious.
Black is looking to counter White’s expected fianchetto with one of his own after 4.g3 b5.
I think 4.g3 was the better move here, not really sure what the aim of White's was.  I suspect it was a passive move, waiting to see what Black's intentions were.  But I think this move tosses away the advantage White has by virtue of the colour of his pieces.
!!! Oh dear.  White was evidently thinking of an exchange of Knights again, but overlooked the fact that the initiative was with Black allowing for 12...exf3 13.Bxf3 Nd4 which gives Black a +2 material advantage.
I am quite happy with this move and the following combination, effectively winning me the center.
This is where things start to pile up in my favor, I am increasing my hold on the center and white...is not.
White has finally decided to attack my queen.
I love it when opponents do this, I am already at +2 and he has traded away a major piece...nothing for me to do but gain advantage.
So here, because of whites blunder with 14.)g3, he has lost tempo because he had to move his rook and I am centralizing like an angry Russian Marxist.  <n><n>This is what I LOVE about good positional play.  When you play good position opponents tend to make bad moves that you didn't even see.  This compounds, while my hold strengthens.
I know this is dangerous, weakening my king, but with f5 my strategic python has its coild securely wrapped around whites deer.  Also , white has no way to break through ( I would challenge anyone to find one)
white has finally realized that he needs to gain some space, but it is too little too late.
I take the trade, happily increasing my share of the board.
A terrible move, leaving my dangerous d pawn to his own devices.
I couldn't believe this either!  Whites queen has no where to go!!!<n><n>This is a good example of good strategic play forcing your opponent to blunder.  I did not even see this possibility but because white is so lacking for good places to go, he panics and looses the game.
Better to wait until White forces the exchange.
I continue to try and own the center.
I thought to give my Bishop some movement on the Queen side.
I have now decided to move my attack to the King side.
My King is not feeling very secure.  Time to evacuate.
I believe the reason for this move was to prevent f4 from advancing.
He offers his Queen.  My understanding that if one is being attacked, it's a good thing to exchange pieces.
I start thinking I'm going to need to get a passed pawn to pull this game out.
If he went Ne7, I planned to sac my rook as then my pawn would have reached the promised land.
In hindsight, I wonder if I should have taken his rook.  Was I playing afraid given that my opponent was about 150 rating points above me?  I was concerned that if I took his rook, he'd capture my e6 pawn.  This, in combination with my fear of his numerous passed pawns resulted in my next move.
I was not thinking the Bishop capture f7.
17. At this time I decided that I want to keep my kn near the center of the broad and work them in combination with many options in the center of the broad. My opponent kn are to the side.
24. appear he want to create space for Bishop and Rooks. Appears he forgotten about the Kn!
take the center...
Zauberer tries to destroy my center...
Line up the bishop ant the queen to fight against the...
Now, the developpement is finished. Time to try some combinations.
Here was my idea...attract the bishop in e4, take the knight with check and regain the bishop. This gains a piece. So...
Attract the bishop in e4
Take back the bishop and win a piece ! I won a piece against a pawn !!
Material equality !<n>Now, time to look at the endgame. Zauberer has a pawn majority at king side and I've got one at queenside. For the strong players of my club, it's sufficient to win the game. I wanted to try it...
I wanted to exchange the pieces to enter in a pawn ending.
Now, how to exchange the queens ?
Kings go to battle.
With this move, I lock the king side. If you can, don't let adverse pawns take too much space...<n>The f4 and f5 pawns will block the kings, especially the black kings.<n>Blacks cannot take the opposing by playing Kd5, because of c4.
Prepares g5. Have to counter it...
Now, this side is locked. Black king cannot unlock it. <n>Black don't have any good move. d5 loses because of Kc5 zugzwang.<n>a5 loses as we will see.<n>Any king move loses (for example Kd7 Kd5 and white either make a passed pawn on the a or b files, or black stops the pawn in a or b rank, and loses the d6 and f5 pawns...)
Another zugzwang because black king cannot join e5.<n>Black king cannot save the pawn, and resigned here.<n><n>A possible continuation :<n>          d4<n>Kxd4  Kd6<n>Kc4    Kc7<n>Kc5 (taking the opposition, now it's a fondamental endgame position)<n>         Kb7<n>Kd6 (b6 doesn't help, beware of stalemates...)<n>and now white take the f5 and h5 pawns. Victory is only a matter of time.<n><n><n> This was a very instructing game for me. Hope you'll enjoy it
thats a crazy move. Black breaks the pin.
I have castled in 4 moves, while he is developing. Needless to say, it seems as though I'm doomed to defense.
Now poor Henry must begin the trek to the middle. This follows one of the chess proverbs: target a centered King.
Breaking the pin.
Adding protection to the strong point at K4.
Locking the center and clarifying the game.
Black's play is on the K-side now, with White's lying on the other wing.
Najdorf consents to the exchange.
Driving back the Knight. Draw agreed. White has an endgame advantage with a flank majority on the Q-side, but it would take a long time to try and exploit. Even if it could be exploited, it may not be enough to win.
This is a second game in the Smith-Morra, white (me) plays quite aggresively, then misses a very strong move that causes the game to extend to 26 moves.  I think the game shows a nice way of marching forward with threats based on black's weaknesses.
I think this is a definite inaccuracy.  Black must try to cover b5 with 8... a6, otherwise white's knight can take control of the dark squares.  Note that white has made 5 developing moves (Nf3, Nc3, Bc4, Bf4 and 0-0) while black only has three (Bc5, Nc6 and Nge7).  Conventional wisdom says a pawn is worth three tempo, white has two (and it's his turn), good development and a # of open files to use.  He also has two clear plans.
I chose to target the dark squares, I plan to start a quick attack which utilizes the fact that black has not castled.  d6 is looking very weak.  My other plan which is also very strong is 9.a3 with the plan of b4.  If black's bishop is hit away d6 will still prove very problematic for black.  He also has no good defense to b4, as 9... a5 10.Nb5 is a better version of the line in the game.
The ONLY way to retain d6 (for the moment), but my c4 bishop has just been unleashed on my opponent's kingside.  Note that rottweiler has played completely reasonable moves, and is finding himself in a huge mess.  Besides my bishop on c4, d5 is a great hole for my pieces to hop into.
Attacking the very weak square f7.  The dark squared bishop has been blocked, but the ...e5 push opened up the light squares, I love how I've done the same knight maneuver on both sides, and his positions is trouble.
Not good, but I'll examine an alternative: 10... exf4 (trying to grab some material for his misery) is met by 11.Nxf7 Qd7 (I don't know what square is best) 12.Nbxd6 !? I could grab material, but this seems more promising 12... Bxd6 13.Nxd6 Kf8 14.Qh5 with a lot of pressure on f7, according to Langrock the game might continue: 14... Ng6 15.Nf7 Qxf7 (moving the rooks is awful and if black gives up the rook white will infiltrate on h7- I can also win the d file with a great deal of pressure) 16.Bxf7  Kxf7 17.g3 and black has three pieces for the queen but it's difficult for him to mobilize, this is black's most promising line, but it seems that he'll have to survive for another 15 unpleasant moves to have any sort of play.  Development can be a fleeting advantage, but if every turn is used then it can be permanent, you're always a move ahead (or more) of your opponent.  While black has survived the brunt of the attack in this line, he's STILL undeveloped.  You do have to play quickly and aggresively in most gambits, but a developmental advantage can last a long time.
And white is simply better, probably winning.  The threat is Qxh7# and black only has one defense, the targets are now on the light squares, f7 and h7.  It's like black had a choice, lose d6 and fall apart on the light squares or play ...e5 and fall apart on the light squares.  In the Smith-Morra the ...e5 advance can be very strong, but black has to be very careful about f7 and the hole on d5 which is great for knights (see Smith-Morra Gambit #1).
Black must take, the queen is attacked as are numerous discovered checks, here's a sample of the danger: 12... Qb6?? 13.Nxh6  Kh7 14.Nf5#.
So... black is lost, but he's not ready to give up yet and he's going to lash out in the following moves, the rest of the game is pretty straightforward.
Bringing my king off the g1-a7 diagonal and preparing f4.
Again trying to tempt me to open the f file.  Black never really gets any play as much as he tries, white's got a space advantage and active pieces.
Trying to bring his bishop to d4, the bishop's much weaker on the outpost than the knight would be.
And black resigns, my king is breathing a lot of air, but he can't attack it yet and g5 is devastating.  I think this game shows a carefree way with pieces (except my blunder 14.Bd2?) and an attack on light squares then dark.  The ...e5 push can save black, getting his pieces into the game and making the bishop of f4 look awful, but it can only be played with great caution.  I think the line where black gives up his queen for three pieces is very interesting, and if anyone would like to play a game (rated or unrated) in it give me a PM or challenge me.  As always please leave comments and improvements.  I hope you enjoyed!
Better than Rxe4, since the pawn on d4 can be poisonous for a while and having to block the way back for the rook on the next move with Ne2 or playing Nb1 both seem very uncomfortable.
Preventing a pawn loss with 10....Qe5 is problematic because of 11. Nxf7 Kxf7 12. Ng5 and 10...Qf5 allows 11. Nxd4
As black will demonstrate, this leads to a forced exchange of two rooks vs a queen. Qd1 was likely a bit better
Aiming for f5-f6. While black can rather easily prevent this threat, it also creates a fast lane for my king and allows my knight to develop behind the f-pawn, rather than blocking it.
This move allows me to cover my knight for free. While I end up not using that to my advantage, playing Kc8 directly may have been a bit better.
I didn't really want to trade two pieces for a rook here, but 20. f5 Rxe1 21. Bxe1 Rxe1 22. Kf2 actually creates a rather dangerous situation for black, as I will look to play f6 on the next turn winning the g-pawn and creating a passed pawn that is quite far advanced. Black will still have a lot of play in that position, but I feel like I may have had a bit more chances in that line than the cautious one I took.
solving the issue with the f-pawn.
After the exchange, the pair of rooks seems even more dangerous than before, but what else was I supposed to do?
covering f4, so that g6 may be taken after Rxd4, but it may have been better to allow all that, as I would get to take h6 anyways. Instead, h4 seems like a reasonable option, looking to play h5 next, which creates some opportunities for my pawns on the king side to become dangerous.
forcing the rook off the e-file, which gives my king a bit of space.
further attempting to gain some counter play through my pawn majority on the KS
excellent move that I had not considered. 35. f7 is now prevented, as black will play 35...Re5, forcing the king to the f-file, which means the queen is lost.
preventing the nightmare scenario described above, but now black has enough time to pick up the pawn.
Most of white's moves already didn't really have a clear plan behind them any more and mostly played to some sort of misstep that would allow to pick up a pawn or something like that, but now the curtain definitely falls.
Forcing the king on the same row as the queen to play Rf3 for the win and therefore prompting the concession.
up until now, Black has managed well; this move however is not good... better was f4, Nh5, g5...
Nc6 adding more pressure to d4. Not too worried about that at this time so I will develop Bc4 aiming at f7
e6 opens diagonals for the Q & B. I think it's best to castle now.
Bd6 aims at h2 protected by K & N. It is time to get back to protect d4 with c3 keeping the N at bay
Not too sure why h6 and not developing the N preparing for castling
a6 preparing to drive the B away. Not in any danger, I move Re1 to controls the e file.
Black castles and Ne4 attacks the B & N. Not wanting to lose the Bishop or N x N opening the King's defense, Black's N x N and R takes N
c4 joins the attack and Bishop settles on c2
Qc7 doubles the attack on h2 hence N retreats to f3 to protect h2
f5 forces the Bishop to c2
Not too sure of black's plan with the Rf6, I finally develop the Bishop at e3
The f4 attack on the Bishop could be another mistake, it blocks the double attack on h2. the Bishop then attacks the R at f6 by going to d4.
The R retreats leaving Pawn at d5 unprotected and having control of e5 decided to trade Bishops
Qc5 focus on f2 could have driven the Q with d6 but have to protect  Nf3 so B is added to defend d5
With Rooks doubled protecting f4 I decided to attack Q with R and B with B pushing p d6
Rf6-e6 doubles on the e file preparing to attack Q. It seems I need an escape for the K with h3
Not sure what Re8 - e6 can do but with a piece up it seems a good time to begin trading pieces - Rd4
Q retreats to b7
Rg6 is played to support g5 but is driven away with h5
With the pawn pinned Q e8 doubles for attack on K. Ng6 is brought forward in the attack
Qf7 can be met with Qf5 forcing the Q exchange but prefer pinning Rook with Re4
Qf6 R x R continues the exchange
Qf7 trying to defend the K  Qe4+
The K has two squares to go now. If Kg7 then  Qg6+ Q x Q    N x Q
The most flexible reply to white's initial move. With this move black invites white to repent from his evil ways and transpose to a d4 Indian opening. Many white players may comply if black presents them with enough evidence that the Indian opening black has in mind is neither the Gruenfeld or the Benoni/Benko.
Black has kept his part of the deal by adopting a King's Indian setup, and here white could transpose directly to the King's Indian with 4. d4. Instead white insists on pushing for an English opening... something he will soon come to regret.
This move reveals white's intentions. White could have (and maybe should have!) transposed to a King's Indian with 6. d4, but instead he is planning to play the Botvinnik system of the English opening, which involves developing this knight to e2 and then play d3.
Best. The Botvinnik system is intended to face a King's Indian setup where black instead plays 6...e5, and white can obtain very good results with it. Instead, the move chosen by black gives white a much tougher time . Black clearly had access to a good database!
And here we have it, the Botvinnik system. On a first impression it seems that white has been smoking something he shouldn't have. He has locked up his g2 bishop behind his own pawns, has developed his King's knight to a less forceful position than f3, and now, on top of that, he has made a horrible hole in d4 for his opponent to exploit. But there's method to this madness. The idea of the Botvinnik setup is that, in exchange for all this, the center is now completely locked. Since black cannot hit back in the center with this setup, white intends to begin simultaneous offensives in the two flanks.  His plan is that he will be able to get to the black king and/or penetrate the queenside before black can take advantage of white's weaknesses. Against unprepared opposition, this plan very often gives excellent results. My opponent, however, was not in this category...
One more move in preparation for what's to come. Alternatively white can begin the offensive in the Queenside with 11. Rb1 Nd4 12. b4 cxb4 13. Rxb4; instead 11. Kh1 anticipates that white will be playing f4 very soon. This is an important move because once white plays f4 and the battle is in full swing, disaster will often result if white's king is caught with his pants down with a check along the g1-a7 diagonal.
And here black decides to innovate with what I consider an excellent move. The correct plan when playing against the Botvinnik setup is to fight fire with fire, that is, to begin offensives in both flanks. The alternative is to delay the kingside offensive for a bit with 11... Nd4 12. f4 e6 13. Rb1 f5. I must admit I was already beging to feel uneasy at this point...
Black cannot play 14... Nxc4?? because of 15. Qd5 , winning the knight. However, on a hindsight it would probably have been better to play 14. b3, with the intention of developing the dark-squared bishop via b2 and not leaving the a1-h8 diagonal under control of black's dark squared bishop. As we will soon see, in the following moves black's bishop becomes a formidable weapon on account of its unchallenged control of this diagonal.
Already white is beginning to regret his decision in move 14. Black's dark-squared bishop has started to put enormous pressure on the a1-h8 diagonal, and white decides he better get his rook out of the bishop's scope as soon as possible. This is no small thing. With this move he not only gives up on a potential queenside offensive: now that the rook has left a1 black will begin a queenside offensive himself!
Excellent move: black wastes no time and prepares to take over the queenside with b5. My sense is that, at the very least, black has now fully equalized.
After 15. cxb5? Rxb5 white's b3 pawn would become a permanent target for black's rooks. White has become aware that black is about to seize the initiative in the queenside and deploys his rook to prevent invasion via the b-file. Still, black will now create a weak pawn for him in c4 that will be under serious pressure from his light-squared bishop in e6.
Black's position is already superb at this point. From here on he can just take his time and prepare to double his major pieces on the b or a files; white can do nothing to prevent this since black's dark-squared bishop controls the a1 and b2 squares that white would need to occupy with his rook in order to prevent an eventual invasion of his queenside.
Mostly just a bluff; white threatens 21. f5, but this threat can easily be taken care of with 21... Bg8 which is what black plays. After 21... Bg8, white can't really advance his f-pawn any further, because doing so will provide black's d7 knight with a perfect outpost in e5.
An excellent move, with which black starts to take complete control of the queenside; white can't play 23. Nxe7, since his position will simply collapse after 23... Bxc4, with both black bishops now having full scope on the queenside. Black's position is phenomenal. I submitted this game to post-mortem analysis in Fritz 10, and it considered that black had made the very best moves since move 12!
With this move white gives up on a possible kingside attack, but there's little else to recommend, since white will simply be demolished if black ever gets to play Bxc4.
And just when black is in complete control of the game, a terrible blunder. With this move, black's light-squared bishop (which was exerting enormous indirect pressure on white's weak c-pawn) is suddenly left out of the game, and on top of that, black's rooks are suddenly left disconnected. Fritz recommends 23... Nb6!. White of course cannot then play 24. Nxe7? since he will not survive after 24... Bxc4!. But even more so, he cannot play 24. Nxb4? either, since 24...Nxc4! 25. Qd3 Rxb4 will simply kill him because of the massive onslaught in the queenside. White thus would have no choice other than 24. Bf1, which reduces him to critical passivity. It's almost unfair that, after the text move, black's excellent position simply collapses.
Fritz noted that here I missed a much stronger option, 24. Nxb4! Rxb4 25. e5, where the threat of 26. e6 forces black to lose material.
Forced but forceful. Maybe black was expecting white to play 25. exd5?? putting and end to the vulnerability of his c4 pawn and winning both more space and a strong control of the crucial e6 square, but white would then lose a piece after 25... Bxc3 26. Qxc3 Qxc3 27. Rxc3 Rxb1 (or even 25... Rxb1 26. Rxb1 Bxc3). Once again all this is due to the fact that black's dark-squared bishop is stronger in this position than any other piece except the queen! But after 25. Nxd5 black's once overwheliming pressure is suddenly entirely dispelled since he is forced to change his active major pieces.
White will now be in control of the b-file (which black has controlled throughout the game), but there was nothing black could do to prevent this, since 26...Rf8? 29. Nxe7, or 26... Bf6 27. Rxb8 Nxb8 28. Rb1. The disastrous consequences of disconnecting his rooks with 23. Rf7? can be plainly seen at this point, where the tables have turned completely and white is now in control of the queen-side.
Black's position is miserable, with all his pieces suddenly pushed against the edge of the board and having to wait for white to invade with Rb7. In anticipation of 28. Rb7 and the pressure the white rook will exert against his e7 pawn, black gets his bishop out of the jam into a position where it can support this pawn, and at the same time tempts white to relieve the pressure in exchange for the bishop pair with 28. Nxf6(?). But 27... Bf6? is a serious mistake, as it allows white to win material in an already critical position. Fritz recommends 27... h6, but I actually think that 27... e5, clearing the e-pawn from its vulnerable square and giving black some space to breath, was much better.
Black fails to see that the primary target of 28. Rb7 is not really the e-pawn. The only alternative was 28... Nf8, although after 29. g5 Bd4 30. Nxe7 Rg7 31. Rc7 black would be fighting an uphill battle for a draw. Now, with the text move, white wins a piece.
This is how black loses a piece; if 31... Kg7 then 32. g5, or if 31... e5 then 32. fxe5 Ne8 33. e6 , winning black's bishop with the discovered check. It is a cruel irony indeed that black had complete control of the a1-h8 diagonal throughout all of the game but loses as soon as white takes over it. Black resigns.
Gotta get my bishop in the battle before I start my attack.
Phase Two: Align the queen with the bishop to prepare for Bh6.
Black threatens my bishop. He ignores my h bishop... for now...
Not the best, but at least I get something.
Now, if black's knight moves anywhere, it's checkmate Qxh7. My next couple moves would probably be 13. f4, exf4 (hopefully) 14.Rxf4, threatening the knight and checkmate
The most logical move, aiming at the center
White has to develop quickly. It's hard for black to castle short because the g knight cannot go to f6 and h6 is a bad place. Furthermore, the pawn f6 opens the diagonal a2-g8 for the white bishop. On the other hand, both white bishops aim at the black queen side and can be dangerous in case of long castle.
To eject the ennoying black bishop
Protecting the e pawn and allowing the queen to come on e2
Weak move, I suppose. It let the initiative to the white and the b pawn is now unprotected.
defending the e pawn and aiming at d5 with the eventuallity of a sacrifice to oblige the c pawn to move.
It supress a menace but weakens black center and the exchanges are good for the one with material advance
To permit the d rook to menace the white queen but letting the initiative to white. Now it will be hard for black to join both rooks
To escape the d rook menace, protect the  bishop in a7 and create a menace on e file (permiting e5)
I hesitated between 16. Re1 and 16. Rd1 to settle on the open file. I finally opted for e1 because I planned to play e5 as soon as possible and because the a rook can come on d1.
Sicilian, I see it a lot in expert play, and I have been playing it more frequently lately.  I figure if the big boys play it, it must be good!
The knight has to go somewhere. Standard chess dogma tells us that moving a piece twice before developing the other pieces is not the best practice.
well, D'oh!  Thanks for the queen white, nice trade! But white has plans for the double attack on f7. White seems to believe that the positional advantage was worth the Queen.
I choose the move c6 over c7 to keep the c pawn close and to allow escape into the corner after clearing the Queen's Knight and rook and a6 ... that was my idea anyhow.
I'll be honest, I moved here because it was the most popular move in the GK DB. I was worried about Ne6, but that should result in trading bishop for bishop and white must be careful about trading to blithely due to the queen deficit.
White prepares to castle. Without a queen in the fray, protecting the King is paramount!
Clearing space for my king on the home row, I hope I can manage to get him back there!
Giving away this pawn, but the black diagonals it blocked had to be cleared.
Still, a pawn is a pawn, and I need to gain all the material I can!
Not sure if that was really the right place for the King, but I didn't like the prospect of ...Kc7 15. Nb5+
It's to my advantage to trade pieces now. And the fork is rather nasty with his ws bishop unprotected.
lining up on his King.
It's unclear to me why White did not nab the rook.
Opening the diagonal for my bs bishop.
he can lose the rook with Rf2, or the game with Kh1. A good game, and an interesting gambit by white in the beginning.
Black achieves the classic pawn centre: pawns on d5 and e5. Normally it's white who can get this - a measure of my ineptitude!
A strong move, making good use of black's strong centre and forcing me to retreat further.
Not a move I particularly wanted to play, as it weakened my king-side noticeably. Black continued to attack on that side with his next move.
My next move, f4, would have been better played before this, as it brings the g3 square under attack.
Plays this to weaken black's strong centre pawns, even if it costs white a pawn in return.
The a7-g1 diagonal is still blocked, so the black bishop cannot control it. In the meantime, white can snap up black's f-pawn to regain the lost material.
At this point, black resigned. Speaking as white, I'm not sure why - he looked to be a noticeably better player than me. My best guess is that he had seen his main attack blunted and did not want to play on without a queen. Thank you for reading this. Comments are welcome.
The move 12...d5? opens up the black position where white is better developed with a safe king. Black's position is not yet developed and the king is still in the center.
This move sacrifices the e pawn in order to open up the game. I considered g5 but wanted to be able to recapture on g5 with the h pawn.
It was scary to contemplate giving up the knight at this point. However, capturing on c5 seems to give black everything he wants and enables him to castle after recapturing with the bishop.
English Opening. This was my standard opening at the time. I recently changed it to King's Pawn though.
At this point, the game is simply starting off as standard: Both sides are even, and both sides continue to develop. I'm glad I'm able to do that now.
Black is preparing to castle as well.
Here's where that move I made on move 9 comes into play. See, when black moved his Knight to e4, his g7 Bishop was lined up for my c3 Knight. We see what happened next. Sounds like a simple exchange, but not exactly. I can't take black's LSB (Light Spaced Bishop) because his DSB (Dark Spaced Bishop) now targets my a1 rook. Of course I will move my rook. That move I made at move 9 did allow black to start to gain a bit of an advantage, but it could be worse. You will see the other reason why the move 9 move was an inaccuracy in a moment.
Here's the final result of white's inaccuracy earlier. Black gains a free pawn. It may only be a pawn and not matter that much, but since black is clearly getting a positional advantage, you can see now how 9. d3 was an inaccuracy. There is still plenty of game to go.
It's pretty obvious to me that black plans to exchange pieces. It's not always the case though, so I play this move to ensure the exchange.
I knew it was better to keep a good pawn structure for my king, thus, I took with the queen instead of the g2 pawn.
I decide to take with the pawn.
Now that black can attack the king with a check, white must defend. The thing is, white can't defend by using their LSB, unless they want to lose their queen. Obviously that is not the case. There is no way to save the bishop, thus, the move made before is a blunder, not only because now black gains a big material advantage, but also a greater position against white.
I could of moved the queen to other positions, but I figured staying with the bishop like this was best.
This is the stage where the king becomes a factor. It is needed to protect the f3 pawn.
I decide to attack black's bishop, hoping to give me more room to maneuver. This is actually a mistake. Again, I will explain why through the next few moves.
I at first found it interesting black did not play Rxf3 to give his Bishop protection. Of course, there is nothing wrong with a fair exchange instead. Now that I think about it though, giving up more of my pieces probably isn't the best idea, but I couldn't think of much else. Black must of taken opportunity of that, but of course, I don't know that exactly, but I'd say it's most likely. This is why the previous move by white as a mistake. You will see in a few moves the outcome of doing so.
I decide to get my both of my rooks involved here, again, not thinking about keeping my pieces on the board.
No surprise there, an exchange.
I'm not surprised it was a double exchange.
Black obviously wants to make sure white does not try to stop the pawn from promoting. I would expect no less.
Black prepares for the mate.
instead of taking the g4 knight, I continue the attack on his exposed king
Although this move is part of a book opening, I don't understand what it tries to achieve. The bishop would probably have to move back to b7 anyway, so isn't that like loosing a tempo?
had to think a lot for this move. still unsure whether this was the best option. Other options were d5, a3 and h3. The ones I had to decide between in the end were e5 and d5. Both look good for white, but e5 has various very tactical lines. d5 locks the position, and the game develops slower. i think that the advantage is more sure with d5, but would be slow to convert into anything tangible. it would most probably be followed by d6, and exchange of the bishop for knight by black on c3. With e5, black's best reply seems to be cxd4. Bxf3 is also good. After Bxf3, white's pawns double, exposing the king on an open g file. After cxd4, white could play exf6 or Bxh7, both of which look good. Probably moving the c knight at some point would be a good idea, to avoid black exchaninging it for a useless bishop.
interesting move. i did not expect it. prevents white from taking on h7 with check. however, i think that it is a 'slow' move, and black needed a 'fast' move at this time. now white can simply play exf6, and black would be forced to play Nxf6 or gxf6 (otherwise white wins the black Q). Nxf6 definately looks the better of the two. After that white can decide about what to do with black's threat of cxd4. Options would include Ne4, Ne5, a3, Bxh7 etc..
the space around black's king has opened up. however, black now also has open files to place his rooks on to attack white's king in conjunction with his bishops. however black's N is still undeveloped.
with the aim of lodging in at d6. black should next play a move which blocks white's black B, or opens space around his rook, otherwise white can win the exchange by playing Nc7. 17..f5 looks to be the best for black. This sequence of moves leaves white's white B weaker.
opens space around rook, and scares the N off
Black exchanges his weak black B for white's N which would have cramped things for black had it stayed on d6. However, white is now left with 2 bishops, which could work well to dominate the board
to protect Bxh7. But now black cannot play f5 (which would have reduced white's white B's mobility and strengthened the f-pawn) since black's rook and king are on the same diagonal.
rook to semi-open file.
pins N. opens up space for R to exert influence. Cheekily invites f5 from black. Black's camp is now quite cramped. The N can't move, the Q has few squares to go to, and must protect f6. Black has to think of a way to liberate himself, and white has to think of a way to use the space he has to attack.
protects the c-pawn against a potential Na5. The 2 general concepts in my mind at this time were to weaken the black pawns by moving my f-pawn up the board. This threat is quite real and near, so black should move his king and play f5 as soon as possible. If white had played f4 immediately, then 23..Na5 24.b3 Bxe4 25.Qxe4 f5, and black is now less cramped, and white hasn't succeeded in weakening black's center pawns as he would have wished. The other thing I wanted to do was to double up on the d-file, and exert pressure on black's backward d-pawn.
Black most probably played this to make his position more 'fluid' - to free his pieces. However the N has no squares where it is currently at. Black would be aiming to exchange bishops, and then play the N to b7, or maybe even c6.
With the aim of doubling on the d-file. Once the rooks are doubled, white can move the B from d6, and bring it to the long diagonal where it would be powerful. Also, the Q would be protecting both, d7 and f6, which could cause black problems.
At this point I had to make a few important decisions. First of all I had to decide whether I wanted black to take my B. Nxd6 would leave me without my dark bishop. In this position, the dark bishop appears to be quite powerful. Placed on the a1-h8 diagonal, it could cause black problems. However if I moved the bishop, after a few moves black could advance the d-pawn (but if Nxd6, then Rxd6 keeps the d-pawn back, and weak). And there were also 2 options if I decided to move my B - I could either bring it to the b2 square through a3, or I could take it to f4, and then play Bh6 at some point. So at this junction, I was considering 3 moves: Ba3, Bf4 and a move in which I wouldn't move my B, probably Qb2
This was a very difficult decision for me. I didn't play Qb2 because e5 by black didn't look good. I also didn't want to exchange much material right now, because I fealt that the pressure was on black, and exchanges would let some of the steam off. I didn't play Bf4 because it didn't seem to do much. Now black may be able to play d5 at some point, which would give him space, and strengthen his d-pawn. However white's bishop would be strong at b2.
Attacks a6, and threatens Qe3. After Qe3 white could play Bxd5, with the white Q eventually taking on e6, and leaving the black king in real danger. Maybe it was a bit premature for black to resign - the position however, does favour white quite heavily.
best way to counter play on the wings? play in the centre of course!
fighting for space on the queenside
developing with tempo. obviously not bxc5 when black achieves everything he could possibly want after Bxc5, whites queenside pawns are very weak and blacks bishops are deadly.
logical, maintaining the pin on the knight and creating a pin on the bishop on a central square the queen cannot be driven from
refusing the sac as after 14...Bxg2 15.Rg1 white gets an attack going against my kingside. probably not worth the 2 pawns but i'd rather not have to weather the storm, i've got a winning material advantage anyway, i'd rather just have the task of converting it.
Forcing white to weaken the light squares around his king, which my light square bishop is in the perfect position to exploit
reopening the rooks line of attack, but Bc7 is the better retreat as it would help in my fight for the d file in some lines later in the game
logical, opposing my rook on the d file
removing whites light squared bishop and thus further weakening his white squares
closing in on the light square weaknesses around the king, threating to come in on both h3 and f3
?? this natural looking move is suprisingly fatal, now white loses his king or his queen. f5 avoids immediate disaster but the white king can definately feel the draft. after f5 the game would still be very much in the balance with both sides fighting for an edge. this is where it becomes obvious that the bishop is better placed on c7 as whites main asset would be his control of the d file and on c7 the dark squared bishop influences d8 allowing the rook to compete for the open file
best capture, taking with the pawn allows white to force the queens off when white will be down 2 pieces and two pawns for a rook but will have active prospects thanks to his control of the d file. although the game is still very much blacks to lose. taking with the bishop is obviously wrong as black will lose his best piece
?? the final nail in his kings coffin, black can now force mate. 21.cxd5 Bxd5 22.Qxd5 exd5 is the only way to avoid losing the king. Rfd1 is met by Nf4 with mate next move
the queen sacrifices herself to insure the enemy kings death
Double check, forcing the king to move to the one square not attacked by a black piece
I was positively surprised to see the Scandinavian defence, because it is a line that I play as well and few others seem to use it, certainly not the 2.... Nf6 line which is played in this game.
And I think we switched to the Qxd5 variation here, with Qxd5 and Nf6 swapped. Still ok, but I like to push a queen around while developing.
And so I start pushing. I prefer c4 over Nc3 as it gives me more space and even prepares a move like d5 dominating the center. I don't really mind a move like Qe4+ as I can put my DSB in between (I'd rather not move my knight to e2 as it belongs on f3 and Be2 gets struck down by Qxg2 and the loss of a rook)
An attack on my center, well it had to come sooner or later. e5 also allows Bb4+ which could get annoying since my DSB is pinned. Most people say that after Bb4+ you can play Nc3 since Bxc3 bxc3 is ok for white, with a solid center and the bisschop pair, but I still ain't convinced.
?? A blunder on my part. It allows Qxg2 and wins material. But I saw some interesting attacking possibilities in this position, black's king is still centralised, and yes indeed only one move away from castling, but if I can prevent that the open center might prove to give black troubles.
Qa4 to be able to castle queenside. Almost completing development and keeping the option of possibly trapping the queen.
again I think this was the only correct move since after Qxh1 dxe5 the knight goes to g4? and then I've got Be4 trapping the queen, so Nh5, Nd7 (and Ng8) are the only options, Nd2 blocks his LSB and Nh5 just puts the knight out of the game. But Be4 is not an option anymore after Bxc3. It however grants me the option to lose a minor piece rather than a rook with Ne2.
Winning the d-pawn, and thus preventing dxe5. Now was the time for some serious planning. I took with the knight on d4 because after castling my bischop would prove far stronger than the knight on d4 eying on the long diagonal and attacking the knight which would become undefended after Rg1 pinning the g7-pawn with tempo on the queen. and if he didn't castle then I would've got two rooks that would jump to the open d- and e-files harassing his king. I also wanted that half open g-file which would put me in a great attacking position.
allowing Bxg7! giving up any hopes of kingside castling and as long as my rook stays on the d-file, castling queenside will be hard too. The threat of Nxf2 has to be taken into account of course, but I found Nxf2 Rg3! and after Nxd3 Rdxd3 I have two connected rooks on the 3rd rank and I'm still threatening to win that h8 rook. I think that O-O would have saved the day. since after O-O, what attack does white have? Rg3 Qf4+ and forced Be3, leaving the important a1-h8 diagonal or the more passive Bc3, which can be followed by a simple Kh8 or Bd7 threatening Nd4 with a discovered attack on the queen and after that Ne2+ forcing the exchange of bischops
This is also check, and I win the h8 rook and in the end get a material advantage.
Black has finally moved all of his minor pieces but can't hope to castle just yet. I don't think that taking the rook was a mistake, but you have to keep in mind that you might get a hard time defending after such a voyage of the queen in the opening.
trying to get the a1 rook involved and unpinning the knight, well, he wasn't going to castle anyways.
I didn't want to lose that bischop as it would demolish my fragile material lead. I do however wonder why I didn't play Bc3 immediately as this just allows my opponent to play Rg8 and take another tempo on my bischop.
a6 probably with the idea of b5, but all help gets too late after Qa3+ Ke8 Bf6 only the queen sac on d6 can provide king safety as the knight on c6 can't block and e7 and d8
Here my opponent resigned for the reasons mentioned above. It was a very interesting game, and I am still not convinced that either side had a clear win. I still wonder if the position after Qxg2 was level. anyways, thanks for reading, comments are appreciated.
White has to risk some more if he wants an attack line.
Black has time to relocate his lsb on the big diagonal.
Attacks b6 and, indirectly, f7. And delays the bishop's run to b7.
Now the other bishop will search for the fianchetto. Very delicate.
Can you imagine how deep calculations must be performed in order to be able to play this?
I won't say ?, but it seems to deserve it. The pawn costed 2 tempoes, and the white's queenside is weak. The white's attack over the black king is not going anywhere, right now.
QxQ, RxQ, Bh3! would have be the right move. Leontxo says Karpos was in time trouble here. <n><n>36.	b6-b8	e8-b8<n>37.	g2-h3	b8-b3<n>38.	h3-e6	b3-c3<n>39.	b2-c3	g7-c3<n>40.	d1-d6	g8-g7<n>41.	e6-f7	g7-f7<n>42.	h4-h7+
Leontxo says this is a mistake. In fact, Rb1+, NxR, QxN+, and white has a hard time defending against multiple threats. But here, the simple Ne3 seems to win.
The first move, which is used to try and make the player take it.
Now, if greedy Someone else is feeling really greedy, he will capture the pawn and lose his own pawn and a rook.
Now Someone gets the pawn, and in the next move a rook.
Someone else gasps and tries to block in the bishop…
Someone else is going to try to get the bishop now.
Threatens bishop in order to open up the queen and bishop.
Pushes up queen to play e3, opening up the bishop.
Opens up the bishop.
Someone else accepts the swap.
…And as stupid as his move is, someone else doesn't want to swap knights.
ok, lets resolve the centre.  Daring move, but the computer liked it, and who i am to argue??
I got a bit aggressive here but it didnt hurt me or him.  The board leans in his favor at this point but not by much. If he takes the bait and strikes with the pawn i have a strategy to make him uncomfortable.
He took it.  Now the game begins.  I thought he should have moved the knight and attacked that poorly placed pawn with this kings bishop or queen.  He would have won it eventually, especially if he started wreaking havoc with his earlier pawn push, which for some reason he gave up on.
this was part of my plan if he attacked he took the pawn with his.  Ive been anticipating his king side pawns to start attacking but he backed off on that strategy, leaving me feeling better and more comfortable taking chances.
Now, the weakness was exposed in that pawn push from earlier.
starting to defend the center
i want to castle
he want to  occupy the diagonal
to the center and to free the DB
where to go?
creating a square for the bishop
attackin and discovering the kingside it gives me idea not to castle and to attack
releasing my bishop and giving my self the option to castle
developing the queen and a option to queen side castle to attack the white king
decide to attack to castle at queen side
i was thinking in casling queen side or nf5 if taken with the bishop the g file will be open rook to king then casle and also attack the weak square e3a triple fork king queen and a rook
To guard the base QP, but N-KB3 would be a better choice. If then 4... B-N5, 5 B-K3 develops and safeguards the QP. 4 N-KB3 would also allow the development of the KB and a quick K-side castle.
Taking advantage of White's tangled development. If White had played 4 N-KB3, he would be in a position to block the diagonal of the B with an eventual B-Q3.
IF White had played 4 N-KB3, this move would be strong, as the Black Knight would be forced to retreat. With the KB controlling Q3, Black's best move would be 6... N-QR3, guarding the QBP and preparing R-B1. However...
...because of White's mistake on move 4, Black wins at once with this move. After 7 K-Q2, Black wins the Exchange with 7... NxKBP forking Q and R.
I accept it, probably the best!
Threatening the bishop away with this pawn-push.
Exchange of the queens nearly totally stop the attack!
Chasing the bishop away!
And there comes the rook!
It´s NEVER good to start wandering up on the board with the king. It´s dangerous, he can be mated or lose material when he tries to avoiding being mated!
White can´t take back with the king. If he does that then Bd5+ will win the white rook.
A big mistake! Leads to Bg4+! Wins the rook!
0-0-0 leads to that my other rook will come in in the game quicker!
Black's intention is to fix the white c pawns up for attack. White should strive to activate the bishop pair and make it count for something. Therefore, he should castle, keep the tension between the pawns, play in the center with move of e4. Black will try to make white the one releasing the tension, by playing ...e5. So white needs to stop this move. However, my opponent was not thinking about the planning, and just makes ordinary moves that give black an advantage.
Now ...e5 is a threat, since black will pressure d4 even more greatly. So 9.Bf4 is more likely the best move. 9...Nh5 10.Be3 and the knight is not well placed.
The lazy "natural" move gives black the advantage.
So black is playing in the center, and threatening to win material. Here is a rule you can use when ceding the bishop pair. *When ceding a bishop of a color, you can place your pawns on the color of that bishop*. It works a lot of the time in many openings. Sicilian dragon, where there is no yugoslav attack: f6, e5 if Bh6.
White finally collapses under the tension and captures; A mistake. Now the c pawns of white are the real weaknesses, and black has retrained the activity of the white piecs with the good e5 and c5 pawns.
White threatened to capture b7, so black prevented it. Right now, white has weaknesses, while it is much more difficult to attack black's position. The weakness on c4 can be probed at almost anytime, and any endgame with king and another piece should favor black. Therefore, black is having a big strategical advantagae.
To be honest, I felt a bit unsure at this point. If my plans were going well, I should not have to retreat my pieces. It turns out that it was the best move. Furthermore, this move is not really a passive move, since it eyes the white queen.
It is a really big tactical mistake now. The queen has no where to go. Therefore, black needs to search for tactical resources. Can you find the right move?
Now the white queen is lost, and I had believed to have won the game here. Therefore, I played the rest of my moves quickly, and counted this as a "sure win".
This is a real mistake that seriously hurts the black winning chances. 18...Nc7 was the simple alternative that led to a clean win. However, I planned this move the last turn, and decided it was best without due thought.
As you can see now, black's advantage is not so great actually. It is perhaps a -/+, but that is it. Maybe even =/+. Here, I started to worry a bit, and saw my missed win. So I slowed back down and composed another plan. Since I have space on the kingside, as well as the king to attack and some misplaced white pieces, I need to attack there. ...f5 is an idea, followed by ...f4. Furthermore, white is not losing his light squared bishop for less effective knight, so I can exploit the light weaknesses as well.
White's last move was a tactical mistake. Now black can crash straight through the king's position! When you make the correct plan and play it out unhindered, it makes a real difference.
So now black is winning once more, and has another clear plan: Kill the king in the center area.
A nice little combination that destroys the king cover. When the king had been forced to run to the middle, Every turn was spent calculating the forcing moves that could possibly bring me an instant kill. Although some think it is very dfficult to calculate them each turn, it must be done so you don't miss something. If the forcing move is really bad, chances are you will tell in a few seconds.
How did this have to do with bias in chess? A lot of moves that were critical to the game were affected by them. Some of the most common biases are:<n>1.(In the case of examining forcing moves)If I threaten him with that pawn, he can take it 4 ways, so one of them is bound to be good. I won't consider it at all. But maybe all those captures lose!<n>2.Oh, this move forks his pieces, exploits weak king, and frees my position, it must be the best move! Admiring a move can only blind you to other possibilities.<n>3.My opponent attacked my queen, so where should I put it? Think counterattack first, since they are more forcing and they help push your agenda.
Now white can force a queen exchange with 12.Qxf5 exf5 13. Nc6  , but further analysis will find a better move
the oldest trick in the book, exploiting the weakness of f7
if not, white will be an exchange and pawn up. Perhaps it would have offered better chances for black
exploiting the pin on the a2-g8 diagonal
Too ambitious, after 5. ... Ng4! 6. Nh3 Qh4+! there's no 7. g3 because of Qxh3, and Ke2/Kf1 is bad too due to of 7. ... Nf2 (8. Nxf2 Qxf2#), and the White King is in trouble.
There were no reasons to castle and put White's King under the pin from c5.
White have got a material advantage, but this move could get them in serious trouble:<n>12. ... Ne2++ 13. Kh1 Ng3+ 14. hxg3 hxg4+ 15. Nh4 fxg3 16. d4 Rxh4+ 17. Kg1 Rah8 and there's no defence against 18. ... Rh1#!
An attempt to attack or what?..
Double strike to b7 and f7
Strange move here for Black. It was better to develop the other pieces.
An attempt to place the Rook in position for an attack.
Another bad move in my opinion. Better was Be6 and later develop the Knight to c6
Now Black is starting to feel the pressure and is beeing punished for not developing faster.
Black tries to leave a place todevelop the Knight. At this point I saw a wonderful tactical blow.
16... g3? Black tries to counter but at the same time weakens even further the position of its King. Here I had a number of options. I decided not to take the advancing pawn because it could pose a threat to my King since lines would open to the remaining Black Rook. That couls be dangerous for my King and Black still had a well placed Knight.
Black resigned. Rc7 would follow and with the King in bad position it would be an easy win. Hope you learned something with this game.
black desided to exchange central pawns early
Gallagher variation. Black desided not to play c6 (leaving d5 for white pieces) and trying to make counterplay on queenside.
black is continuing in his plan. This move makes white knight to leave his centralized field but d5 and d6 are now black problem
14. .. b5 is logical continuation but after 15. f4 Ned7 16. Qxd6 white has an advantage as shown in many games. <n>I prefer Be6 instead of Nc6, there is no reason to leave with knight, let's wait for white f4 which makes white kingside weaker
Re3! attack (Rd3 heading for d6) and defence (cover of knight c3) in one move.
logical move. Strong King Indians black bishop on g7 has his oponent on b2 now<n>Not Qxd6 because Bh6 and Rbd8 of course
Black get off weaknesses d5 and d6 but another trouble is about to be solved. Maybe acknowledge a mistake and return Qd8?
Ne5 wasnt possible for f4 with e5, maybe stick with black plan and go for Na7?! with b5 idea<n>Knight on b4 is out of play will stay here till the end
pinning b4 knight and making space to transfer rook b1 to new battle-field, kingside
Black doesn't want to exchange blacksquared bishops so there is another plan of defense ..
Mistake IMHO. White logically wanted to leave from c1-h6 diagonal but forget about b4 knight. It's "trapped" on b4 square but some white piece must cover d3 field!
Hi everyone!  I thought I would talk about a recent game I won in the Barmy Army Tournament.  Looking at the rating differential you would think it should be a piece of cake for me.  I was aware of my opponent's optimum rating, however - 1330.  Looking back through his profile he has an impressive array of wins over 1400  opposition and even a 1500  player.  In those games he either delivered checkmate or his opponents resigned on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  His playing strength is therefore very similar to The Dentist - remember him, anyone?  Well, I did manage to beat NN in 18 moves - Glenda struck again, but there was a stage in the game where I took 2 days to come back with a move for the want of a plan.  I hope you have a good read as this is all about an unusual opening.
4. h3 - unusual continuation - probably to take me out of the database.  I did see in the database, however that somebody had played a3 and the suggested continuation was Nxe4 with at least equality for black and then I could get to see what my opponent's endgame play was like!  It didn't quite work out that way though!
8. ....... d6 - after losing that pawn, white continues to develop sensibly and his queen exerts some pressure on b3 - on the b7 pawn and the f7 pawn is pinned.  My move opens up the diagonal for Frere Leblanc who bears down on h3 with the possibility of a bishop sac on h3 to open up the white king.
9. ....... Rb8 - after white's loosening g4 I decide to back up my b7 pawn to enable a possible bishop sac on g4 - white advances his pawn further to g5 with his next move.
11. ...... g6 - not sure I like this move but it does support my knight on h5 which controls g3 - this will become a deciding factor later on.  Over the next two moves we have some sensible development from white but in between that Frere Leblanc goes to g4 first to enable Glenda to deposit herself on d7 and then later on he will go to h3 to menace the f1 rook and then Glenda will land a nasty check on g4.  So how does this all materialise?  Read on .....
After the initial brief conflict, the complications begin...
Now the pressure has been switched to the  d5 pawn....
I take it while I can though, I feel I'm gonna be too busy to do it after this opportunity....
This must have come as a bit of a thunderbolt! the Queen is immune due to Rxf7 25 Rd8+ Rf8 26 Rxf8# after this moral sapping loss black begins to snap under the pressure...
Black cannot defend against the twin mating threats and resigns. A very enjoyable game to play and I hope to read also. Thanks.
The Polish attack! Or perhaps, Sokolsky opening. Well I wasn't expecting this in this Blitz game. But there was no way I wanted that dark squared bishop looking at my kingside. After a very brief think, I decide to accept doubled pawns if white chooses to do that...
And now I may end up with a knight on g7! Now obviously, a better way to have approached this odd flank opening would have been with 1. ...e5 but aside from white getting good pressure in the center, stay tuned for what follows...
Here I decide to create a little queenside action, simply to not allow white to totally restrict black.
Bb7 might have been a better move here. But, because of the position, if white takes the c pawn, I plan on driving up the board a bit on the queenside. And if not, then I had ideas to free up my knight and light-squared bishop. Now yes, black looks really bad, lol. But white's pieces are not that well coordinated yet, and I can't afford to let them get coordinated!
I am beginning to feel a little better about black's position now.
Better for white was Bd4 or Nd4. But his momentary failure to see this allowed me to cover it on my next move.
I think this was an inaccuracy here. It gives me one more tempo to reposition a knight to a very useful place, and with my kingside fianchettoed, there would be no lasting pin on g4. Fritz agrees.
Now at this point of the game, both sides look rather awkward. Fritz insists the game is still even. No one has yet blundered, but a couple of small inaccuracies have been made, leading to white's dark squared bishop being rather out of the action, and black to being still cramped, although not as badly as before.
I give this some thought, and decide I would not mind so much if the pawns were doubled, as it would give me the f file. I don't want the white e pawn advancing any further, especially with the way white's pieces are set up. Fritz does not like this idea, preferring that I not allow those pawns to be doubled.
I am not wanting to control the f4 square, but white felt he needed to make sure he did. Fritz thinks Qg4 was much better, and this is the first move Fritz really dislikes. Nor do I do what Fritz wishes; I don't want to move a knight to c3, because it allows white to find an immediate use for his one bad bishop. But after 22. ...Ndc3 23. Bxc3 bxc3, black gains dangerous piece pressure on the queenside. One line would continue 24. Rd1 Nxd4 25. Qd3 c5 26. Ne3 Kg7 and little is left for white to try; 27. f4 is too dangerous. In this blitz game, however, I did not see this.
Here I am preparing a bit of a push on the f file. For some reason, white's dark squared bishop has seemingly been forgotten in that upper corner, and I am not minding that one bit. It's a pretty bad bishop right now, and would take a couple moves to undo that. But white does not see the long term value of doing so at this point.
I believe that white is simply creating a place for his queen to go so that g pawn can move forward. The white king will be exposed, but I am still a ways from being able to take advantage of that.
And white thinks he has shut down my attack. Well... we'll see here in a bit. I have an idea, but don't know if I have time to do it. And white can easily force my rook from f5...
I'd like to get my king to g7 at some point, but perhaps not quite yet. Now I'm committed to my idea; the black rook cannot escape easily... and if this wasn't Blitz, I'm pretty sure white would find the way to win a pawn...
I of course am forced to exchange knights because I don't want to move my rook in this position. For some reason, white does not continue with the obvious to threaten the black rook here.
Hmmm. I had not considered just that bishop move, as obvious as it is. With Bd3 on his next move, black would have to play what he had prepared before he was ready. I try one move first, to see white's intention. Can you guess black's intention yet?
Rf3 here for white is dangerous for black. If Rf3, black will be hard pressed to salvage a draw. But white misses it, having decided he wants his rook to take the b pawn. So at this point, the game takes a different turn than it otherwise would have.
I did not take with the e pawn because I did not want that diagonal open for the white queen, nor did I wish to have an unsupported backwards pawn. Nor did I want white to get in e6. And because white chose to give up that powerful white bishop, I can try my idea on my terms now if white does not move Rf3.
What would you do here as black? It's likely easy to see now since there is not much else black can do here and I've given plenty of hints on what white needed to do. You stronger players will know anyways. It turns out to give black an advantage, now that the white light-squared bishop is no longer on the board.
Bxf4! So white thinks a bit here. And decides to take it on.
To keep the game from getting away from white, Qh3 was called for here. This is the game's first real blunder, and it gives black such an advantage that even in Blitz, it's not given back. After Qh3, however, black's winning chances are greatly reduced even though black still has good opportunities to draw with best moves, according to Fritz.
I missed Qf5! which would have been even better here. Well, to be honest I thought about it. But time was short, and I did not have time to think it all the way through; seeing that nothing was imminently going to threaten the black king, I decided to take the bishop.
Either Qf5 or Qf1 as I chose are both now devastating, and the game will end soon.
Kh3 also leads to a won endgame for black. This loses immediately...
without even paying attention to the board
blocking the queen from my rook and not to move the bishop to protect my queen.
I'm going to take the queen away from the play by having her take out my knight.
The bishop is lined up
I was already planning to fianchetto this bishop; it's an even more obvious choice now, with b4 in White's control.
Releasing the queen's bishop and preparing for an eventual ...c5.
I think ...Nc6 or even ...Bg4 would be fine here, but I was wary of an early pawn push against my undeveloped queenside. I'll also need to expand eventually, so I put the Knight where it can see c5.
At the time, I was concerned about 7...c5 8.d5 e6 9.e4 and my resulting backwards pawn at d6, but I don't think it looks so bad now. 7...b6 followed by ...Bb7 before playing ...c5 would probably do better; this e6 pawn proves to haunt my position for a long time to come.
I'm not sure of the purpose behind this move. White may be aiming for a Knight on e4 or c4, but either post is easily assailable, and exchanging one of his knights for my expendable one on f6 doesn't seem productive.
The computer labels this an inaccuracy, and gives the continuation 9...Nd5 10. Ndb1 dxc5 11. b5 a6 12. Ra2 Nc7 13. bxa6 Nxa6, which certainly looks good for Black, with a significant developmental lead and good prospects against White's cramped position. The computer recommends 9.Be2 instead...
But I don't see the discovered pin on the Knight, and simply recapture.
The computer is still obsessed with ...Nd5, but I'm not feeling that aggressive at this point in the game. I'm trying to clamp down on White's advanced position and get my Bishop into the action, but...
...There goes my Bishop's only good square, and it's going to take some work to get him into play. This move also puts some pressure on my Knight on f6, threatening to open up a powerful discovered attack down the long diagonal.
Blocking the attack down the h1-a8 diagonal and preparing for ...Bb7. I open up my own pin first to keep White's Knight from trying anything tricky.
The computer lists this as an inaccuracy, and I agree. While it doesn't lose material, this Knight push nets me a tempo after ...f5, which I can then use to play ...Bb7. I think the intention was to aim at d6 while defending the Knight on c3, but that piece is in no real danger (12.O-O-O Bxc3 13.Bxc3 Nxc3 14.Qxa8 Nxd1 15.Kxd1 leaves White in fine position).
Picking up a little space and gaining a tempo to play ...Bb7 after the Knight retreats.
?? This is simply an oversight. White doesn't have enough to threaten anything significant, and hangs a piece.
I really wanted to keep my Bishop around and I was afraid of hanging my Rook if I got greedy and started taking more Knights right away. 14...exd5 is definitely better here.
?? This is not the correct Knight to give me. White would get the pawn back anyway, but at least after 15.Nd2 Ne5 (not 15...exd4? 16.Qxd4+ Kh8 17.Qxa8) 16.Ne7+ Qxe7 17.Qxa8 Qc7 18.f4 Bd7 19.Qxf8+ Kxf8 20.fxe5 Qxe5 White has decent, if maybe not enough, compensation.
The material is nice, but now I have to keep an eye on my isolated, undefended e6 pawn.
! Driving the King into the open.
? 17.Kd1 looks ugly at first glance because of 17...Nd6+, but after 18.Qd3 there really isn't as much to worry about and White's King is a little safer than he is on e2.
This Knight finally gets into the fight, unleashing the Black Queen and defending the weak e6 pawn in the process. I've dealt with both of the White Queen's threats for now.
?? My thought process here was that after 18...Bb7 19.Qxb7 Ng4 20.Kd1 Nxf2 and I get the rook, then the bishop, and win easily. What I failed to notice is that the Knight doesn't actually check White's King from g4, so the King has no reason to move and my poor, patient Bishop dies for no good reason. 18...c4 would have been a much better choice.
Steadfastly sticking to my plan, even though I realize at this point that I've given back a large portion of my advantage. I still threaten f2, and White's development is too far behind to defend it efficiently.
It's worth noting that I could still play ...c4 in here pretty much any time, but I want to consolidate my pieces first. White's King can't take my Knight here without exposing himself to a deadly attack from my Queen, Bishop and Rook.
Black brings the Queen back to someplace useful and threatens to take the Knight and get his other pieces off the back rank.
Trying to get out of the way of the light-square Bishop so White can get his last two pieces into play. Getting the King off the e file also threatens Qxe6+ without having to worry about a game-ending pin.
White continues to work to consolidate his position, not taking the bait on e6.
So I continue to do my best to keep the Rook from escaping its corner. The King has to retreat, and the Rook stays out of play for at least another two turns.
I'm comfortable enough with White's awkward position that I can spare the tempo to defend the e-pawn. With this move I transition from my earlier defensive posture into all-out prophylaxis mode; my goal now is to slowly tighten the noose until White is forced to give up something decisive. The computer suggests Nd6 instead, which opens up the position a bit, and is certainly playable.
?! Freeing the Rook and reinforcing the queenside momentarily, but hanging a pawn in the process. I like 25.g3 or 25.f4 here instead, with an eye toward hiking the King over to c1 or b1 and freeing the h-Rook.
The Knight returns to this menacing outpost, forking g2 and c4. My Knight and Bishop are unassailable right now, and White would dearly love to be rid of them.
I think 26.g3 is better here. There's no reason to overadvance the g-pawn; it makes f3 and f4 unnecessarily weak and doesn't accomplish anything that 26.g3 wouldn't. There are a few other options that provide a bit of counterplay for White, but I can't see anything better than g3.
Picking up the free pawn. I considered leaving the Knight on e3 because it's just so strong there, or trying 26...Ng2+ and trying to drive the White King into a nasty discovered check or fork, but this seemed the most straightforward, and doesn't let White's Rook on h1 out.
Threatening the Knight and pinning the Bishop momentarily. White's Knight is now in an ugly spot, but at least the Rook on a2 has a path out.
Tossing in a check before I deal with the Knight, opening up the d-file and forcing the White King to f2 (if 28.Kf1?? Nd2+ 29.Rxd2 Bxd2 and Black wins easily).
Getting out of the pin and away from my Knight and Bishop. Another option is 30.Rc1, which leads one way or another to some favorable exchanges for White.
?! The computer lists this as a mistake, preferring to take with the Knight. I wanted to keep White's Rook and Knight locked away, but now my interlocked R/N/B trio is going to make my life difficult. 32...Nxc4 would maybe have been easier.
Setting up an obnoxious pin on the Bishop, threatening Rxb2 or Rxc3.
Forking the King and Rook.
The pawn is more tempting than the Rook now. White's pieces are locked down pretty effectively and there's blood in the water.
I think Ra1 is a little better at this point, to try to entice some trades and ease Black's pressure off.
The beginning of the end. 38.Kg2 leads to mate in four and 38.Kh4 loses a Rook and Knight for my Bishop after 38...Be1+ 39.Rf2 Bxf2+ 40.Rxf2 Rxc1.
And that's all there is. I hope you enjoyed it, and my thanks to cetst11 for a very good match! (I won't be annotating the other game in this match; I made some bad mistakes and he seized on them immediately, crushing me simply and quickly. A quick game, but not particularly interesting.) Comments and ratings are much appreciated!
Black will advance the bishop to protect the pawn.
?  This move leaves white's a2 pawn vulnerable to the black bishop.  White will be able to trap the bishop behind enemy lines, however.
?  White is throwing away his black bishop?  For a pawn?
Black declines the en passant to protect the a pawn.
:)  Black realizes that RxN leaves him vulnerable to Bd5+, pinning the rook.  Not even an exchange, just a free rook.  Nc8 looks like a retreat.  Although it protects the b pawn, it doesn't really help the knight get in the game.
Whit this move I attack pawn on d6 and clear the way for black bishop to attack pawn on g7.
If I move my Knight here, my bishop is gone, probably the best move here is Re1.
He is still pressuring my Bishop And my Knight on e5.
I take time for my next move here. One of my peace will fall, but wich one? If I try to save my rook, then he must go on b4, but I didn't want him there. So what to do?
But the rook was to tempting.
So I started to clearing the defence around his King.
Here I must play Bc2, and there is no way to prevent mate on h7, unless he loses his Queen. 24. Bc2 Qxc2, 25. Qxc2
Going to e4 square with my Bishop.
this allows white to exchange dark bishops, and leaves black king a little exposed
i played this as i expected black to attempt to get play on the queenside
Black is cramped and is finding it hard to find squares for his pieces
I am not sure what blacks plan was here. I think c4 needed to be played. This also frees c5 for the black knight
This is a common way to arrive at the modern Benoni. Essentially, Black puts off committing to the line until White has played a couple more moves, in order to avoid some nasty "anti-Benoni" lines. This is in contrast to the Old Benoni, which is the immediate 1.d4 c5.
And this is the basic setup; clearly it can be reached through any number of transpositions but the key pawn structure has now been set up. From here, play may continue in a number of ways, but the semi-open center and lack of Black d-pawn can make for a very fluid struggle for dominance. I like this opening already.
This is standard. White supports his d-pawn and strengthens his claim to the center. Furthermore, many lines in this opening seem to revolve around an e4-e5 break by White.
As the Black DSB is blocked in by the d6 pawn, fianchettoing it seems to be called for. This is another place this opening is similar to an Indian defense, but unlike in (e.g.) the King's Indian, the fiachettoed Bishop will not be blocked by a Black pawn on e5.
This is a popular move, still in the main variations. It gives White a stronger center and may become crucial to an e4-e5 push.
The Taimanov Variation. White develops with check, and announces his intentions to really constrict Black's game. The upshot is that Black's best response is 8...Nfd7, cramping his LSB and Queen's Knight. If he tries 8...Nbd7, the game is still playable but Black will have to give up material of some kind after 9.e5.
Driving the Bishop away to give Black a little freedom.
Upon reflection, I like 10.Bd3 better. At the time, I thought it would have few prospects there, gazing at the sturdy Black kingside pawns, but I failed to anticipate how much pressure Black would soon be putting on my e-pawn.
A couple of database games have the line 10...Qh4+ 11.g3 Qe7 instead, which busts up the White kingside a little more. According to my opponent, he did consider that line but decided weakening my kingside wasn't worth the strength that the g3 pawn could lend to my center.
White defends the e-pawn, as Black was threatening to win it with 11...Bxc3 12.bxc3 Qxe4.
White is beginning to contemplate simply pushing on to e5.
Things are really heating up; Black needs to weaken the White center if he's ever going to get his queenside developed. As White, it was about here that I found myself wishing that I had played Bd3 instead of Be2, because then I'd have a move free to play Re1 and hold the center calmly. But, I didn't, so now I was stuck debating between trying to hold e4, or trying to push e5.
I settled for holding e4. 14.Ng5? doesn't accomplish anything after 14...h6 15.Nf3 Nxe4 16.Nxe4 Qxe4, so I went with the Bishop move, expecting Black's response to be the very-sharp 14...c4!? 15.Bxc4 Nxe4. Now if 16.Nxe4?! Qxe4 17.Qxe4 Rxe4 18.Bd3 Rb4 Black looks pretty strong, so instead White needs to play 16.Re1! and the situation gets even more complex. A sample line might continue 16...f5 17.Bd3 Bxc3 18.bxc3 Qc7!? 19.Bxe4 fxe4 20.Rxe4 Rxe4 21.Qxe4 Qxc3 and now White can force a draw if he wants, or else the shootout begins in earnest!
Looking back, I don't like this. I was trying to prepare for either b2-b4 or just the eventualities arising from the Black DSB on the long diagonal, but I think this move is too passive. I think I could have gotten away with 15.e5! (...dxe5 16.Nxe5). I think 15.Bd2 or 15.Re1 were also good options. The GK computer doesn't consider this move an error, but it does quietly drop my perceived advantage by about half a point.
16.gxf3 might actually be better, as counterintuitive as that is. It would lend more support to the center and keep Black out of g4.
Strong. The pressure on e4 has let up a bit, but now there are warning signs to take note of: the Queen has access to my kingside now, and the now-undefended d4 square looks tempting to the newly-freed Black Bishop.
This basically guarantees a draw (if Black wants it). 17.Ne2 would have kept it interesting.
Jumping on the weak square. Man, this Bishop is strong here!
Just like that, a huge pile of Black pieces has appeared next to the White King. The obvious threats are ...Qe1+ and ...Nf2+. The only way to mount a legitimate resistance to the latter is with 19.Nd1, which, while it makes for a *very* interesting position, does not look good for White in the long run. 19.Rf1?? seems to lose outright to ...Qg3 followed by ...Qh2#, so I chose the path I could see clearly. Not very bold of me perhaps, but given the alternatives...
Surrendering the f2 square and essentially forcing Black to draw me: I'm now threatening Be1, which would give me a big advantage. So...
Black can't stay, thanks to the Be1 threat.
The typical response (according to the database) is Bd3, though I prefer Bd2--the second most common response.  Bd3 is probably better as black usually wins with Bd2.
This was fourth on the database list--with black usually coming out ahead, apparently.
I like this move--it was the first response I considered to black's defense of the knight.  But it does put the pawn in the way of QxN.
23... Be4+, 24. Qg2 Qxg2#.<n><n>I guess most of my advice ended up being for white.  Not my original intention.  But if you do this, what is your opponent's best response?  It is wise to look at least one move ahead.<n><n>Bc5 shows some promise.  Black retains the knight, but white could follow with Qd4.  White is down two pawns so trading is best avoided.  Maybe instead of Qd4, Pa4.  Trading pawns lets white attack black's c6 with rook and bishop.  Black saves the knight, but the game lasts longer.
The theme here is development.  So far we have played 6 games and 50% of them have been decided by developmental problems.  This game is no exception.  I manage to get some very active piece play and once White steps out of theory, I am able to simplify the position to one in which Black has a winning engame.
My friend chooses this move order to avoid my well studied Bogo-Catalan lines with an early ...Bb4 .
This is by far the most interesting move, as White wants to interfere with Black's plan of queenside expansion, and with it, his queenside development.  White does have to be careful, as it is a weakening move and he hopes that his center control will offset the weakenss of b4 and b3.  As often is the theme in the Catalan, Black's chances will most likely be tied to the activation of his queen's bishop.
The best method of developing the light-squared bishop to oppose its opposite number.
A very natural move which unleashes the power of the fianchetto bishop and prepares to recapture the c4-pawn with the knight.
Other lines are drawish and this move offers Black the best practical chances to play for the full point.
An interesting move which proves to be a little to slow.  11. Nxd7 Na5; 12. Qc2 Nb4; 13. Qc3 Qxd7 gives Black an excellent position, due to the weakness of the b4 and b3-squares.
Here I opt to exchange the centralized knight and effectively nullify White's pawn advantage in the center.  Now simplification would yield a won endgame for Black due to the queenside majority.
Completing development and preparing to play ...Nb4 and exchanging the light-squared bishops.
This allows a simplifying combination which gives Black the winning endgame, due to the weakness of e5, b2 and the nonexistant queenside development.
The rook will find a very nice home on the 7th rank.
Winning material with threat.  If the knight moves the e5-pawn drops.
Not only creating luft, but preparing to kick the bishop with ...g5, when the e5-pawn drops.
Rd8+ yields the black bishop.
4. c4 - white decides to expand on the queenside and black decides to counterthrust with d5 clearing a square for either the black lsb or the knight to get to it.
6. Nh3 - this move gives the white lsb control over the d5 square and the white knight is eyeing up f4 or g5 which will hit out at e6 and it will need black to open up the kingside with g5 (if Nf4) or h6 (if Ng5), rather risky if I want to castle short.
This is what Ion had to say about my knight move to d7.  I wanted to know whether this was the wrong decision here.<n><n>He replied - "Would 10...Bd7 be an improvement over 10...Nbd7? I don't think so, unless you were planning some kind of switch to the K-side (11...Be8-h5, say, which might actually be quite good). But you could equally well have tried, after 13.Nf3 Nf6 14.Ne5 Be6. The WN posting at e5 is an asset, but Black isn't too badly placed, it seems to me."
12. Nd2 - completes development and next move that knight will go to f3 and doubly control e5.  I try to exchange off my king knight for white's queen knight but Ion just won't buy into it.
14. .......... Nf7 - I think due to Ion's earlier note this was the loser.  Although it contests control of e5 it ensures my lsb is blocked in and it hinders the completion of my development.  If I had played Nf3 - although that would have allowed one of Ion's knights to come to e5, that would have allowed e6 and then one of the knights could have then gone to f7 or e7 and perhaps forced an exchange of one or both of the knights.
15. ..... Qd6 - Glenda lends support to the c6 pawn preparing b6 allowing the lsb to come out via b7 or a6 connecting my rooks.
19. Rxa5 - I did manage to complete my development, but white has developed much pressure on my queenside.  The queenside pawns are now busted and white will eventually win my a pawn.
21. ............. Qd7 - this move was necessary because the f pawn is hanging.  However it wastes a vital tempo.  If Glenda had gone straight to c7 then I would have had time to back off my bishop to c8 and swap off one pair of rooks on the b file.  In a pressure situation like this time is of the essence!  If I had perhaps got in an earlier g6 then Glenda could have gone straight to c7 and all may have been well.
25. ........... Kf8 - Henry makes for d7 to support the c6 pawn, but he is stopped in his tracks by ...........
29. .............. Rc8 - after a plethora of exchanges, black is not only a pawn minus but my rook is reduced to utter passivity defending the backward pawn on c6.  The only white pawns on Ion's second rank are the f pawn and the h pawn.  They are defended by the white king so no counter targets here.
30. Ne1 - makes for e5 or b5, either way striking out at the c6 pawn.  Ion chooses to plonk it on e5 after I back my knight off to d8 to defend the stricken c pawn.  Note that with the knight on e5, Henry is prevented from defending c6 which would have released the black rook for action down the open b file.
Ion - I don't know whether 35...Rg8 was best but it did seem to mean that if Black wanted to get play, she would have to give up her c-pawn...
38. ........... Kf6 - while Ion is consolidating I am reduced to shunting Henry from e7 to f6 to avoid further loss of material.
41. f5 - the killer -  for example:-<n>41. f5 Ng5 <n>42. Rxg7  Kd8 <n>43. Rg6  - white could also force an exchange of rooks with Rxc7 which still wins but more slowly but I think this is the best move here (I will be a second pawn down and about to lose a third - the g and f pawns will become passed and the c pawn continues to be a target - this pawn will fall if I try to counter with my rook.  I do not think that my rook will be able to mop up Ion's pawns in time - therefore time to resign!)<n><n>So ends the lesson on how retarded development can be severely punished by the strong player.<n><n>Have a nice day everyone!<n><n>Joanne
In retrospect, I'm not sure this move was a good idea because it trades away my passed pawn.
Now I have a two pawn advantage and a Bishop against a Knight.  I've got to figure out a way for the Bishop to be effective.
This should create another passed pawn, which should be to my advantage.  My opponent will have a passed h pawn, but I should be able to use the Bishop to restrain it.
With two passers, I can really start to tie up the Knight.
The h pawn has been restrained now, allowing me to push the e and f pawns.
The f pawn cannot be stopped.  If Kxe3, f8(Q).  If Nxf2, exf2 with promotion to follow.
Castling to defend knight.
Rook and roll!
Hi everyone!<n><n>So many times have my Expert and Master buddies have said how patient they have been when they have been trying to press home advantages or even deal with slight disadvantages when playing me.  Well, this time it is my turn to be the higher rated opponent here.  I end up playing against the Sicilian Dragon.  I try to break through but meet stubborn resistance and at one stage my opponent (whose optimum rating was 1562) had very much the better of it.  He slipped up very late on in the game and allowed me to win 2 pawns.  I sacrificed those two pawns to exchange into a K & P ending.  Henry had the final say and I got my first rated win in about 3 weeks.
13. ...... Kxg7 - bishop trade.
17. ....... Qxb7 - now a bishop trade.
31. Re2 - to get first grab of the open e file.
32. Rg1 - that dangerous black horsie makes one of my rooks passive.  Now the g4 pawn is weak.
32. ...... h6 - was expecting h5 making my f5 pawn weak and giving black a strong passed g pawn.
34. Re3 - to stop a possible rook incursion on c3.
38. Re3 - without that pesky knight my rook now moves back on to the e file and threatens Re6.
41. Rxh6 - voila, a pawn up, after being under the cosh for a few moves it was nice to plumb in some conditional moves - moves 40 and 41.  My patience is rewarded.  Black now defends with Rc6.
43. Rxg5 - now the g5 pawn drops off.
Not worried about Bxc3, cause that will end up being an advantage to me.  The pin will not last long due to my plan to castle.
Removing the pin
Ok, I don't want to lose my bishop here needlessly.  Move to b3 and if he takes I can either open the a file or undouble my pawns.

I take advantage of the absence of my opponent's central pawn by grabbing as big a share of the centre as I can, as well as opening up an attack line on the c4-pawn with my bishop.
My opponent is fighting for that pawn! In the Queen's Gambit Accepted, it is important for Black to compensate for White's control of the centre by grabbing a big share of the queenside. And if this happens to defend the pawn too...
I can't resist shoving my unimpeded central pawns into my opponent's territory, squeezing him as far back as possible and trying to use this to recapture my pawn.
The pressure builds up on the backward, weak and for the moment pinned pawn on c6. If I can somehow remove this pawn, all of Black's control on the queenside will collapse.
Removing a defender of the c6-pawn, but this pawn shows no sign of falling. My main fear is that my opponent will be able to hold his pawn advantage and get into an endgame still holding it.
I want to deal with those advanced queenside pawns of Black's; I am planning a4 next and Black's whole pawn formation is under fire.
Obviously, my opponent has decided not to take the pawns. So now after, say, 13.axb5 cxb5 14.bxc4 bxc4 Black's pawn on c4 is isolated and consequently weak.
Aha! A blunder. My opponent doesn't notice the discovered attack on his bishop.
My opponent is behind by a bishop, has lost his extra pawn and is cramped by my central pawns and, to cap it all, my forces are massing on the queenside.
My queen comes in to seek more material.
...but black continue to attack.The best way to defense is...
White want to eliminate blacks strong bishop and this was the fastest way
Black didn't retrieve his bishop because he want to continue attack
Now black beginning new attack
Trying to force an exchange of knights, but Black doesn't take my knight.
Taking the pawn and pinning the rook.
Exchange of knights. This exchange also gave me an extra bishop.
I think that Black was trying to get the rook out into the action.
Black is trying to block my rook's path to the king.
Checking the king with my pawn supported by my bishop.
Perhaps a better move for Black would have been Kb6, which would have helped him to avoid mate. If Black had done Kb6 here instead, I would have done Qxc6+, which would have basically forced Black to take my queen with his own, and then I would have taken the queen with my pawn. Black would probably have then either taken my pawn with the king, in which case I would have captured the bishop with my rook, or moved the bishop out of harm's way, in which case I would have moved my rook to a6 to check the king again,. Even so, I have played through that outcome and although I am still able to checkmate, it takes an additional few moves, and since I'm not sure how Black would have responded to some of them, the game might not have ended so quickly.
Perhaps it would have been better for black to move to a4 instead, as that helps him to avoid checkmate. My next move, checking the king with my f-column rook, is kind of essential to block the king's escape square on b4, and if the king hadn't already been on b4, it wouldn't have been a check and Black would have been able to force an exchange of queens in order to escape mate.
Perhaps a better move for Black here would have been Ka4. That way, I wouldn't have been able to move my queen to a5 and mate, because he could have taken the queen and it wouldn't have had support from my rook, due to the bishop blocking it.
White has opened with the English; Black plays a modern Indian-style response. White will now seek to occupy the center with pawns, while Black develops around them and prepares for a central pawn break.
With the center happily occupied, White continues natural development and prepares for castling. Meanwhile, Black is ready to make a play for the center himself with ...e5.
White castles to the dangerous side, putting his king in the sights of the Black Bg7. For now, though, there's no real danger, and the benefits of the White Rook on the d-file could be significant.
The GK engine prefers Black to focus on the e-file with 12...Nxf3 13.Bxf3 Qe6, but I think this is okay. Black pressures c4 instead, and considers a direct queenside assault to take advantage of the White King's position.
The GK engine considers this a mistake, but I don't really see it. Apparently 13...Nxf3 14.Bxf6 Bxf6 15.Nd5 Bd8 16.Bxf3 is strong for Black, but I was expecting 13...Nxc4 14.Nd4 Qc5 15.Bf4 with an attempt to trap the BQ somewhere on the horizon (as it happens, the GameKnot engine assumes this line as well, but considers it slightly advantageous for Black).
Pushing the Bishop back, but it was headed back anyway, with no prospects on f4. Probably Black should have preferring finishing his development with ...Bd7 and an eventual ...Rae8.
The BQ's avenues of escape are actually very limited, despite not being in direct danger yet--thanks to White's active Knights and well-placed Bishops. The Queen can get out, though, with 17...Nc4! freeing e5 for the Queen.
? Black's first mistake, though I can't blame him at all. The lines are really difficult to see here; I won't try to write them all out but Black's Queen is, in fact, trapped now. Correct was 17...Nc4, as I mentioned above. All the next moves are terrifically complex, each move wholly different from the last. I strongly suggest you look carefully at each of the next several positions, focusing on White's threats to trap the Black Queen--there are rather a lot of false trails and traps; the positions are really interesting.
? As I mentioned, 18...Qc5 was the only way to stay in it. Now the Queen falls again!
? But White misses the correct move again! Amidst the sea of possibilities there was 19.Na4! which wins the Queen outright. Now, Black has a chance to escape.
?? The final mistake. Refusing to put his Queen in quarantine on b8, Black misses the trap and this time, White follows through correctly.
No point in losing the Knight (though GK prefers 22.Nxg7, and I tend to agree since now White will have a concrete material advantage and reducing towards the endgame will favor him.
1-0. With nowhere else for his Queen to run, Black resigns in the face of overwhelming material loss (23...Qd8 24.Rxd8 Rxd8 25.Qxc5 is easily enough to prove decisive). Many thanks to hinschi for a fantastic game! I hope some of you enjoyed reading it; especially the last six moves or so. Comments are appreciated; thanks for reading!
I hesitated long before playing this move because it makes short castle almost impossible and the black d pawn makes long castle risky as well but I thought that the double pawn on e would give white a strong center and that I would anyway been on attack which suits me better but if strong counterattack the defense will be doubtless.
?! I'm not sure it's a good move.<n>+ it opens the diagonal for the DSB and the file for the queen<n>- it permits the white knight to leave his castle and go on adventure and white's to get rid of the annoying pawn.
The black queen 's in campaign
The squire comes to help his knight. Carrying on setting pressure on the right wing and menacing h5 to attack the bishop in g6.
The bishop calls for a guard.
Danngerous spot for the queen (dangerous for both sides). If black manages to remove the two white knights, his queen could come on e4. On the other hand,  the queen could be under attack of a rook, the b pawn or a knight.
"Anyway, at this stage, there is little point to defend for white. The best chance resides in attack", the queen says leaving her husband alone with his bishop counseller.
?! I'm not sure about that move. The castle is under siege and no more a safe place. On the other hand, the center is not safer.
It's a dangerous move for white because of black's d rook menacing the queen but I thought that she could move on the opened diagonal.<n>As for the rest. I evaluated (may be wrongly that black couldn't give the mate with rook and queen).<n>Furthermore a queen needs at least one servant.
The black knight leaves his king to enter in the battle.
Retreat but still menacing the black king and protecting the bishop on e3.
Material equality, Little defense on both sides. Both pawn structures are almost totally destroyed, black controls the open d file, both kings are unprotected and under menace (the two black knights are dangerous for white and his king has found his lady back and stays on the open file). White's pieces are more mobile and White has the initiative.
To regain the control of the d file and, eventually, menace the black queen by playing Rd4 and to free both rooks in case of a counterattack which could oblige the king to retreat on line one.
"I come to you, my queen and am ready to lay down my life", the black knight says.<n>Pressure is less on the white e pawns but it allows the black h rook to give check on f file, dangerous for white.
Adieu Madame.<n>(I supposed black cannot attack dangerously, even with the h rook, for the white king, who now wanders alone in the wide world could come to g3 behind his guards but I'm not so sure about it)
I studied the board carefully to see if white could attack dangerously the naked white king ("My kingdom for a horse") and I had the impression that it was impossible to give the mate, or even perpetual check if the white king went on e1. But It often happens to me to oversee moves so I didn't feel relax.
Normal developement here, and now I "lose a tempo" with this move instead to go on with the inmediate c5. But it's on purpose. I just don't like to go - again and again - into Bb5+ etc. It can be very boring.
Here black has to think on Ne7, but it comes that the N on f5 is easily kicked out with g4, starting a pawn storm on the kingside. I don't really like a N on f5. And if White doesn't take, I'm self-closing me in. Why not BxB? This just gives white "all" and to me "nothing". Bg4 is anoher idea, but after h3, we'll reach a position similar to the game's.
Opening the way for the Q to a4+, and I can't play b5 because of Bxb5+...
The pressure on d4 kind of ensures white'll play BxBg6 at some point. At the same time, the Q is preventing white to play the dsb. But I overlooked...
...pressing on e5 and on the c column for the future.
? Black's game is in keeping the tension "on" in order to control the game with a constant threat on the center, pressure on the c column and intelligent use of Nb4... and I am throwing it all out with this move! In addition, I have no support against a future b3 because of my previous tempo loss allowing a5. And now I would struggle to develop. A very bad move for sure!
I am allowing Bh4 for a tempo.
...a new defender for g6 and and Sopen column for my R. But my pieces are stuck and undeveloped. I'm lost... except that white has to manouver wisely in order to develop himself...
! Attacking f5, my weak point. Because of e6, of course.
Exchange quickly it's my only chance, if ever.
Here, RxR will do... or not? RxR, QxR, and black will have a roadway to h1+ and so on.
Important move in order to play the previous one.
White can perfectly give up the N for a free R, and after a4 - b4 black is lost. But it's very hard to give up a piece for free, and besides, Rxb2+ would be deadly afterwards...
My K can go to the center. It won't be able to prevent white's R entry, if white finds it, but in the meanwhile I have to go for my faint chances.
But my opponent wasted the occasion, and falls for ANOTHER DEAD LOCK. Now he will never be able again to move any piece but the N. Can you believe it? Beginners, be aware of such "dead lock"...
The idea is to block the dark squares, keep the N off c2, and then capture the e pawn. Nxe4 immediately is met by Qd4+.
?? A serious blunder. As is typical in this motif, a seemingly normal move can turn bad quickly. Be2! was necessary to protect d3 and maintain the idea of capturing on e4 with the potential of a pin.
At this point, White should resign. Capturing the bishop loses an essential rook to check, and interposing the rook is futile. Otherwise, only one king move is possible.
The only move to try and retain some material. White then resigns.
Firework start. Hard to see sacrifice, but if black goes Qe7, 11. Nc7+, Kf7, 12. NxR. True is that black would have an attacking position after Ne5 (trapping the white knight), but probably the master's analysis went much further than mine.
Leontxo says Qb6 could be "the correct one", but not why. The attack on b2 doesn't seem very promising. But white should lose a tempo in order to save the e6 knight, and it is  beyond my ability to say what would happen.
The good point of Qb6 is that doesn't give white a tempo to castle.
A questionable move, as it leaves the f column to white. True it allows black to play Nc5, freeing his lsb, but the black king it too exposed!
...but it leaves white the canche to add pressure to the black king.
Sad position for a king. Black cannot play the knight to the 5º rank because it blocks the profilacting action of the black queen on this row, facilitating white's plans to trap black's king.
Leontxo says Capablanca could have won with 16. Qf7, never mind if black plays Qxe3+, 17. Kh1, after which indicates g6 as the correct defence for black (white threats g4 - g5# and if Nxg4, Rh5#). 18. Ne6 (threatening mate), Rg8, 19. Nd5, Qxe4, 20. RxNf6, to which black answers with Nf8 - losing. It seems a weird move, but... <n><n>Black cannot take NxRf6 because of 21. NxNf6, threatening the queen and mate in h8, AND the rook... <n>...and if black plays QxNd5, white goes 21. QxRg8, NxRf6, 22. Qg7+, Kh5 (forced) and 23. Nf4+, winning the queen!<n>... Ne5, and with 21. Qxg8 white wins, even if black goes: Bxe6, 22. Qxe6 (not QxRa8, BxN, with a strong attack).
...threatening at once g5#, since black cannot take the pawn (Nxg4, Rh5#).
...the best defence? After Qxe3+ white is in troubles! Black threats perpetual, and to avoid it white must either lose the knight or the pawn (helped by Nxe5 if white wants to shield his king with Nc-e2), and the pressure over the black's king, losing. <n>Am I right?
It seems to me that 17. h4 whorths a look. Must black take gxh4, or he can go QxQ?<n>If gxh4, 18. g5+, Kg8, 19. (say) gxNf6+, Nxf6, 20. Rg5+, K(say) f8, 21. Nf-d5 (e3 must be protected, and with this knight white prevents Nxe4), NxN, 22. NxN (with the queen, it allows Qxe3+, but it is unclear if that would save black), QxQ, and white is just a pawn up, but with a winning position, despite the doubled pawns. I think.... White doesn't have a mate (as far as I can see) 23. Rf1+, Ke8, 24. Re5+, K goes to the queenside and there is no mate in sight. <n><n>Many other lines are possible after 17. ..., QxQ, since hxg5+ is not mate anymore, so Kg7, and white must play carefully to avoid lines such as 19. gxNf6, Nxf6, threatening the rook and recovering material equality even if white central free pawns must win in the long term.
Nxb6 is of course impossible because of RxNf6+. White's attack seems to have lost steam, since the knight must retire. Now, main white's advantage are the central free pawns, but he cannot save the g pawn.<n>So Capablanca tries to complicate threats.
Leontxo says black can win after gxNf4, 19. g5+, Kg7, 20. gxf6+, Nxf6, 21. Rg5+, Kf7 (or Kh6), 22. exf4, defending the rook, realigning the free pawns, with a winning position, even with a pawn less. <n>Kasparov said 18. ..., Ra5 is even better.
Not clear why to me. The idea is, probably, being able to play Rg6 after 19. Rd6, gxNf4, but probably white would go for something like Nf-d5... or maybe, black dreams with an attack over the white king (But Nxg4 was necessary, first...)
Black thinks he reached a sort of shield so proceed to take away one of the strongest threats over his king. Now, it has two squares to go.<n>Leontxo says NxN was better, but it is unclear to me how black position would hold after exd5, reassetting the central pawns. Nxd5 or Rxd5 seem good too!
This is mainly to free the 6th row to white's rook, preventing Rg6 defence to black.
if 21. ..., Nf6, 22. RxNf6+, NxR, 23. RxNf6+, Kh5, I cannot see a clear victory for white, since 24. Nf5, BxN frees black. <n>White has nice threats with 24. Ne2, RxNe7, 25. Ng3+, and if Kh4, 26. Rh6+, Kg4, 27. Kg2! and black cannot stop the mate (h3#). <n>But, if black goes 25. ..., Kg4, 26. Kg2. Now, if black goes h5, white can go 27. Rh5, and black cannot escape from mate (Rxh5 / h3, in either order). <n>So, it seems to be the hidden threat that prevents black to stop the check with the knight.
Black must stop the mate in h3. Now, the previous sequence starting with RxN doesn't give check to black, so leaves him a tempo to defend.
Probably, Capablanca was looking for a repetition in order to reach the time control, later... but his opponent went to another move.
Black can give the quality in order to release the pressure (g4, 27. Nxg6, axg6 and black seems to hold, even if in a losing position: white can try 28. Ne2, Nxe5, 29. Nf4+, that eventually leads white to win the pawns with a better position).<n>Leontxo says that if Nc5, instead, black could have drawn the game.
Leontxo says that now, if hxg6, white goes 28. e5, since Nxe5 is not possible due to RxNf6. The same doesn't hold for the previous comment, in which I said that hxg was best.
attempting to force the bishop away....
but White would like the bishop to stay. The defending knight, however, isn't going to be as safe as it would like to be....
the start of a pawn chain, and a chance to get up a piece. Will White see it?
nope - White instead advances his other knight. Better would have been to retreat the bishop to stop Black's next move...
! the threat here is 8...Bxa3 9.bxa3 Qxb5, with the added bonus of doubled pawns on the a file. White sees this and tries to stop the threat....
now White chooses to shut off the queenside. I'm not worried - all my pieces are on the kingside.
Well, since my pieces aren't (yet) able to get onto good squares, I go for a kingside pawn storm
I guess this must have been more of a waiting move than anything - looking at the board here, I can see no opportunities for White to launch an attack. (It gets White one step closer to connected rooks, but I prefer Bb2)
hoping to break up my pawn attack...
and I naturally defend, with the threat of a discovered attack on the queen
now a trade is forced, though it was probably no great loss for White - his dark-square bishop has been completely useless the whole game
and here's where White finally breaks out of his passive state and into some form of attack. Actually, Black was still winning here, and would have been far better off playing fxg3 here, forcing off more material from the board (and regaining the lost pawn, if White is careless; 25...fxg3 26.Rxf8? gxh2 27.Kxh2 Rxf8)
I follow through with the exchanging, as I intended to do, but maybe I should have kept the second rook to take care of the passed pawn
I retreat my knight to safety..
good move. The king doesn't give me a chance to defend the c-pawn...
I would have loved to have traded rooks here to relieve the pressure, but that would have quickly lost to 34.a7!
I don't want to have to deal with another passed pawn (plus' I can't recapture because of Kxf5...but maybe that would have peen a good thing. The king would not be able to stop my pawn's run towards promotion, forcing the rook to retreat and easing up the pressure for Black)
here comes the pain...White goes on the attack, and is planning to overwhelm me with his pawns
This was one last desperate attempt at some form of counterplay (it may have been more useful back at move 38) If White responds with exd6, I can play e5+, with some chance of getting one of my pawns promoted. However, if White was to respond with...
and now my two passed pawns - my last hope - will fall, and it's here where I resign. Good game :)
Pe4 is covered by Nc3 and won't bury the black bishop.
QxR, QxR, RxQ, and black picks up d & b pawns at leisure.
This is your gamble.  If W takes the defensive track and returns to N-c3, you build an advantage.  However, I chose the move aggressive N-d6+ giving me the tempo.
cant think why I played this as it blocks path of Bishop if Kings Indian defence is played. Planning an attack on f3 pawn at this stage was a mistake.
planning to try to trap Queen by blocking light squared Bishop then playing Ra8. But should have played b6 rather than b5 as will become apparent later.
b7 still a safe square for white's Queen so a bit more manouvering required. Had I played 11.b6 I could have now played 13.Bc6 to leave Queen in big trouble after 14.Ra8
trying to bring other Rook into play.
Thought I play this as last roll of the dice hoping for big mistake by white. If he takes d6 Bishop with e pawn I win, but if he takes with Queen I loose.<n>Since I am about to loose anyway decided to take the gamble. In hindsigth I'd have been better battling on and trying to win a few pawns back.
Black, of course, will want to rain pawns down on white's castle too. White missed a bit of an opportunity here to win a pawn or ruin black's kingside castle.
The black bishop and queen are defending the pawn at d6. If black recaptures on f6 with his bishop, the pawn will fall. If not, black's kingside castle is in ruins.
If a rook on the 7th is heaven, is a rook on the 6th limbo?
Black castled. Well he should since he sacrificed his d-pawn to maintain an intact kingside castle.
Black initiates a trade. It's not favorable to the player who is behind in material, so white is glad to oblige (not that black gave white any choice in it).
Now I'm fumbling for what to do. The kingside is a wash, but here on the queenside white has a 3-to-2 pawn majority. Time to find a way to push that through to a promotion, though I'm not entirely sure how to do it.
Keeping the king centralized so black cannot use his king to gain an advantage kingside.
31. ... fxe5? was a miscalculation by black. It only cost him one more pawn, but going from down 7-to-6 to being down 6-to-4 is a big step toward a lost endgame.
Now white has a pawn majority on both sides of the board.
Playing 34. axb4 or 34. cxb4 seems to win another pawn for white, but after black plays 34. ... axb4 and white recaptures on b4, white has doubled pawns on the b-file and black responds with 35. Rc2, forking the pawns on b2 and g2 and regaining the lost pawn immediately. Worse, black then has his own slice of heaven with a rook on his 7th rank.
This is where I realize white is in trouble. I want to advance the a-pawn and promote him, but my rook is in the way. How I wish that rook were on a2 right now. White cannot force a promotion on the kingside with the pawn majority because black's king is over there. In fact, if I'm not careful, that king could destroy white's pawns if allowed to - fortunately white's rook dominates the 5th rank, shutting out the black king. White's king cannot run to the support of the kingside, because if he makes one move away from b2, he let's black play Rb2 followed by Rxg2 and Rxh2 and then he'll have no kingside to support. In fact, I worried that black might be able to play for a 3-move-repeat draw by bouncing back and forth between b3 and e3. Up by two pawns, and I'm faced with a draw?
The rook defends g2, and is defended by a pawn so black cannot dislodge the rook with anything other than his own rook, such as from g6, which would be suicide - his king is too far away to stop the white a-pawn from promoting.
Black attacks the pawn, but he's well enough defended. Of course, now the pawn can't take those last three steps that are looking even farther away, now. Black might want to break up the white kingside by playing his pawn to h3, so white prevents it.
Now it's time to get the white king involved in driving black out of heaven.
The key move. I have to give 45. Rg4! an exclamation. Black cannot get back behind the white pawn now, no matter what he tries.
By moving to the third rank, white prevents black from simply playing 47. ... Rf3+ and then playing for perpetual checks or 3-move-repeats. Further, it's possible that later in the game, there may become a power struggle over the a8 square and white will need his king to help.
Now white has sacrificed two pawns, but at least the little guy on a2 knows he can finally put on the royal gown and reign as queen, even if only for a moment. Black should not have captured with 47. ... Rxg2?. Instead, 47. ... Re2, 48. ... Re8, and 49. ... Ra8 to block the white pawn and initiate that power struggle over a8 that I previously mentioned. Capturing with 47. ... Rxg2? loses the tempo he needs to reach a8 before the pawn promotes.
49. ... Rxh3?? seals black's doom. It's doubtful that black could survive a King+rook+pawn vs. King+2 pawns endgame, but it's far more doubtful that he can survive once white's queen promotes without immediate recapture. Moving his rook immediately to e8 was his only chance at a draw. It's interesting to note that six moves ago white had a two pawn material advantage, and now black has a one pawn advantage. Three white pawns gave their lives so their king could find a new queen.
52. Kd3 once again prevents black from putting the white king in check. All black can do is play some kind of waiting move, and if he moves his rook off of the 4th rank he will lose his pawn to 53. Rxh4. Nothing for it but to trade rooks.
Time for a king+queen checkmate, even though the white king must realize this guy in the gown is not the queen he began the game with... This is the point that black resigned. A fun endgame, one for the books (well, my books anyway), and my third longest game on GameKnot (would have been my longest game if we played out the eight or ten moves to a checkmate). I doff my hat, white_knight_03, you gave me two good games (our first was a draw).
This rather wastes a move. If Black wanted to play this, she could have played d7-d5 in one move rather than two. Still it threatens d5-d4, so White has to do something about this threat.
Another sensible move, moving the rook to the open file.
Black correctly takes back with the knight. Taking back with the pawn was possible and gives a slight edge to Black, in terms of more space controlled. This is better though, it makes it a lot easier to attack the weak White pawn on d3, along the semi-open d file.
This is a mistake, allowing Black to get two bishops in an open position. Nxd4 Qxd4 15. Bc3 Qh4 16. Nd2 Nd5 17. Be5 Nf4 18. g3 Nh3+ 19. Kf1 Qg5 20. f4 Qg6 21. Nc4 Bf5 22. Rc1 was better.
Black mobilises her rook. Now that the Bishop on e7 is protected by the rook, Black is threatening the pawn on d3 with the queen. Qxd3 immediately loses to Rxe7!
This looks good too, putting the bishop on a fine diagonal.
Black connects her rooks and is now threatening to take on f3 followed by Qxh2. Black has a great advantage.
Black also has to protect Bc7
With a double attack on the Rc5 and also threatening Re1 forking king and queen.
White hits the queen, but only to drive it to a better square
Now Black blunders, and gives up the advantage she has carefully secured. Qg6+ 33. Kh1 Qe6 34. Rc4 Qh3 35. Qd1 b5 36. Re4 Ra8 37. Re5 Qh4 38. Qd7 Rf8 39. Kg2 b4 40. Qc6 Qd4 41. Re7 is given as better by PMCA
The rook seeks sanctuary.
Now the second pawn goes, White has re-established material equality, and Black's advantage is minimal and based on the split pawns on the kingside. White should be able to draw this.
White advances a pawn. As White I would be tempted to just sit on the position, play something like Q-c4-g4 maybe h2-h3 and just wait for Black to come at me. I think the White queen belongs on the kingside, protecting the king and pawns there.
Black wants to attack with the king supporting the queen.
Now Black starts to win pawns again.
Queen goes back, ready to strike down the d file, or return to the kingside, as required
Black protects.
Black takes and White finally gives up. Many thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it. Don't forget to rate it on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am getting on. Until next time dear reader!
The major blunder that put me on the back foot and lost both bishops with no gain!
Was in real need of some breathing space!
Threatening mate and also protecting the knight.
Making the sac to get rid of his knight and disrupting his pawn push.
I know I needed to take his pawns on the left side of the board otherwise I would have regretted it.
Under a mate threat with both rooks on my second rank.
Now, 13.fxe3 seems to be strong. <n><n>1) Doubled pawns could be only a problem when someone attack them (only in that situation are weak). <n><n>2) All the pawn's structure could be "compensated" with the enough activity of pieces. Doubled pawns, by definition, open columns, so rooks are a clear happy pieces then!<n><n>3) F column will be the only open column on the board. So, black's rooks are not so actives, and pression on f7 pawn (Bc4 + Rf2-Rf1 -doubling-) is hard. <n><n>4) Otherwise, white's queen will have a nice mission, on g3 or h4 squares, putting even more pressure on Nf6.<n><n>So, idea interesting --> fxe3, see where black castle and preparing a kingside or queenside attack, Qg3 (h4), Rf2 and Raf1.
Ok, what make now?<n><n>* Key in chess - the soul - are pawns! So, finding rupture points - crashes - with pawns, open diagonals and columns, improving activity of pieces.<n><n>Nc3 and Bc4 are active and centralised. But rooks are not so happy... :(<n><n>So, f2-f4 advance will open f column and, after this, Rf2, Raf1 and so on, will touch all the kingside. Black will be in danger, and probably will close Bc4 with a future d6-d5 (Be6, etc.) will be the best option. But then Rxf6, Qxh6, Rf3-g3 appears... uff! :-)
Ok, thinking about this move, I wonder myself if take on d5 and after on e5 is possible... because after<n>16.exd5 Nxd5 17.Qxe5, black's Nd5 is touched.
Maybe now 17.f4, trying to done play to Rf1, could achieve an interesting activity.
Now 21.e5 takes attention, so we must to make a "tree" of possibilities... <n><n>This type of pawns in the fifth row, "cut" in two sides the board, and it's difficult to transfer the pieces if one attack is generated... I'm seeing it (Jorge) a lot of times in tournament games, so:<n><n>21.e5 axb2 and now we must calculate <n>a) 22.exf6 bxa1=Q 23.Rxa1 Black's castle pawns don't be touched - by Qd3! reply - but unfortunately something like 23... Rfe8 24.fxg7 Kxg7 25.Qd3 - trying Qh7+ is confronted by 25... f5!<n>b) 22.Rab1 is a simple solution, with an attack if, for example, game goes 22...c5 23.exf6 cxd4 24.cxd4 <n><n>So,
A critical moment! To see all our possible moves is essential at these situations!<n><n>So, we have:<n><n>To save the knight:<n>1) 22.Nxe6 and after Qxe6 23.e5 is possible<n>2) 22.Nf5, as in the game<n>3) 22.Ne2, with some "peace" in the board<n><n>Create other menaces:<n>4) 22.exd5 and if 22...cxd4 23.dxe6, and both queens have pawns to say them hello :)<n>5) 22.e5 don't lose anything, because 22.. cxd4 23.Qd3! and Nf6 must remain in his square,  or Qh7 will be a terrific checkmate...<n><n>All 1), 3), 4) or 5) seems to be correct, but it not easy to calculate them...
Black could now take on f5, I think:<n>22...Bxf5 23.exf5, and black pawns are fine after Rac8 or c5-c4, trying Rfe8.
Really a good move, too! If 23.cxd4 Bxf5 24.exf5 cxd4 25.Qd2 Rac8, and d4 pawn offers a good support for black's knight on c3 and e3, after a future Nd5.<n><n>Maybe 23.Nxh6+ gxh6 24.Qxh6 could give any chances...
here 6.... c5 is an alternative<n>yes its strange , black is forcing white to advance his center pawns !!!!<n>which is usually what white wants to do .<n>The idea is simple : destroy the pawns !!!????<n>for example <n>           7.d5      e6<n>          8. Nc3    ed<n>          9. cd      c4<n>and there are many games and variations from this point played by top GMs<n>back to the game 6....  Nc6 is the normal move
9.Be3 is the most played move ( of course developing the bishop and defending the  d4 pawn), and should be the best.<n>nothing is wrong with 9.a3 ( preventing knight or bishop to go to b4 square, also in mind  b4  in future .
9. ...    Qd7  was played before and gave black a nice position to play even though black lost.<n>the move in the game is in my notebook where i believe is the best here keeping the presure on the d4 pawn and open all posbilities .
defending the d4 pawn .<n>so what to choose ? <n>10....  Be7<n>10....  Qd7<n>10....  Bf3<n>I analysed the three moves  and think that 10. Bf3 give my openent some  weakneses in the king side which i prefer .
11.Qf3   then 11....   Nd4  12.Qe4  Nc6  white had some compinsation for the pawn but is it enough ... its not clear for me till now..even the e5 pawn might fall .<n>back to the game <n>Its very hard to decide what to do here ?,  and what move  is better ? .<n>many good moves<n>according to my notes its  11....Qh4 ( the move in the game )<n>but 11.... Be7 is good too , also the old   11....  Qd7  is playable here .<n>so i  continue according to my note
As you can see too many choices i had,  and its not easy to decide where the queen should go.  But i have to make a move any way<n>Even white's position is ok but he should work hard to find the best move .<n>I was tring hard to find what should white do here , i think white should try to exchange queens in some way as black queen is annoying white .<n>i had now some analysis for this position , i will not write it cuz its too many but its strange :<n>My queen is out early and looks  alone but its very strong
so kevin played  13. Nb5 ?<n>i think he is waisting his time with this move , and clearly he got    NO PLAN .<n>He should try some thing else <n>13.Qc1<n>i even think   13.Ne2 is not bad as 13.Nb5<n><n>13.Ne2  Qf3   14.Ng3   and Bg2  or 14.Rg1  0-0-0   15.Bg2 with good compensation for the pawn .<n>With the move in the game , there is no threat nor devolopment  and not even defending the pawn .<n><n>u can notice the weekneses white should keep an eye on them, (  c4 , d4 , f3 , and the king )
This is a very critical moment in the game also the same old question  : where to go with the queen ?<n><n>if  14....  Qg5  then  15.f4 !   and no more threats from my qeen and even the queen will be in bad squares.<n><n>if 14... Qh6  15.Qc1  Qc1   16.Rc1  Nd4   17.Nd4  Rd4  just better ending ( pawn more ) but two beshops with my openent .<n><n>so i prefer to annoy my openent more with my lonely qeen
Hi everyone.  Here is another recent game where I exploit my opponent's failure to castle.  Another key factor is my ability to develop my pieces with threats, thus not allowing him to consolidate.  I continually add pressure to the King's position, even though there is a clear way to net material.  I hope you enjoy.
Capturing towards the center has many advantages.  In this case,  it allows me to play ...d5 right away, as well as opening up a file for the rook on a8 and a diagonal for the B on c8
Grabbing my share of the center
Placing the Rook on an open file with a threat.
but instead, he chooses to drive away the pesky rook
once again, developing with a big threat.  From here, it is all downhill for white.If 12.0-0, 12...Bxf2  13. Kh1 Bg3.  If 12.g3, 12...Bxf7  13.Kf8 Qh3#.  Not looking good for white.
12...Nxe5!!  There are no good squares for the Q to go to defend f2.  Qg3 is met by Bxf2 , and a loss of the Q.  Qf4 is bet by...
adding another piece to the mating game
castling to bring the final piece into the attack
This game was very fun to play, and I hope it was entertaining to watch.  It should serve as an example to new players to protect your K at all costs.
Hmmm, is he gonna exchange off pieces this early? i sometimes get uncomfortable with trading off this early i wonder if the opponent just likes to take rather than think..generally speaking.
Or get back up, of course theres no way back for that bishop now, he's committed to the cause..
I quite fancy that bishop now pawn aswel! thats if i get a chance..
can't remember why i did this but it looks good, right? I think i saw this in a book and decided to give it a go....
Trying to exchange off a few bits just to clear the congestion..Too late me thinks..
I like bishops, yum yum...plus i felt i needed to relieve some of the pressure i was feeling..
had to protect that little beauty...And i had to clear the way for a quick castle should the need arise..
Time to castle.....
To stop Nf4 and the threat to my bishop...and to stop him eyeing d3 aswel...
Erk!...too late to cause an irritation on the queen side now..
I had so many options here but i chose to keep the pawn advance going simply to keep pressure on his king....on reflection this was the wrong move maybe Qa4 would have been better...
this was innevitable what to do now, by this time i got tag in my ear boasting and pontificating...
I'm in a corner and wondering where it went wrong....
The Sokolsky, an opening I employ occasionally with rather good results; nobody seems to know how to play against it, and the mix of positional play and tactical tension suits me fine. It's also basically asymmetrical in nature, leading to dynamic, fluid positions with little chance of ending ending in a draw.
The most common continuation, usually leading to sharp positions where White may have to play carefully. Longer-term he may find a positional bonus in the exchange, as he now has a surplus of center pawns, but his kingside is often a bit soft for a long while.
White is in no hurry to exhange in the center; if Black captures on c4 White will recapture and develop his bishop in one move. Also, White is now in a real hurry to get his king safely tucked away before Black can start operations for real.
A small, but very important move. White's bishop on e5 is on the verge of being forced off e5, and when that happens Black would like nothing better than to post his bishop on d6. With his dsb on d6, Black will be in position to exert potentially fatal levels of pressure against White's underdeveloped kingside. But by forcing the bishop to move now, White prevents this. Black will either have to move his bishop off-line to a5, or waste a tempo in tucking it away on f8; if it moves to d6 immediately, White will simply exchange it.
White cannot put off moving his bishop any longer. White considered capturing on d5 first, but rejected that line because the black knight on d5 (after recapture) would make development of his knight on b1 more difficult.
Retreating to b2 is preferable here, as the bishop preserves his influence on the long diagonal. On 10.Bg3 Black may consider exchanging his knight on f6 for it (after Nf6-h5xg3), which would immobilize White's kingside and weaken his center pawns.
The automatic move in this position would be Be2, moving the lsb out of danger and protecting the knight on f3. But... this would cost White the bishop pair and exchange a rather powerful, freeranging piece for a bishop of mediocre influence. Are there any alternatives? Turns out there is one...
!! White simply ignores the pin on the knight, sacrificing his queen for ... what, exactly? Turns out there are fascinating combinations against Black's king, queen, and rook based on the weakness of f7 and the relative placement of the pieces.
This may look a little insane, but consider for a moment: where is the Black queen to go? There are only two squares where it won't be immediately lost once White moves his knight off f7 (with a discovered check): e7 and b8. Of these, b8 may actually be the best choice, but it's a real dreadful place for the queen to be.
And White is at plus 1, with two passed, protected center pawns, a well-protected king vs. Black's out-in-the-open majesty, and the bishop pair.
Aiming for play against White's kingside, while keeping an eye on the center. Both f2 and h2 are weak and Black aims to follow up by moving his knight back to g4, threatening them both at the same time. But now White is sufficiently developed to take advantage of his piece superiority and Black's exposed king.
Winning a tempo, which gives White the option of doing a lightning-transfer of the knight to h3, from where it will shield all of his weaknesses.
The d-pawn is slated for advance, and White wants the bishop out in front of the pawn chain and on the kingside first, from where it will be able to operate more freely.
Potentially a grave mistake. White cannot take advantage of it now - his knight on h3 would hang - but maybe later... and if not, then Black will for sure have to spend extra time moving the knight out of danger again.
Anchors the bishop on e5 and prepares to race off to the finishing line...
Ah! It happened! Black has now lost the knight on h5.
The black knight on h5 has nowhere to retreat.
The knight is doomed, but White's in no hurry to pick it off. The bishop move aims at restricting the freedom of Black's king even further - and also threatens mate or loss of queen by means of g5+.
The threat against the bishop on e5 is illusory; again Black's exposed king allows White to speed-move the knight to the rescue.
White's setup afforts Black little possibility of counterplay. The White king has now vacated the g-file and the rook is poised to take over there.
But this time White ignores the threat against the knight. Black cannot touch it - it's toxic: 38...Qxd5 39.Bf4+ Kh5 40.Rg7! and Black is lost. 40...Rh8 41.Rc1 Bb6 42.Rc8! Qa2+ 43.Kg3 and mates.
This is not mere greed; the knight needs to vacate f6 in order to let the bishop control g7.
Trying to exploit d5 and backward pawn
A concession that Black has erred; now the king is trapped in the center.
White's commanding knight on d5 continues to plague Black
Notice how all of my pieces are in postion to attack a very suspect defense.  Also, He has not developed his Queens knight and his King's Knight is hanging out in an alley!
I decided to move to open up the queen and bishop's diagonal.....I mean, who am i to say they cant join in on the action??
Getting ready to attack his bishop!
OK, lets just look at the board here.  He has not ONE piece past 4 rank.  His pieces look like a bunch of hobo's trying to stay warm on a winter night (that's not me, that's Robert Frost).  <n><n>Again, Im in attack mode trying to get rid of pieces now.
Usually I win quite easily if I launch into attack before opponent remobilizes.
The idea was Kxe5 which leads to Qg3+ and then mate. A little day dreaming always helps
It was hard to think of a way to attack that position
I think he was not sure how to attck either. The a pawn was a rather small thing to pursue.
Trying to attack f5 and protect f2 from black bishop
I didn't have to protect c4 from queen because of mate looming at f6, g7. I was hoping for a chance to get my rook on b7. More like a sucker punch.
Bxa3 would lead to b4 closing out bishop from the game
This was the key move in this mate. Anything else and it wouldn't work. Spent some time.
If he captured the bishop it Qh8 was still a mate. Inevitable after 31. ...hxg6.
Putting pressure on the Knight, and tying the Black Q to its defense [the threat is BxN PxB QxP winning a Pawn.]
Pressuring the pinned B.
Breaking the pin.
Beginning an exchange..
...and completing it.
Securing the King.
Counterattack on my Q.
...but so was the Bishop. Black resigns.
6. bxc3 - an early plethora of exchanges follow an English Opening.  This will lead to open play.
14. ....... Rhd8 - both kings are centralised with the queens off and now the king rooks face each other on the d file.
16. ........ f6 - black tries to improve the position of her pieces and pawns.  I need to further centralise my king but Henry does not get much beyond his second rank.
18. ......... Bf7, to make way for Henry to come to e6 but white decides to expand on the kingside.
23. exd5 - both of us have tried to expand on the kingside and queenside respectively but this has just resulted in an exchange of pawns.  However, white now has a passed d pawn.
24. ....... a6 - to bolster the b5 pawn just in case white chooses to double rooks on the b file.
27. ......... Ne8 - to try and prevent the d pawn coming to d6.
33. Rxe4  - white forces an exchange of knights freeing up the d pawn.
36. ............. a5 - I try to get a passer of my own on the queenside.
39. Bd1 - played to halt the advance of my b pawn.
51. ........... Bc6 - Ian finally comes round to my way of thinking and he offers me a draw which I gladly accept.  I will now tell you a little story about this game.  It is another OTB trip down memory lane. In 1997 I was the captain of the Cambridge City C Team, although with my low rating I played on either boards 4 of 4 or 3 of 4.  All I asked of my team was that they just do their best and make sure they show up!  That evening, a team-mate Romalt, our top board player was taken ill and so could not play.  That meant I had to play on board 2 against a player rated much higher than myself.  Somehow, though, I did not mind being the under-dog.  One of my other team-mates got a draw and our team came away with 1 point out of 4 which at first sounds pretty poor but allowing for the fact that we each had to play one board higher than normal and we were one player short I think we acquitted ourselves reasonably well.  At the time Ian Webster was the highest rated player I had drawn against in a rated game so I was really chuffed at the time.  I did surpass this effort a few months later in the Roger Goldsmith Trophy by drawing against a player with a rating of 1560 - and he ended up being on the defending side!
I kind of liked Qc4, though it would have been easy to defend.
This is (unless I am mistaken) the two knights defense where white can and does move his knight to g5 to threaten a fork. After which, black usually castles to avoid the fork and defend the f pawn.
So I played this move to gain more central control and prepare to develop my LSB.
Prepping b4 to chase my bishop.
Here I started seeing possibilities of if I could move my knight closer, some king of sacrifice to draw his king out.
He's trying to trap my bishop.
Taking with the knight would have brought it off the rim, but this un-isolates my pawn.
I took a long time there too, trying to figure out which piece I should take with. I settles with the bishop because the king is on a black square and this attacks the rook. It also confines the king to only two remaining squares.
Trying to get some defenders over, but overlooks the threat to his rook.
This is quite good, prevents me from moving my rook to g2, and attacks it.
?? I was trying to get my king involved, but I think this was a pretty bad blunder, as it allows him to win my knight.
A win against the Traxler.
a crucial tempo.
At this point, White has the advantage, the bishop pair and an extra pawn.
White continues to advance the pawn.
Bd6? A Mistake because the pawn on d6 is not so good
poor Bishop
5....exd6 is also playable, and tends to give black a solid position.
This is the variation I wanted to play - the so-called "Voronezh Variation"  White evacuates the a1-h8 diagonal in an attempt to eliminate much of black's counterplay.
"?!" - this natural move is what the Voronezh was designed to counter. Black's best chance is to play 8...O-O then strike at the center right away with 9...e5.
The entire point of white's play. In the Alekhine, the thematic response to white's d-pawn advance is to play ...Na5, putting pressure on the c4 square. But here, white has played Rc1 and b3, so ...Na5 only serves to misplace the black N.  With ...Na5 no longer an option, black will have a difficult time finding something useful to do with this N.<n><n>Black's most promising response to white's plan is to delay developing the N to c6, and instead play an early ...e5, taking advantage of the fact that white's other N is still sitting on g1, and not on f3 where it can influence e5.
More usual is ...Ne5, but in either case white will now have a permanent space advantage and black will struggle to find counterplay.
Preventing another thematic Alekhine move sequence of ...Bg4 and ...Bxf3. Now black must solve the problem of what to do with his light-square bishop.  13...Bf5 will be met with 14.Nd4.
Right idea, but about 4 moves too late. A better plan at this point would be 10...Nbd7, trying to create counterplay on the Q-side after e.g. 11.O-O Nc5 followed by ...a5.
White's plan is to put rooks on c1 & d1 and attack in the center.
"?" How will black complete development of his Q-side after this? Best is probably 16...Bd7, getting the other rook into the game. Not 16...dxc4?! 17.bxc4 then White will play Rfd1 and Nb5, and the hole on d6 & isolated e-pawn are big problems for black.
"?" This blunder loses by force.  Black's best bet is to admit the ...Nd7 was a mistake, and put the N back on b6.
?! Eliminating the black K's last remaining defender, but after the game I found 25.Qe4! which leads to a much quicker win (the GK game analysis computer agrees).
? Leads to a forced mate.  Black can put up stiffer resistance with 26...Qc7 27.Bxd5 Qxc2 28.Rxc2, though white has more than enough extra material to secure the win.
Black has to move his Knight again due my pawn.
Black has developed his DSB and it has a nice look at my f2 pawn.
I play yet another pawn to e3 thinking this will protect me from the DSB. This is not the best move I could of played something better, developing a minor piece would have been better.
I develop my Knight to protect my center pawn. I was about to f4 to protect the pawn, Could that of been a better move?
Now Black castles kingside.
I bring out my LSB as far as it can go. My pawns on the c-file are doubled up and I am wondering if I will ever get  to move them in this game.
I decide it's time to introduce my Queen into the game. A better move was to exchange Knight's.
Bxh7+ I decide to put Black in check with my LSB. At least if black takes with his King. I can move my Queen out of danger.
move my Rook next to my King.
Qxc1#   Checkmate   The End!   hope to hear from all who wish to discuss this game!
Not sure if positioning this B here is good enough, since, after next movements, it can be taken by N, or at least threaten. but if  Nxbg6 (after several movement) opening the f column doesn´t look bad.
Giving time to black to arm a better attack
B in b3 is a pain on my king. But then if 19.Bc2, it gives white another strong position for that bishop.
...and yet the Queen in d1 seems to help my attack. No time to waste, no get away for the king.
Good one! 22.gxh5; Qxh3!  Now that bishop in c1 blocking the R in a1 is quite an advantage for black.
Now the Queen has a strong defensive position. If column f is opened, and eventually there is Rxf8+, then queen has d6 or b8 to attack and, at least, find an easy draw position. Not sure what is best for black now. Both white and black have only secs left (around 1 min each and dropping)
This, as noted before, is a real pain, since N in f6 cannot be moved whithout causing the rook exchange and the Queen activity within black´s defensive lines.
That painful B in a2... This was the best I could come off in these circumstances.
Leaves the king an escape route...but also weakens the column
So I felt I needed to keep the queen, if I still want to go for a lucky win.
...and found that the king has a long walk around his lines...Can I get something out of it?
Activating my rook and avoiding changing it for white´s.
I had the feeling I needed to back my bishop, but not sure where. It seems Bg6 might be better choice
!! Nice one! Threats Rg1 if gxf6.  10 secs for black... nothing to do? This is the end of the game, but after 20-30 more secs I saw: 34...Qe4! <n>This is why I wanted to share this game. I found it interesting and fun. Intention of checkmate in c2, and checks in e3 with strong attack. Also now gxf6 can be done.<n>Hope you enjoyed it!
I enjoyed this game, not much in the begin but as it progressed, saw an opportunity an it payed off, nice. Even if it's is against a lesser ranked played no disrepect intended to my opponent. A win is a win an it's a great feeling !!
Move 18, Kg4, it will soon go on a journey
and parried
so now the decision...for the center of the board...
it looks to be black..
and continues
The board is not organized...I need to get both castles and both knights going...
OK an exchange
get the knight involved
Already we can see the problems caused by 3...c6:<n><n>1. The e-pawn can no longer be protected by playing ...Nc6.<n>2. If you play the natural ...d6, the bishop on f8 is blocked in.<n><n>The move you have selected means that the other bishop is now blocked in and more time-consuming pawn moves will be required to free it. On the plus side, you are threatening to win a pawn.
Developing a piece to a good square and threatening to win a pawn, but ignoring the threat to his own pawn.
Not good - after 9...bxc4 10.Nxh8, the knight is trapped and Black has the advantage.
Unfortunately, it's not easy (because of previous moves) for Black to complete his development quickly and effectively. So although this move doesn't actually develop a piece it was probably the best available since it hinders White's development (although at the expense of a pawn).
Freeing both bishop and knight - good.
Threatening 16.e5 with 17.exf6 or mate to follow.
Black can still hold the game with ...Nd7.
Taking advantage of the pin on the knight to gain greater control in the centre.
It's hard to understand the rationale for this move.
White is aiming for rapid development and a lightning attack on the black king.
7.Qd2 either blocks in the knight or causes it to block in the bishop.
Taking advantage of the simultaneous threats - f2 and b2 - , but basically forcing white to take complete control of the centre.
The knight returns to c3.
Retreating is sensible (otherwise, if it is captured, then white must take with the pawn due to the threat to the d4 pawn), although it leaves the king rather isolated...
Black will get a strong attack anyway, so white attempts to reduce the effectiveness of the attack.
Threatning mate in one. White now needs to escape his king to the Q-side, where he is easily strongest.
At this point, it is unclear how successful the attack will be, although it seems not to work; the king is currently trapped, but if the white knight comes over, then his chances look good.
...f5 is better, since black must bring the rook into the attack.
The attack is basically repulsed, since it is hard for black to maneuvre and the white king will have a clear route to the Q-side.
Black does not really have the option of not taking the queen now, as 31...cxd4 32.Qa6 leads to a game similar to that given in the notes to white's 28th move but with black down even more material.
Other moves lead to repeats.
The normal move here is 4... Nc6, since the bishop has interfered with the queen's defence of the d4 pawn, so White then plays 5. c3 and loses a development tempo.
Curiously, the world DB recommends 5. c3 even though Black has not attacked the pawn. Presumably the reasoning is that the move will have to be played sooner or later anyway. In any case, the next two moves by each side are obvious, and we reach the same position regardless of the order they are played in.
The DB gives this as only the second most common move, after 7... e6, but again the two lines are likely to transpose into each other.
This move seems at first sight rather less enterprising than 9... Bd6. If White exchanges on f6, the bishop will be poorly placed whichever capture Black chooses; and if the intention behind this move was to avoid gxf6, then surely Black ought to be glad of the chance to add a rook on a half-open file to his accumulating pressure on White's kingside? However, Black's subsequent play reveals that this move was part of a consistent plan.
White immediately deviates from Gottlieb-Rousell, in which Bh4 was played. The capture allows gxf6, as I mentioned in a previous comment, but probably after 9... Be7 White had confidence Black would not play this move.
Gets out of the pin and connects the rooks. All the same, it's not clear what White's plan of attack is going to be. White misses the dark-squared bishop here, since he can't try to establish a central majority by b3 and c4 as this would allow d4 to be taken.
Black's intentions are clear, at least: "Place your rook on the line of the queen, whatever the pieces that lie between." This is the start of a minority attack, aiming to divert the c3 pawn from its defence of d4. This plan justifies Black's choice of 11... Bxf6.
"Let's settle this once and for all." White wants the pieces on d2 and g4 removed from the board to give his other pieces more room to rearrange themselves.
Black has no choice, since 13... Bh5?? 14. g4 Bg6 15. Bxg6 fxg6 16. Qxg6+ not only wins a pawn but makes the backward pawn on e6 an instant target. And of course 13... Bf5?? just loses the piece, since the e-pawn is pinned.
Black chooses not to castle, in view of the fact that White could now plan an attack with Qd2, Bc2 and Qd3, and Black lacks the kingside knight to defend against this. Moving out of the e-file pin before beginning to advance the queenside pawns was a pragmatic decision.
White begins to double the rooks, following another old chess adage and meeting a flank attack with a central one. Presumably White intends to advance the pawn to f5. It begins to look like we're in for quite an exciting middlegame.
Black's attack is getting there faster, and White must take time out to inhibit the pawns from advancing further, especially with the queen still on the file Black is trying to open.
I think I would have played 17... Qb6 here, intending to continue advancing with ...a5. This requires the b5 pawn to be defended first, and moving the queen also makes the rook's veiled attack on the enemy queen more imminent. With the move played, the knight is heading for c4, a good square, but too easily challenged with Nd2.
The knight vacates the file for the pawn's advance. This is the most forceful way of doing so, gaining tempo and simultaneously controlling the c4 square. Black is forced to exchange (an exchange that favours White, since the knight was not useful to his plans, while Black's bishop was defending the e7 square), as otherwise the a5 knight is simply misplaced.
Black gains a tempo in return by attacking the rook. This time the exchange was not forced, but seems best all the same, since Black's knight is well placed, White no longer has his own knight to challenge it with, and the exchange allows White to keep the initiative.
Black does not want to recapture with either pawn, as that would close the c-file, negating his plan so far. However, the queen capture has a disadvantage:
Black's queen is not well placed to get back to defend the kingside pawns, so White is able to keep initiative by attacking them.
Black continues with his original plan.
A mysterious king move. Of course there was no danger of Black changing plans and attacking on the kingside, since the f7 pawn cannot move.
White decides to bring Black's minority attack to a halt by threatening to exchange queens and create a passed pawn.
(?) Surely 28... bxc3 is correct, for the reason I mentioned in my last comment; Black would like to fix White with a backward pawn on a file available to Black's rooks.
Now Black is the one with the backward pawn. However, White will find it difficult to attack, in view of how much better placed Black's king is than White's. White therefore switches plans and doubles up on the newly opened f-file:
But this is easily met by manning the breach with the rooks. Now if White tries to break through:
The result is an exchange of all the rooks, and now it's down to the kings.
My first thought was 37... Kd6, trying to make more of Black's better-placed king before White's catches up, but in fact this pawn advance is probably best. Black claims space and gets his pawns closer to the end of the board, thus ensuring that the ...e5 break is much more powerful when it comes. It's important to note that, even though it's the pawns that are doing the work, it is Black's superior king position that gives him the advantage, for two reasons: (1) White must centralise his king, giving Black time to advance the pawns, and (2) there is no possibility of White using the c4 lever as it would take his king too long to get there. White must now be regretting 25. Kh1?, but that was by no means his last mistake in the game.
I think White needed to play 38. g4, halting Black's pawns before they can advance any further.
And the advanced position of this outside pawn secures Black the win. The fact that Black's king must retreat is irrelevant, since ...e5 followed by Kxe5 is inevitable anyway.
Now we have a queen versus a pawn on the seventh rank. This would be interesting without the other pawns, but with them on the board Black just has an easy win by sacrificing his queen for the pawn. (For the record, without the other four pawns Black wins by 52. Kd6 Qh3! keeping White's king from getting in front of the pawn. If Black plays any other move, White has a draw, since the pawn is on a bishop's file and Black's king is too far away.)
Black should not be able to stop the c-pawn this way, and should just take the quick win by Qxc7+.
Black now has an easy win (even if you remove both Black pawns!) so White resigns. Well played, and thanks to no_genius for showing me this game; it was an interesting one to play through.
Black ignores this and places an attack on the unprotected bishop
Rather than retreat or exchange, white chooses to block with the pawn and gain a better position
Trying to retaliate. If dxc5 then ...Bxb2 winning the bishop and rook for a Knight and bishop. Still a mistake because...
He attack the Knight on the rim
If bxc5 then rook gets bishop
Black decides to attack the k-side as his position is not really suitable for castling anyway. Position may have been OK if he played well but he was at a disadvantage
White prepares to capture pawn with the bish but loosens the grip around blacks king
Attack that was waiting to happen
Black presses on
Exposed e pawn must be taken care of to reach the black kings lair
Blaxk tries to get in first
Probably why he chose to develop with 5... Bb4 , so he could get the Knight to e7 and quickly castle.  It's a fairly decent plan, but he does run into a hitch.
Trying to grab a stake in the center.
Even 9... Kh8 would eventually lose to Ng5, Qh5 (or something similar, with the same theme).
Generally thought of as better than the alternative Kg8.<n><n>[10... Kg8  11. Qh5 Re8  12. Qh7  Kf8  13. Qh8  Ng8  14. Nh7  Ke7  15. Bg5  Nf6  16. Qxg7 Kd7  17. Nxf6  Kc7  18. Nxe8 ]  and black is down the exchange and two pawns.
Probably done to give himself just marginally more time to think.
In order to avoid the immediate [13. h5  Kh6  14. Nxf7 ] where white can pick off the queen.  However, mate threats still loom.
Sentencing black to some painful discovered checks on h6.
In order to cut off the h7 retreat when the white knight moves.
??<n><n>Now, black's only try was to give back the piece with Nf5.  Though, heavy material losses would be soon to follow with white's attack still alive.
White Bishop cant stay where, this also free's Rook.
Any chance to break up pawn formation is a must......Leaves holes in yr ranks my friend....
So far, all pretty normal for a London. Black can do two things: c5, and get countergame on the queenside, or try to castle queenside, instead. Black didn't make the mistake of Nc6 before c5, but castled kingside. This makes it a perfect target for me. It would be exaggerated to say that white has an edge, but black has to play with more care that it seems.
Here it comes. Cesar crossed the Rubicone.
Almost useless move. The Nd5 can't be taken by the other N. Nb4 is hardly an annoyance. Black plans to answer Nd7 to g5?
Nd7 forces me to find a way to proceed, and I have plenty of them, but it would be hard to find a definitive winning one. But black preferred...
?? The losing mistake. f5 was needed, or even Qh4, and the fight continues.  But now, nothing can save black.
Opening a square for his N to retire, but...
If now black plays 15... f6, 16... BxN. Bxh6 is threatened, so fxB seems the only reasonable option. After it, 17. Ng5 seems to offer white with Nxh6, winning, for example: Be7, 18. Nxh6+, gxN, 19. Qg6+! and mate on h7 the next move.
BxN, dxB, Ne7 was another idea.
The unconfortable Bd6 pays the price of his outcome (it could have been in e7, and black would stand a little better).
Hi everyone!<n><n>Another game with the Master Mater and another game where Jo gets Freddied.  Henry gets the dubious honour of being "Knighted" at the end.  How does this happen, well, read on.  We pick up the action on move 8.
11. ...... Bg7! - this gives me food for thought.  That dsb rakes down on to my queenside.  If I play Nc3 then BxN breaks up my pawns.  In hindsight though maybe it would have been better to have allowed that trade for although it may have broken up my pawns it may have opened up some lines onto the exposed black king.  I now trade my developed knight for that dsb.  Freddy said it was a mistake and so it proved.  Fou Lenoir stays at home the entire game!
16. Ne2 - trying to chase away the Witch.  She does back off and allow me to castle but is that an invitation to castle into it?
24. ....... Qg6+ - nasty queen fork, grabs the c2 pawn and worse still she invades my castle to try and sieze Henry.
30. Nc3 - allows mate in two but not sure what I could do.  Freddy moves the Witch to f3 and I beg Freddy for Henry to be allowed to stay in the hospitality suite of his castle instead of the horrid fetid draughty dungeons as I feel he has clocked up enough Tesco loyalty vouchers with such frequent visits to go there.  Freddy replied that he would grant me the vouchers plus a free ticket to a Fancy Mate!  Haha!
31. b4 - I decide to spend this token move to show where I would have liked to have put Fou Lenoir.
32. ..... Rxg4 - Freddy decided to given Henry a Stay of Execution for just one move but after I taken off the bishop he does knight Henry and then Henry is taken away to Freddy's castle to spend yet another night or two in Freddy's there - this time it is the luxury suite - away from his beloved Glenda.  Ah well, I hope he fares better in Freddy's Traxler Tournament that I plan to enter once I get my games load down.
Hi everyone!<n><n>My buddy Bob Jacobs drew my attention to a victory he had obtained against a player of near-IM strength.  In fact he is currently an IM.  In this game, however, Bob's opponent slipped up big time and immediately resigned on the grounds of Ruinous Loss of Material.  So, how did all this happen?  Well, here is the Gameknot Analysis version of the game.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17771714&fb=1&rnd=0.860014379173279.  Bob starts with his favourite opening, the Queen's Pawn Opening.
11. .... Qxe7 - bishop trade.
16. gxf3 - black busts up Bob's castled position, but will he be able to capitalise on this?
22. Qxe4!!! - Yeeeeeeeees he does!!  Black immediately waved the white flag.  It just shows, Masters are human and they make chessic howlers, but they are not Masters for nothing - it is very rare that they do make oversights.  Bob should still take credit for this victory - first he must spot the hanging piece.  He must then decide whether it is a sacrifice or a mistake.  Firstly he must look at his king and check that he is not in Old Matey's shadow or that if he does take the hanging material he will not then cop Old Matey.  He must also ascertain that after the capture, his opponent does not have any other riposte or positional counterplay.  Black had none whatsoever and so, having just a pawn for his queen, resigned on the Grounds of Ruinous Loss of Material even though his opponent is 800 points south of him - it was just too much.  Anyhow, another known Master has slipped up big time and he will be joining Bob on my It Can Be Done Thread.  See you soon - Joanne
Not one of the main lines. The most played moves are 2.. Pc6, 2.. d6 and 2.. e6. If white plays 3. d4 now it will become an accelerated dragon.
Now you can see what I mean with the holes. Pawn on c4 is weak because after b3 is the diagonal for the bishop on g7 open to the rook.
Maybe was 7. Nh3 better, because it can go to f4 followed by Nd5. The knight doesn't do anything here. g5 will be met by f4!
On 8.. Nf6?! follows the strong 9. e5!
holds the bishop away form field g4
A very strong move. On 12. Nd5 follows the strong 12.. Nxd5 13. cxd5 b5! with control and bishop pair for black
This is a very big blunder. Better was 12. Nh2 followed by moves like f4 and g4
Very strong combination. The knight on c3 was indirectly pinned by the bishop on g7 and now the knight on f6, which was blockading the bishop, has gone away with a pawn. Now white has to play 13. Rxe4 which is met by 13.. Bxc3. Black has a pawn more and an enormous advantage because the standings of the pieces. The bishop on c1, queen on d1, rook on a1 and the knight on f3 aren't standing good. Black has the same, but can bring them active much faster with moves like b5, Bb7, Dd7 and if white has taken on b5, which is quite logical Rfc8. Black has still to defend h6. White first has to play Rb1. Then isn't there a good field for the bishop. Black hasn't weak points. There can't come knights on d5, the queen hasn't a good place. I should already say, but maybe it's too fast, black is won
White must play here Bxh6, but black still has an advantage.
Nimzo-Indian, Rubinstein system. I like this better than the Capablanca version, 4. Qc2, and better than immediately putting the question to the bishop with 4. a3.
The most natural move, and the one most played on Gameknot too.
Necessary. Black can now exchange on c3, reinforcing my centre, or take my pawn on d4, agreeing to a pawn structure with my pawns on c3 and b4. Retreating to a5 is also a good option, not yet agreeing on anything and leaving me to figure out how to hold the centre.
I thought long about this move. As I said before, I believe this position is more common with the moves 0-0 and Nd7 included. Now, if I play 10. bxc3, he'll probably play 10 ... Qxd1 and I lose castling rights as well as hopes of an attack. Loss of castling rights might not be that bad with the queens off, but I rather have my king out of the centre. (Although, in the game, my king never leaves e1!) I could initiate an exchange of queens myself, but I didn't feel comfortable that way. So, I decided on this move, sacrificing a pawn but letting my dark-squared bishop into play via b2. Note that both my bishops and queen are aiming at the Black's king castled position.
Blocking his queen and bishop but lending strength to the knight on f6, the main defender of Black's castled position.
It should be obvious that I'm planning on a kingside attack, so Black's next move came as a surprise to me.
Not such a good move. Black attacks my light-squared bishop but removes support to the f6-knight.
I could have also played 13. Ba2, but I figured that would take to much time. At least now I'm threatening to win back the pawn with 14. Bxf6 Qxf6 15. Bxh7+.
This is definitely a mistake, not a fatal one, but a mistake nonetheless. Black is probably trying to achieve counterplay along the c-file, but that takes to much time. Black is acting like his king is perfectly safe. Or he thought that after 14. Bxf6 Qxf6 25. Bxh7+ loses, because my rook on a1 is attacked and that I therefore do not have the time to retreat my bishop, leaving it vulnerable to entrapment.
I thought it was time to attack.
Looking at this situation, my position is far from a winning attack. Actually, I think Black is better here. Moves like 16 ... Ra(f)c8 and 16 ... Ba4 come to mind. My queen has to defend the bishop, Instead came a blunder.
I now have the ability to open up the h-file, leading to a definitive attack.
18 ... Kg7 leads to 19. Rh7+ Kg8 20. g7 and Black has to give up his queen to fend off mate.
The winning move. If Black takes the pawn, he again needs to give up his queen. If the rook moves, mate follows too: 19 ... Rf8 anywhere 20. Rh8+ Kxg7 21. Qh7#
This capture would not have been possible if BL had not removed his own potential to play 3... Qh4
WT also had the option to play 5.exd6, which is called an En Passant pawn capture, and would remove BL's pawn off of d5 if WT had done so. But since he did not use that option, WT now loses the chance to ever capture that pawn En Passant. [However, if black were to later play f7-f5 then WT would have an option to play e5xf6 e.p. upon that move. ]
Bb4  is another error costing BL material, for if now 8...dxe4 9.Qxe4 and BL cannot save both his Bb4 and b7 pawn that are attacked by the Qe4.
Now 11...Kf8 12.fxg7  Kxg7 13.Qg4  lets BL last a bit longer and deprives WT of his rare 0-0 checkmating move.
There should be two smiley faces painted on that move 12.O-O / One time clear back in about 1981 or 82 I won a skittles game that ended O-O-O# for the Checkmate. It has taken this long to finally add the second bookend to the set~! <n>To add some symmetry, perhaps irony; while this game from a King's Gambit Declined ends with O-O# ... the game ending in O-O-O# was won by WT from the QUEENS Gambit Declined ?!! ... Hmmmm<n>  }8-) <n>Thanks to my opponent for playing this one all the way thru.
Just standard development to this point. Now what? It feels strange for me to have a fianchettoed bishop in the Caro-Kann, because how can I play c5? I'm looking at Qb6 next and then Nbd7 and, at some point, e6. I feel I'll have to trade on f3 at some point and get rid of my problem bishop that way.
I just peeked at my teammates' game -- already lost one and behind in the other one. That's tough. Means that I have to win both just to get a draw. And my plan had been to win my game as white and try to get a draw with this one.
I'm going to have to deal with my weak pawn on e7 at some point.
Why would he do that? If he pushes it to h5, I'll play g5. That lets his knight have f5. So I'll play e6 to keep ahold of that and also helps take some pressure off of that pawn.
Is he going to give me a free pawn? Maybe he thinks he can win it back with a strong attack on my c-pawn.
This seems to be called either the "van Geet", after a Dutch International Master, or the "Dunst" opening after a New York master.  It's a flexible opening that allows quite a few transpositions, but is less popular than some due to the possibility of black playing d5-d4, forcing the knight to move.
Here's a famous game by Ted Dunst (taken from wikipedia):<n><n>Dunst-Gresser, New York 1950 1.Nc3 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Bg5 d5? (better is 5...Bb4 6.Nxc6 bxc6 7.Qd4 Be7 8.e4 0-0 9.Bd3 h6 10.Bf4 d5 11.0-0 dxe4 and the game was soon drawn in Ekebjaerg-Oim, 14th World Correspondence Chess Championship) 6.e4! Be7 7.Bb5 Bd7 8.exd5 Nxd5 9.Nxd5 Bxg5 10.Qe2  Ne7? (Losing at once. 10...Be7 11.0-0-0 is also very awkward. Although it's unpleasant, Black should have tried 10...Kf8.) 11.Qe5! Bxb5 12.Nxc7  Kf8 13.Nde6  (now 13...fxe6 14.Ne6  wins Black's queen) 1-0 (notes based on those by Tim Harding)
Forcing the bishop to retreat or trade.  This is different from 7. a3 in that I did it for a specific purpose rather than "by rote".
Pinning my f pawn.  I dislike bishops on the a2-g8 diagonal, or the b1-h7 diagonal, when I play black.
!? (Interesting move)<n><n>I decide to offer a bishop trade in the hopes of opening the f file for my rook while removing the hated bishop.  I marked this as interesting, not so much because of the individual move itself, but rather the idea behind it.
Normally doubled pawns are seen as a weakness because they can't protect each other.  In this case, I decided a minor weakness was worth the pressure I could put on the half-open f file.
?! (Dubious move)<n><n>This forces me to use pieces to defend both e pawns, emphasizing the problem with doubled pawns.<n><n>Nd5 or Nd7 followed by Bg5 or Bh4 may have been better here.  I intended to force white's knight to move with e4, but went about it badly and almost got myself into trouble.
Bringing the knight to the kingside where it will help attack my undefended pawns.  This knight doesn't move again, but does prevent me from occupying several critical squares during the course of the game.
!? (Interesting move)<n><n>Closes the b8-h2 diagonal and makes my bishop look a little foolish.  On the other hand, it opens the d4 square and the a7-g1 diagonal.  White should probably open the game, but I believe he was still eyeing my pawns and this traps the pawn on e5.
Protecting my pawn, but more importantly, lifting my rook to allow the other to move in behind it.
Prevents Rg6 which would pin the knight and possibly win it if followed by h6.
? (Bad move)<n><n>Doubling rooks was my goal, but with the knight on g5, this was the wrong time to do it.
?! (Dubious move)<n><n>Unnecessary and perhaps weakening.  White needs to develop his bishop and bring his other rook into play.  Nxh7 followed by Bg5 blunts my attack and looks interesting for white.
?! (Dubious move)<n><n>Blissfully unaware of the dangerers of Nxh7, I try to bring my knight into the struggle on the kingside.
?! (Dubious move)<n><n>Retreating the queen to defend against a minor threat (Nxc2), this relieves pressure on my kingside.  Developing the bishop or Nxh7 (again) is better.
The thought was to force the knight to retreat, but actually taking the knight would allow Bxg5, trading my rook and pawn for a knight and bishop, which would remove my greatest asset, the rook battery, and allow white to bring his other rook into play.<n><n>This does prevent the previously mentioned Nxh7 followed by Bg5 threat, as well as prevent h6, so it's not all bad.
c3 is probably better, forcing my knight to retreat and preparing for an eventual d4 to open up the game.  As mentioned last move, the knight is safe on g5 as taking it allows Bg5, winning my rook.
Moving my bishop to the critical diagonal.
! (Good move)<n><n>Sacrificing my knight to open the f3 square.  My queen was clamoring to move and the rook blocked her path.  I considered Qf7, followed by moving my knight off of the a7-g1 diagonal, and Bxf2, but that seemed far too slow.
Helps protect the f pawn, but it's a weak defense.  White really needs his other rook and bishop in play, but there's no time to do that now.
I felt like I needed an extra piece in play, to prevent the king from escaping, so decided to bring the knight over.  This protects my rook and allows Nf6.<n><n>It looks like the knight is unneeded since Bxf2! leads to 24. Rxf2 (Nxf2 Rxg3#) Qxg3  25. Kf1 (Kh1 Qh3  26. Rh2 Rf1  26. Qxf1 Rxf1#) Qxh3  27. Kg1 (or Ke1 Qh1  28. Qf1 Qxf1  wins at least a rook and may lead to mate) Rxf2 wins a queen for a rook.
The time taken to move the knight into position allowed white time to regroup.  If he can move his bishop out and bring his other rook into play, he may have a viable defense, but there's still no time.<n><n>If Nxh5, then Qh3#.<n>26. Be3 Bxe3 leads to a more restrictive version of what we arrived at next move because the king doesn't have g1 as a flight option.
Pins the knights again with the same threat, though Kg2 is no longer available to break the pin.
Allows the other rook to protect the back rank and attempts to protect the pawn, but again, it's too late.<n><n>If Kg1 to help protect the f pawn, then Qxh2 removes protection from the f pawn.
Since the goal was to remove the f pawn protecting the g3 knight, capturing the bishop or pawn works just as well.
White resigned.  0-1<n><n>29. Rxg3 Qxg3  30. Kh1 Qxh3  31. Kg1 (Qh2 Ng3  32. Kg1 Rf1  33. Rxf1 Qxf1#) Ng3 32. Qg2 Qxg2  33. Kxg2 Nh5 leaves black with a knight and connected passed pawns, more than enough to win.<n>29. Kg1 Qxh3, after which black should give up on mate and trade down to the won endgame mentioned a moment ago.<n><n>Please feel free to message me if you have comments, questions, or find any mistakes (I'm sure I left a ton of them - think of them as Easter eggs).  :)
Accepted challenge from eesther  not aware that this player was undefeated. Thanks for the game!<n>At the end of this game, that clean sweep was stopped. Red fox is Rising and shows why in our game.<n>I am not going to try to explain move by move as I have done in most of my past annotations. Please do this for me. This annotation was made by me to promote this game we all play. eesther has told me to annotate our game and will also add comments. on with the game white opens e4.
Well this is interesting, why not? Let's move my Queen early. I'm sure this will get the LSB to either move or get protected, The f7 pawn is in attack.
LSB retreats still targeted on the white diagonal keeping a eye on my K
this pawn is now played exposing my DSB with a nice view of the black diagonal towards the side of the board.
Rook to d file
N has to retreat
Q returns to c7
N is well placed to the center of the board
I'm ready to start the offensive.
coordinated attack on d3 seemed appealing at the moment.
that was not an error on his part, that was tactics on mine. I want to take credit for something.
so, did this work? i know there are some problems with it. such as the fact that i never castled, and my queen was in danger a lot of the time. but you have to admit that mate around move 9.
Hi everyone!<n><n>I am playing in a MT in memory of the victims of the Japanese Earthquake.  Both the above players are my current opponents.  I saw that my buddy Jim had lost his Master status and found that he had, sadly, lost a game to a Class B player called Delta38.  It shows that amateurs CAN BEAT Masters and as I am currently playing a huge crop of Masters and a Grandmaster I will play through this game to show myself how it can be done.  Gameknot Analysis is provided here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15498364&fb=1&rnd=0.41857366360436593.  Jim starts off with 1. e4 and Delta gives him the French Defense with e6.
2. b3 - a little offbeat but prepares to fianchetto his dsb onto b2.
7. ..... c5 - GM Daniel King, in a chess video on the French has always recommended this black pawn break on c5 before black's queen knight goes to c6.
13. Bc1 - wow and double wow, black wins a pawn here because if Bxc3 then we have an example of a PAWN FORK on b4.  Either Jim's knight or his bishop will have to go.  Now that pawn on c3 could become very awkward indeed for Jim.
13. .... Ndxe5 - and so the carnage goes on.  Another white pawn drops off and suddenly black is TWO pawns to the good.  Unlike me, Delta bravely keeps his mits off the Offer Draw button - mind you - I think I will now, if I had that position avoid offering my opponent a draw now I have that little handful of Expert Draws in my profile I am prepared to up the ante!
15. Bxf3 - now with plus material black is eager to trade white down into an inferior endgame.
18. Nc4 - Jim tries to break free of it but will it last?
20. .... 0-0 - black finally castles on move 20 so his rooks are now connected and can pile on more pressure on the white position.
24. ..... b3! - a beautiful in between move.  White must move his rook and then Jim's dsb is picked off next move and black has two connected passed pawns just soooo close to promotion.
28. ..... Rab8 - awesome -- this rook backs up the b3 pawn and black has just kept that pressure on.
30. ..... d3 - Jim accepts the sacrifice and Delta pushes his d pawn to d3 where it backs up the b2 pawn.  I think that next up is Ba3 and if Rxa3 then c1/Q+ comes next.  The rook on b2 will be trapped so Jim resigns on the grounds of ruinous loss of material and Old Matey will not be too far away.  This is an absolutely awesome result for Delta because Jim Friar is a very strong player and here are my past game stats against him - past games against therealjimfriar (won/lost/drawn): 0 (0%) / 7 (87%) / 1 (12%).  Yup, I think the Master Mater will be certainly quaking in his hiking boots if he ever comes across a Delta!  Anyhow, I hope you have all had a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne
My opponent in this game, kneilca, sent me a challenge with the message "Please feel free to comment on the game", so, after a long gap, I have another annotation to share with everyone.
Two Knights Defence, always my favourite response to Bc4, and an opening I've been playing a lot recently thanks to Freddy's mini-tournament on the Traxler variation (4. Ng5 Bc5). Good fun, but for this game I decided to go back to the more mainstream 4... d5. As Ion said in a comment on someone's annotation, the great thing about the Two Knights is that all the variations can lead to exciting play :)
White's most enterprising continuation, violating the prohibition on moving the same piece twice but with a strong attack on f7. Black must decide how to meet this attack...
...and the most common response is this pawn sacrifice, hoping to gain an advantage in development in compensation.
...since Black also has this option, my favourite. So far I have a 100% win record in games with this line; partly because the move considered White's best response, 6. Bf1, is simply never found at the board by players who haven't seen it before. The point of this bizarre retreat is to guard g2 and to preserve the bishop from exchange (either 6. Be2 or 6. Bb3 is met by Nd4); and Black still has to deal with the threat to his knight. Since both 6... Nxd5 7. Bxb5 and 6... Qxd5 7. Nc3 are fine for White, Black normally plays 6... Nd4, transposing into the labyrinthine Fritz variation.
Getting back to the actual game: Black has only one realistic response to this move, 6... Qxd5, putting g2 under fire. In this line Black hopes his pressure on White's kingside will be sufficient compensation for the pawn.
This is the most common move here; White hopes to weather the storm. 7. Bf1 is now too passive and usually leads to Black victory in past games in the database.
Castling in this position is very bold; maybe too bold. The main alternative is 8. Qf3, hoping to defuse Black's pressure. Of course Black would not exchange but would play 8... e4; however, the long diagonal would at least then be blocked.
Black threatens immediate mate, and now 9. Qf3 is less attractive, since the pawn on e4 will be well supported and will cut off the g5 knight's retreat. 9. Nf3 is a possibility, but the pawn move played in the game is in fact the most common.
Since Black intends to storm with the kingside pawns, he naturally castles on the other wing; the h8 rook can support the pawns from its home square, while the a8 rook needs to be brought into the action.
White opens a line for the bishop, and also defends the e4 square, to discourage Black from trying to annoy the crucial f3 pawn. It looks as though this defence is ineffective, the d-pawn being pinned against the queen, but in one game in the database, Black unwisely tried 12... e4, and regretted it after 13. fxe4 Nxe4 14. Qg4+.
The knight makes way for the f-pawn to advance, and also defends the g-pawn so the h-pawn can advance. This looks dangerous; though perhaps Black is playing a little overconfidently and striking immediately with ...g4 was more to the point.
(?) Not sure about this move. White clearly can't aim to counter Black's pawn storm with one of his own, as his pawns are too far behind. Instead, I suspect the intention was 17. b4 Bb6 18. b5 to kick Black's queen off the long diagonal. A nice idea, but too slow; Black just responds Qg6 and Grond crawls on. What can be recommended instead? Perhaps 16. Ne2, getting another defender to the kingside and creating the possibility of blocking one of Black's lines by d4.
White's slowness gives Black the confidence to (finally!) play this move. Now the enemy are at the gates and the Rohirrim are nowhere in sight. The immediate threat is 17... gxf3 18. gxf3 Qxf3+ 19. Qxf3 Bxf3#; White could instead play 18. g3, but then the knight is frozen in place and Black can easily break open White's kingside by advancing the f- and h-pawns. The only way to defend f3 (remember, it can't move) is to move the f2 knight; but it has no squares. 17. Nh3 gxh3 also undermines g2 and leads to checkmate, while 17. Nxg4 fxg4? 18. Ne4 would dampen Black's attack, but instead 17... Rxg4 and White can't take the rook.
White capitulates rapidly after this move, overlooking that the pawn was defended, but by now it hardly matters.
Otherwise Black plays 18... g3 19. h3 gxf2, cutting White's communications so that there's no good defence to the threat of Qg6 and Qxg2#. But against the move played, Black has:
A "removal of the guard" tactic. The obvious materialistic recapture is not, in this case, to be condemned; Black would have a similar follow-up to any move by White now.
d4 to open up his black bishop
This is a very dangerous move, but it may turn the tide your way if used correctly, for if diagonal squares remain open and white's bishop is out, you pretty much get free rook.
In here, if he takes out his white bishop as I mentioned, I can attack g2 and take the free rook.
In order to activate a piece and open up for castling
I donpt want to put it in the f8, because that just undoes what I tried to do.
Limites the movement of my bishop
More in order to get a castling
He surprisingly opens up the diagonal, therefore locking in his kinght, because I wouldn't want to lose my rook.
for better position of knight and to connect the rooks afterwards.
I always use this opening as I find it lead to a open game, which I prefer. It was also what I was taught to do at chess club.
Not a great move, and the one that Black was trying to induce with his slightly dubious Bishop sortie. It weakens the Kingside pawn structure and gives Black's light-squared Bishop a target at which to aim itself.
?? An awful move. White has no good possibilities on the K-side, and taking the e-pawn will only give Black a monster square on e5 instead of a blocked and passive Bishop.
! The refutation.
!? Trying to open up the position and make his pieces more active. Also, this is pretty much the only way of convincingly demonstrating the wrongness of White's f4 push.
? Waste of tempo.
White, once again, has to redevelop his pieces to aim at the center. However, challenging the e-file with 19. Re1! was the only way for White to hold on.
Once again, ganging up on the b-pawn, which White will have to go through some contortions to save.
Doubling on the e-file and for the moment stopping the c5 push.
Kind of a pointless move, but it is hard to suggest anything to White at this point.
Too little, too late. White hits upon the correct idea of advancing his Q-side pawns, but Black dominates in the center far too much for this to end any way but painfully.
? 25. Kh1! would have prevented the Black Queen from joining the attack with tempo.
This game illustrates the fact that, although you may have a pawn center in a closed or semi-closed position, often the best course of action is not to attempt an attack on the K-side. Also, when the character of a position changes and becomes more open, centralization often leads to an unstoppable attack when ignored.
I played White in this Mini-Tournament game. I think it is an instructive example of how to have good piece coordination in the middlegame.
I don't think this is the sharpest move against e3, since White can transpose into some reversed defenses with an extra tempo, such as 2...c4 transposes to a reversed Sicilian where White has the extra tempo e3. Against any passive move by White, Black should play an opening where tempo doesn't matter, such as 1...f5
I think the simple Nc6 is better, or Bd6. Trading a bishop for knight usually benefits the player with the extra bishop, so White can get an advantage with h3 forcing Bxf3, since Bh5 g4 Bg6 Nxe5 wins a pawn for White.<n>After h3 Bxf3 I wasn't comfortable with doubling my pawns or moving my queen early, so I didn't play h3, but now I see that my queen would've been fine on f3 and I can take advantage of Black's light square weakness with c4 later, but instead I played the passive Be2.
Pinning knights in the opening usually isn't a good idea unless the pin is strong and can be followed up with pressure. Here I can just break the pin with Bd2 and Black's bishop has no purpose on b4 and can be harassed with a3 later.
Like I said before, bishops are usually better than knights because of their long range capabilities. Trading a bishop for a knight will weaken a color, which can be exploited by your opponent's extra bishop of that color. It is less common that a knight will be better than a bishop, unless the position is very closed making a bishop hemmed in by its own pawns, or sometimes the bishop's handicap of not being able to step off its color will become an issue. Bishops are generally better than knights, but this early in the game it isn't a big deal, the advantage is more clear when pawns are traded and the bishops become mobile on the open board, while the knight's ability to hop over pieces becomes less important.
My only advantage is my bishop pair, while Black has control of the centre, which cramps my position and makes it hard to find a plan. It's still only the opening, so I'll have to wait and see what Black does before I can find a plan.
This move makes it reasonable that Black wants to castle queenside. I think it's better if Black castles kingside, because then it's hard to attack him from there, and Black can focus more on his space advantage. When Black castles queenside, it's easier for me to attack so Black has less time to exploit his space advantage.
I didn't want to play bxc3 because it makes my dark-bishop less active, but opening the b-file was probably my best choice, since more open positions benefit the bishops. Here Black doesn't have to let me open the position, so the knights might become superior to the bishops since my bishops are contained by pawns.
? This is definitely a mistake because I can start an attack by pushing my b and a-pawns easily. Castling kingside was better since attacking with my g and h-pawns would be weakening to my position.
Hoping to play b5 and open the position.
Black has wasted moves trying to stop me from opening the position to his king, but I'm going to get an open file sooner or later. It's not too late for Black to walk his king to the kingside, but Black kept his king in danger on the queenside to hope to consolidate a defense, but that defense deactivated all of Black's army I was able to exploit.
Even though makes my dark-bishop bad, I wanted to activate my light-bishop on the f1-a6 diagonal to attack Black's weak queenside pawns.
exd4 is probably better, even though opening a position should benefit the bishops, it gives Black more space to come up with some counterplay, unlike in this closed position, Black's only chance is a do or die kingside attack, but my threats on the queenside are too quick.
This attacks the b-pawn, and bxa4 isn't good because I can open the position more with b5 later. If Black defends the b-pawn then he only lets me open 1 file, but defending with Kb6 isn't good because after axb5 axb5 Qa2, Black has to play Ra8 to stop my threats, then I can get 2 rooks for my queen, and my rooks just dominate the a-file.
Nxb5 was a lot better, because my pieces cannot slip in easily and Black has time to defend his weaknesses. axb5 is pretty much a blunder, because that completely opens the a-file so my threats come 1 right after the other and Black never has time to generate counterplay.
I can triple my major pieces on the a-file with tempo.
This is the most solid defense, since Nc8 gives me too much control of the a-file, but when Black defends like this, his pieces become totally inactive where I can exploit my superiorly coordinated pieces. Nc8 is probably better, since Black doesn't have to defend so passively, and has a better chance to recover from the attack.
I've gained a lot of tempo in the attack, and devalued Black's pieces. The rook on a8 is completely immobile, and surrounded by pieces that cannot leave the defense of the other immobile pieces. In positions like this, the attacker has to find the right moves to slowly squeeze the opponent out of defensive options.
There isn't any other way to make progress. My intent is to come to a5 with my queen and threaten Rb6 , where the only defense is Nd7 since the other pieces cannot move.
Black will have to make this move anyway, and this makes way for f5 to start a pawnstorm on the kingside. I'm pretty sure I can capitalize on my superiorly coordinated pieces before Black can make progress on the kingside.
Black has 5 immobile pieces clumped on the queenside. The queen or king cannot move because they have to defend the a7-knight, which also can't move because it's blocking the immobile rook, and now Black's other knight is paralyzed since it defends against Rb6 . My 3 major pieces have demobilized most of Black's army. Black's only mobile piece is the h8-rook that cannot do much damage, so I have him where I want him. The only way I can overcome Black's clump of immobile pieces is if I can somehow get my bishops active in attacking Black's defensive pieces.
This defends against Bg4, attacking Black's immobile knight. In order to get my bishops active to complete the attack, I need to first open the position, since my bishops cannot do anything when they are blocked by pawns in this closed position. f5 blocks the diagonal to the immobile knight, but there is nothing blocking Black's immobile queen on the h2-b8 diagonal, so it would be crushing if I could place a bishop on that diagonal.
This move prepares for a Be1-Bg3 maneuver. Attacking an immobile piece is the key to cracking any defense. Black can try stopping my bishops' infiltration with 22...exf3 23.Bxf3 h5 24.Be1 h4, but I can force open the position with 25.g3, after 25...h3 26.g4 the only thing stopping Bg3 is f4, but Black's position falls apart after I win that pawn. If 25...g5 instead of 25...h3, then 26.g4 forces open the centre since I'll trade pawns on f5 and then breakthrough with d4.<n>26...fxg4 27.Bxg4 attacks an immobile piece
When Black recaptures, the abscence of the pawn that recaptured will create a weakness, and just that little bit of free space is all I need to activate a bishop and complete the queenside attack.
If fxe4, then I play Be1 and the h4 restriction attempt doesn't work because of Bg4, attacking the knight that defends against Rb6 , but regardless of how Black recaptured, I free up space and can activate a bishop.
If Kc8 then Rxa8
Black resigned since I will play Rxa8 next move and just go up even more material. Black's main mistake was castling on an unsafe area of the board, allowing me to start an attack. Even though my attack wasn't immediately decisive, I was able to increase the pressure against Black's immobile pieces, until I could force open the position and get in 1 more attacker to finish the job. Had the position been completely locked with pawns and unable to be opened, then Black's defense would've held.
Black can try the Fajarowicz variation 3...Ne4 which concentrates on the rapid development of the pieces, but it is virtually refuted by 4. a3! If white now tries to hang onto the pawn, he usually fails, or gets a compromised position.
So I play this, opening up a discovered attack with my queen, on the Ng4. Now Nxe5 is met with 5. f4 and white has a space advantage.
But Dewi plays another move. Already I am thinking for myself. After the game, it struck me that maybe white should just play 5. h3 here, and we reach the same position as after 4. e4 Nxe5 but with black having played h5 and white having played h3. I suspect that h3 is more use to white than h5 is to black, and white should have an advantage in that variation. Surprisingly I can't see this on either of the Gameknot opening databases.
But he just ignores it. If I now capture twice on g4, he has d6 uncovering an attack on my queen, followed by taking on e5. Black is a pawn down, but with some compensation, in the form to two bishops, better development and some open lines. So I chose another move.
This pesky check helps his development. Now I thought that he was getting back his pawn, but I may be able to get the two bishops by blocking with my Nb1. I also considered by Bc1 to be my better bishop, worth hanging on to.
This surprised me. He is now threatening to exchange on d2 and then capture on e4.
This was another surprise. After the game we looked at lines like 11. c5	Ng4 12. Nf3	Bxh2+ 13. Kh1 Nxf2+ 14. Rxf2 Qxf2 15. Kxh2 and although black has a narrow material advantage - rook and two pawns for bishop and knight - black has lost all his attacking pieces except his queen, which can be harassed. The initiative has passed to white. Unfortunately instead I made a dreadful error.
Because of this move, with threats to f2 and h2.
My king reaches relative safety on d1, and black hasn't quite got enough for a knight.
But now there is no way he is going to promote on g1, with 3 pieces - rook, knight and bishop - protecting it.
But onwards the pawn marches - it may have been better to finish black's development and prepare to play 0-0-0. At last most of my pieces are working well together.
Preparing to move my king to d2 or c2 to link my rooks.
His rook comes in.
Bishop comes out to add another protection to g2.
Rather than taking the pawn immediately, I consider it more important to take the queens off.
He correctly tries to exchange pawns.
I think this is a mistake - there is no need to make this exchange.
I prevent his king from advancing, and prepare to attack f5 from f6. This give Dewi the unpalatable option of losing his f pawn or allowing the exchange of rooks. He opts for the latter.
So he prepares to advance the pawn.
I retreat. I am not really threatening to take on a7 yet, but if he plays, say Kf7, then I can take on a7.
He puts an end to the ideas of Bd4 taking on a7. He now wants to exchange another pawn with d6-d5. In those circumstances I have to be very careful. If he can exchanges my b pawn too, I could be left with wrong bishop and rook pawn, which can't be promoted.
He briefly traps my bishop, but my king is coming to its aid.
Now, c4 grabs a good amount of space in the center, and allows white to continue with a little initiative in the opening.
?! I don't love this move, as it blocks the light-squared bishop and the queen in, and basically commits black to moving this knight a second time in short order. But there's an even bigger problem, that white overlooks.
? Missing the way to capitalize on black's mistake last move. c5! traps the Nb6, winning a piece. Those of you who ever have a chance to play me at blitz chess will notice that my quality of play plummets precipitously; this is one small example.
Played immediately. In a non-blitz situation, I would've looked to see if moves like Be3 or Bf4 were better; in blitz I jump on the chance to move the king to a slightly worse square. Lasker's old saying, “When you see a good move, look for a better one” wasn't meant for games this fast!
?! A little surprising. I was expecting a move like e6, defending the knight while opening a line for the Bf8. Now the e-pawn is blocked, and the bishop will take some time to resuscitate. In the meantime...
An easily parried threat, but in faster games, it's a LOT easier to be on the offensive than on the defensive. Black's options don't look great at this point: Nd7 blocks in the other bishop, too, Bd7 loses a piece (and maybe more) to c5, and King moves have their own problems (e.g., 10. ...Kf8 11. c5 Nd7 12. Bf5, with Ne5 looming).
?! Also not good. There isn't a lot of safety to be found on the queenside. White has some pretty strong continuations.
The best way to attack! Black has only two options, and one (11. ...Kc6 12. Ne5#) is out of the question.
White would love to play Bf4+ as a follow-up, but currently the Ne6 guards the f4 square.
White opens up the center to harness his lead in development but will it prove worthwhile especially since it appears to make him lose a pawn?
! aggressive! I like it! My queenside is starting to feel the fire and I may lose all the queenside pawns!
If I recall correctly I was thinking on my opponent's time at this point as my own clock was low. Right now I have very little going for me! I am down an entire rook (as well as a pawn) with a non active bishop. I only have a stab at his king with my queen. Maybe it will pay off
He goes for the win. I can draw if he stays on the 1 and 2nd rank.
The only way to continue the attack. At this point I am fighting for a draw and white is fighting for a win since he is up.
The only way to stay in the game. I have to keep checking him or quickly lose.
Going in for the checkmate. Looks like it is time for my final assault. Final because if it fails I lose immediately.
! I can cause problems now thanks to my rook! Keep in mind we were in time trouble at this point and so this was quite a saving move.
Not the best move. The best was 6.Bf1, followed by black Bg4, 7.f3, Nxd5, 8.Nxf7, Kxf7, and so on.
Not the best either. This move allows me to get rid of my weak, and horrible pawn over a useful pawn. Better was Qe2 or Nc3.
Sticking to Classical lines.
Trying to KO the White center, since my QP has been diverted.
Clears the way to castle. Right at this moment the Tigers hit a home run and I made my next move without looking carefully at the board.
I figured on being a Pawn up after 6 QxQ ch KxQ in return for losing the right to castle. But...
The most logical and used move.
Placing the white king in a safe position and helps the rock to dominate the d-file.
11....a5??? That will lead to the dangerous 12.Nb5.
now it is mate in three.
Nice one, where a white's mistake in the beginning leads in a finale nicely won by the black.
?  In his effort to keep the pawn, white makes the mistake
More exchanges are welcome, black also controls the free column...
Black gets its King into the game, since he lacks 2 pawns and his pawn structure is not that good, in exchange for his Bishop...
Perhaps the white shouldn't have rushed into advancing his pawn, with the rest and his king  staying in the back...
Stops the pawn and hopes for an exchange (bishop for a knight) and maybe a pawn...
White manages to protect his pawn structure in the king's side, but black can win a pawn with: Bxe4, Kxe4, Kxc3, which opens the column for his pawn (c7). It has the disadvantage of letting the white king go towards the 6th-7th line, which could be dangerous, but black believes that, by sacrifising his Knight for the advanced pawn at the right moment, he can win the game.
Black wants to first make sure that the white won't be able to get another pawn towards promotion, after the knight x pawn.
According to the plan, Knight takes the advanced pawn and it seems that black will be able to win this...
Black is starting to get a bit worried, but believes he can do it in the end
Starting the attack on the queen-side. Also probably looking at Bb7 to put some nice pressure on the e pawn.
Looking to ease the pressure off of the e pawn by eliminating the Black knight.
Good developing move! Finishes Black's development (though they need to castle!) and annoys White because 12 Bxf6 would be pointless due to 12...Nxf6
Lining up the rook and queen. Though really it isn't much of a threat at all. Not with the Bishop at d3...
? Getting another knight to defend the e pawn? And clearing a way for the queen to develop possibly?
Finally the Black Monarch arrives at his palace!
! A good move since this gives Black's Knight a home at c4 after the massive trade soon to come.
Allowing his knight to move finally.......
! Instead of wasting time on a one move attack on Black's knight with 25 b3, (beginners would almost definitely do such a move) Black creates a nice camp for his Knight at c5.
Moving the knight to a more effective position and offering to trade knights...
! Putting the Queen in position to penetrate Black's territory.
The reason for 32 Kh2. So if Black takes 34...Qxd1 Rxd1 35 Rxd1 and there is no check that allows Black to come back and protect his knight!
Even now White has the advantage with his connected pawns. This game was a winner for sure if only White moved 43 Rxh7. My brother was (understandably) extremely intimidated by the rating of his opponent and settled for a draw.<n>This game was played on the first round on board two at the Washington State Team Tournament in 2006. Where his opponent's team went on to take 3rd place at State! Jeremy Jusak finished that year as the 4th best Senior in the State of Washington!
...a6 in the Yugoslav attack is generally a tempo loss and should be avoided unless there is a specific plan. White was not threatening to go to b5. Better are the main lines 9...d5, 9...Bd7 and 9...Nxd4 10.Bxd4 Be6. (look up some grandmaster games to understand the different ideas behind one of these lines).
There is no immediate refutation of ...a6 although white might win a race to checkmate on the h-file. 10.h4 and 10.g4 are playable but I don't know exactly which is better.<n>White should not play 10.Bc4 here because then 10...Nxd4 11.Bxd4 b5 would justify black's ...a6 move.<n>10. Kb1 is a useful waiting move, which prevents ...Qa5 due to the following trick played in the game. I thought White can take the time to play this due to black's slow move ...a6, and was planning on choosing between h4 and g4 next move.
??<n>This is not playable with the white king on b1.<n>It was still possible to transpose to the 9...Nxd4 line with 11...Be6 followed by 12...Qc7, 13...Rfc8 and only then 14...Qa5. Although 9...a6 is going to be a harmful loss of tempo.
I was trying to get my knight back to d5. In retrospect 15.Nd5 is probably better. I will have to recapture on d5 with a pawn, but will avoid opposite color bishop endings.
?! Obviously it was time to move the bishop, but where?<n>I was uncomfortable with Bc4 because of ...b5 and ...a5.<n>Bd3 prevents ...f5<n>Be2 gets out of the way of the rooks, but is a passive square.<n>g3/Bh3 is another plan.<n>My bishop and h1-rook are worse than their counterparts, but if I can get the black pieces tied down to the defense of d6 then I can slowly improve white's position.
!<n>One step closer to reach the opposite color bishop ending.
?? This is the losing move, and the trap.<n>I was afraid black could draw this position by:<n>(a) playing ...b6. This will allow the a-pawn to advance to a5 if attacked by the bishop. Note white can't prevent ...a5 with b4 because c3 hangs, and if white plays a4 threatening a5 then black has time to play ...a5 first.<n>(b) moving king to d8 or c7 (close enough to defend d6 and b6 pawns, and trying to stop a passed pawn in case of a ...b6; a4 a5; b4 axb4 cxb4 sequence (assuming the c3 pawn has to be well protected by white first- this means white's king and rook are passive)<n>(c) only then trying to exchange rooks
With 2 extra pawns, the opposite color bishop ending is now won for white.<n>The plan is to make passed pawns on opposite wings, as far apart as possible.<n>Just because it's (theoretically) won does not mean it's resignable; the game HAS to be played out. One slip by white and it's drawn again. Black just has to suffer and patiently wait for a chance.
In this match Malpas & Oswestry were home to Wrexham in Malpas. We(Malpas & Oswestry) were missing several players, so I had to play on top board, rather than board 4. I had already lost to Bob with black earlier in the season, where he played 1. e4 and an open Sicilian. Instead now he plays The English Opening. The English derives its name from the English (unofficial) world champion, Howard Staunton, who played it during his 1843 match with Saint-Amant and at London 1851, the first international tournament.
I maintain the symmetry.
He moves to recapture his pawn. I could have just followed the symmetry with Qa5 here. Gameknot computer suggests .....Nd5 10. Qxc4 Nxc3 11. bxc3 Be6 12. Qh4 h5 13. Bb2 Qa5 14. Nd4 Qxc5 15. Nxe6 fxe6 16. Bxc6 bxc6 17. Rad1 but....
I attack his rook, and drawn on my suggestion. As we were already 3-0 down in a five board match, my opponent agreed. After the game we found that white actually has a combination here, which wins a pawn - 14. Qe8+ Bf8 15. Nxh7! Many thanks for reading, please rate this on the star system, and leave a comment or two to let me know who is reading my annotations! Until next time dear reader!
I gain in time by capturing a developed piece in return for an undeveloped one. I was expecting the simple recapture 14 QxB.
H'mmm. Not sure why White didn't recapture, but I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.
My pieces seem to be pointing in the direction of White's King, so I try engaging in some tactics.
Creating "Luft" if necessary and keeping the White Knight away from KN5.
H'mmm. Have to make a retreat with the Rook.
...and completing the doubling of my Rooks.
Pressing the issue.
Adding force to my attack on the KNP.
Continuing to press...
...I can trade off the Queens. With every exchange my material advantage looms larger.
Locking the Pawn position and keeping the backward KP in my sights.
Now if I can advance my QNP, I can force away the White pawn blocking my QBP.
I look to reposition my Knight more centrally.
And my Rook, too.
...I can make the Rooks vanish.
Time to remove Black's last piece.
Had to put it back.
Time to head for a square where I can guard QN5.
I attack the knight...
Now I give my bishop freedom from the left hand side...
Now I unleash the other bishop...
...and attack the other rook, trapping it.
...and loses his bishop...
...in exchange for mine, creating more space.
By splitting the king and knight, I'm guaranteed another piece here.
He decides to take my knight...
Now my bishop is stuck...
A possible plan here, to potentially split the bishop and rook
I decide it's time to move my bishop...
...but end up having to also move my king.
...along with the bishop...
I can afford to attack the king here, with my bishop covering.
Now I lose my bishop...
...and my knight...
But this is a bit unusual. As the knight doesn't have prospects of going to b4 or c5 it doesn't look like a good square to me.
He prepares to fianchetto his bishop.
I prepare to advance in the centre.
With the threat of taking on d5 and then on a6.
I attack the knight.
I was so proud of this exchange sacrifice at the time. Fritz tells me however, it was unnecessary and taking on f6 with the bishop is plus 12.94 to white, and second best move is Nf5. Fritz is wonderful at bringing you back to ground!
Moving his rook away from the attack and trying to exchange pieces down the c file. I don't think I would have taken the rook though - I think my bishop is better than a rook and should contribute to a winning attack. Fritz says whatever black does there is a forced mate from here.
Again, a natural move, defending the rook and eyeing h6 but Fritz prefers Qh5, just allowing the rook to go, but mating. Nf5 is Fritz's second favourite move.
Fritz says this is the best move. A knight fork on h6 is threatened, and if the black queen drops back to g6, there is another knight fork on e7.
Fritz gives this as best move, and mate in 8.
Black forgets that my knight is within striking distance and can capture it. This also removes the Bishop's protection and now my LSB can capture his without being recaptured.
Black forgets that the only other thing protecting his bishop right now is the Queen; I can take the bishop with either my knight or my own bishop and I don't have to worry about being recaptured.
I take it with my knight to avoid being taken by the pawn.
Taking the pawn. Black's pawn is pinned and he can't take the knight because the bishop protects it.
This was a bad move on Black's part, as you'll see. Now I can pin both his queen and his rook with one move. Before this, the queen was protecting the key square at c7, so I couldn't move my knight in this manner. Now my knight is free to wreak havoc.
And mate. Black made a few errors in the opening that allowed me to mate. The first was not realizing all possibilities on the board and taking too many risks, which allowed me to capture several key pieces. The second was that he quickly lost almost all his pawns and the king had zero protection.
BIG MISTAKE!! This is the prime reason for this mate in the first place.
The good thing about 3.e4: if Black develops a piece, White is often able to push his central pawns with tempo.
The reason for this move? In GM Yasser Seirawan's "Winning Chess Combinations" I had just discovered a chapter on the brilliant "Classical Bishop Sacrifice" which you are about to see. This stylish attacking motif captured my imagination, and I resolved to use this attack as soon as possible. This is about to be my first attempt at using it.
The Classical Bishop Sacrifice attack runs Bxh7 Kxh7 Ng5 . 13.h4 prevents ...Qxg5. h4 also comes in to the attack after ...Kg6.
As Seirawan so nicely puts it, it's a case of "damned if you do, damned if you don't". On the one hand, Black will be left a pawn down after 14.Kh8, and White retains a good attacking possibility...on the other, White's crushing attack starts after Kxh7.
A very neat and stylish win. Remind me to use this attack more often :-).
The Birds. An ok setup.
? Not really the best place for it. I believe better was Nd4 or Ng1.
We need to get our kings in the game.
! I think that this is the quickest way to win.
All I got to do is get my king to e5 and I win easily.
?? Best was to go Kc2 but it doesn't make no difference to the outcome of the game.
Box the king in.
He resigned -- After Kh6 Kxf5 and Kh5 Qh7 mate. I hope that you liked it? Please leave a comment and rate it on the star system, thanks.
Black is now solidly developing the pieces out, and white has his center under some pressure.
White was afraid of 11.Nxd4 d5 probably, with threat to now play ...Bc5 or ...e5. This move still adds pressure to the black position. It looks very strange, placing another piece backwards, and losing control of the center, since the d4 pawn is no longer there. Therefore, black plays the best move.
Now black needs to stabilize the position and stop white from gaining a total control over the center. My defense over the next few moves are actually quite accurate, and my opponent loses his advantage quickly. Defense is much more difficult than offense, but I manage to do it. The key is to avoid all the concrete threats by the opponents, and taking any spare time the opponent allows you to get your position together.
This move is rather passive, but it does hold the center, which is what black has aimed for. Therefore, white has only a small advantage. My opponent, not wanting a draw, becomes rather frustrated with the fort not crumbling and loses most of his advantage. 24.Rd4! was strongest.
Black breathes a sigh of relief, and now starts with a more aggressive plan, to use my much superior endgame skills to outplay my opponent, who had an almost winning position at one point in the middlegame. The following was a wonderfully instructive grind as I improve my position while white clearly has no idea what to do.
Exhanging queens is suicide for my winning chances and probably would lose, due to the queenside majority white has, that will give him distant passed pawn. Besides, I am now playing to win. By the way, here is a rather advanced rule about the endgame that most players don't understand- Endgames, even those with equal material, are certainly not drawish, even if only 2 pieces are left. Some certainly are, but most are not. Most people would assume a draw here, which is totally wrong. If both sides play perfectly, a draw of course, but that is for any about equal position. Instead, both sides have appropraite ways to improve, and playing for a win is just as reasonable as in a typical middlegame position. Most players tend to think that equal endgames are draws. They are, but not easily at all! Any equal position is technically drawn with best play, but that requires both sides understand what they have to do. So I am playing to win here.
I will fix and neutralize my opponent's majority, then will use my king to support an advance of my first kingside f pawn, to fix the white weaknesses. Bd5 is a strong idea, tightening the pressure on white because taking gives me a passed pawn in a queens only endgame.
You see? Black has slowly improved the position, but white has no idea of what he needs to do. To tell the truth, it is not easy, so therefore white should stay put and cover some weaknesses the best he can. The key in the endgame is that the stronger side pushes the pawns, and the weaker side keeps the pawns at bay to cover weaknesses. The opponent does not understand this idea.
With his plan completed, black has gained a continuous edge due to the space advantage and weaknesses on the kingside. White seals a blunder that ends up losing the game.
Terrible move. Now terrible weaknesses will be created. White is clearly worse, so he should not help the opponent by advancing pawns and worsening his position. Let black do the work to try and gain something.
??This move now loses the game by force by one tempo. The calculation is straightforward, but black needs to make sure he does not miscount the pawn steps. The key is the the a and h passed pawns will stop each other when one promotes, so the first one to do so wins.
My first OTB game of the season, following a horrendous season last year, when I dropped from the 1st team to the 2nd team and still didn't do very well.  Nevertheless, hope springs eternal and the 1st team was short of players, so I filled in.  Things didn't start well for me as I turned up at their old venue and, as 7:30pm drew near, realised that there were no chess players present or boards being set up, so I asked at the bar and was directed to the new venue on the other side of town, arriving about 8 mins late.  Fortunately, the match had not yet started.
I got into trouble in a recent Gameknot game against 3. h4, so I was glad not to see that.  Gallagher comments that "3. Bh4 used to be the main line but has been discredited somewhat in recent years".  As the game went on, I found this bishop to be a major thorn in my side as it severely inhibited my development.
Gallagher describes this as "a solid move which, in my opinion, fails to exploit the position of the bishop on h4."  He prefers 3....c5 or 3....g5 or 3....c6, citing one of his own games as an example of 3....g5, which he drew against Illescas in 1985.  It leads to some bizarre-looking pawn formations.
This is not mentioned by Gallagher, so it's either a modern innovation or not very good.  It seems to me to be a natural developing move that doesn't create any weaknesses in White's position or provoke any particular response from Black.
After quite a long think, I decided on this conservative approach, hoping to exploit the absence of White's DSB from the queenside.  I was already worrying about how to develop my kingside, given that the e-pawn was pinned against my Q and that both ...f6 and ...g5 looked ugly to me.  So I planned to get the Q away from the pin, then play ...e6, followed by developing my DSB and castling kingside.  Given the passivity of my resulting game, I think in retrospect that 4....g5 would have been the better option.
In accordance with my plan, I deferred the decision whether to swap Ns or retreat but continuing with my plan for developing my kingside and taking the opportunity to pin White's N.  This move is much less effective than it would have been if we had omitted 3....d5 4. e3 when the Q could have swung across to h5.
At this point, I first considered continuing with my plan for kingside castling with 7....e6 but I didn't like the way that it would box my LSB in, especially with my remaining N being so limited in options.  Moreover, if I did develop with 7...e6 and 8...Be7, White could capture on e7, forcing my K to recapture and I wouldn't be able to castle anyway; so I delayed those moves by developing this B outside the intended pawn fortress, leaving for later the decision on how I would develop the kingside.
I hadn't really considered deeply enough this obvious response.  No bishop retreats looked attractive and 8....Be4 just seemed to encourage White to play 9. f3, building a strong centre with tempo.  I didn't really consider 8...Bg4 for the same reason, so ....
I decided to swap, despite bringing his Q onto a powerful square that threatens h7 and can be followed up quickly with Ng1-f3-g5.
As discussed before, ...e6 still did not look attractive, so I developed the N to the more central of its 2 options, whence it could, hopefully, eventually nestle on f6 or support a pawn thrust to e5 or c5.
So much for entertaining notions of 10....e5 ... A good aggressive move by White, surely to be followed by the N developing and castling kingside.
As discussed previously, 11....Be7 was unattractive due to 12. Bxe7 but I was still determined to castle and, with d8 covered by White's DSB, queenside castling was out of the question.  So my DSB went to the only available square that wasn't covered by a White pawn or piece.
Now I felt that this prophylactic move was necessary to delay White's attack if I did manage to castle.
So White parked his N on e5, attcking f7 and asking me the question ...
I didn't feel I could just leave it there, as I couldn't castle without leaving the Nd7 unprotected, and, if I didn't castle, he could swap on d7 and I'd have to recapture with the K anyway (maybe not a disaster, given the fortress of the phalanx of pawns on white squares, but White already had f5 prepared).  Capturing with the N, which seemed the more natural move, would have resulted in the Bd6 then having to move after White had recaptured on e5, so, in the interests of speed, I gave up B for N.
The logical recapture, opening the f-file for rook action and keeping Black's pawns locked.
Thankfully, not a surprise but I had underestimated the concern that f7 was going to cause me.
The Q had no further purpose on the queenside and was urgently required to marshal the defence of the kingside.
White's plan is simple: use his heavy pieces on the f, g and h files till something in Black's defences gives then break through and force mate.  Carrying it out requires some resourcefulness, though.
Given the weakness of f7 in the face of the forthcoming rook battery and the impossibility of using f8 or e7 from which to defend it, I decided to move the pawn immediately, thereby creating a new weakness in my position ...
There was no way to prevent both Qxg7mate and Qxh6, so I played the most flexible defensive move I could find, hoping that, eventually I'd be able to equalise by exploiting the f-file.
I chose this square so as not to occupy f7, which might soon be needed as an escape square for my King.  It also threatened the spare pawn on e5, but this was not my main objective, which was still defence.
Having won the pawn, Wgite returned his Q to g6, preparing to move his R to the h-file to support check on h7.
By doubling my rooks on the f-file, I hoped to prevent White's other rook from making a useful contribution.
Now White has successfully brought this rook into the action ... I wondered if perhaps my R should have stayed on f5 after all ...
Heading for safety on the queenside.  I was still only a pawn down, with the potential to win that back on e5, so I felt I'd almost equalised.
Of course!  Now White has a clear path to swapping off Queens and than exploiting Black's back rank with his remaining rook, winning the rook and pawn endgame easily.
As I played this, I saw a glimmer of hope, if White avoided the obvious 28. Qh8, which was clearly winning, and chose to attack my Q with his rook.
??  Just as he released his hand off the piece, White recognised his blunder and offered his hand as I advanced my Queen.  For some reason, the pin on the g-file was not that obvious.
A lucky escape!  I think I nearly deserved it though, as I had defended a bad position resolutely until the opportunity offered itself and I was alert enough to have spotted it beforehand.
hi this is an interesting game which, though I happened not to win an apparent winning game, gave me the opportunity to win my first tournament.
preparing the classic f5
retiring from the battlefield to compose on the other side. We'll see my knights played a good part here.
just in case black is inspired by a sacrifice or a h5 move. I considered I had a little time to continue my own attack. Who said that: "first defense, then attack"?
h-column didn't seem to dangerous for now, since I considered my own attack as faster than the eventual movements rook-king to occupate the free corridor.
we are now both on d6... Black should play Ne8, thought after that I had some plan to continue my attack.
and a second pawn... but i was now arrived at my own peak... and I did not know it.
impressive, no? I thought it was... bishop and queen seem to be able to consider an attack on the king.
king is comfortable to flee, here.
these 2 pieces seem busy. I have to admit that I considered to late the importance of the e3 square.
and now the dangerous spot is c4. I started to consider the draw, now, though I was 2 pawns ahead.<n>Computers play Nxg4! I have to admit...
forced, as a Nc4 position would lead to a double attack on my bishop.
we can consider the knights have beem much more agressive than the bishop in this game. For both sides.
gosh, this is a beauty! Congratulations to ataka.
I considered for a moment Qa2, but I thought it does not lead to nothing and the f-pawn is too dangerous. Actually, it was the best shot
Pirc Attack!<n> <n> <n>As noted it's actually a defence that focueses around the four black moves: d6 Nf6 g6 and usually Bg7, and on White's side d4 e4 (or in a different order) Nc3. White has a lot of options and kind of controls what will be the style of the game with the following moves (e.g. 4 f4, 4Nf3 4Be3 or 4 g3).<n><n>I'm trying to get into this with the book Pirc Alert by Albert and Chernin :)
preparing to give the dark-squared bishop a home on the long diagonal
maybe developing to Nc6 was attractive here, which also guards the critical point e5?
up to this point the game is equal I guess, however the knight needs to find a new home...
? a bad decision, as the knight has no future here (only c7 which is not free yet). It would have been happier on h5, even it's on the dim.<n><n><n>Comment: My fear was that after Nd7 e6 woud follow. Of course fxe6 would yield Bxe6 Bxe6 Qxe6+. I did not feel that comfortable with that thought... Kh8 would have to follow since white could do Ng5! well... :)
asks the bishop for a decision
fixes the pawn on e5
A crazy-looking move to a beginner's eyes (well, it was to mine when I first saw it!), but the Benoni lines this move foreshadows are some of the most aggressive lines at Black's disposal.
This is the move that usually heralds the Czech Benoni, although from here the game could still transpose into King's Indian Defence lines... White doesn't usually advance the d-pawn here, attractive though the idea looks, as on d6 the pawn becomes isolated and lost.
It is this move that really identifies Black's opening as a Czech Benoni (named for the Czech masters who explored it - Hort, Jansa and Kavalek).  Black has in mind to exchange this bishop for White's c1-bishop at g5, given the chance.  The downside is that the thematic break, ...f5, will require considerable preparation to bring about.  This preparation is likely to involve playing ...g6 so as to recapture on f5 with a pawn.  Though Black's manoeuvres are often slow and tortuous, it transpires that it's not so easy for White to take advantage of this.  This game turns out to be in its early stages a good demonstration of the respective strategies, but, later, also of what can happen if Black mistimes his thematic break.
White has a big choice here, and the move played is neither the most common, nor necessarily the best.  Also playable were Nf2; Nge2; f3 or f4; or g3 or h3.  Bill Hartston remarked that White's possible plans are numerous, and not easy to categorise. The bishop move is aimed specifically against Black's intended ...f5 break.
It is more usual here to develop the g1-knight to f3 or e2.  My plan in this game was to play as aggressively as I could on the K-side, just to test how good - or otherwise - Black's defensive prospects really were.  This pawn advance is much less concerned with stopping ...Bg4 than to support the advance g2-g4, aiming at inhibiting the ...f5 break in the short term, and maybe foreshadowing a pawn storm further ahead, or at least the opening of lines for White's rooks.
One of the moves recommended by Hartston against White's set up (the other recommendation being the equally thematic 7...Nbd7).  The idea is not only to free the f-pawn, but also, after ...g6, to bring this knight to g7 whence it will also support the f-pawn's advance to f5.
An important decision, though its implications have already been discussed.  True, it constitutes a weakening of Black's K-side - the dark squares around the King - but it also presents a target at g6 if ever White gets a pawn roller going.  What are the prospects of that though?  Such a pawn storm proves difficult to arrange, as you will see.
Developing with an apparent gain in tempo.  But Black's response is to place a knight precisely where Black wants him.  The pin is no real inconvenience to Black...
(!?) Bolstering the bishop, and with the idea that the Q might eventually gain access to h6.  The Q-move also enables the long castling, or at least bringing the a1-rook into play...
(!?) Solid defence.  Possibly this was one occasion that Black might have contemplated some sort of Q-side action - 11...Qa5, say.  But the move played is thematic, and has the potential (as the sequel will show) to force a decision upon the future of the h6-bishop.
(!?) The alternative was 12.0-0-0, which might actually be the better choice, as it happens.  But I didn't want a "castling on opposite sides" game and in fact felt that the K was probably safer in the middle squares.
Preparing to drive out the intrusive bishop by 13...Ng8, perhaps?
(!?) An unexpected decision.  Did Black apprehend that White might take on g7?  After [A] 13...Ng8 14.Bxg7+!? Kxg7 White might have launched into an all out assault: 15.h4 Nf6 16.h5 Bxg4 17.hxg6 Bxf3+! 18.Kxf3 fxg6 19.Qh6+ Kf7! and it's not easy to discover how White can reinforce his attack.  The WK probably will have to get off the f-file soon (like, now) but after 20.Ke2 Qb6!, White has to think about defence.  What if the h6-bishop retreats, then?  [B] 13...Ng8 14.Be3 f5! - the sought-after pawn break! - 15.gxf5 gxf5 16.exf5 Nxf5 17.Bg5 Nd4+ 18.Nxd4 cxd4 19.Ne4 Bf5 20.h4 ... White doesn't seem to have made a whole lot of progress.  Either way, Black seems to emerge with a roughly even game ... at least.  OK, then, how about White's third alternative, to allow the bishop to be taken?  Let's try a waiting move [C]: 13...Ng8 14.b3!? (there might be a better waiting move, but this will do for our purposes): 14...Nxh6!? 15.Qxh6 Bd7 (developing) 16.h4 f6! 17.Ng5!? fxg5 18.hxg5 Bxg4+! (18...Nh5?! 19.gxh5 does look strong for White) 19.Rxg4 Nh5 20.Rxh5 gxh5 21.Qxh5 Rg8 and although a terrific battle continues to rage on the K-side, Black
xd4 cxd4 19.Ne4 Bf5 20.h4 ... White doesn't seem to have made a whole lot of progress.  Either way, Black seems to emerge with a roughly even game ... at least.

This, clearly, must be the crucial point of the game.
seems to be holding his own.  This, clearly, must be the crucial point of the game.
(?!/?) ...which duly comes.  During the game I was a little surprised, in view of my previous move, but still thought the move was pretty much OK.  Now I think otherwise.  I identified a couple of later moves that did seem to harm Black's position, but the moves I recommended turned out to be no better, which suggested (in retrospect) that in fact this pawn break had come at the wrong time.  As there was no opportunity to play this earlier, then it had to wait.  For what?  I'm not sure I have a good answer to that question!
White certainly does not want to allow Black's f-pawn to advance further!  Black would then have a fine game.
(!?) For the moment, Black dare not take the f-pawn, owing to 16...Bxf5 17.Bxf5 Rxf5 (17...Nxf5? 18.Bxf8) 18.Bxg7+ Nxg7 19.Rxg7 Kxg7 (20...Rxf3?? 21.Qxh7#) 20.Qxf5 and White emerges from the massacre with an extra piece.  The purpose of this rook move was to unpin the g7-knight, allowing the recapture at f5.  During the game, I thought 16...Rf6 more accurate, as it obviated White's next move.  But 16...Rf6 17.Bg5 with 18.f6 to come would have been similar to a line discussed after Black's next move.
(!) Opens up the b1-h7 diagonal for the Q and B already aligned thereon. White wins a pawn, but also has a strong attack.
White has an undoubted advantage now, with plenty of open lines into the Black position, and the White knights starting to pile in, as well.
It can't be helped: Black must lose material.
(?) Relatively speaking, a disastrous move.  But as  Black was already in serious trouble, it really just accelerates his downhill progress.  21...Nxe8 lost at least the exchange (22.Bxf8), and 21....Qxe8 22.Nxf6 was even worse.  No wonder the rook capture would have seemed the least of all evils...
A smashing blow, attacking e8 (Nxe8), g7 (Bxg7+) and h7 (Qh7#) simultaneously, and the BQ dare not take the knight owing to Bxg7+ winning the queen.
Slender though it is, Black's best hope... Places an extra defender protecting g7, and the h7-square is also protected.  Too bad about the rook...
Checkmate.  Black was doing fine up until the mistimed pawn break (14...f5?) after which his game went downhill fairly quickly.  Yet the pawn break was exactly what Black aims to play in this opening.  The line suggested after 13...Ng8 14.Be3 f5! looked OK for Black.  Maybe that's the key:  13...Ng8 is to be preferred to 13...Ne8.  It was certainly not obvious during the game that this might be so, but after the latter move, it seems that it might be difficult for Black to arrive at ...f5 safely.
My idea is to play Nc4, if black play b5 then move the night to e4, if possible I would play a4 to prevent b5.
I want to develop my bishop and believe that this is better than e2 (c4 is not an option due to b5 and we are helping black to develop his queen side).
Not a good move, the basic idea is to develop your pieces first then the queen - yes there are openings where you develop the queen early.<n>Another good opening point is that you should not move the same pice twice during the opening (unless someone force you to).<n>b7-b5 would have been a natural way to develop - it prevent white from playing Nc4, and it develop the queen side, e6 is also a good plan to develop the black bishop.
A clear mistake - Bxe2 followed by e6 and developing the bishop and castle would be a way to move forward, but white have an easy game here.
A mistake - white want to play c4 and now he do it with a tempo.
The best would be to move the night back to f6 and accept the mistake.
Qd5 would win the rook, but this is also nice, it win the queen and a rook (example - Rxf8, 27.Rxf8+, Kd7 28.Rxe7+,Kc6 29.Rxc7+ and Rxa8.)
Premature. The best move is definitely 2.d4 here, occupying the centre. At the time I was hoping to mess up Black's pawn formation by doubling his pawns on the c-file. As a beginner, I for some reason saw doubled pawns as an out-and-out liability...a weakness which resulted in many a painful loss.
Forcing Black to waste a tempo with his knight had not occurred to me, for the simple reason that at the time I had no comprehension whatsoever of the value of time (i.e. number of moves) in chess. However, my favourite activity was using the underestimated pawns to shove my opponents' pieces around. Knights are particularly susceptible to this, as we are about to see.
Yay! Gaining space with tempo, and my opponent's silly horse has to leap out of sight.
The intrepid pawns move forward into the opponent's half, and the stupid knight has to get some more exercise.
Obviously the knight has nowhere to do, he has to content himself with defending with a pawn. Black chose the WRONG PAWN! He has opened himself up to attacks on the kingside, and my f-pawn is perfectly placed to help.
Time to call in the town bully (to quote GM Yasser Seirawan). Even I could see a (practically) winning attack when it danced under my nose.
A masterpiece... Now, after 18. Qd4, we get Bf5, rendering b1 useless... We win a crucial tempo...
Incomprehensable... The least black can consider, is 18. ... Bf5 19. Rb3...
Not an uncommon opening. The idea is to get the KBP forward before planting the KN on the natural square, enabling this P to participate in a K-side thrust. And of course to veer down less explored paths than, say, the Queen's Gambit or the Ruy Lopez.
Focusing attention on Black's K4.
Naturally I have no intention of letting Black maintain the pin on my Knight.
I wasn't expecting Black to so willingly give up a minor exchange.
Intending to fianchetto the QB...
...and increase my hold on the central dark squares.
Time to focus on completing my development.
To clear Q2 for the Knight and avoid obstructing the long diagonal.
The mate threat gave me time to guard the other B as well.
Naturally, I want to drive Black's Q from the heart of my position. I was expecting 18... Q-N5.
I think Stalhandske wanted to go out of the database here.  He is doing this to group G in the Walking club and it is causing our brains to go into overdrive!
I am playing off a general idea I heard of where black plays for superiority on the queenside while white tries to demolish the kingside.  My plan doesn't come forward as I end up defending on the kingside plenty of times.
I'm not sure what to think at this point.  I don't have a solid plan, but I am thinking about moving pawns to open the queenside eventually.  I also did not want my knight pinned by the LSB which I don't think was much of a threat.
I elect to capture the knight before it decides to capture mine and open up my kingside.
f5 forces the knight to move while blunting the range of white's LSB
Bringing my knight over to support my kingside.
I give up my idea of having a knight vs. bishop.  Not sure why, perhaps I thought the knight was safe, or maybe I forgot the plan after a couple of days.
i try to protect my pawn on g5
Here I resign.  I thought I saw a forced mate, but later realize that what I saw was not mate, however, after 30... Qxb2 I am in deep trouble.  I will lose enough material soon enough while trying to avoid checkmate that I cannot possibly have a positive outcome.  Overall, I can proudly say that I fought valiantly against stalhandske, and I thank him for the game!
I follow up with my favorite c4...always looking to take on f-7 so the king can't castle to throw off my opponent.
I get ready trade to move my bishop to g5 to take his knight to weaken his king.
I counter...and at the same time I prepare to move my queen to c2 for a second check on the king after the bishop checks him on f7.
This is where the noob comes out of me....There is no reason for this move. I was hoping to take the pawn on c5 at the same time checking his king but didn't see the defending knight...stupid I know!
I bring out my knight in hopes to castle soon and protect the bishop and for center control.
Finally I take his knight! the move I have been waiting for. Maybe a bit too soon as I now see I could have moved my pawns up to protect the bishop?
Another noob mistake. Forgetting to castle !!! and my king and rook being forked as I am checked.
He pushes up his pawn to e5
He moves his knight to c2
I get my rook to an open file as I'm sure you will all appreciate
Black casually moves his rook to d2 as he eyes down my knight with both his rook and his bishop. I have to move one of my knights..Which one?
I move one of my knights to f5. One of them has to be taken. I think I chose wisely.
I take his bishop and now his rook is looking nice.
I don't think this was a good move by black to retreat his rook and go for my knight. a better move would be to check my again with his queen by going black queen to e8. Instead he moves his rook to d5.
You probably saw this coming. Its the move I was waiting on. I check his king at the same time his rook is threatened and I am protected by the knight on f5. At this point not much he can do but follow my lead.
now his queen is taken. and I am up in material. The tables have now turned that quickly. I think his best move here would be to check me or take my knight.
He chose bishop to e7 to guard his rook.
The game starts with a strange opening. Black usually responds with e5, but having not seen this move before, I went with my gut (and apparently it was saying e6). From what I heard, white normally will go for a fianchetto with b3 and then attack the center with f4, much like the bird opening only in a different series of moves.
This would also have been my response to e4. The "correct" response would have been e5 to attack the center, but that wasn't what I wanted to do this game.
As I mentioned earlier, the fianchetto is usually the key to this opening.
White now controls the diagonal. At the moment the bishop can't be stopped, but it isn't a threat yet.
It may seem like an even trade, but this trade is anything but even. White is trading a very strong bishop for the knight which wasn't as strong. Not only that, black now can develop his queen while attacking the rook. As said multiple times, f4 was much better.
Places more pressure on the knight. The only move is to move the knight away or...
...To defend it with the other knight. I find this move weak since both the bishop and queen will be stuck since the knight is blocking them.
Attacking the center and after a3, the bishop can stay on a5.
It's a great place for the knight, but it gets easily chased away after a few moves. Right now, e5 loses a pawn and g5 leaves the king defenceless later.
Develops the bishop and opens the c-file for the rooks. I understand that Bb4 was probably better.
This was the losing move of the game. The best possible result for white is to let the knight go, and pray for a draw. Of course if black doesn't see the winning move, the game would be much different. Do you see the winning move?
With a simple sacrifice, white will have to let go of the knight and now the rook, unless white makes another mistake.
The obvious move, unless black wants to give away a huge advantage.
The move that wins the queen. There is absolutely no way to prevent losing the queen. Taking the bishop is the "best" move. All other moves are deadly as well. White resigned here, since there is no way to recover.
Finally prepearing to move E-D pawn!
Let's see if white moves g4 in order to weak even more the pawns
Black covers fully the diagonal
Black prepares the attack. After ...,Rxe1; Qxe1,Kf3 and Black gains the Queen: the Bishop is the problem, how to make it inoffensive?
Black leaves there the Rook and traps the Bishop!!! The idea is to sacrifice the rook in order to make inactive the Bishop.
White is too hungry.. <n><n>22.Bxc6, Kxc6 and White loose a piece but it permits to alleviate pression over the king.<n>Now the Black attack can start!
5. Ng3 - Pitroque chooses to retreat his knight and attack the f5 bishop, but would a developing move such as e3 been better?
6. ..... h6 - Janet creates a flight square for her bishop so that it can bear down on the h7-b1 diagonal.
8. Ne5 - not too sure about this - I think white may have again been better served to play Be3, a developing move and to neutralise the power of Janet's light square bishop.
10. Qxd3 - and now the bishops are traded off and the WQ is on a pretty good diagonal.
11. f4 - white wants to support his knight on e5.
15. Rhe1 - giving further support to that steed on e5.
15. .... Nd5 - suddenly, activity in the black camp!
21. ..... Nce3 - drums beat!  In come the black cavalry and white's rook on d1 is en prise.
26. .... Rfd8 - white's attack has run out of steam and not only that, has an 8 point material deficit to contend with against such a strong Master as Janet.  White therefore gracefully resigns on the grounds of Ruinous Loss of Material.  Commiserations and good effort here, Pitroque - you got her worried!  Kind regards - Joanne
Now I have the center with a tempo on his rook.
Three pieces in the center. Black has none.
Why not bring another piece into the attack.
This game is the main claim to fame of both Hamppe and Meitner, and has been reprinted widely. The variation of the Vienna Game it uses was named the Hamppe–Meitner Variation in honour of the two players. The game was played in the 19th-century Romantic style, in which rapid development and attack were considered the most effective way to win, where many gambits and counter-gambits were offered (and not accepting them was considered slightly ungentlemanly), and where material was often held in contempt. These games, with their rapid attacks and counterattacks, are often entertaining to review even if some of the moves would no longer be considered the best by today's standards. In the game, Black sacrifices huge amounts of material to drive the white king to his back rank and attempt to force checkmate, but White spectacularly manages to force a draw by perpetual check.
This is the Vienna Game, an opening which Hamppe made major contributions to, giving his name to two variations in the Vienna Gambit.
Better would be 3.Nf3! d6 4.d4 and White has a slight advantage. The move is premature; although many lines of the Vienna have White trying to obtain the bishop pair with this move, the bishop can still retreat to e7, and the knight is not ideally placed at a4.
The quiet 3...Be7 would be better and less risky, especially since the move played may in fact lead to a win for White with best play. A bishop sacrifice is commonly seen in reply to an early knight attack in various lines, including this one.
The only way to save the e4 pawn. If 5. Kf3 then Qf4 drives the king away from the protection of the e4 pawn.
Black tries to open up the position, in order to get at the wandering white king.
Although 7.Qe1 is usually given as a refutation of this line, with 7...dxe4+? 8.Kc3 e3?! 9.Kb3! Be6+ 10.Ka3 where Black has nothing left, Black need not play 7...dxe4+?, and in fact better is 7...Nf6! (Schiller's move) 8.g3! dxe4+ 9.Kc3 Qg4 10.Bh3 Nd5+ 11.Kb3 Nc6!! (11...Qg6!? is unclear) 12.Bxg4! Na5+ 13.Ka3 Nc4+ 14.Kb3 Na5+ with an equal position. 7. Kc3 is perhaps the best move.
Better for White than this curious king move would be 8.d4!? exd4+ 9.Qxd4!! Qe1+ 10.Bd2! Qxa1 11.Nf3 Qxa2 (an alternative is 11...Nc6!? 12.Qxg7 Be6 13.Nc5! 0-0-0 14.Nxe6 fxe6 15.Qxh8 Qxa2 16.Bg5 where White has a large advantage) 12.Qxg7 Qxa4 13.Qxh8 d4+ 14.Nxd4 Qa5+ 15.Kb3 Qxd2 16.Qxg8+ Ke7 17.Qxc8 Qxd4 18.Bc4! and White has a winning advantage, but must find several very difficult moves.
This move is a crucial mistake, after which Black forces the draw in a breathtaking manner. White can win here more easily than at the previous move with 9.d4! exd4 10.Bxa6 bxa6 11.Nc5 or 9.c3! Bd7 10.Ka3 b5 11.d4 bxa4 12.Bxa6 Qxg2 13.Qf3! Qg6 14.Qxd5 Bc6 15.Bb5.
Black checks.
11.Kb5 still leads to a draw after 11...Ne7!! 12.Qh5! a5 13.Qxe5 Na6 14.Kxa5 Nb8+ 15.Kb4 Nbc6+ with equality.
Black checks.
12.Kc3 has been suggested as a means to avoid the draw, but loses after 12...d4+ 13.Kc4 Be6+!! (13...b6? is unclear) 14.Kxc5 Nf6! (threatening mate in three with 15...Nd7+ 16.Kb5 c6+ 17.Ka4 Nc5# or Nb6#) and White cannot avoid checkmate: 15.Bb5+ Ke7 (threatens 16...Ne4#) 16.Qf3 c6 (threatens 17...Nd7#) 17.Bxc6 Rhc8 (threatens 18...Nd7+ 19.Kb5 bxc6+ 20.Qxc6 and mate in five) 18.Kb6 bxc6 (threatens 19...Nd7+ 20.Kb7 Rab8+! 21.Ka6 Nc5+ 22.Kxa5 Rb5#) 19.Qxf6+ and mate in eight follows. Every move in the game after 12.Kxc5 is forced.
This is a standard response to Nf6.  I'm not afraid to play a Queen's Gambit game if necessary.  In fact, sometimes I prefer it.  I guess it depends upon my mood.
I've studied extensively with the Benoni - learning pawn structure, secrets, and levers.  Some people cannot stand it because of the closed nature of the positions.  You have to know strategy a little better to do well in this opening.<n><n>To continue with the Benoni, play 3. ... e6.
This is a fourth transposition (into the Benko Gambit), and it has only been three moves.  That kind of aggressive manipulation is often attempted by both sides when strong players meet. It's a normal characteristic of the game.<n><n>****<n><n>The main idea here is for Black to sacrifice his a and b pawns to open up the files for his rooks.
It is dangerous to not accept the pawn.  Take it every time in this position.  <n><n>At least that is my advice.  Some authorities claim  4. Nf3 is possible.  I don't buy it.  I've tried it and have been burned big time.  <n><n>****<n><n>Alon Greenfeld Vs. Judit Polgar 1989 (0-1).  Alon played 4. Nf3 instead, and Judit Polgar won.
Offering the second pawn may seem weird in an unfamiliar position, but 4. ... a6 is considered the only real way to safely handle the Benko as Black.
A strong alternative for White would be to play 5. b6 instead.  Such a move avoids the complications that taking the extra pawn creates.  I find that this alternative is unnecessary as long as you are sufficiently familiar with the main line and the subsequent variations from it.  If 5. b6, then Black can choose between Qxb6 or e6.<n><n>****<n><n>It is strongly advised for Black to wait to retake the second pawn after 5. bxa6. For Black, the sacrifice is done to gain position and speed in development.  <n><n>****<n><n>At first glance, Black could retake with his rook on a8, with his knight on b8, his bishop in c8, or with his queen after a tactical finesse (Qa5+ followed by Qxa6).  Experience suggests that the only good retake is with the Bishop.  But like I said before, Black should develop first.  There is no hurry in this position.
Black has already gained tempo for the sacrifice of the pawn.  Apparently pawn positions later in the game tend to favor Black too.  So White must play accurately.  Development is priority. <n><n>Thus 6. Nc3 is sound.  A rare alternative is 6. g3; it is also playable.
Black has open lines for an attack. <n><n>****<n><n>He has the potential for a devastatingly powerful lever with e6 later in the game.  An eventual c4 pawn is golden if Black can safely reach d3 with his Knight.  He can potentially do this with a knight on d7 and moving it through a vacated square on c5. Together these features can be a winning positional strategy for Black.  It's is easier said than done.  White can usually give Black back material to prevent this. However, often greed gets the better of players.  <n><n>****<n><n>These are not the only ideas for Black.  He could move his f6 knight to either b5 or a4 to create a double attack with his fianchettoed bishop at g7 upon the important c3 White knight.  And/or (depending upon circumstances) the b8 knight could move through d7 and maneuver to either b4 or c4 to attack the White b pawn.  If Black can somehow succeed in gaining back the lost material by capturing either the White a or b pawn, then Black should immediately trade down into an endgame.  The likely pawn structure should significantly favor Black.<n><n>****<n><n>Timing is extremely important in the Benko.  If things are coordinated just right, White suddenly finds himself in a positional zugzwang.  No matter what he does, his position continually deteriorates.  <n><n>But if Black does not time his movement properly, then he will be the one in trouble instead.
By trading the bishops, Black has relinquished one of his opening compensations for the pawn.  The light squared Black bishop no longer provides pressure along the a6-f1 diagonal. Yet at the same time, White will likely have weak control over the white squares.  The only way Black can exploit this weakness is through potentially awkward movements with his knights.<n><n>****<n><n>The battle for c4 and subsequent control of d3 will have to be fought by Black's knights or major pieces.  This is likely to lessen the pressure along the a and b files.  This may give White enough wiggle room to at least force a draw and perhaps launch a counter-attack upon Black's King position.
It turns out that Black has made the Bishop exchange for naught.  White is clearly about to catch up with Black in development.
Why not?  An e4-e5 advance is natural. If the Black pawn on c5 is eventually to be taken, then White has to get rid of its support on d6.  Also, an open e file would be advantages for the white rook on e1.  <n><n>****<n><n>Black's main strategy is to capture either the a or b pawns to even the material.
Good move!  This helps support c5 while adding pressure along the open files.  <n><n>But perhaps Qc7 for control of the e5 square was better.
I mentioned before that timing is important in this opening. This move prevents Ng4, where by it would provide extra support to the e5 square. More importantly 13. h3 forces Black to commit to a plan of action.  And the move also helps subdue White's weak white square problem.  <n><n>****<n><n>Black's knight on d7 currently blocks the knight on f6's preferred route of attack.  After e5, Black will not want to take.  If he does both Black's c and e pawns will be very weak.  If he does not take, then the e file is opened up for the White rook.<n><n>****<n><n>It is difficult for White to time things without knowing what Black's plan of action is.  But here it should be obvious that some form of additional pressure along the b file is coming.  13. h3 pretty much forces Black's hand to do so.  This gives White more maneuverability in the center of the board.
This is a breakout move.  White will concentrate upon controlling the center.  The last thing he wants to be is distracted because of the pressure along the a and b files.  Isolating the c pawn is priority.  Those unfamiliar with the position often don't understand this.<n><n>****<n><n>With 14. e5 in this position, the game will likely become at least a draw under best play.
The combination to follow is advantages to White because it gives his rook a lift and adds pressure to the e7 pawn.  This combination subdues two dangers that Black threatened, at the same time - the e6 lever and the potential for a black knight outpost on d3.
Obviously, the rook will soon be forced to move again because of the bishop on g7.
This sets up potential skewers, adds pressure to Black's King, and supports the white knight on c3 so that b3 becomes possible in the future.  This would allow the remaining white Bishop to develop. <n><n>**** <n><n>It should be noted that one of the strategies for White is to eventually play b3 followed by a4 and then take advantage of the outpost of b5 with his knight.  The danger in this plan is that the x-ray attack upon both the c3 knight and the rook on a1 by Black's bishop at g7.  So if White intends to try this, he must coordinate these maneuvers carefully.
This was expected.  Black does not want a potential second break, and he wants to maneuver his knight into a better position while opening up the diagonal for his bishop.  Despite the enormous firepower that Black has on the Queen-side, he still needs additional support from his knight and bishop to launch a successful attack.
This maintains the rook lift and protects important squares along the a and b files.  Over protection allows flexibility in movement of any pieces involved.  More mobility means better chances.
This supports an advance to c4, but it may be time consuming to try to take advantage of an outpost on d3.  Black cannot do everything he wants at the same time.
This makes it difficult for black to maneuver his knight for any real advantage. If the knight moves, then the bishop on f4 supports the advance of the d pawn. <n><n>**** <n><n>Some people would consider this a tactical mistake because in allows Black to gain a pawn.  In reality, the pawn structure is no longer optimal for Black to gain a winning advantage by regaining the pawn.  It is a very subtle finesse. <n><n>**** <n><n>The more usual move is 19. Ne4; but, I wanted to change things up a bit and did not want to necessarily directly exchange pieces, unless it led to a more likely drawn position.
White has enough resources to handle things here, despite the pressure upon c3.  Black has weak points at c5 and e7.  This should be more than enough to compensate for giving back the material.
This combination only gives back a single pawn to Black.  Granted, the taking of the pawn had to be part of Black's strategy; but here, it is not nearly as effective as it is normally thought to be. <n><n>****<n><n>This resulting pawn structure is different than the usual favorable formation for Black in the Benko's Gambit in a couple of crucial ways.  First, Black's c passed pawn is not supported by another pawn.  It is just as isolated as my 'a' pawn.  That makes it vulnerable to attack.  Second, I have an advanced d pawn that can now operate as a crucial lever for White against Black!   The move d6 could easily serve as another break for White.
It is only a drawn out exchange of the minor pieces and rooks.  Black is following the idea that once the recovery of the pawn occurs, then it is time to exchange down into an endgame. He is probably looking for a favorable Queen exchange to seal a fleeting advantage in that phase of the game.
Ironically, fewer pieces on the board makes it more probable that a draw will happen.  The critical point is illustrated by awkward position of the isolated pawns. <n><n>**** <n><n>The last thing White wants to do is exchange the bishop for the knight on d6, while it is on d6.  That would allow the e7 pawn to support the c5 point and then White's d pawn looks weak. As is, it is relatively strong.<n><n>****<n><n>Note that after the exchange, Black has fewer pieces to deal with the center thrust by White's d pawn.  Fewer pieces on the board actually increase the power of this particular pawn.  Black's strategy is going to have to shift to prevent that thrust.  As is, the knight is already doing exactly that.  But this in of itself leaves Black crippled when it comes to continuing a viable attack.
This attacks d pawn and somewhat ties down the white Queen.<n><n>****<n><n>Now that the outpost on d3 is available, I need to prevent its occupation by the knight.  I was looking at an advantages way to exchange my Bishop with the Knight in a more favorable circumstance.   As is, such an exchange would shut-down my advanced lever. <n><n>****<n><n>Since I knew he would eventually move the knight, I had to think well ahead.
This creates a series of threats again while establishing my own outpost on b4.  Notice how the position of the Bishop also prevents an advance by the c pawn. My intention was to manipulate so that my rook could be used for a purpose other than guarding the a2 pawn.
This frees up my rook for other plans of action.
I don't like the x-ray attack on my King.  I need to respond early to this.  It could potentially cause White a great deal of grief later in the game.
Moving to relative safety. This is more of a strategic move than anything else...to respond to a potential tactical threat.
26. h5? I was surprised by this move.  This weakens the g6, g5, and h6 squares.  It could open up a strong attack for White against the Black King.  White's Queen is already along the attacking side of the board near a position to take advantage.  I thought that building an attack upon White's isolated d pawn or supporting the c pawn for potential further advancement would be more productive.<n><n>****<n><n>Computer analysis suggests that 26. ... h6 would be OK.  Frankly, I would not make that move either - although it does make more sense than h5.  26. ... h6 would have created a pawn duo with the g6 pawn and theoretically given Black more options.  But it too would have weakened the g6 square.  <n><n>****<n><n>Making such a move is usually a sign that you cannot think of anything better to do.  In this case, I was thinking about what I might be missing.  After all, id=Chrisobee is a higher rated player than me.
I decide to add pressure to one of Black's weak points...to see what will happen.
He ignores the pressure and creates his own threat of advancing the pawn.  This should have been his previous move, in my humble opinion.  Here, Rd8 might have been more productive because the d pawn is somewhat vulnerable.  Such a weakness in White's position would have been more obvious if my King were still on g2.<n><n>****<n><n>But 27. ... Rc8 was OK.
This stops Black's plan, dead in its tracks!  It also creates more pressure upon the Black King.  I wasn't sure how I could break through on the King-side; but creating strategic threats is often the first step in realizing a tactical plan to do so.
Nb5 only creates a nuisance threat with little actual bite.  But it did limit my available moves for my bishop.  Bb4 was now impossible because of the fork at d4. <n><n>****<n><n>29. a4 might have been an alternative to my next move, but after the exchange on c3 my pawn on d5 would be free to take.  I didn't like the prospect of defending against a pawn advance with my Queen.  Nor did I like the exposure of my f2 weakness while playing defense. Such a combination of moves might suddenly make 26. ... h5 look good.
OK.  I'm pretty safe right now. I need to create additional threats.  Multiple threats at the same time could lead to an advantage. <n><n>****<n><n>My only significant worry is still the d5 pawn.  It is being attacked twice.
This is a complete surprise! He decides to use his f pawn as a lever now that the e6 lever is questionable at best.  30. f6 seriously weakens the g6 square a second time.  It looks like a successful attack upon his king is now possible if I can find it.<n><n>****<n><n>A quick Computer analysis after the game suggests 31. Qe4 fxe5?? 32. Qxg5+ and Black is in deep serious trouble.<n><n>****<n><n>I took my time to study this position and soon realized that after 31. Qe4...Black does not have to take the bishop!!  In fact, by not taking he seems to gain an advantage!  31. Qe4 Kg7 32. Bb2 e6.  And now my Bishop's movement is restricted and my d5 pawn cannot move.  My Queen would be exposed.  33. Qe3 e5!  At the very least, the initiative would have been handed to Black "on a silver platter".  So I didn't play 31. Qe4.  I assumed this was id=Chrisobee's finesse.<n><n>****<n><n>Although 30. ... f6 looked like a good move during the game, further analysis would have revealed that 34. d6 Nd5 35. Qe4 Rc5 36. f4!!

The Winawer, which can get quite sharp and complicated in some main lines...
Forcing either a retreat or an exchange which yields me the bishop pair, but at the cost of a weakened queenside pawn structure and a tempo for development. In this case the exchange is by far the most often played, in the 4...c5 line Black has the option of choosing the sideline 5...cxd4!? 6.axb4 dxc3 and now not 7.bxc3?! but 7.Nf3! with good play for the pawn.
!? A rare line, far more common is 6...c5, striking immediately at white's center. After some research I found out that the idea of this line is probably to play ...Ba6, exchanging White's strong Bishop for the 'French bishop' which is often a problem for Black, but considering the continuation of this game I'm not quite sure if Black was aware of the plan in this opening.
I was out of book, but I decided to continue with what is considered the main line in the normal ...c5 variation and which is the most principled move in the position. According to the DB's this is also the main line here. It strikes at Black's g7 pawn and sets up an attack against the Black kingside.
The most played move in this position, but according to my coach this is a bad place for the knight, because it does nothing except for blocking off the Queen's way to g7. But probably Black can't let go the g7 pawn in this variation, because he doesn't have the quick counterplay like in the main line Winawer. Other moves would not be very good: 7...O-O is just castling into the storm, 7...Nf5 invites 8.Bd3 attacking the knight and threatening to remove the protection of the g7 pawn with 9.Bxf5 exf5, 7...Kf8 takes away Black's castling opportunity so the rook won't get into the game very soon and 7...g6 is just a weakening move. All in all I think this was the best move in the position.
?! A new move, and probably bad. Black should really seek counterplay with ...c5 at some point and this blocks off that option, so Black would need at least one other move to make it possible. Here 8...Ba6 was played 9 times and 8...Qh4 twice, according to the 365chess.com database.
Starting some action on the kingside.
Probably Black tried to relieve the pressure by exchanging queens, but a strong attack is also possible without queens, as is shown in this game...
11...Nf5 puts some more pressure on the center and blocks of the f4-f5 advance. The disadvantage is that it can be chased with g4 at some point, but Fritz gives it as best.
This does not achieve much, the bishop is still as passive as it was on c8. Black should really be looking for some counterplay by now.
?! Allows me to create a huge weakness in the Black camp, which can be exploited immediately afterwards. Far better was 13...exf5 14.Bxf5 Nce7.
! The Black kingside is under huge pressure and White is already winning either the h7 pawn or the e6 pawn.
Probably Black has to defend e6, it seems the most important of the two pawns that were attacked. Still I (and Fritz) think 15...Nd8 was a tad more accurate. That would also allow ...c5 to finally get some counterplay going.
?! My only inaccuracy of the game, according to the computer. I realized just after I made this move that I could have taken on h7. Still this move maintains pressure and adds an extra piece to the attack, so it's not disastrous or anything...
? Somehow Black seems not to realize his h7 pawn is hanging or is thinking he can get enough counterplay for it, but 16...h6 was really the only good move in this position.
! Of course. The rook can't defend both the e7 knight and g7 pawn at once. If 18...Rhg8 had been played, Black had been able to play 19...Rae8 now.
Another tactical blow which also wins the knight on e7 as the rook has to go away. After this Black resigned. I do think Black played below his rating, but nevertheless this was a very pleasing win, especially given my inexperience in this opening. I scored 3.5/8 in the tournament, with 1.5/5 against the 1700+ opposition (which could also have been 3 points) so I was very happy with my performance overall and my play. This was the highest rated opponent that I have ever beaten (excluding a simul in which I beat an IM, see another annotation of mine). Thanks for reading, feel free to leave some comments.
As it was to be expected...
After a long think. If cxd3, I have some chances on b3. Now, B or N to c4?
This impressive center must win...
White's dsb and R are unable to move.
Decisive advantage, but... how to close? I now think that d3 was a must.
...I can't play g5 at once, because of Nf5, and his N is doing something.
I'll lose an exchange by force, so why not to grab this juicy central pawn...
...and now the tactic:
and the WK has the opposition...
for surprise reasons I choose the Pirc
now if Nc3 I have e5 immediately challenging the center
and here it is as expected white keeps in the main lines, so I get to challenge the center with e5
the Ruy Lopez Pirc, in this line the game assumes a structure and development very similar to those occurred on an open game... the Pirc was just a decoy!
Queens off the board and the king in the center wont be hazardous for me...
preparing Be6 by placing the rook on the future semi-open column, and to keep my king on the center of the boards eyeing both wings...
and now here it is the open column, I've managed to equalize right on the opening
eventually heading to g3
prophylaxis in two ways, preventing Ng4 and opening an escape square for the dark squares bishop
leaves d8 to connect rooks while assuming a defensive role for my weakest pawn e6 and increases control of the d column if the rooks are ever to be exchanged
blocks the column in reply to white's threat of doubling the rooks
a6 to follow preventing Nb5 and preparing the b5 push
with my pawns and pieces set I choose to exchange a few more pieces to simplify the game, and try to outplay my opponent due to the space advantage and activity of the remaining pieces
inviting the exchange that allows me to undouble my e pawns
and here it is as planed... the pawns are undoubled... let's try to win this one, Ill keep from pushing e5 for now, leaving an entrance on white's field...
threatening Be3 to win the rook to a skewer..., and white on has one of three moves to save the rook: <n>a) Kb1 of course removes the skewer threat so white can move his rook to d1 (only square for the rook) after Be3...<n>b) Rd1 anticipating Be3, moves the rook to the only safe square<n>c) Nd4 blocking the access to e3, but even this is lost as will be proved latter on...<n><n>any other will lose a quality... even Kd1? removes white's rook only safe square, due to Be3 and the rook will fall next...
forces Nf5+ Rxf5 exf5 Be3 Kd1 Bxd2 Kxd2 Kf6 (the point of Rxf5 to remove the guard) again skewers the rook and wins back the quality
again the skewer theme on the rook appears, this time even more deadly as white's structure is compromised and there are no other pieces to try some counter-play
and the resulting endgame with a pawn up is easily won for black due to the pawn majority on the king's wing...
next after white's Kxa6 I get g5 and after Kxb5 forced to get the king out of the way from white's a pawn I get to play g4
now will be hxg4, and hxg4, and I have the before mentioned two pawns against one on the king's wing with an assured march until promotion and a won Q vs 2 or 3 pawns endgame, this game show the importance of an overall endgame strategy and proceed to convert any positional advantage in a won endgame...
I prefer this to 5.Bc4, because ...e6 severely limits my bishop's effectiveness.  Trading the bishop for his knight is usually not detrimental to white's position.
Simplifying the position.  In most opening positions I prefer my bishops to my knights and so try to avoid exchanging them, but in this particular opening it's not only acceptable, it's preferable to exchange it.
Preparing to aggressively attack the kingside.  White's potential, whether his kingside attack succeeds or not, is more than enough to make up for the exchanged bishop.
His counterattack looks dangerous, and will come faster than mine, but while his will net a long term advantage, he needs to survive to use it!
The beginning of a series of sacs (mostly little pawn ones).  It also opens the bishop's c1-h6 diagonal, which is essential to the attack.
Intensifying the pressure.
A mistake, perhaps even a blunder!  Here I should ignore the threat to knight and simply play Bxg7 and continue my planned attack.  I was feeling a bit more cautious, though, so...
A truly fatal blunder.  His best chance is to play Bh8, when I still come out with a limited advantage.  Here, though, when allowed to exchange the bishops, my attack becomes lethal.
The punch forward to d4 but ...Kd5 leaves an adwanced protected knight threatening Kc7 if the Queen is deployed to early in development.
Realising the danger on c7 trying to develop with threat pinning knight to Queen
Reverse of the spanish opening that started accept or decline the knight capture for the bishop
Creating breathing space for the rook on c8 to prevent the threatend fork from Kc3
Prevents the double attack on the f7 pawn. Over exchange of knights and Queens.
Knight and Queen exchange complete white has the slight advantage of the doubled pawns and weakend kingside defence of black.
Maintaining the threat on the Queenside Rook.
Moves the doubled pawns over toward the centre when facing an attack from rooks and bishop shoring up the defences as a result of white's blunder.
Halts the d pawn's advance and also allows completion of development freeing the bishop.
Not really threatening fxe4 but the threat of f4 throttling the newly liberated bishop's usefulness
Threat of trapping the bishop removed with the exchange and advance beyond the pawn's defensive line.
White's bishop can either retreat and re-enter the trap of capture forcing the king to stay in the centre of the board after capturing for the exchange.
With black's king now unable to castle putting the threat on the 3 file preparing to open it up
Removing the pin and protecting pawn on e5. Also prevents e4 18. dxe4 fx4 19. Rxe4+
Better should have bee c4 to try and close up the game to try and make something out of the material disadvantage rather than allowing an open file as a result of cxd4
The threat was Kb4 to threaten Kxd4 to open up the d file for advance, better would have been a3
Kxc3 25. Rxc3 Rxc1+ is still probably better as the d pawn has advancement potential, however, this still has matching winning threats with an exchange either on c8 or c1 of rooks
Trying to stop the king's side advance but the threat is already coming from the queen's side and it is too late.
After the advance of a5 now creating two pass pawn on the a and b files.
The ongoing advance continues Kc3 allows for the advance and the capture of the rook
The battle to queen was always blacks to win
Today on "I annotate a game" I wanted to start a little series. I have recently been playing around with the Evan's gambit and am trying to learn it properly. As part of this process I thought that I would annotate my games, good or bad, win or lose, and show you my thought process as it evolves. As it turns out this game was a great one to start on as I got a great position and went in for a crushing attack and was better very quickly. Doesn't always work out this way, but this game was nice.
Signifying the Evan's Gambit. The idea behind this attack and many similar opening gambits is to sacrifice a pawn for active counterplay on some part of the board, relying on compensation for the pawn. What is the compensation here? White intends to castle quickly, get the rooks in the middle and somehow keep black's king in the middle to attack. Alternatively there is often a strong attack against the f7 pawn if black castles with the bishop on c8 undeveloped. So white is playing against passive pieces and a slightly airy king. Lets see how this one goes.
The most critical lines of a gambit are ones where the sacrifice is accepted. It is not considered a good idea to take with the knight, and on move 5.. we will explain this further.  Suffice to say if you are going to take, bishop is best. If you wish to decline, Bb6 is fine, and if I play game in that line I'll also annotate to see what we can learn about that position. Enough to say it is also a reasonable alternative.
You might wonder why not Bc5 and the position is very similar to the earlier position on move 3 but white has given up a pawn. Not so. If 5..Bc5 then 6. d4 exd4 7. cxd4 and white has a very strong center and easy development. Black's pieces are awkward and has a lot of problems to overcome. This whole idea is why taking with the knight on the previous move doesn't really work. White still just plays c3 here, and d4 next, with a nice center, easy development and soon will look for a strong attack. 5..Ba5 aims to stop all that because if d4 then the c3 pawn is pinned to the king and can't retake, making that strong center. Which white player would try that.
[?!]Apparently I would. Don't get me wrong, the c pawn is pinned to the king and can't retake. So this is now a three(!) pawn sacrifice if black wants it. The best way to play here would be O-O and only then to play d4. d4 is playable to be sure, but white has give away enough pawns that they now MUST get an attack going or the material advantage will be decisive. Some line like 6. O-O d6 7. d4 and black has many options that don't include giving white the massive center.
Black accepts the gambit'ed pawn again, but gives up the potentially powerful bishop on a5. I think dxc3 is a better try because in this line the rook quickly comes to e1 aiming at the king, but with the bishop on a5 that is not always possible.
White take a bishop that has moved now 4 times in the opening with a piece that has moved once. That is how to get ahead in development...even at the cost of pawns.
Clearly, though the pawn on c3 is probably falling.
With pressure against f7. This move is common to many possible lines in the Evan's gambit, and is an idea to be looking out for.
Developing a piece with tempo.
Seems forced. Qf6 is just like it was the previous move but now white has an extra piece developed. Now maybe black can develop the bishop on c8.
Taking advantage of the pin on the d6 pawn and that the black queen is guarding f7. I was somewhat temped by Re8 here as well, but that just seemed too slow to me. Note that that pawn on c3 has been hanging for a white now but white really cannot afford to take it because it gives black the tempo they need to consolidate.
Of course. Obvious maybe, but powerful. Black must go bad to c6 or lose a piece. Black has 4 pieces that still have not moved from their starting positions and white only has 1. Black really needs very precise play from here even to have a chance of holding. I will note the computer has liked white's position for a number of moves yet but this is the one where it's best variations start giving up material for active piece play, which is normally how I determine that one side is actually properly ahead. Of course white has to play well to take advantage, and nothing is easy, but this is a very nice position.
As I look over this position the computer prefers the other move I was considering. 13. Rfe1. One problem that I have with these positions is that sometimes I overplay the position and do something too quickly. This is not a mistake, as white still has a great advantage, but just continuing to build pressure is often the better way to play. In my opinion knowing when to win back material and when to continue to build pressure in strong positions is one of the hardest skills to learn in chess. Here I went for this because I saw a forcing line where I thought I was winning and wasn't sure if black had counterplay if I waited. So I didn't wait. Fine, but not strictly speaking correct.
If any other move either rook to e1 with check is winning on the spot. If you leave the queen there of course you just take it. Just for example 13.. Qf6 14. Rfe1+ Ke8 (14..Kf8 and mate in 9) 15. Bd5 (another very strong slow play sort of move) and white is breaking through with rook coming to the d-file and the black king without room to move. There are some nice moves white has to find, but it looks very dangerous.
I thought black had to play Be6 to try to hold everything together. I was looking at Nd4 (engine tells me this is better but not winning) or Bd5(engine tells me white is much better) or maybe just taking on e6 and trying to deflect the black queen away and taking on b7 (this is apparently winning, but I hadn't seen the line yet. For your enjoyment: 14..Be6 15. Bxe6 fxe6 16. Bxd6! (the move I hadn't yet seen) Qxd6 17. Qxb7 Rook moves somewhere 18. Qxg7 and white is winning the house. <n><n>Instead black played this and is giving up the queen. I think if black wanted to try this they can probably resign. Perhaps this is a reasonable try though to trade the queen for some breathing space and hope for a blunder by white.
Black should castle here if they want to have a shot to create some fortress.
And dead. I hope this game was as enjoyable for you as it was for me. A little trip down the Evan's gambit. I have some other games in this line I will be showing to you all soon, so if this is a thing you are interested in come and look in a while to see. This one went very well for white and I was winning as soon as move 11, an opening win. Even still I could have played more precisely and I am trying to get a feel of when slowplaying is good and when I need to go in for the kill. Thanks for reading and hopefully we can keep learning together.
54th GK Tournament, round 1. Another player leads our group#90 with 5 wins and a loss - I gave him the loss, but we split 1-1. The only way I move on is to win both of my games against my opponent in this game, in which case I am in a 2-way tie for first place in our group at 5-1.
Black would like to have played 4. ... Nc6 to attack the white queen, but white would reply 5. Bb5, pinning that knight and sparing the queen the indignity of retreat. By playing 4. ... a6 instead, he protects b5 from the white bishop.
Black might have enjoyed Nb4, forking the queen and the c2 pawn, threatening Nxc2 with a fork against white's king and rook. Also, white's bishop might need to run away. Thus my 8th move, solving both concerns.
I am not sure what 8. ... Ng4 accomplishes. The knight threatens nothing. It might move to e5, forking my queen and bishop. Since I would find that irritating, I relocate the bishop to his previously arranged hideout.
Again, black's move perplexes me. 8. ... b5 would have driven off the white bishop and gained a little tempo. But 9. ... b5 does neither. Maybe black plans a home for his bishop on b7. As for white, it's time to drive away the black knight from g4.
Though it's not much of a miscalculation, black may have been better off with 11. ... Nxf3 . As played, 11. ... Nf6 allows white to double up the black pawns on the e-file.
And now I play the classic pin.
I welcomed 13. ... b4 since it invites black's king bishop to come play on my side of the board, where it may be vulnerable (for example, if white can play Qb5  after clearing away the pawn from a6). It also tempts black to avoid Be7 breaking the pin on his knight at f6.
Defends the knight on c3. I wouldn't want black to force me to recapture with my b-pawn if he takes my knight. That would double and isolate my only queenside pawns. It also threatens the overly venturous bishop.
Recapturing as planned, and putting pressure on e5.
I don't know if black just missed the threat on e5, or if he decided to abandon the doubled pawn. It is rather awkward to protect doubled pawns. 16. ... Qd6 17. Rd1 Qb8 would hold the pawn for now, but leave the black queen in a strange and distant place.
This is when my plan formed. Black's king is exposed in the center. A rook on d8 supported by the bishop on g5 would be checkmate. There is the small matter of black's queen and knight - time to drive them off. It's worth noting that there are lots of things black can do to prevent this checkmate. It's risky to make bad moves that might end in a checkmate, especially if your opponent has simple ways to escape the mate. So, if the checkmate you want to play for is not a forced checkmate, then make sure the moves you make along the way are sound moves so that you don't leave yourself worse off for trying for the failed checkmate. First step, chase away black's queen. This move also places a white rook powerfully on the open d-file - always an excellent place for a rook. And it does so with a threat against black's queen, buying white a tempo.
Even better, black wants to trade queens. White is a pawn ahead and welcomes this trade. Another consideration is worth noting. Even though I drove the queen off of d8, she still protects d8. Here is a secret: When any piece moves, it automatically defends the space from which it moved. I know that sounds obvious, but consider the implications. Driving a piece from a square does not automatically mean you control the square. More often, that square is still in contention, as is the case with d8 after black's 18th move. The queen exchange will solve that.
I'm halfway there, but now I need to chase off the knight. 20. e5 would be awesome, except for the fact that black would play 20. ... Rxe5  and my dreams would die unfulfilled. Black is also threatening my bishop on g5 with that same rook. Fortunately, there is one move on the board that solves both concerns. 20. f4! prepares for the advance of 21. e5 and it also defends the white bishop.
Ahh, there it is. I didn't expect to actually succeed in the checkmate. Black could have avoided it many ways. 20. ... 0-0 would have worked, though 21. Bxf6 does more damage to black's pawn structure. 20. ... Nd7 also would have worked with no worries about the pawns. 20. ... h6!? would have been interesting, driving the white bishop off of the h4-d8 diagonal, but at the cost of further exchanges that favor white. Still, while the mate was not expected, the moves leading up to it were all valuable moves that advanced white's game, so had black averted disaster at the end, white would have been in a solid position to go on and win the game. The final position is worthy of study. It arises in many games. The triangle formed by white's bishop and rook and the edge of the board is a common mating theme. All it takes is for a piece to exist where the black pawn at f7 is in this example. The rook and bishop cover all the squares to which the king might flee except the one diagonally away from the rook. Here black's f7 pawn contributes to the mate. This triangular checkmate formation (the diagonal between the bishop and rook form the hypotenuse) comes up surprisingly often. I call it the Bermuda Triangle. I don't know if the chess world has a different name for it. Recognizing the formation is a good way to find the checkmates and use them against your opponents, or avoid them when your opponent wants to use them against you.
Most players would usually play e5 for black, this move, e6, blocks in his bishop on c8 unless he wants to play: b6, and then: Bb7.
I push up my pawn, momentarily exposing his rook to a threat.
He pushes up his pawn. Most people do this on the other side, with: e5 d6.
I open up my bishop early.
I push up my pawn, threatening his and being protected by my pawn and bishop both. I knew he would play d4.
I threaten his pawn, and if he takes I will be able to open up my knight.
Awww! He threatens my bishop, forcing me to retreat, and protects his pawn on d4!
I push up my knight, and I am now in a castling position.
He threatens my rook, and he will receive the free pawn after I retreat with my rook.
Now I'm not in a great position. There's my knight to worry about, and there's his queen to worry about.
And he traps his bishop!
I threaten his lonely bishop on c8.
Opens up bishop early.
The only way to stop it.
Checks the king with the queen, now the knight is vulnerable.
Threatens the knight, as it is pinned to the king by the bishop.
I am plus one and am about to get checkmate.
I check the king again, being protected by my bishop. Now, mate in one.
Moves to the only possible square and…
? Why has he lined his Queen up with my bishop?
?? This is costing him. There is actually a tactic to win an exchange here. It's really funny, because my older bro (he has won the British Title 3 times in a row!) didn't spot this whereas I did. Can you spot it?
! The next move. This forks the king and queen so he has to take.
!! The winning move. While the pawn on d6 attacks the rook on e7, My lsb is attacking his rook on a8.
! applying more pressure to the back rank.
and he resigned due to the double threat of Qh8# and taking on c6.
I decided to go an exchange leaving behind the book
an exchange was committed
the king was forced  to evacuate
I dont want to capture b7 because of the rook pin, and a penetration to my queenside!
looking up for safety, I need to prepare for the e file exchange
3. ....................... Bc5 - an unusual response to the Ruy Lopez.  This could lead to a variation called the Benelux which is rather sharp.
15. Qd1 - black decided to exchange on f3 - I was pleased with that because as I am a piece up I will need to exchange pieces to simplify to a won ending.  This queen retreat drives back the black knight.
17. Nd5 - making use of an outpost on d5 - d5 is a really good square for a knight according to Kasparov as it controls many central squares.
20. Bc3 - black makes a further error on move 17 by playing his pawn up to a5 - this allowed me to win this pawn by a bishop fork on b6.  Black could have the beginnings of a mating attack on my kingside position so I cannot afford to be complacent here.
22. Qg3 - again I take nearly 2 days to make this decision.  The queen exchange is forced.  If the queen retreats then an exchange-winning knight fork will come on f6 as the g7 pawn is pinned.  This will allow black to win his pawn back and my kingside pawn structure will be slightly compromised but as I am still a piece up this exchange is desirable.
24. Rfe1 - contesting the e file.  Black must either back off his rook or exchange on e1.  If he exchanges on e1, that suits me down to the ground.  If he does not then I can perhaps force an exchange of knights due to a pin down the e file.
25. .......... g6 - decides to back up his h pawn but I find another way to win material - the d pawn must now fall after I move my rook to d1.
27. Rxe8 !! As black has only 1 legal move, Kh7, he can either resign or allow mate next move.  I set up 28. Rh8# as a conditional move, look at my watch and decide that it is now time for me to go to the work's canteen for lunch and then take a short walk outside as it was a lovely sunny day.  As my opponent was still on-line I knew that I would come back to my desk and receive a gameknot message telling me that I have delivered mate or at the very least received a white flag!  When I returned to my desk Gameknot sent me this message "Game Won (Checkmate), Congratulations!  I then went and did some filing in excellent spirits knowing that my rating was within 4 points of my highest provisional rating, 1695.  My current rating to date is 1691 and I have scored 20.5 points out of 32 games from my 3 mini-tournaments put together.  Nice.
Wanting to play Bg7 and then castle.
Opens up the bishop, this move usually blocks in the black squared bishop, but because the bishop is at g7, this move is fine.
Blocks the threat and threteans the bishop.
Threatening the queen and bishop unless the swap is excepted.
Blunder. I get a bishop for a pawn.

And another free pawn.
Doesn't take the rook, and now my bishop is pinned to my queen.
I decide to play the mirror match up. I was thinking about e5 to go into some sort of reversed Sicilian, but didn't feel confident in it.
I raise a question mark behind this move. Yes it's probably main theory in the English ( I haven't checked yet ), but it feels so meek. I suppose this is because I myself play the queen gambit which of course starts with d4 and thus I'm not accustomed to the entire d3 idea.
Explosive! This move isn't necessarily the best move, but I decided that I didn't want to allow my opponent to be in his comfort zone any longer so i tried breaking open the center. I looked at cxd5 Nxd5 Nxd5 Qxd5 but couldn't find any move dangerous moves after that.
This move is just a plain mistake if you ask me. Not only are you blocking the good diagonal of White's light squared bishop, giving it less scope but you also make d3 a target in the future.Yes you get a little center control due to it, but I don't consider it adequate compensation.
I was pondering on retreating to d7 or d6, but I didn't want to obstruct my bishop and if Qd6 is played then he gets Bf4 with tempo which I didn't want to allow so I opt for retreating to d8.
Another questionable move in my opinion, not because it's bad but because there are better alternatives. The idea behind Rb1 is simple. My bishop on g7 is attacking the pawn on b2 and as a result his dark squared bishop can't develop, so he plays Rb1 so he can develop it in the future. That being said Qc2 accomplished the exact same thing, but also threatens the c5 pawn and develops his queen so I don't understand why he didn't just play Qc2.
This move ensures I win a pawn since it attacks both a2 and d3 which got weakened as a result of the previous e4 move and he can't defend both. That being said I do still need to be careful when I win a pawn since the knight can become a a subject to pins/skewers and whatnot if it for example were to take on d3.
Questioning my pawn on c5 and preventing Nxa2 due to Bxc5 which gets my knight in awkward position where it has trouble with retreating.
After a long think I end up playing the obvious b6 move. I was thinking whether or not I could get away with for example Nxd3 but for some reason I didn't end up playing it. Maybe because I was scared of moves like Qc2 Nb4 Rfd1 but looking back to it, it isn't much to fear. The idea behind b6 is to not only protect c5 and a a result make his dark squared bishop less valuable, but also to play Ba6 if he would play d4. Example: 13. d4 Ba6 14. Re1 Nd3 15. Rf1 Nxb2 16. Re1 Nd3. It doesn't win a lot of material for Black, but it's something White will have to be wary of for quite some time.
Not a big fan of this move, but it's understandable why he played it. He wants to avoid Nxd3 by defending it as it would give up the little center control he had. That being said, a knight on e1 isn't a lot to be scared of.
After a long time of thinking I capture on a2. I was calculating stuff along the lines of 13. Ne1 Nxa2 14. e5 Rb8 15. Qa4 Nb4 16. Qxa7 but found that it isn't really an issue. The White queen isn't helping in his defense over there and I'll be able to win the pawn on e5.
This might be an inaccuracy on my part and I wonder if Ba6 isn't better. The reason being because it blocks of the escape of the White queen and maybe it'll be possible in the future to win the queen. The queen would have nowhere to run after Ba6. Bf5 is played to target the weak d3 pawn which is logical enough I suppose.
A move that emphasizes the situation White is in in my opinion. He needs to make these type of moves since, if he waits I'll capture the d-pawn, then win the e-pawn, trade everything off and you're suddenly down in an endgame with 2 pawns down. Even if it means trading off, White's strong bishop, he cant' just turtle up and do nothing.
Targeting the rook on f1, however I think this is a mistake. Not only was Bxe4 probably better, but maybe I could have just played Nxd3 here. I didn't go for it since I was a little scared off creating a weakness on the g-file, but looking back on it this isn't that big of a deal considering the limited amount of pieces White would have left. I also would be up 2 pawns, meaning an easy endgame.
Defending the rook by blocking the diagonal. His knight wasn't that strong on e1 so he might as well trade it for my strong bishop. I realised Bh3 was a mistake shortly after I made the move.
I probably would have played Bxg2 to avoid f5 being played with tempo, but this is fine too. I understand that he wants to keep his central presence as it's one of the few things White has going for him.
Finally capturing the material I could have ( and probably should have ) captured long ago. I was a little hesitant as I was expecting f4 to follow, but my plan for f4 was just to play Bg7 once more.
Preparing for the d4push and avoiding the loss of the d3 pawn.
Opening the position. The plan I had in mind was 20. Rfd1 f5 21. Bf3 f4 22. gxf4 Bxf4 23. Bxf4 Rxg4 and suddenly my rook is active. I'll play e6 or e5 in the future and get my queen involved to try for a mating attack.
After a long think he retreats to f3. Perhaps he was trying to convince himself of Bb7, but it's far less threatening there then it actually looks so Bf3 is correct in my opinion.
After another long think he pulls out Bd2 with the plan of trading my knight for his bishop and creating doubled pawns on the c-file. which are very easy to target.
The plan is simple. Get my knight to d4, trade with his light squared bishop and open up his king to the f-file so fxg3 comes with tempo. That being said I'm not sure why I didn't just play Nxd3. The pin isn't that scary with the bishop blocking the d-file. I suppose I got so focused on my plan that I forgot to search for alternatives which are clearly better.
The dreaded move where I lose a knight. Of course you can argue that Black already has compensation for his knight in the form of the pawns he won earlier, but it still was a hefty blow to my morale.
Stunning his previously bright face in a look of horror as he mutters something I couldn't hear to himself. ( I assume he muttered something along the lines off, "that lucky son of a ..." ).<n><n>The problem with Rxf3 for White is that he can't really ignore it. If you decide to ignore it with for example bxc5 then Rxf2 follow and my queen will eventually enter the fray via Qd4. As if that isn't bad enough the pawn on the 3th rank can potentially promote if he isn't careful. And even if he finds some way out, he's 2 pawn down like before he captured my knight. Therefore it's really hard to resist the temptation of taking the rook. Capture the rook and pray that you can flee somewhere like for example, get all the way to the c1 square? Or ignore the rook and go into a lost endgame? None of the options seem appealing, he chooses the former.
There's 2 ways of approaching this for Black. Either Qd5+ or Qf8+. I'm pretty sure both of 'em are good, but I wanted to prevent the White king to abuse the e-file so I chose the latter.
Going to e2 gets met with Qxf2+ mate. Going to g2 gets met by the same move after which Kh1 Qxh2/ is checkmate. Going to g4 gets met with Qf5+ After which Kh4 is forced. After that you play Qh5+ which is also checkmate. Ke3 gets met with Qf4+ after which the Qe2 is forced and then you get the same checkmate as if he were to go to e2 immediately. By process of elimination the only safe square for White's king is e4.
The only place to give check while limiting his options to just 1 square. Qe3 gets met with Qf4 leading to a checkmate explained earlier so e5 is his only square.
Opting to move my bishop as far away as possible from the enemy king. Let's say I put my bishop on b2 instead, then things can get fishy if he gets his king on b3. Bg7 was also a possibility. ( Note that Bf6 isn't a possibility since my queen will go to the f6 square somewhere in the future. ) At this point of the game I have about 9 minutes left to figure out a winning variation.
Moving his king to b5 would have meant I'd play c4 with discovered check. ( not cxb4 as his pawn on b4 is more of a hindrance for him then a strength ). after which he can play a5 that gets met by Ra8#. Moving to a6 instead of a5 gets met by moves like Qe6+ and if I get my queen on c6, then it's fair to say that White's king is dead. If he were to go try and escape via b5 then I'd play c4 again and White's king it in for a bad time, checkmate is unavoidable in that position. Kxb6 is the most prolonging move.
Putting the king in check once again. Going 30.Kb5 means I plays Qc6+. After he moves to c4 I play bxc4+ which is a discovered check. If he plays Kb3 I plays Qxc2+ which is checkmate with Ra8 after he flees to a3. Kb7 gets met by Qc6 which is also a forced checkmate. 31.Ka7 gets met with 31. Rc7+ 32.Kb8 Qb6+ 33. Ka8 Ra7#. 6 seconds left on my clock as I try my hardest to think of a forced mate if he moves to a5. I press the clock and my time goes back to 36 seconds. I haven't found a plan for a5 yet, but know I can come up with something given that I create a minute for me to work with. It helps enormously that the next few moves are rather obvious.
Limiting him back to b5. I need to get rid of my own c-pawn in order to win his queen, though I can't help but wonder if there's a forced mate here.
I decide to just win material. After a short think I couldn't find an immediately forcing checkmate.  Having a queen for his rook in an endgame should be easy enough to win.
And with this the game ends. It was a close one, closer then I dare to admit. I'm really happy that I found Rxf3 over the board. All the moves before that, however were questionable at times. The tournament is almost nearing the end. I just need to play one more game against someone with a similar rating. After having hard matchups every round it seems they've finally taking mercy on me and let me play similar rated opponents.
The Scandinavian. I'm not totally disappointed of it, in its new version if (!?) Icelandic Gambit.
Good. My queen's threats on e5 are not to be undervaluated. No hurry now to hunt the queen, that has its safe square already in mind: a5 and (after c6), Qc7. White will occupy the center in the meanwhile, but black is still solid and has an easy developement (Bf5 and Nd7. The bishop is to be exchanged, mainly.
I can delay my c6 plan a move, thanks to the missing white knight. Now I threat Qe4+ and Qxc2 (Nd4, QxQ etc.).
The spare tempo that helps black to catch up somewhat in developement. <n>I had to decide here if e6 or e5. Both are possible, and it is not clear to me which is better. The decision has to be made in a number of similar position, so it is not easy to address. c5 is aggressive, but also blocks black's own pieces from an useful square and diagonal. e6 is more solid, and goes for a quiet game. Slighlty too defensive for my taste, but hey, I'm playing black against a 1900+ so...<n>Besides, in both lines, the idea is to resist to Nh4 with Bg6, that is, accepting to have it exchanged to absorb the force of the white's attack and opening an useful semiopen h column.
Ok, that does look threatening, but still it is hard for white to break in. If d4, e4. And the other pawn able to break the black center is the f one. If it moves, white's king gets somewhat exposed. And black is castling-minus-two only, so white must hurry if he wants to attack. This is a good start. <n>Now black: on the agenda is Bc5. Or Bd6, if the point to be attacked will be h2. This will happen after white's exchange of the knight for my lsb. So it is better for me to wait white's intention and release the dsb's developement a little, while I have useful moves like...
I doubt that in the previous move I could have tried to provoke white's knight manouver with e4, but then I said: "Why lose a tempo, if I can get it for free?" White is going right into it. The best thing I can do is to develop. If c4 (white seems not in a hurry to play it, but you must be aware all the time: the escape route forthe queen is still safe and open? Now it is, for sure, but after 9. c4, which will be the proper place for her? a5, d6 or e6?)
This brings a rook on a vital column. White's queen has not it easy to move if white insist in not playing c4.
Well, this is known. You know, I don't have to worry because of Bxa2, because after b6, I win it for two pawns. My king gets exposed, but white has not it easy to get serious attack (?). Anyway. The right thing to do is to take advantage of this move to complete my developement.
The natural Nc4, that avoids white's exchange, and keeps my dsb, looks attractive, but in fact I kind of "lose a tempo" for developement. And I sensed that in this position, developement is first black's need. White is almost forced to accept the exchange, unless he wants to release all the tension with d4 (but a good player won't retreat of his earlier decision so easily). <n>The alternative is Be7, avoiding the "Knight manouvre" against my lsb. But in fact I am not disgusted if white plays it, so why take a dangerous way with Bd7, Bxa2? <n>Ah. Kb8, to defend a7... is a passive move. Not the required one if black wants to survive.
Ok, a mistake. Maybe. But think. I prefer to have a pawn in e6 that a freeway to the white rook. Since I can actually handle e4 (can you see it? Am I right?), is a good moment to play it. The attack on f2 was only a dream, so better to forget it. I have in mind to keep control of the game, and this accomplishes that purpose. If white goes 12. NxBf5 instead, black must think hard about Bxf2+, and if 13. KxB, maybe something can be done starting with e4. This is for homework... :-)
This is probably the best way to handle Bg4 by white. If I go Be6, White would press me with Bg4, and I can't exchange (After QxB+, I think white has better game because of Bf3), This way, white will go Bg4, and if the knight leaves, black can play f5. In the meanwhile, black has in the agenda Kb8, to unpin the knight, and white can't do much about it (Is this true or false?)
Trying to provoke d4. After the exchanges, I have a fair game. Useless Qb5. I don't want to take this pawn with my queen even if for free.
Unpinning the pawn. I love white's king in that corner... :-O). Now: how to continue the attack? f5 looks good, but... what's the point? f4, maybe? Does it look good? And, during the game, I wasn't able to focus on the Qb4 move. It was not to threat b2, but because if white goes for NxB, hxN opens the column, and if I could get my queen to h4... but I can't. White does have defence against it... isn't it? So I played
This doesn't go right to Ne4, taking advance of the pin on the queen, but the pin is an element to be taken into account constantly by both sides. I don't say it is the best move. If white goes Bg4+ now, NxB, QxB is safe enough for me (?)
Now. I can think about things like e4, d4, exB!?, dxQ, f3xb2+, Kxb2, RxQ, RxR (either) and Ng4 goes on with the initiative, if not the attack.
White wants to block the advance of my pawn. Nc3 is good. But e4 is so appetizing, that I tried to figure if I could sac the knight in order to do it.
Interestingly, white offers an exchange sac (Ne3, NxR). I was unable to see if was safe, but I doubted it. Anyway, exN is good for me, so...
Now, it was very risky Rxh3+, Rxh3+, but again it is deadly if exN. That's very nice, but how to proceed? Get the exchange sac? White can play like this because he is playing good or not? Anyway,
The queen can come in with Qe6. I was looking for Nxh3.
Foreseeing that after the exchanges, my queen has free way to h6.
So white has conquered the defence of h3. Not a good result, and I think my attack vanishes. Bg4+ was to be avoided, since it allowed white to defend h3.
No matter if Qxa7. The last sparks of my vanished attack.
Wiser was gxh5, but I wanted to keep the pressure on h, just in case.
I have to exchange the pawn, my rook cannot keep trapped like that.
Now my game is to push the a pawn. I better have the king around it - it won't get on time on the kingside.
Rb2+, Kc3, and white loses a pawn. Still winning, but in the meanwhile, black can make the a pawn run a little.
A free tempo?
Another tempo gift. But a2, Ra1, Ra8, and the white pawns win.
I have no time to put my rook on the c column to get a free promotion.
Rxc3 and black is technically dead, or not?
but the other pawn will get it. He is waiting the last moment to exchange the rook.
Pin on bishop
! this is effective repositioning of the knight; will force black to exchange his main defender of the kings side
Defending and reenforcing pawn chain
! As well preventing e6 Queen now has access to H file
He surrendered at this point. I was a bit worried at parts in the game, but I managed to turn it around. Had he continued, I think it would've gone Ke7-f7, Bb4-d2, Rh6-g6, Qc8-f8 for checkmate. Moving the rook in that chain would be non-ideal but it would be logical considering how my opponent plays.
forgets to take out his bishop, big error
Baker sometimes experiments with gambits like f4 and d4. I wouldn't touch those positions and prefer to stay away from them. I like slower positions that arise from Nf3 Nf6 play.
Classic Baker move, to open the centre IMMEDIATELY
Black's better options were probably Bg4 or Nd7. Opening the center when you're behind in development is asking to get abused, like my friend did to this guy
Rather than wasting time recapturing, Baker brings out his forces immediately and doesn't give a damn about the pawn
Baker considered castling instead, and giving Black the chance to play cxb2 winning another pawn, but he said that by simply capturing with the knight, he already has more than enough compensation for the pawn, even if it doesn't look like much now.
Black was too worried about Ng5, that he made this totally losing mistake. Nc6 was much better, since after Ng5, Black just plays Ne5.<n>Be7 also stops Ng5, but it allows Qb3!! and Black is lost.<n>Why is h6 so bad? This weakens the g6 square, and the only other piece left defending g6 is the f-pawn, so........
Baker removes the only defender of g6 to capitalize on that weakness, even if he has to sacrifice a piece while doing it.
Now it may look like Black is up a bishop for nothing, and the g6 weakness seems insignificant.
Now suddenly, Black's king must find an escape square, and Baker has many tactics revolving around g6. <n>Like if Ke8, then Qh5  will mate Black. <n>If Ke7 then Ng6  wins back a rook leaving Baker up the exchange. Neither tactic would work if g6 was guarded.
Black is forced to go deeper into White's territory, but must watch out for 8...Ke6 9.Qd5  Ke7 10.Qf7#.<n>And 8...Ke6 Qd5  Kf6 Qf7  Kxe5 f4  Kd4 Qd5# is also mate, so Black's eighth move is the only one that isn't immediately losing. Although Baker was still totally winning after Black blundered h6????
Although Black is now up an entire knight plus an entire bishop, his material advantage is insignificant due to the fact that none of his pieces are developed.<n>Except his king!
Baker was threatening f4  Kd4 Qd5#, so Nf6 blocks d5 from mate.<n>Black could also try to escape with 10...d5 (intending Kd6), but Baker has Bf4  Kd4 O-O-O  Kc4 then Rxd5 totally wins since White's threatening Black's queen, and also threatening Rd4   Kxd4 Qd5#.
If Kd3, then Baker castles which threatens Rd1  Kc2 Rd2# and Black would have to take the pawn anyway to avoid the threat.
Now White still has a direct mating threat of Ng3  Kd3 Rd1  Kc2 Qb3# Baker just needed to get his rook in the game.<n>How can Black defend? If 13...Kf5 then Baker has mate in 7 (Ng3  Kg4 Qg6  Kh4 Nf5  Bxf5 g3  Kh3 Qxf5  Ng4 Qh5  Qh4 Qxh4#) although I'm not sure if the guy saw that.
Black's only chance to escape is to try and create escape holes.
Black realizes he can't escape through the centre, and tries to run like hell, consequently losing to the mate in 7 Baker planned earlier.
Not very good, my first mistake here. I didn't checked the possibility that the knight could capture the pawn. I was expecting dxe5 and force a early queen exchange. But even that was a bad play because the knight in f6 and the c4 pawn would be under attack.
I was expecting the b5 advance and protect the check with a knight, so I tried to gain some strength in the center and eventually put some pressure on the white king.
Now here comes the attack!
Although my knight became pinned my rook gain some mobility.
That was not a strong play... the pawn in e3 is in a dangerous position a exf2+ puts the king in check. White b6 pawn although under attack and seemingly unprotected was not in danger.
A glimpse of hope. The rook controls the b line and make way to Bb7+ putting the bishop in c4 unprotected, and allowing black to castle.
Now the knight is pinned and unprotected.
White is losing by one bishop and the king is out in the open.
With this "strange" move I was hoping that my opponent made a mistake. And if that didn't happen my interest now was exchanging some pieces and going to end game with and knight advantage.
Not a good move again, the knight is now freed so Rxe4 would have been better. Although it would lead to 21. Rxe4 Qxe4+ 22.Kxe4 Ba4 pinning the white queen with the bishop.
I enjoyed this game because of the great comeback and it also taught me to stay away from the queen gambit. A thanks to my opponent for this thrilling game.
another attack and another defensive move
Like the idea of my knight on this square
Am considering a bishop sac, but it isn't really on yet
This move looks counter intuitive as it blocks the bishop, but it is going to force black back, and allow white to gain some time
This is not the strongest of moves, and provides an opening to exploit
To trap the e rook
seriously weakening the black king
Both kings are unsafe and there is a big struggle in the center. I hoped white would be greedy enough to play 20. Qxe4
Well plaid. If 20. Qxe4 Re8 and the queen has to live the e file, allowing 21. ... Re1+ with mate to follow
To drive the bishop off and protect the king's guards.
Menacing the queen and white has to pay attention to 23. ... Re2 with mating menace
Good move, preventing both threats and creating one on f7
to eliminate the mating threat on f7. Black's plan is to force white to trade rook and queen to have a game end with rook and bishop against bishop pair.
Blunder... The game is lost for black. It was suppose to enable 26. ... Re7 but it enabled white to play Bf5 and trap the black queen.<n>I think that the correct move was 25. ...Qe6.
Trading a queen against rook and bishop.
White threatens to win material: Nb5xc7<n>Alternative variation: 8. Be3 e6 ; which is supposed to be better, however my aim is e6 after d5 and a kingside attack, so Be3 was not really on my mind.
Alternative variation: 11... Rf7 12. Nfd4 <n>Time to remove the leningrad bishop and take away a very important piece of this structure
Alternative variation: 12. Nfd4 Nf6 13. Nxg7 Kxg7 14. Ne6+ Kg8 15. Re1 $18<n><n>The Kingside attack starts!
Alternative variation: 13... Kg8  [and Black can hope to survive]
Alternative variation: 16... e5 17. Qh4 Qe7 18. f3 <n><n>Black tries to break out
Deflection: f5<n><n>My idea at this point was to play e4 and maybe follow up with f4 and e5
Again the target is the weak e6 square
?? <n>Alternative variation: 19... Rd8 [there is nothing better in the position]<n><n>This ruins black completely, it will open up the file for my queen and all hell can start to break loose.
Alternative variation: 20... Rf8 [hardly improves anything] 21. exf5 Qe8 22. Ne6 Bxe6 23. Qxe6+ Qf7 24. fxg6 hxg6 25. Rae1 <n><n>It's the end of the 20th turn and neither blacks knight nor blacks bishop are really developed, the rook on the a file is completely useless, whereas white just has to play f3 and it will have total domination on the f file
Probably dubious. Right now all I had was a vague idea of trying to open up lines along the kingside.
fight is all around e4. white can't keep black from posting a N here, but can definately exchange to reduce pressure
I think white could have done better here. The idea behind f5 is to give black problems with his center. Although I think the idea is right, it's implementation should have waited for a little. The reason i say this is that 15.f5 leaves white's queen bottled in for a few moves after 17.Bxe3. That gives black time to choose a plan of action at will. However, considering that black has not yet castled, and already has a weak looking K-side, white should try to make things more complicated for black over the next few moves, and I think the way to do that would be to keep the Q more active, and then play f4. For example, 15.Qc2 or Qd3 look to be promising. After 15..Bxc3 16.Qxc3 Ne4 17.Qb4 b6 18.f5 the position is the same as it would be after 17.Bxc3 in this game, with the important differences that black: has 'holes' in his Q-side, cannot play Qg5 (or any other attacking move), cannot safely castle on either side of the board. Additionally, white's Q is better on b4 than it would be on c2.
Attacks white's backward pawn, and brings in the Q to the side of the board where white's king is. I think this would be one of the problems with an advance of the f-pawn in the opening - a weak center pawn.
Interesting. White could also have played Rae1 or Rf3. I haven't looked deep into this, but Rf3 seems to have the advantage of the R being protected, and it also allows the R to move along the 3rd rank without fear for the e-pawn.
!? allows interesting attacks for both sides. I could have kept the K in the center, but that wouldn't have allowed me to push forward on the K-side. Since white seems to have a inactive Q at the moment, and more pawn-problems than I, it seemed that it would be a good idea to send the K off to the other side of the board, and march forward on this side. But now white can press on with the pawns on the Q-side. All seems like a matter of who's attack is more fast and more sure.
Threatening cxd5 with mate on c7. More importantly, bringing the B to life.
I was expecting 21.cxd5 instead. That would have opened up the c file, and the Q would have been able to exert influence, maybe the a1 R could also join in the fun. After 21.cxd5 b6 the bishop isn't lost for nothing, because of the very nice continuation: 22.Bxb6 axb6 23.Qc6! Rd6 (otherwise Qa8  ) 24.Rc1 Qe7 25.Rxf5 and black is helpless (for example the threat of Re5).
To prevent the threat of c6 followed by cxb7 and the opening of the c-file putting black's K in danger.
Moving on with the plan of marching the pawns forward. I still think that it would have been better for white to somehow open the c-file. The Q is so powerless in the current situation. Alternatively if white had brought it forward as suggested in my comments on 15.f5, prospects would have been brighter.
My turn to march a pawn! Aim is obvious; since white is posing no serious imminent threats on the Q-side, I will now try to weaken the position around white's K with my pawn, and then bring in my heavy pieces.
Too slow! Achieves absolutely nothing! White will not even have time to get his pawns out of the way for the R to be able to do anything
Pinning the R. Only move which doesn't loose material is Re1 (or b2) - to protect the queen. After f5 by black, and a subseuqnet exchange of Qs, black should be able to spoil white's central pawn chain with b6, and push his connected K-side pawns. It is a bit unclear, but I think black would definately be better.
?? decisive mistake. Perhaps white thought that he was now threating mate on the back rank and also attacking black's queen. However he missed the simple continuation which black went on to play.
the only moves for white are Kh1 or Kf1. In either case black may play Ng3, forcing white to take the N, leaving black at the liberty to then play Qxb1. Black's advantage is now almost certainly winning.
Black immediately launches his pawn attack.
Black becomes greedy, oblivious of the danger posed by the light-squared bishop. 18. ... Bxd3 was in order.
The computer prefers Qxd2 instead, maybe because it likes the knight on c3.
The Houdini chess engine thinks that d6 is preferable.  I can only assume that it wants to keep its options open as to play b6 or not.
This move is consistent with Black's plan.  The computer thinks that 13. .... e5 is minuscule better.
White could have played 14. Nfd2 and now if 14. ... Nxd2  15. Nxd2 brings the other knight back to a more useful square of d2.  If instead  14. ... f5, then 15. Bf3 is fine for white an allows him to try to exploit the pin.
Again this is consistent with Black's plan, but the computer slightly prefers 17. ... Qe8 so that if 18. Qa2 and 19. Qa7, black can play 19. ... Qa8.
Hi everyone.  This is the first of two losses against chesstico.  In both of these I think my endgame technique was found lacking.  The purpose of the annotations is to ask the question: how?  So I may skip a bit of the earlier stages.
Black seizes the opposition.  Now who has the more pawn moves to either keep it or snatch it away?
I think I should have tried to prevent this, if at all possible.  So perhaps I should have tried for f4 and e5 before advancing my a-pawn but I don't think I could actually have prevented it after 30.... Kd6
I couldn't just let Black take on f4, so I had to either take on e5 or g5 or advance to f5.  I think that would have lead straight to a draw.  Taking on e5 would have left the smae configuration as taking on g5.
Again, I don't think it would have made any difference which pawn I moved: 37. h4 gxh4 38. gxh4 h5 and White's K has to cede ground to Black's K: 39. Ke3 Kb4 wins the a-pawn.  39. Kb3 Kd4 wins the e-pawn.  This seems to confirm that 33. Kc3 was the losing move.
Defending his e pawn, opening for the bishop.
Theres no rush to castle and I like bringing the knights out early..
The calm before the storm...
The warzone is now open for battle!
Threatening mate at e7 and bishop is pinned by my rook!
Only the queen can save the game. Hoping for an exchange but why would I want to stop now?!
And there you have it! Black resigns as although I'm only 2+ in material so far, the outcome is in my favour due to positioning and inevitable gain for me. I really enjoyed this game thankyou branneke ( I like your puzzles too!). To everyone else I hope you enjoyed the game as much as I did!!<n>Cheers,<n>Bianca
The expected standard move on the Caro-Kann.
The move most natural to Caro-Kann.
Pressure. To make a good move. d5 is protected. The developed white knight is in a line of fire from a fianchetto I can create.
Attack and pressure on the white queen to do something like taking the pawn.
He uses the king's bishop instead. Now for the e6.
White has the same feeling to get out another piece. Was that the right place to put the developing bishop?
Evacuating my own other bishop. Didn't want to block the Queen's line of fire. I also wanted to get the capability of doing a disclosed attack on white's f3 knight or g2 square with or without that pawn being there.
NCO-13 comments: ...a safe system, avoiding the complications of the open variations. White gains an initiative against imprecise play, but otherwise has few prospects for advantage.<n><n>Since I am looking to tip the scales of advantage in my direction, I simply try to be precise and look for the advantage for me.
White left the NCO-13 opening book at this point. Probably a benefit for me in looking for the first tipping point advantage.<n><n>I would rather be closer to castling, and maybe not have the queen off the back rank yet. BUT, I'll take the possibility of advantage.
Is this a gain of tempo for black, forcing his knight back?
I found a place to increase my aggression here.<n><n>By now, I think we are well pass the first tipping point with not much tip.
Perhaps a tempo gain for black. He decides to hunker down.
Begins a combination to gain a point.
Here black has an eye on gaining significant material advantage by setting up an attach on white's rook. Notice the possibility of a fork of his rook and king next move.
and
One of the most aggresive responses. The only move to save my bishop is...
Good. This contests my center, and set d4 as a resource.
I want to keep the black diagonal free for my bishop.
Where is he going to retire the knight? Nxe6, g3, to close the king's movements, no matter the material loss. I lose a pawn, true.
BxB, QxB, Nxe5, Qe2 was not good for black. If white goes BxB, I'm in trouble.
Recovering the piece, but in an inferior position, but for Qxb2, winning the rook. Now, white won't be standing still in the meanwhile.
Only way to escape pepetual or losing material. Probably, the "exchange" would have favoured me, but it seemed to lead to drawn.
Black is being careful to avoid giving white a strong game with f2-f4.
White ensures that the board stays open for his Bishops.
Having allowed Black to take a strong central presence, White now seeks to tear it down.
? Not as strong as it looks. It appears at a glance that Black has guarded against White's threats and safely escaped the pin, but this actually does lose a pawn: 9.Bxf6 gxf6 10.Nxd4! where Black cannot take the Bishop after all: 10...Qxb5?? 11.Nc7+ wins the Queen.
? This move is meant to give an escape space to the LSB (on a2) and foreshadow a queenside attack, but it really just doesn't get much done. Best was 10.Nxd5, as I mentioned above.
? It looks like this forces the White Bishop off the board and gains space, but it's actually quite weak. 11.Nd5 still forces ...Qd8, leaving Black in a very inactive position.
? Luckily for Black, this is blitz, and both players continue to miss the very strong Nd5 attack.
Is this pawn poisoned? We'll have to wait to find out, but it doesn't look immediately dangerous, so Black snaps it up.
? White spares his opponent. It seems like developing the Rook was a strong choice, but best was the simpler 16.Nxa3. The text overlooks a retaliatory tactic from Black...
White puts pressure on the center, but it's a bit empty: Black's King may run safely to the queenside now, and the e-pawn has a wealth of possible defenders. 19.Nd2 may have been stronger, looking to transfer to the kingside, or else 19.Kh1 with an eye for c2-c3.
Connecting the Rooks and preparing to barrel down the half-open g-file.
Preparing ...e5-e4, as well as giving the Rg6 a way to access the queenside if need be.
? There was no reason not to take with the Rook; I just missed it (we were both rather low on time here; < 1 minute each).
White must now lose a Rook, or else the game. He has his choice of ways to do so: Kc1 and Rxe2 both work. But either solution must be short-lived, as he'll be down a terrific amount of material and cannot hope to come back.
The 2nd, 3rd and 4th move of black have 2 purpose:<n> 1) get out of books<n> 2) (may be) make me in "attacking mode"<n>I did not succeed to prove it, but loosing tempo in the opening is dangerous.
Due to his hazardous opening, black has difficulites to develop kingside pieces.
White develop quietly and postponed the question of the center.<n> After dxe fxe, black would have the f6 square for the knight and e7 for the bishop with acceptable development.<n> After d5, the position is locked and black can continue with plan involving g6, Bg7, Ne7, 0-0, f5. Like Philidor.
?!<n>After BxBh6 ! NxB Qd2, black would have to play Ng8 (beurk) or g5, f4 and the position will open on a very unsafe king.
Attack the c4 pawn.<n>After Ne7, I would have probablt played Qh6 to prevent 0-0.
Obviously, it is time to open lines for an attack !
Candidates move :<n>A] e5, B] f5, C] Nd5, D] Qg3, E] Qh3<n>Probably the best one was Qh3 with possible answer Nc5, f5 g5, Bh5<n><n>White move intend to exchange an active defender but actually loose a piece.
Well, black is a knight up, but kingside N and R cannot move, the Nc3 intend to jump on e4 b5 or d5, Rooks can attack on d, e and g files. What should black do ?<n>I was expecting Qd7 then Qg7 (or f7) to exchange the Q but black choose another way.
Here my opponent offered a draw. After considering the answer to Qd5 I felt there was not enough pieces left for an attack and agreed for it.<n>For instance Qd5 Rc8, Rc6 Qd8, RxR QxRc8, Qd6+ Kg7 and the king will be safe in h8.
that is Levenfish attack , in dragon variation , the idea is to forward whites pawn to e5 and get  strong space and center advantage . black must be careful now if .6....Bg7?.7.e5-Nd7.8.e6 with big advantage. if 7....Ng4 black in lost position after 8.Bg4+Bd7.9. Qxg4 or 8....Nc6.9.Nxc6-bxc.10.Bxc6+, and last one .7....Kf8.9.h3 and the black knight is traped ,9....dxe5 will lose quicker after .10. Ne6+Bxe6.11.Qxd8+
10....Be7 is the correct move , maybe black wishes to not showing white where the black bishop will move , but he's must recole that it  has aweak pawn on d6.
good move , white attacking the weak pawn d6, and controls the center butt , the white king stays in the center with out castling and it could be big problem for whites
18. Qd4 was stronger move ,attacking the queen on e3, the pawn on a7, and d6. its not good for black 18....Qxd4.19.Bxa6+Kb8.19.Rxd4.or 18....Qe6.19. Qxa7 with big advantage , after 19....Re81!.20.Qxe3-Rxe3.21.Rxd6 white stays with pawn advantage and good position .
Big mistake for white it seems that black just lost abishop on a3 but, the weak king on the center can pay abig price .
and ad raw was agreed because of 22.....Qc1-e3+ . another option was 22. Qxf7+Rd7.23.Qc4-Nxa6.Qxa6+ = that's why 19.....Kb8 was better move .  I hope you liked  my game , Evan i played bad and all most  have been punished for  being greedy for material , i learned allot ,like how much castling and safety of the king is so much important , thank you and i would like to read yours comments have nice day and play chess !!!
This starts off with the Clemenz Opening. This is rarely played in games with people of my rating, and basically gives a tempo to black.
I start off with a powerful move, controlling the center and giving free space for my pieces. Knowing the opponents rating, I tried to go for the Scholar's Mate.
This move chases the knight away when I want to get to f7 with my queen.
I am set for the attack on f7. One move can mess this up, and there are a LOT of them.
Since attacking with the knight failed. I think that this was attempted to get the bishop in there. I can easily block with d5 anyway. Still, there is checkmate next move...
Bxf7 would also have checkmated. This is not exactly the Scholar's Mate. That mate is typically four moves, with the same pattern of the bishop on the f7 diagonal and the queen also attacking the square from f3 or h5, and no other pieces are blocking the way of checkmate. This is a good strategy for winning games against low rated players quickly and efficiently, but otherwise NEVER play this opening. Be smart in defending against this, or end up like that...
Much stronger is 3...e5, immediately counterattacking in the centre. Winning the e-pawn 4.dxe5 is a weak move as after 4...Qxd1+ 5.Kxd1 Nc6 Black has the advantage. 3...e6 is more passive, and also allows to develop a bishop and recapture the pawn.
So, Black recaptures the pawn, and doesn't need to waste a move to do it.
White pushes a well-defended pawn into Black's territory. I usually play this as 4.d5 after 3.e4 e5, to attempt to hold my central gains.
A weak move...I think... - I can see no reason for Black to spend a tempo on a small queen move, and block his bishop. This allows White to claim a greater lead in development.
9.exd5 and White has an extremely weak d-pawn: isolated AND extended. This move keeps White's pawns together and puts a powerful knight in the centre - an outpost, as no Black pawns can attack it. Am I overrating the power of a minor piece in the open centre?
A provocative and risky move: weakening the knight outpost, but gaining space in Black's side of the board and gaining a tempo, forcing Black's bishop to move. The downside is that this pawn is far from the defence of its other pawns, and can be shifted with a timely ...f6.
Preparing a potentially dangerous discovered attack which threatens to win queen for rook and knight - a gain of 1 material point.
The exchanges are performed, and I see now that White's gains are not limited to a single point of material. Granted, Black's bishops are very powerful on their diagonals, but Black's kingside is cracked open, and since White retains his queen he will hold an advantage if he goes for a kingside attack. Black's minor pieces are also far from the kingside's defence. However, of course, if Black mobilises his defensive pieces quickly he will stand a good change of weathering the onslaught.
! A strong move, gaining a tempo (unless Black wishes to lose even more material, in which case White can exchange off pieces and enter a won endgame) and forcing Black's king to stay exactly where he is: the f7-square cannot in the near future be used as an escape square, due to Black's doubled pawns. Black's king becomes a sitting target.
Escaping the material loss, and perhaps paving the way to a successful defence by placing his rook in front of his kingside.
20...Kxh7? 21.Bf8+ Kg6 22.Qh6+ and Black's king is stuck in the open. Instead, seemingly ignoring White's threats to his king, Black is following a checkmating threat of his own.
A powerful pin. White is forced to go for the draw he has in hand on the kingside:
Checking the king
Moving my bishop to a safe square
White seems to intend to bring the other knight out into play.
White also intends to get the rook into play; perhaps he intends to do Rxf7+ on the next turn, but my bishop guards that pawn, so it would result in a loss of material for him.
Trying to threaten the bishop.
Rather than taking the bait and losing his rook, White instead tries to force my hand.
Checking the king
I take the knight because my rook is protected by the king.
White doesn't want to exchange rooks
Trying to get White to exchange rooks
Checking the king
Checking the king
Taking a chance to be able to promote it (futile)
At this point, it was also inevitable that one or more of my pawns would be promoted, because the king couldn't get close enough to capture one before it became a Queen.
I learned once the hard way that it's a good idea to take the pawn at d4.  Allowing white's pawn to d5 leaves black all congested.  Besides, if white's queen captures back at d4, it gives the initiative back to black.
That kingside knight seems so important to white's defense, and worth the trade if I can divert his bishop from e2.
This puts a damper on my hopes for Ng4 followed by an attack on f2.  Now, maybe I better start to think about castling . . .
Ugh!  Great move by white.  What can I do to save the knight?  Qe7?  That allows Qxc6+.  I can't move it because of Bxg7.  I was hating my position at this point, as you can imagine.  It's all because I was a tempo or two behind due to having to keep moving my queen earlier.
So I save my knight, for now.  I was hoping to bring my h rook over and into the game, but I'm too exposed and white knows it.
Back to where I was before . . .
Ugh.  I felt a bit like resigning.  I can't castle, I'm about to lose the exchange, and I have no threats . . . . Well done on white's part.
Poo.  Now what?  I'd like to get my rook into the game, my king to a safer place, but white has the initiative and material advantage.
Smart move, pinning my Knight.  I'd like to get it into action and open the long diagonal for my bishop, but I can't because of the threat of Rd8+ forking my king and queen (protected by his queen at g5.  If I play Nd5, then white plays c4.  What an awful position!  Who wants to bet on black to win this game???
I think white should have called my bluff here and played Rd1.  I'd almost have to trade rooks, and he'd be further ahead after simplifying the board.
Instead he goes after my knight (and queen).  I've got nowhere to go with the queen . . . but I think this is an example of white going after material instead of keeping his eyes on the prize--my king.  To save my queen, and possibly the game, I launch a kamikaze attack.
Regaining the rook . . .
Again, going after material instead of playing good offense (or defense).  Nd2 or even c3 would have probably held the game and the advantage for white.  Instead he takes the knight and goes back up by 8 "points" (but of course, chess is not a game of points, is it?).  BTW, white was smart in capturing with the rook, because Qxb5 would have allowed Qe1 mate.  Hmm.  What's going to happen?  Here's where it gets REALLY interesting.  I have the initiative, so I have to take it.
I expected this.  I think Kd1 would actually have been better though.  It makes sense for him to force a trade since he's got such a clear advantage.  I thought about trading and trying to get my pawn to queen, but it's impossible.  So, to keep the initiative. . . .
Lose the game.  And I couldn't have done it without that little hopeless pawn at f4.  Of course, I couldn't have done it with some errors from my opponent.  The lesson in this game?  A big lead in material won't win by itself.  Instead of going after more material, good defense or strong offense (against the king!) is the key.  Thanks for reading.  I'm interested in your insights and opinions too.  --Crossquill
Hi everyone!<n><n>Master Freddy is contemplating another mini-tournament based on the Halloween Gambit.  I decided to test this particular water with him, taking the black side.  I did not use the database but my choices proved to be a disaster, anyhow, on with the show which begins with 1. e4.
4. Nxe5 - here it is, the Halloween Gambit, Freddy gambits a horsie for a pawn and speedy development.  Naturally I accept the gambit by taking on e5.
7. ...... Bb4 - I try to catch up with my development with Bb4, now I wonder whether d6 was a better alternative here.
13. ...... Nf4 - trying to hassle the queen but Freddy merely retreats the Evil Witch to f3 making multiple threats.
This is not the wisest response, but I don't like Nxd4, c4 (with tempo). So I tried this to see where does it lead
Good choice, but better was d5! It seems to lose a tempo, but undermines black's plans (c6, dxc6!, followed by a terrible counterattack based on B/Nb4...).
Going on with the scheme. Nc6 is not wise in this position, since after d5 the knight's journey doesn't accomplish that much.
The normal choice was Bf4, followed by e3. But I wanted to cash something. If Ne5, black wins the following exchanges.
It's always nice to see that the white's dsb can be exchanged...
White accepts the exchange, and true is that I am far behind in developement, and my opponent has an edge right now. But... how to capitalize on it?
...ready to Bg4.
Better was Ne3. I can guess white wanted to keep the e semicolumn open, in sight of its weakness, and I can't say it's wrong. But this just slowens white's developement. The white knight can go to c4, true, but this is a better place for the pawn.
Odd developement, for quickness, not obstaculizing the lsb, and protecting b4.
White makes a strategic mistake, or either he just wants to offer me to lose the bishop pair for a doubled pawn. Interesting...<n><n>(saved but unprocessed lines)<n><n>16.	b2-a4	e7-e6<n>17.	b3-b4	f5-d3<n>18.	c2-d3	f8-b4<n>19.	d2-b4	a6-b4<n>20.	a4-c5	e8-f7<n>21.	h1-e1	h8-e8<n>22.	c5-b7	f7-e7<n>23.	b7-c5	e7-d6<n>24.	a2-a3	b4-d5
I don't fall for it... yet. I love my bishop pair, look at it. From f8, my "undeveloped" bishop is powerful. I exploited the b3 move by white. Of course, I calculated what happens after Re1.
Now wanting to pin a knight.
White avoids me... the temptation to exchange the bishop (I was almost prepared to consider it in sight of c5), but blocks my pawn's advance. Good...
...and the bishop pair is magnificent. Chess is cruel: even such a great edge can be reverted if you not take advantage of it inmediately and aggressively.
I choosed this way to manage white's attack: slippering it. Now, if g5, I have plenty of moves to play with, and if gxf, Bxf just improves my position.
This seems to be a good move, but in fact it is the losing one. f2 must be covered at all costs, since it is clear that white doesn't have the tempo to play Kb2 to guard a3 from the black's dsb. The problem is that from there the bishop blocks the only place for the rook to defend c2. White can't afford to lose a second pawn without a sound compensation. After 27. Bg3, black has Rf3, and white is forced to 28. Rd3. Black misses a tempo to play Ba3 and seriously threat mate. It was dangerous, but it was the only choice for white.
The key of the position is that the white's dsb is not covering any vital square, given the solid protection of the white squares. It's wonderful position is useless. The only white's possibility is to exchange his knight with the lsb, but this is very difficult to achieve.
Trapping the king, and winning c2.
Desperation. Anyway, white's position is unholdable. After the rook retires, c2 falls, and white has no perspectives. The same principle was applied: try to get the maximum as soon as possible from any edge. In very few moves, the game has turned from a long endgame into a losing position. I hope to have been accurate (but I can be wrong), and to help some player with some hints about the game. Thank you for reading.
Black doesn't try to defend the d pawn.
Developing on the center
Reinforcing the center and preventing Ng4
Now I considered white's developpement as finished. For I want to keep the LSB on his square as long as possible because it could be usefull on e2 or d3 and I have no moves to lose, for both players have castled on the opposite side. The rush at the Kings will soon begin. Will black defend or will he try to attack the white king and if so he does, who will be the quickest ? (I analysed the game as deep as I could and was not sure at all).
To prevent white's attack by Nb4. I spend one move but it should make my opponent lose at least two moves to be really dangerous for the king.
Now, white considers the king sufficiently safe to be able to attack.
White attacking plan is very simple (pawns supported by DSB, Q, R and, if necessary LSB). In this position I think that white is better because his piecs on the center can be used wether to attack or to defend, which i not the case for black.
Menacing the knight on c3
Retreating. A good spot because it controls c3 and d4 which will be an important square. Drawback : it blocks the LSB.
To avoid 17. Nd4 but giving white one tempo. At this moment, I saw a tactic.
To menace e6 (and fork attack between Q and R). Black would need his f7 pawn to take the knight and (playing fxe6) and couldn't play fxg6.
To protect the f pawn and join the two rooks.
Black sends one more piece on his right wing. It reinforces his attacking possibilities but weakens his kingside.
Now black's on attack but it'll take time before it gets dangerous.
It's time to launch the attack.
Black has no choice (if 21. ... fxg6 22. Nxe6 and black loses his f rook.)
Fork attack (Q and f rook). Black has to take.
Attacking the black king and preventing a further Qxc2+, thus enabling the white queen to leave her guarding post and attack.
At this point, I tried to analyse all of black possibilities and had the impression that the game was won for white but it's a complex situation and I was not quite sure (I could handle 26. ... Qa5 by 27. Qe6+ ... 28. Rd5 ; 26. ... Rxf3 27. Qe6+ Kd8 or Ke8 28. Rh8 with a mate to come ; 26. ... axb3 27. Bxb3 with situation almost unchanged but safer white king. I had some doubts with 26. ... Na5. But at least I could obtain a draw.) However...
I wanted to play aggressively, so I try to introduce imbalances early, here on the second move.  White is prepared to play e3 if d/c.
I am not sure if this is the correct move and would like to know.
D5 really ups the ante, now that white is gambiting a pawn.  I just wanted to keep the position as fluid and complicated as possible.  Sometimes, as here, I play a move that looks intuitively good to me, without a lot of calculation.  I am pretty sure black can undermine and win the d pawn, but on the other hand the pawn, while it remains, is pretty annoying from black's perspective.  An early advanced pawn can be distracting and could hinder black's development.
So black is immediately giving up his dark-squared bishop.  I wonder about this move, though.  It is going to be an open board, and maybe white will play e4 followed by be3.
He elects to defend c4, and I am able to defend d5.
Preparing to play Ng3 and be2.
I don't think this move makes it as unpleasant for white as nd7 and f5 would be.  I think the only idea is to threaten c3 after qa3.
Inviting qa3, if that was the intent, and vacating e2 for the bishop.
This move is certainly distracting and causes me to take time away from solving my castling problem, but I don't think it guarantees any major advantages.
Again, I am not sure about black's play here.  Let me know what you think.  I guess the idea is to threaten nc5 or nb4, but after nb4 the knight is still going to be defended by the queen alone, and maybe it will be a liability.
I think the idea here was to keep the bishop for bg3.
I wonder if black has made another mistake in this critical position.  I feel that if I can weather the tactical threats black is subjecting me to, the g6 pawn will tell.
Aggressive play from black.  E3 is obviously not playable at the moment, and is e/f really that strong for black?
Bh6 seemed a possible move here, but maybe I am wrong.  The move that will bring me closer to victory will also take me nearer defeat, as f2+ would appear to win the white queen.
Besides threatening to win the bishop, I think this is a good move because of the threat of rff5. But here I find a truly beautiful idea.  I find a queen sacrifice after g7.
Probably not, after this mistake.
This exchange is good, as if 7. Nxe4 Nxe4 8. dxe4 Qxd1 9. Kxd1 leaves white unable to castle with the king stuck on an exposed central file.
Ah yes, that makes more sense, but this works too, keeping the ability to castle in exchange for a loss of material.
Forced, gives an obvious combination for Black to remove a bishop and double my pawns.
As expected, but I cannot see easily how white will continue to attack after Kg7 -- white really wants to get a rook onto the d file to contest for its control.
Awkward choice for white, Re-d1 to sacrifice the b2 pawn and get to Rd7, or protect the pawn.
Chose to protect the pawn, but tied up another rook in the process.
Ah, ok, presumably a3 was to stop the a pawn from hanging after this advance. Now I suspect white wants cxb4 axb4 so that he can attack on the a file.
so I will lock the position. Removing the d3 and b3 squares from white, this should make it very hard to defend both the a3 and c3 pawns.
This is the move I played b5 for, but now the c4 pawn is well and truly awkward for white (though the knight sacrifice is a possibility, 26. Nxc4 bxc4 27. b5 is interesting). d3 looks like a nice place to get my bishop if I can now.
Defends, but now Ra2 seems to win a pawn, either after Ra1 Rxa1 Rxa1 Rxc3 or simply Rxa3
Now two pawns up, trying to remove white's ability to advance by taking the g4 square away from the knight.
The position is now relatively seized up for the moment. h5 is needed to fully lock the kingside, but it is not urgent.
Threatening Rxf2 and allowing the c and b pawns to advance.
I can get a free pawn and keep b5 defended -- now 4 pawns ahead.
Black can now gain the bishop on c4
To protect f5
Black saw his opportunity to have a 3 fold repetition and draw since he was down in material
If I play too early in the morning I make moves like these.  Once in awhile you just have an off day, where things go terribly awry.
Normally I wouldn't take that Knight, but after having looked at very old games for some times I had an urge to play old fashioned chess.
And this had to follow...
Black wants to take advantage of the weak white squares.
En naturlig blokering, der også åbner for hvids sortfeltede løber, som kan placeres på enten e3 eller f4. Lb2 synes ikke at have samme effekt, da trækket kræver forberedelse med b4<n><n>It seemd to me as a natural blocker also preparing for the bishop to work
Lf4 er ikke nogen direkte trussel. I stedet kunne der som nævnt tidligere være spillet b4 og L b2 eller Le3. Den direkte trussel af springeren på d4 gennem Le3 er ved første øjekast indlysende, men efter 18..., Sf5 taber hvid et tempo.<n>Stillingen er ikke uden muligheder for begge sider, og gennem upræcist spil kan der opstå ubehageligheder for hvid, der er foran i materiel, men som overhovedet ikke har sat sig på stillingen endnu.<n><n>At first I wanted to plant the bishop at e3, but got scared seeing Nf5
This move wanted to provoke f6, but it did not give me anything
Equilibrating the material situation, losing one tempo and aggressively contesting the center.
... and falls on the battlefield.
To prepare the castle and take control of the d8h4 diagonal.
Now that the king is safe, the left wing soldiers can advance.
Initiating a trade. Both sides will get an isolate pawn in the center.
There were other candidate moves (12. Re1, 12. Rb1) but it's a fork attack between h7 (mating menace) and the isolated d5 pawn.
Menacing the rook and the king, on the long term. Black will have difficulties to force the DSB to leave his advanced post.
Setting the rook in safe, aiming at the center, menacing the queen.
Protecting the queen and the c pawn.
White controls the center, nobody conrols the open file, the black king is unsafe, white is ahead in material black's pieces are well grouped and can initiate a quick counterattack. Each side has one unprotected bishop. White has an isolated pawn on the left wing.
White's plan is to attack the back king, using the open e file but for that I need to regroup the troops which are not on the proper squares. It will necessitate some manoeuvres because black has dangerous available possibilities.
Black's plan seems to contest the center. If he eliminates the c3 pawn, he'll have strong attacking possibilities.
It seems to me a weak move. Probably done to prepare 19. ... b5. and may be to prevent 19. Bb5, so that black can play a further Re8.
Black attacks on the queen's wing and still aim at the center but it weakens his position on the kingside.
Rook on the open file, menacing b7 I judged that white's position was now strong enough on the kingside to let black take pawns on the queenside.
Fianchetoing the bishop.
Forcing the rook to move.
To double the rook but the c8 rook is now unprotected and dame guenièvre is looking at a8
To double the rooks and indirectly protect c3 (which I hoped black would bite).
Here Pc6 is vulnerable, by either the queen or the bishop.
He told me before the game that his sole opening was to take both my knights early.  He thinks I'm too sneaky with them.
I had a serious internal struggle on whether to do this move.  I hate messing up my pawn structure, but I felt it was about to be relinquished of solidarity in a moment anyhow.
sending bishop to help in case of attack.
After this move I knew I was in trouble.  His N reaching e5 is big trouble for me when his pawn advances....my resources would be takin aback and allow for an onslaught by his queen/rook on the same file.
I "thought" it was a good idea to help out with the pawn, but this move was my downfall.
c5. A push for space, as in the Sicilian Defense. The c5 pawn lets the Q come to b6, and the N can slot in behind the pawn at c6.
d4. This move is ultimately going to get the Q out early, or move the N twice, but is a good push for space.
Qb6 - attacking f2, and, if the B on c1 is moved, b2. Aggressive.
Bd3, developing and defending.
b4? pawn sacrifice. This was not needed, although it was probably an attempt to divert attention from f2.
Capture, and bring the other N into the attack.
h3 - trying to take pressure off.
This was in hope that he would take with the Q. Also, it swapped off (which when winning is usually a good idea.
Nxf2 - the N is in the heart of the defense.
Nxe4 . Discovered check, winning the pawn and also allowing the N to move to better squares later.
Bd6 ; Qd6  was probably better, as it could then come in at g3.
g3 - to prevent the loss of a Q.
The Q was attacked.
Kh1. Kg2 may have been better, as it stops the Q coming in.
Qf2! Threatening mate in 1, and with a good attack.
A quick end to the attack. Checkmate.
?! dubious. Black chooses to defend his pawn instead of staking a claim to the centre. Another move gone without developing a minor piece. If black does not play correctly now, he could easily find himself on the back foot.
?! - I felt in an aggressive mood, and I thought I would get a pawn storm marching since black has not moved a single minor piece!
? - This is a truly terrible move in my opinion. Black already had a pawn supporting b5, and this closes the option of Na6. After 6 moves, black has still not moved any pieces! I probably would have considered Nf6 or even Bg4. Any ideas on the best course of action here for black?
?! - the aggression continues. This targets the c6 pawn should black move his knight, and opens up paths for the f pawn to continue my planned pawn storm. This is probably not the best move in this position. However, it certainly is aggressive!
Black blocks in his LSB, which now becomes a weak bishop. I assume he wanted to start developing kingside to castle and get out of danger. However, I already have a pawn storm brewing.
! - Black chooses not to develop, so I continue the plan to rip away black's kingside defences and start an attack. I would give myself a slight edge at this point, considering black's lack of a single developed piece.
Black regains his pawn and is not looking terrible at the moment, but not great either.
I drive the queen away and continue the kingside expansion.
I develop my bishop, eyeing a discovered attack on black's a8 rook. I'm considering kingside castling if I can drive away the queen at this point, but in retrospect, the kingside is terribly exposed if black can mount a counter challenge.
Black sees the discovered attack and gets out of the way, giving the rook more scope than Rb8.
The aim here was to skewer queen and rook with Be3.
Black gets away and seizes the open file.
Since no skewer is available anymore, I get ready for long castling to contest the open file.
?? I assume he was trying to unpin his knight but I can't see the point in this.
Black doesn't see it, or does and underestimates it, and targets my bishop.
!! - the threat on my bishop is ignored for now. If black recaptures with axb5, I counter with Ba5 and win the black queen.
A reasonable counter to my plan.
! - Gaining tempo and starting to mount a potentially dangerous attack on black's exposed king. I have almost all my pieces aimed towards the black king, with the exception of my Rh8. This move wins a piece.
Notice that black cannot take the bishop because of Rd8#!
Black equalizes material and threatens my LSB at the same time. But I still maintain the tempo with my next move.
Either the king is lured into the open or the queen lines itself on the same diagonal as the king
With the threat of Bc6 - however, I did not see that black actually does not lose material necessarily. e.g. 25. Bc6 Qxc6 26. Qxc6 Nxc6. However, I can then follow up with Re1 and the king is still exposed.
!! - multiple threats here. If black takes my DSB, I have Bc6#! If he attempts to create a hole for his king to escape, I still mate swiftly e.g. 25... f6 26. Rd8+ Kf7 27. Qe6#
A neat checkmate. The king is blocked in by his own pieces, the knight is pinned, and the rook controls the open file. A nice game from me, I think.

We're thinking along the same lines. I figured that was coming, and I'll use my other knight to trade it off. <n>But I'm also trying to play Ne4 myself -- always a strong move in the Dutch, I've been told.

Interesting how our knights on the e-file and the f-pawns are mirroring each other. But he still that backward pawn on e3, and I wonder if I can find a way to exploit it.
In another annotated game, I said that I was tempted to take dxe4, and an annotator remarked that that capture is often calling to black but that taking with the f-pawn will almost always work out better. In this case, I like that the pawn can be supported by the queenside chain instead of having to play g6 to guard it with a pawn. I also like giving my bishop some extra room and maybe opportunities for the rook.
I'm sure not going to trade rooks and let his queen go to f1. Yet this is starting to look like a massive trade-off is on its way.
My threat was too obvious. He's not going to trade and worry about my queen roaming around over there.

We called the draw here. As we get closer to an endgame with just pawns, I'm not feeling so confident. My king will be limited where it can go because of his passed pawn on e5.
4. .......... This is the Beverwijk Variation of the Ruy Lopez - but I wonder whether this is a good line or not in retrospect because I really do get into an awkward mess in the early part of the middle game.
12. ........... Qxd1 - this queen exchange is forced as the black knight must get out of the pin to avoid the kingside pawns being shattered as well as the queenside ones.  I am now a pawn to the bad into the bargain, sigh!!
16. hxg3 - they say you shouldn't exchange pieces when you are down on material, only pawns, but I have one proviso - if the exchange results in messing up your opponent's pawn structure it is certainly worth considering in my humble opinion.  White's active dsb is off the board and at least I have the bishop pair against 2 knights.
23. c x d4 - I thought long and hard about this exchange, it does knock out a defensive piece and it now breaks up white's queenside.  Can I do some serious damage before white activates his queen rook?
25. Rf1?? - trying to exchange off or drive away the black rook but unfortunately for white the lsb on that lovely long diagonal has the final say with ........
25. ........... Bg2 !! - at the very best (for white) I will be a piece and a pawn up in the endgame, at the very worst for white, if he plays his king to g4 he will cop Old Matey in a handful of moves.  White sees this and waves the white flag.
I'm not keen on this response from black though I think it's still within book, I don't like that it restricts the knight
This move took us out of the Gameknot database. I wanted to break up the black pawn structure a little and give my dsb access to b2 and a3 as black was now going to have to castle king side.
This bishop stays on this lovely diagonal for the rest of the game. Note that although the diagonal is blocked by a couple of pawns, there are no black pawns to stop my pawn on d4 advancing and opening the diagonal further. This proves significant later in the game as we will see.
regains the gambitted pawn and gives my lsb a little more room to maneouvre
As well as shifting the bishop, my queen now has an eye on the a2-g1 diagonal
Doesn't really defend the bishop as I have the option of c5, though I am not going to take that option. I'd like to keep my pawn on c4 but won't complain if bxc4 as then Bxc4 leaves my queen and bishop lined up with where I am expecting the black king to soon be i.e. on g8 after castling
Preparing to castle but also commanding the diagonal b1-h7, again attacking the area around where the black king will be after he castles.
All according to plan. note that the black dsb is now out of place and doesn't really have any good options. In addition the black lsb can only move to b7
This was to encourage black to create weaknesses in his pawns around his king
I think I would have taken with the knight here, however I think black is planning c5, opening the diagonal for his lsb
However I now have a plan to attack the black queen with my dsb as we will see.
Threatening the queen. I didn't want to take the d5 pawn as then I would have made life easier for black.
Declines the exchange, later on this may prove blacks undoing.
Moving the queen to the nice open 4th rank. As both my bishops and my knight are threatening the area around the black king I can easily bring my queen into the action too.
I was expecting something like Bb7 here leading to an exchange of bishops. I think black was rightly worried about Bxf6
I was very pleased with this move, blacks options are limited and I am threatening Nxg7 with some nice threats to follow
An unfortunate oversight from black. I was expecting f6
Better for black was to take with the N first, so if I wanted to recover the pawn in a Budapestian way (Ng5), he would have had f5. This allows Qh5+, so... you know. Looking for troubles, as always...
! Now it's up to me how to lead the attack without being too much bothered by his lsb. So...
Here I lost the chance to make this the game I wanted it to be. Bxg6 was a sure win!!!!!!!!
Not now, after the BQ plays on the 7th rank.
...and now, Qxe5 seems to win, but after the Q's exchange, Re8 would recover the piece. Bxe5, and black can't play f6 or white will sac on g6, probably winning. But it's hard to say without the analysis board! I think that a sac on g6 is still premature, here. But I think that Bxe5 is very dangerous.
I though it was a funny way to propose Q's exchange, and it was. But the outcome won't be good for me, and I just allow black to recover the initiative.
...cutting by B's sac on g6 forever. Now, I was in a real problem. There was a way to save me?
? Bf1, thinking in Ba3 just after was better. Now, I know that d3 and I lose the B, but to d3 I had in mind...
...but again, my early attack left me very undeveloped, and now I have to lose my Q or accept an ugly xc2 move... or not? I though I found something.
Now, if gxQ, Bxh5#. A real beauty, isn't it? Of course, it doesn't work, because black can play QxB+, and then gxQ. White would have recovered the B after Bc8+ (disc), BxB. A crazy position, isn't it? Now, White threats Qh6, forcing f6 and after it g6 or h7 would fall. Black threats... a lot, but not so quickly... does he? So HE RESIGNED. Now the question: was he lost? Any comment appreciated... :-)
As White, I've always preferred the closed and semi-closed openings. Closed openings start with 1. d4 d5. Semi-closed ones start with 1.d4 and black responds with some move other than 1. ... d5. The Open Game is 1.e4 e5, a Semi-Open Game is 1.e4 where black makes moves other than 1...e5. Flank openings 1.c4, 1.Nf3, 1.f4 can easily transpose into closed or semi-closed (or sometimes open or semi-open). Also, 1. d4 d5 can easily transpose into various openings such as the Slav Defense, Chigorin Defense, Albin Counter Gambit, Baltic Defense, etc., if black later plays d5.
So we both bring our knights to c3 and c6. This is good.<n>************************************************************** <n>Generally, the knights belong on c3, c6, f3 and f6 on their 1st developing move. The primary reason for this is, each knight controls 2 of the 4 central squares: d4, d5, e4 and e5. I will speak more on controlling these crucial squares on White's move 7.<n>**************************************************************** <n>The 2nd reason knights should be placed on these squares is that you don't know yet where they will be needed. Let's say later in the game, you need your king's knight to help defend your queen side. The knight would get there faster from f6 than he would if you had played him to h6. If you wanted that knight to assist in an attack on my king, he would be on the job faster from f6, than from e7. The same principle applies to all 4 of those knight locations.<n>**************************************************************** <n>The third reason is, a knight on f3 controls e1, d2, d4, e5, g5, g1 and h4; six squares. You usually want to place your pieces where they control as many squares as possible. A knight on e2 also controls 6 squares, c1, c3, d5, f5, g3 and g1. A knight on h3 controls g5, f4, f2 and g1; only 4 squares, thus an edge of the board knight is usually weaker than a knight in the center. A knight on f3 and e2 both control 6 squares, but the one on f3 is usually stronger due to the 1st two reasons above. <n>*************************************************************** <n>There are exceptions to every rule though. The squares c3, c6, f3 & f6 are the ultimate starting locations for knights, but depending on the position, d2, e2, d7 & e7 can be best, and on rare occ

When the latter is the case, it is usually just to relocate it to another place.<n>**************************************************************** <n>Key Principle: Develop towards the center! Develop knights primarily to c3, c6, f3 & f6.

Develop knights primarily to c3, c6, f3 & f6.
So here we transpose into a QG (Queens Gambit), whether declined or accepted depends on you. In the QG, White offers Black a "free" pawn in an attempt to draw Black's d pawn away from controlling the center. If Black accepts, White has many resources to use to get the pawn back, one of which is the simple Qa4+, followed by Qxc4. Black cannot hold the pawn.<n>****************************************************************** <n>It is generally accepted that it is safe to take the pawn as long as you don't try to hold on to it. On the other hand, I personally don't accept the QG pawn when I play Black. To take would mean moving my pawn away from the center to take a pawn that I cannot hold. Better to keep developing and supporting the center as you did with 3. ...c6, or with various other means.<n>****************************************************************** <n>That is only a personal opinion, though, since many masters accept the pawn. If you choose to accept the pawn, that's fine. Then you need to learn the various lines of play where black accepts the pawn.<n>****************************************************************** <n>Key Principle: When and if you accept a pawn gambit, be careful about trying to hold the pawn. I'm not saying never try to hold a gambit pawn. Sometimes depending on the position, you  should keep the pawn. I am only saying be careful. <n>****************************************************************** <n>In the case of playing black against the Queens Gambit, don't try to hold the pawn or don't accept it at all.
QG Declined / Slav Defense. With this move Black threatens to accept the pawn, then support c4 with the pawn thrust to b5. I still was not concerned as Black gives up the center control and I still have other resources to harass his queenside pawns, and potentially gain the pawn back, such as e3, followed by a4. If bxa4, then his pawn structure is terrible. I would then have no trouble winning the 2 pawns back!
I continue to add pressure to d5, not concerned about 4. ...dxc4 and 5. ...b5 to protect the pawn on c4, because of the reasons stated on Black's previous move.
He who controls the center the best, controls the opening! <n>****************************************************************** <n>So we both are doing a good job of controlling the center. In the opening it is crucial to occupy and / or control the primary center squares, d4, e4, d5 and e5. Secondarily, it is also important to do the same to the 12 squares surrounding those 4, being c3, c4, c5, c6, d3, d6, e3, e6, f3, f4, f5 and f6. Lastly, it is good to control any squares on the board you deem important, based on the position.<n>****************************************************************** <n>You have a pawn occupying d5, the c pawn controlling d5, a knight controlling d5 & e4, a bishop controlling e4 and the queen bearing down on d5. I have a pawn occupying d4, the c pawn controlling d5, the knights controlling the 4 primary squares and a queen honing in on d4.<n>****************************************************************** <n><n>So thus far, we both have a lot of control of the center, but I have a little more than you do, since you have no occupation or control of d4 or e5. My extra control is not a major thing as of yet, but it is something you should be looking to work on. For example, you may want to consider Nb8d7 and Qc7 both to control e5.<n>****************************************************************** <n><n>This type of analysis should be frequent throughout every game, especially in the opening!<n>****************************************************************** <n><n>Key Principle: Contend to control the center of the board!
5.Qb3 to defend the d4 pawn, attack the undefended b7 pawn and apply more pressure to the d5 pawn.<n><n>Be careful when bringing your queen out early, as she can be subject to attack, causing you to lose development. I will speak more on this on move 7 for black and white. I chose to bring my queen out early here because she can't be attacked easily on this square (exception being 6. ...dxc4 7.Qxc4, or 6.Qb6 as you  played, no problem).<n>****************************************************************** <n>Key Principle: Only bring your queen out early if she can't easily be chased around the board!
So you offer me a queen trade, which would give you the disadvantage of doubled pawns and the advantage of an opened file for your queen side rook. ************************************************************** Doubled pawns are a disadvantage because they are harder to work with later in the game, when you want to break through to get a passed pawn. Isolated doubled pawns are worse, because they are also harder to work with to promote them, but more than that, they can`t defend each other. Therefore they are easier for your opponent to attack and take them. <n>*************************************************************** <n>Rooks need open files to reach their full potential. Most frequently, files are opened in the middle (among other reasons, because the central pawns on the c, d, e & f files are the most frequently traded) and the rooks move there to gain their mobility. Yet an open a-file would be ideal as the queen rook automatically is on an open file.<n>***************************************************************<n>Since the queen trade would not result in isolated doubled pawns, I felt your advantage of the opened file would be greater than your disadvantage of doubled pawns. I'd rather you took my queen, giving me the open rook file (and the doubled pawns). Thus my next move, c5 to attack the queen.
This is the only reasonable square to move to (apart from trading queens) as you need to defend the b pawn. The move 6. ...Qa6 would open you up to 7.e4 attacking the Queen and the LSB. You probably saw that though since you did not play 6. ...Qa6. :-)
7.Bf4! So, I sacrifice my Bishop, knowing that if you take him, I take your b pawn, then your rook! If you don't take my bishop, you have to move your queen, thus losing even more development. You already moved her twice.<n>****************************************************************** <n>Mohsen, let me make up an imaginary scene, then relate it to chess. Imagine twins, Jack and Jake setting aside funds for retirement. Jack set aside $10,000 in the year 2010 and invested it at a certain interest rate, say for example 9%. In the year 2050, his total interest earned would be $304,094.20. Jake on the other hand waits until the year 2040, and sets aside $10,000 and invests it at the same interest rate, 9%. In the year 2050, his total interest earned would be only $13,673.60.<n>****************************************************************** <n>What is interesting about this scenario, is that if all things are equal with the exception of the investment dates, Jake can never ever catch up to his twin brother Jack! You may ask, "Why the lesson on investing? I'm here to play chess!"<n>****************************************************************** <n>One of the most important principles in the opening is to try to get your pieces and pawns developed (moved out of the original square, to a more active location) as quickly as possible. If you don't, you may find yourself behind in development. It is also intriguing to know that if you play an opponent who knows how to take advantage of an initiative, similar to Jake in the illustration, you're far less likely to be able to catch up! One

One way to get a lead in development is to force your opponent to move the same pieces over and over again. If you develop your queen, then I develop my bishop to attack her, forcing you to move her a 2nd time, I gain a "tempo", and you lose a tempo. One result of gaining tempo is that it gives you the initiative over your opponent. This means that you have a measure of control over how your opponent moves his pieces. You can't safely play QNd7 right now, for example. You'd lose your Queen!<n>****************************************************************** <n>Both you and your opponent have things you'd each like to accomplish. Every time your opponent forces you to make a move, he hinders you from doing what you may have planned, (unless of course if the move he forces you to make was actually part of your plan).

ful Mohsen, not to allow your opponent to gain tempo, and therefore development, faster than you do.
So now Mohsen, You have moved your Queen 3 times. Take a look at your other pieces, compared to mine.<n>****************************************************************** <n>You have a knight, bishop, 2 pawns and your queen developed. The only material you have intentionally placed are the knight, bishop and pawns. Your queen was intentionally placed on b6, then she moved back to c7 and c8 where I chased her. It is good to force your opponents hand! As I said, if I force you to make a move you did not want to make, it can put you in a position you don't want to be in!<n>****************************************************************** <n>I, on the other hand, have a bishop, 2 knights, 2 pawns and my queen not only developed, but sitting where I intended them to be.<n>****************************************************************** <n>Furthermore, I have 7 development moves, you only have 5! White goes first, so if all things remain equal, white makes 1 development move, then black makes 1 development move, white makes a 2nd development move, then black makes a 2nd development move, and so on. Therefore black is always 1/2 development move behind. The battle in the opening is to tilt the scales in your favor (whether black or white). You want to force your opponent to lose development or tempo, by attacking more valuable pieces with less valuable material.<n>****************************************************************** <n>A 2nd way to force initiative in development is to develop a piece with check. The king moves, (for example to d1 or d2 on the open d file), so you queen side castle, putting the king in check again. You have developed your bishop, your king to safety and brought your rook to an open file. All your opponent has done is move his king around. Good for you!
Preparing to continue your development. You need to try to catch up!
Now I have my queen and minor pieces off of the back rank. I only need to activate my rooks. You still have a queen, bishop, knight and both rooks undeveloped!
I normally prefer my bishops over knights. This is because knights are the stronger piece in cramped, closed positions, while bishops are stronger in open positions. So, you have to consider each game individually, but generally, as pieces get traded off, closed positions become open positions in the middle game and end game. As the position opens up, the bishops become stronger and stronger. So, although both pieces are technically the same value, the bishops are my piece of choice. That may be just a personal thing though, because while most strong chess players agree with me, I've met some who disagree. So here I attack your bishop and trade. Then I will have 2 bishops against a knight in the endgame.<n>****************************************************************** <n>Also, the trade gives you doubled pawns, which can be compensated for by the fact that you also will have an opened file. Earlier in the game, I stated that the opened file was more of an issue than the doubled pawns. In this case, I feel the opposite because, while you have an opened h file to attack my king, the DSB (Dark Square Bishop) would help cover h2. <n>****************************************************************** <n>In addition, if you castle on the king side, your rook goes to f8 off of the open file. If you choose queen side castling, you have a good deal of maneuvering required, seeing how I attack your b pawn with my queen, and my DSB is on the h2-b8 diagonal. To queen side castle, you need to move your queen off the back rank. Her only square to go to is d7, which should be reserved for the queen side knight.
Now I will have 2 bishops against a knight and bishop. I rub my hands together.
Mohsen, it is usually best for pawns to capture toward the center of the board. It gets back to controlling those primary center squares, d4, e4, d5 and e5, and secondarily the 12 squares surrounding those 4, being c3, c4, c5, c6, d3, d6, e3, e6, f3, f4, f5 and f6.<n>****************************************************************** <n>Capturing as you did leaves the e6 pawn weak and less protected. You want to keep all of your pawns strong, but especially the pawns within these crucial areas. The e6 square is within that secondary range.<n>****************************************************************** <n>This move also weakens your kings position as the a2-g8 diagonal is more vulnerable to be attacked. This (in conjunction with 15. ... e5) gave me space to make the combination: 18.Nxd5 cxd5 19.Qxd5+. Qxd5 would not be check if you had captured via 11. ... hxg6. Since it would not be check, the combination would not work, because when I play 19.Qxd5, then you protect the bishop with 19. ... b6.<n>****************************************************************** <n>Key Principle: Make Pawn Captures Toward the Center of the Board!
Suspecting you may play Nh5, I wanted to give my bishop a retreat square. If after Nh5, I play BxN, I still give up a bishop for a knight. I wasn't interested.
I played this move not only to bring the rook to a more central square (since there are no open files to put the rook on), but I also did it in preparation for your 15. ...e5. I was not sure you would make that move, but just in case, I needed extra support on the c5 pawn, so after the exchanges on d5, I can play Qxd5 followed by QxB or RxB (on c5).<n><n>Aside from that, if there are no open files, it is good generally to bring rooks to one of the 4 center files (c, d, e or f). This is because the pawns on those files are the ones most likely to be traded.
14. ...Nh5? Be very careful about putting your knights on the side of the board. There are certainly exceptions, but generally, when you put a knight in this position, it should be to trade it off (as I did), or make a forking attack, or serious threat, or to get to another more active position. <n>****************************************************************** <n>In this example though, you may have done it with an intention to trade off my bishop, but I, not wanting to trade had an escape square. The knight has no attack or threat and there are no active squares he can move to, (with exception of f6, where the knight just came from. That wastes time and hurts your development). To make things worse, you helped me to shut your knight in further by trading on the e5 square (15... e5). This trading left me with a pawn on e5 cutting off your knights only escape route (f6). So the knight was forever stuck on the side until I attacked him (24.g4) and you resigned.
15... e5? After the exchange on the e5 square, I will have a pawn there, attacking f6. Notice that f6 was the only square your knight had to retreat to. So 16.Bxe5 Nxe5 17.dxe5, and your knight is forever trapped. I knew the knight would never get back into the game, since you can't move your pawn on g7 as it is blocked by the pawn on g6. You can't move the pawn on g6 (to make space to move the pawn on g7) because I would play BxN. So the only way to make space for the knight would be to win the pawn on e5, before I play g4, but I have a enough to defend the pawn. You don't have enough fire power to win it. I delayed the g4 move since I felt the knight was dead anyway. He could neither attack me nor help defend you.<n>****************************************************************** <n>Also, this move 15... e5 removes protection from the pawn on d5, which helped me with a later combination, beginning with 18.Nxd5.
This capture enables you to get a bishop for a knight, which is good for you. But I went for it to get the pawn on e5, to block in your dead knight. There are also the other reasons pointed out in the annotation on 15...e5.
17. ... Bxc5? You've taken the poison pawn! This is bad for you because we have my queen and your king on the same diagonal. So after Bxc5, I play 18.Nxd5, with a discovered attack on your bishop! If you take back, (defending the bishop with your queen) I play QxP+. I give up my knight and win the 2 pawns, knowing I will the piece back when I take the bishop with my rook or queen. You could have played 17. ...Kh8 to avoid the ensuing combination. <n><n>Key Principle: Be very careful about allowing forking checks and discovered attacks.
Again, as I mentioned earlier, I take with the rook instead of the queen to force you to move her. Taking with the queen in an attempt to trade queens would not be bad either. See my next note on 20. ...Qd8 for the reason.
You are behind in material,so it's not in your best interest to trade. I have 7 pawns to your 5, a 2 pawn lead. I have a strong bishop and you have a dead knight, so for all practical purposes, a bishop lead. Yet in order to win the knight after g4, I have to give up a pawn (Pxh5 and you play Pxh5), reducing my pawn lead to 1.<n><n>So if we continue trading, then after everything is traded off, I will still have a pawn and bishop. I would use the king and bishop to help advance the pawn to become a <n>queen.<n>Key Principle: Avoid trades when you are behind in material!
So we trade queens, and from this point on, I simply offer another trade, which you willfully accept, then I play g4 to attack the trapped horse.
Try to castle with best developing moves.
I think, I can hold close the position, that is why I gave up the bishoppair. And I wasnot at my best, so the knight can be very dangerous to be. I oversee sometimes.
I leave some territory for my king to breath, with the connectoin of my rooks.
Try to catch the c3 pawn after the exchange.
The mistake. I win back the pawn. After gxh6 white would have time for this move, or simply for the Bxh6 move and then with Qg5.
Now the black bishop cannot get breath in the nearby of my king.
There are certainly much better ways to win this position, but I played the last times very weak, so I donot give my opponent any chance to win.
an unusual response to the Sicilian
ensuring that White can't exploit a bishop pair but giving up my most active piece to do so
Black's attack seems to be working.  White's kingside pawns are split and Black can advance his King to support his advancing pawns.
? this isolated passed pawn was not as important as the one on f5, supporting my pawn on e4.  My rook had it blocked.
boomshakalaka aproaches this game with a strange opening, not sure if trying to throw me off or if he has a gameplan
pressure on the knight
black feeling the pressure castles, with little pawn defence somewhat a foolish move and looses the game because of it
black looks to gain a free pawn wuth a fork on d4 & b2
Maybe 6. ... Bf5 was a little weak, inviting white to play 7. e4 and gain a tempo. But g4 didn't seem to be any better, expecting a quick push of the white pawn to h3. Nor does e6 look better with white able to push his pawn to d5. I guess d7 was OK, but I kind of want a knight there to help support a black pawn on c5. Maybe black should have gone that route first.
I looked at this move and thought that with 9. dxe5 black could win at least the e5 pawn outright (maybe with something like e9. dxe5 10. dxe5 Bxf3 11. Bxf3? Bxe5). Or if white is careless, black could win a piece (I am looking now and can't find it, but I'm pretty sure in my head during the game I thought I had at least one way to come out a piece up with bad play by white). Truth is, all black managed to accomplish here is an even exchange of some material. Had I worked this out better in advance, I would not have chosen a long sequence of exchanges that liquidates half the material on the board and leaves white with a superior position, threatening to give away a draw to a player rated 600+ points lower than me (I much prefer to keep things complicated when playing with such a favorable disparity in the ratings, invite my opponent to make mistakes), so I think I'll give 9. ... dxe5? a question mark.
Now black is ahead by a pawn. If 13. Kxe2? or 13. Nxe2?, then black replies with 13. ... Bxe4 and remains a pawn ahead. White does have a sneaky move here though. By about the 10th move I had revised my evaluation of the exchanges, but it was too late, the snowball was rolling down the hill. I saw 13. Nxf7 coming, but I was hoping my opponent wouldn't see it.
The two black rooks are forked. Black must capture on f7 or lose the exchange. But he doesn't have to capture on f7 immediately. During the game, a few moves back, it occurred to me that a zwischenzug here with 13. ... Bxc3+ would wreck white's queenside pawn structure, isolating all three pawns and doubling two of them on the c-file. I had planned to play it. Then, when it got to black's 13th move, I totally forgot that plan and played too quickly to prevent the fork, losing that chance.
Now it's ugly. Material is even, but white has two sets of three adjacent pawns, while black has an isolated pawn on the half-open e-file. Black wants to play 14. ... Bxb2, but white would reply with 15. Rxb1 and 16. Rxb7, recovering the pawn and getting a powerful rook on the 7th rank. So 14. ... g6 is intended to prevent that, knowing full well that white won't allow such an obvious pawn capture.
Whit eprotected his b2 pawn and black prepares to double rooks on the only open file.
16. ... 0-0? was a blunder. With even material and a superior pawn structure, white was heading for a winnable endgame, or at least an easy draw (not bad for being a 600+ point underdog). But the white king was protecting d2 and by castling, he gives that square up to black's rook. Black is now forking the knight on e2 and the pawn on b2. One of them must go.
White makes two mistakes with one move. 19. Nxf6? trades pieces when white is behind in material. Also, it allows black to un-isolate his e-pawn with 19. ... exf6. Of course, any other move by the white knight allows 19. ... Bxc3, although 19. Nb4 (threatening to recapture after 19. ... Bxc3 with 20. Nxc6) seems to hold onto everything. 19. ... c5 chases the knight back to d5 where it defends c3 and can be supported by 20. c4 then 21. Ne3 if black attacks the knight on d5, and 19. ... a5? just allows white to immediately capture on c6. 19. ... Rc8 gives white time for 20. Rfc1.
21. Rfe1? offers black a 6-for-5 trade, exchanging rooks and gaining the pawn on a2 in the bargain.
OK, now I got nervous. Black dares not allow white to get his rook on the 7th rank, forking the king (who was on f7) and the pawn on a7. But white will either get there, or get a three-move repetition draw (the white rook can keep threatening to move to d7 or e7 and any moves by the black king to prevent it would be met with checks until eventually black repeats the position three times or abandons the 7th rank). Now that black is ahead in material and faced with a certain win, I am of no mind to allow the repetition draw, so I may have to let that rook rampage on the 7th.
White doesn't seem to see it so black gobbles the last queenside pawn. This makes me much more comfortable with white getting to the 7th rank now.
And now white goes for it, and black denies it. No white rook on the 7th today, not now anyway.
Black wants to get his king to e5, but not at the cost of losing the e-pawn after 31. ... Kf5. I considered doing it anyway, then demolishing white's kingside pawns and promoting on the kingside while white was busy preventing queenside promotion, but that felt a little too much like running up the score. Much more fun to pretend the six kingside pawns don't exist.
White cannot play Kxb5 now or any time hence because he will then lose the foot race with the a-pawn as it successfully sprints for promotion on a1.
However, 36. Kxb5 was not one of my conditional moves. I figured white to stop one queen, rather than allow both. Not that black needs two queens. Black takes the opposition, chasing white to the edge so that after the d-pawn promotes, there will be less chasing to do.
I decided to take this with knight.
And eventually he was forced to defend.
Now he's mine. lol. Actually I'm his. I should have move my king to safety before.
And Nd2 is one of the most popular ones. White's plan is to expand on the queenside, while I try to attack on the kingside.
This is still theory. I move the knight away, so I can play the typical central break f5.
The break.
Adding pressure on e4. Moving the knight back and forth is not as bad as it would be in open positions. Here it is more important to get to play f5.
I close the center. I surrender the fight for the center to turn my attention to White's king.
The attack begins.
The knight is a more useful piece in the attack, so it occupies a better square.
This is logical. White adds pressure to d6, which is the base of the pawn chain after the exchange of pawns on d6.
The purpose of this move might not be obvious at first. It protects the c7-square, which will be important for White, if he wishes to penetrate the position. In addition, it frees the f8-square for other pieces and allows the rook to join the attack if it is needed on the g- of h-files.
The bishop has no future on the long diagonal, because the center is closed, so it helps in defence by over-protecting the important d6-square.
I think this is a mistake. The b5-square belongs to the other knight in my opinion. There is no hope breaking through with pawns only.
And I continue my plan.
Now the a- and b-pawns stay where they are.
Pressuring the d6-pawns. I am happy I already have it protected.
This knight is going to g5.
This is natural. White opens the second row for the queen, so that it can help in defence. <n><n>Defending the h3-pawn with 25. Kg2 leads to 25...Nh4+ 26. Kg1 Qxh3 27. Bd3 Ng5 and White is helpless; for example 28. Qe2 g2 29. Nde3  (29. Re1 Qh1+ 30. Kf2 Nh3# or 29. Kf2 Qg3+ 30. Kg1 Nh3#) Rg7 30. Nf5 gxf1Q+ 31. Qxf1 Ngxf3+ 32. Kf2 Qh2+ 33. Qg2 Qxg2#. I did not have to calculate all the variations before I sacrificed the bishop. My intuition told me this was winning already. This combination of moves Nh4, Ng5, Qxh3, and g2 is repeated in many variations, and that is what I saw.<n><n>Other defences still leave Black with the advantage. For example, 25. Ndb2 Nh4 26. Bd3 Ng5 and winning similarly, for example 27. Qe2 Qxh3 28. Nxd6 g2 29. Nxf7 Kxf7 30. d6 Qg3 with a checkmate to follow with Nh3#.<n><n>Perhaps the best defence is giving back some material with 25. Nf2!? and then not 25...gxf2+ 26. Kxf2 Qxh3 27. Ke1 and White's king is safe and he will probably counterattack on the kingside with equal chances. Correct is to refuse the defensive sacrifice with 25...Ng5! (or 25...Nh4! the move order is not that critical) 26. Rfd1 Nh4 27. Rb3 (27. Rd3 gxf2+ 28. Kxf2 Qxh3 29. Ke1 Nhxf3+ 30. Bxf3 Nxf3+ 31.

After this move White resigns, nominally ahead in material with a bishop for a pawn. But the threats are the same as given in the annotation after the previous move: Nh4, Qxh3 and then either checkmate or advancing the passed pawn. For example: 26. Nxd6 Bxd6 27. Bxd6 Nh4! 28. Qe2 (or 28. Rb2 Qxh3 29. Qe2 Rg7 30. Bxe5 g2! 31. Bxg7 Nhxf3+ 32. Qxf3 Nxf3+ 33. Kf2 Qg3+ 34. Ke2 gxf1Q+ winning) Nxh3+ 29. Kh1 g2+ 30. Qxg2+ Nxg2 31. Bxe5 Ng5 and Black wins.<n><n>I emphasize that I did not calculate all the variations during the game, but trusted in my intuition and experience from similar positions.
Now the Bishop moves to b2. This cuts off its line of effect and although it lets the Q come to b1, Ba3 was probably better from that perspective.
f6, leaving a hole in the kingside, but trying to prevent a Kingside attack winning.
Now the Bishop moves to a3, probably what it should have done to start with.
Forcing the exchange, as the White Bishop was menacing on the Kingside.
Now, I thought an attack would finish me off, so I sought to swap off Queens. My only other alternative was Qf6, which probably also swaps off after Qf7 (notice the N forks winning the Q if it is on g5 or d8)
g4! A good move by White. The Knight has no escape square, as Ne7 is punished by Bxe7, and if the Rook takes the Bishop, Ng6  winnning a whole rook.
Black tries to push through the Queenside, as that is really his only hope.
Black now has to attempt to stop the pawn.
Now that the King is on g5, Black can try this line... Rxf3, exg3 and the pawn cannot be stopped, although both sides get Queens. I think this is a win for White however.
It was probably wisest to get the B to a3, so it could stop the pawn.
Black realises that White's Rook can stop his pawn, so tries to get the king in.
Rh5! If RxR, gxR and after c2 the B can stop the pawn queening by going to a3.
Preparing to bring my Ng1 to e2.
He makes another central advance. This is similar to another recent game I played, against the lovely penelope80, but in that game she played d5 earlier, so I didn't have to worry about black doubling my c pawns with BxNc3 as I could always undouble the pawns by exchanging on d5, and so I was able to develop my Ng1 to the more active square of f3. For this reason, I think the move order played by Mike Williams is better.<n>http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/real-time-game?gm=61234
I did now consider an exchange sacrifice. 11. b4 Nxb4 12. axb4 Qxa1 13. Qc2 and I am threatening to trap his queen with 0-0 and Bb2. Unfortunately he has 13.....Nd5! with advantage to black. So instead I played a more obvious move....
Bishop drops back. Although white is now confined to the back three ranks, white can now develop with tempo, attacking the black queen, and black's advanced knight can also be driven back with gain of time, if necessary. I think white has a small edge.
Preparing to develop Bc1. If now 14....Nd3? 15. Rd1 and the Nd3 is pinned and lost (I have Bb1 attacking the knight again if necessary).
I attack the queen, as per my plan.
Bishop moves to a more active square.
Did you consider this move? I don't think it leads to advantage for white, but it causes black problems, which thankfully my opponent did not meet in the best way. I also considered 18. Nb5, but realised it is easily met by Bxb5 19. Qxb5 Nf3+ 20. gxf3 Qxf4 with advantage to Black. Computer seems to prefer 18. b4.
Of course! Qxe5 loses to Nxf4!<n>At the time, and during the post match post mortem, I liked Re8 here - I thought it drew for black after, say Re8 21.	Bxc7	Rxe2 22. Bxd5 Bxd5 23. Be5 and black can't take the Be5 as his own back rank is weak, and this seems a very drawish opposite coloured bishop ending. However, computer prefers the move Black actually played, and prefers White after 20.....Re8 21. Re1!
Threatening both the queen, but also a discovered attack on the queen, for instance if g6 then 23. Bb8 wins the a pawn.
Played to weaken up the Black king side. For instance if I can play h4-h5 I am threatening to exchange on g6 and then play a winning bishop sacrifice on g6. If now 24.....h5 then 25. Qg5 and again, I am threatening a winning bishop sacrifice on g6. I think his best defence now is Qh6, but thankfully for me, that was not forthcoming.
Now I am also threatening Qf6 and mates. Qf3 was also strong. Nd5 had to be played, but white is much better.
And Black resigns. Many thanks for reading, please rate the annotation on the star system, and leave a comment or two, to let me know how I am doing with my annotations! Until next time dear reader!
The most common moves here are 3. d4 (The Open Sicilian), and moves like 3. Bb5+ (The Moscow Variation), however my opponent played this Bc4 move. I always see this move, yet I feel it's basically handing Black equalization, as Black can usually build up a nice center with ...e6 and ...d5 to follow (which would also kick the c4 bishop with tempo).
My standard response, preparing ...e6 and ...d5, plus developing.
And my plan starts to take action.
Perhaps he noticed d5 was coming and just evacuated early, but this is the loss of tempo I described earlier.
I decided to make him move one more time, and I welcome the exchange since the doubled pawns will only bolster the center I am about to erect, plus it opens up a b-file that will be great for my rook.
Again wanting to trade off bishop for knight, maybe my opponent loves his horses.
After the smoke clears, I no longer have doubled pawns, but a very strong center, an semi-open b file, and the bishop pair.
I was debating whether I should do this move, or wait until the c-file opened up and use that instead. I chose this in the end because I would have another rook to come over to the c-file, and the control of both half-open files. Along with the bishop pair in an open position, I figured I would serve extremely well.
Opening up the c file, and the position in general. This is always good when you have the bishop pair, as bishops thrive in open positions, whereas knights love closed positions.
I played this partly because this was a timed game and I couldn't think of any great squares to move my Queen to on the spot. Besides, I figured the prospects I already had should serve me well enough.
Connecting the rooks, and preparing Rfc8
?! I wasn't sure of this move, it seems as if it's just wasting tempo. Maybe my opponent was preparing to redirect his knight to e5 and try to exchange the knight for my bishop?
Enacting my plan, and also attacking the undefended c3 knight. If I can get this knight to move, I win a pawn on c2.
Attacking the knight once again, it has to move now.
I chose c7 and not c8 since I wanted to double rooks on the now fully open c-file anyway, so going back to c8 just to come to c7 made no sense.
My bishop got kicked around a bit, however it came at the cost of weakening his queenside. I also managed to keep my sights on the a7-g1 diagonal, meaning the knight on d4 needs to stay put or else my opponent will be down the exchange.
? White needs to turn his full attention to the queenside or else he'll simply get steamrolled.
Rooks on the 7th rank are happy rooks. This move also comes with tempo, since the knight can't go to d4 without it's twin knight protecting it.
Compare the pieces here. My rook is active, on an open file and attacking pieces. Meanwhile White's is currently staring at a brick wall on a3. My bishop has a lot of movement through my pawns, and a lot of pawns of White's to attack. Meanwhile, White's knight isn't doing a whole lot, and it doesn't really have anywhere good to go.
White's a and b pawns were going to fall, and I would then have 3 passed pawns to run to queening squares. Due to all of this, my opponent resigned in this position. I hope you enjoyed my commentary, please comment with any lines I may have missed, or any improvements in general!
I have an impressive pawn center, but can it hold?
This blocks in blacks LSB, but it's still the best square for the knight.
Locking up the center
I felt the center was locked up enough for this exchange.
Bringing another piece into the attack
Preparing to swing over to the kingside.
Black's position is like a sheet of glass, if you push too hard it will crack, and if you push even harder it will shatter. In this game, it does.
And bam! Black's position has cracked badly, I have an open file to his king.
Adding more defense to the bishop
If I was black I'd resign now, but he plays on
Black is reduced to shunting his king back and forth.
Taking advantage of the pinned bishop
The bishop blocks the rook from attacking the promotion square
I like to try to use blitz to try out and learn new openings.  I like to play the Giuoco Piano but I have to know the Two Knights Defense and I am grateful when someone plays it. ( I usually lose right now. )
The threat on the pawn at f7 requires some kind of action.
The cross pin saves the bishop and lets white do a little more than just fall back and defend.  There are three lines I found in the opening data base and I have looked at:  Rb8, breaking the pin,  Qc7 overprotecting c6 and perhaps gaining a good diagonal for the queen, and cxb5 which after 9. Qxa8 will be quite interesting.
This wasn't in the data base so white has two options: maintain the pin with Ba4 or Be2 to better defend the kingside.<n>If Ba4 eventually black will castle and the bishop won't serve much purpose at a4.
I chose Be2. If 9...., c5 then I thought 10. Qg3 would hit the e5 pawn and allow me to play 11. d3 with an extra pawn and a position I thought I could defend. However 10. ..., Bd6 looks very threatening.  I may have been fortunate this was a blitz game.
The pin with c5 is an illusion since white can play 11. Nxf6ch then move the queen or trade queens if black allows it.
Both sides try to complete development and now black can expand on the kingside.
White is a little uncomfortable here facing the duo at e5 and f5.  It might be possible to play Qh5 and play Bxh6 with at lest a perpetual in some variations. (On 15. ..., c5, 16. Qh5 should be an adequate response.)
Bxh6 is playable now since if black captures white can check on g6 followed by Qxh6ch and has at least a perpetual.  White would have three pawns for the bishop and might be able to capture the pawn on f5.  But black puts an end to that dream.
Trading queens and trying to make the extra pawn work is probably the safer course since black really has all the space on the kingside, but the bishop on b7 means Qh3 is safe at least at the moment
18. ..., f4 is probably best. I had planned 19. Bg4, Bxg4, 20. Qxg4.  The threat of mate gains a tempo but the knight on h5 might be in trouble.  If 20. ..., Qf7 then Bxh6 and white may be ok though.
Yes the knight has nowhere to go since the retreat 19. Ng3, allows 19. ..., f4 with the discovery on the queen and knight hanging.  But there is an out.
There was no way to save the pawn on h5 so the queen capture may be better but being able to take the pawn with the queen and maintain an attack is good for white.
Threatening the rook and heading to d5.
A trade of rooks here would give white the chance to invade on the 8th.  But 24. ..., Rxb1, 25. Rxb1, Bd6 trys to keep the rook out but 26. Rb5, Bc7 to save the knight allows Rxc5 with pressure on c8.
While the Sozin variation is still playable, it is not as popular as it once was because a pawn push to e6 neutralizes much of the LSB power along the a2-g8 diagonal.
A necessary move which prevents the knights from taking a strong outpost on b5 while also threatening a pawn push to b5 to prepare a queen side attack.
A common developing move which prepares for pawn to b5 and places the queen on the open file.
Although 11. g4 could have been played right away by white, this move further supports the advancement to try and rip open black's king side.
Bb7 was also a good alternative, but I chose to post the bishop to d7 to prepare for an a5-a4 pawn advancement.
Threatening to trap white's bishop. However, before white looks to defend, it is crucial that white continues with its plan first before defending.
?! This move can wait. It was important for white to continue with its own by playing 15. g5! first to force the knight to retreat to e8 so that the rook on f8 would remain inactive. Now, after the exchange of pawns there will be an open file that the f8 rook can exploit.
The most logical square to retreat to where the queen can potentially attack the weak b2 pawn.
?! A defensive move that gives me more tempo. Best would have been to continue to push forward with the plan and play 17. g5 Rfb8 18. b3 Ne8.
Exploiting the weakness of the dark squares around white's king to develop and attack the knight at the same time.
? A mistake, leaving me two options the knight or the bishop. If I was to play Nxd7 my knight could have made excellent use of the e5 square afterwards and I would be able to put a lot of pressure of the king. However, I opted to capture the knight which also puts great pressure on the king.
Now, the bishop must retreat to a4 and the king will take heavy bombardment along the c-file and along the weak dark squares.
! The king is now in grave danger. White seems to have quite a few defenses after Bxc3, however, they all lose due to the latent power of the e7 bishop, the exposure of the king, or the fact that the d7 bishop is hanging.
White can attempt to hold on to the bishop, but all attempts would fail. For example, 21. Bb5 d5! and the king can not avoid mate while also not dropping the g1 rook. For example, 21 Bb5 d5 22. Rd3 Qa1+ wins the rook.
Probably the best option for white to try to hold. After the exchange of queens, the game will go to the endgame where I will have material advantage, but it will still be tricky to convert the win.
Of course, white's first priority is to stop the advancement of the a pawn, however d4 may have been slightly better to prevent the knight from taking advantage of the e5 or c5 square.
?! Not following the proper plan. At this point, I really began to lose sight of what my main goal was. The bishop was supposed to be used to defend the pawn once it reached a3. Additionally, it gives white more time to block the pawn.
Now white has successfully blockaded the a pawn due to my poor play.
I decided to create a concrete plan to try to force the king into an uncomfortable position, then follow that up by attacking the weak pawns. Although I do drop the a pawn, perhaps I have some compensation because I can mobilize my pieces quickly to the queen side.
White must now be careful. If white allows me to get my rook on the b file then there are some mating threats that could arise.
! A good quiet move which allows white to defend the d3 pawn after 31...Nb4+ 32. Kb7 Rc5 33. Rgd1.
White has done a great job of defending, and I was beginning to fear that I may have let the win slip away. Since there is no more attacking lines, I decide to try my best to get the best position that I can before any major exchanges occur.
Forcing the king to the back rank. Of course white does not want to go to c7 or a7 because the knight check would force the exchange of rooks and black would be better because of the strong bishop.
?! Rb7+ was probably best to try and bait white to play 37. Kxd6?? Ke8! and white must continue with Rxb4, or otherwise mate is inevitable. This move gives white a good drawing chance after 37. Rb3! and I could not play Bxf4 because the knight would drop after Rdb1.
?! White is playing too defensively. Rb3! gives white good drawing chances since the bishop must stay back to defend the knight.
Giving some more breathing room for the bishop after a retreat c5. After this I have all the time in the world to plan the best way to continue.
Even though white has doubled rooks on the b file, there is no further way in which white can pursue an attack. Now I had a concrete plan, after 39...Bc5 40. d4 Be7 41. e5, I would find a way to place the my rook behind white's weak pawns which should result in a win.
Before I attempt to get my rook behind white's pawns, it is important to first force the king further away from the pawns and to relieve some pressure on the bishop.
! Finally finding a simple way to victory. Although material will once again be equal after 43. Rxb4 Bxb4 44. Rxb4, my rook can just drop behind white's pawns and pick them off since white's king can't defend them.
! An important in-between move. If I was to play 44...Ra2? right away, white can hold to a draw after 45. Kd7 Rxh2 46. Rb8+ Kg8 47. Ke7 Rf2 48. Rf8 Rxf4. Even though I would be up two pawns after this line, there is no way that I could convert my advantage since I can't move the rook off the f file to protect the f7 pawn while white's king could simply move back and forth to e7 and e8 to keep up the pressure on the pawn.
So white has a chance to defend one pawn at least, but after 45...Ra3 white must choose between keeping the d or f pawn.
Now that I will be up a pawn, it still won't  be a clear cut win. White can move the king to c5 to protect the d4 pawn to allow white's rook to defend the h and g pawns.
! This subtle move protects everything, for now at least. Any way in which I try to attack the h pawn would result in the rook backing it up with Rh2, then following it up with h4 to protect the g pawn.
This square movement that I just made with the rook may not appear to make too much sense, but it works out very well. After the king moves to c5, there is absolutely nothing that white can do other than move the rook back and forth along the h file to continue to protect the h pawn. This will give me all the time in the world to bring my king over to g7, after which I can follow that up with pawn to h6 to force a pawn exchange which will allow my king to attack the h pawn as well.
White is running out of time. Although I still can not play Rxh4? right away because of Rf2, my king still has room to run over to g4 to try and push the rook off of the h file.
So I continue with my plan, forcing the king back to c5 since my rook can now block after Rxd4, Rf2, Rf4.
Taking away the rook's last escape square on the h file, making Kg3 followed by the loss of the h pawn inevitable.
The rest of the game is mop up. All that I need to do now is push my g pawn to the promise land.
A last ditch effort to try and win the f pawn, but it is too late since the g pawn will promote well ahead of white's e pawn.
thought of knight c3 but then thought try to gain control of the centre with king pawn
did this to allow my knight out to c3 without him being able to force me to move it again by moving to b4
wasn't expecting that - i think this is to attack a1 rook with bishop whilst defending h8 rook
continue with my knight c3 move attack his pawn forcing a defensive move and protects king pawn as secondary measure
perhaps not the best move but bring this out for a cheeky attack on king via f7 pawn.  mproviding of course i can get some kind of back-up without him noticing
mmmm think now that this was previously planned on bishop move---I think now he may have expeceted queen move. i think this is to protect an attack on his a8 rook with my queen
maybe another ambitious move to attack pawn forcing either a take or bypass to allow me to capture c4 pawn with my bishop or if he leaves it i'll take it anyway pawn for pawn and expose my rook in process
Best bet now for me is to make room ready for castleing and try to see his intentions---
Needed to protect d4 pawn also c3 knight and a1 rook. I think this is best way as it also pushes me up the board sort of attack and defense in one
oh i see should have realised really allows knight out---is this to castle or attack c3 knight ?? I'll assume castle as i have queen to protect knight and can still move bishop to d2
good expecting this now plan attack on his a8 rook with my knight expecting to lose my black bishop and pawn on levelling then points and opening up the game
This is a really annoying move - if Bxe3 then Qxd3 and white has developed more than I had, and if my bishop moves, then I lose a tempo - white's bishop is perfect on d3.
Though this develops a piece, I actually think that c6 would have been better and if Qxb7 then Nbd7.
Trying to give my DSB a path.
Developing, and targeting my knight.
Flanky knight - as I call it. It has two other perfectly fine squares to go to, so why not go to them?
Pawn v rook - my rook has no active square to go to.
?? This occurred previously in one of my annotations - Why not to go to Scandinavia 1. This is a truly poisoned pawn, though rather this is less crude than the one that occurred in the Scandinavian annotation. Not Rb7?! but ...
Ra8! which traps the queen of the flight square a6 and leaves the queen with no good move. Let's sum up - it's rather pretty actually.<n><n>a6 and a5 is controlled by the a8-rook.<n>a8, b8, c7, d7 and e7 are controlled by the d8 queen.<n>b7 is controlled by the a5 knight.<n>c5 is controlled by the e4 knight.
The only move to gain the maximum material.
My opponent tries to open some lines against my king.
And black resigns here, thinking that after Re2 or Nf4/h4 he is doomed. But, other than the poisoned pawn, well played jagroop52. And I hope you enjoyed the game to. @oodle3.<n><n>EDIT (30/12/14): archduke_piccolo is right - white resigned, not black.
...I went to b4 anyway, and queen moved to...
Now I take the bishop.
And now I start to double my rooks.
This move equalizes material, but as the game progresses, knight tends to be stronger than bishop here, especially since the bishop is pinned by the rooks!
I decided to offer the trade anyway...
Again, taunting my king to march forward.
37 Rd8??? Finally the CPU buckles under my pressure.
Now I had the game in the bag.
But now, something changes. This is the first "real" move. Ok, no problem. I will retreat my bishop, and the naughty knight can go nowhere to be dangerous, while it is ready to be kicked away with c5 - or even e5, if I decide so.
Ok, the good thing is this way I will get some tempo, sooner or later, attacking h2. The bad part is that he will be able to press hard on the diagonal - and b7 if ever my pawn chain gets open. Which is not likely just now, but wait...
Normal, he wants to put a question mark on my pawn chain. Now, d4 is the "normal" move. He can exchange the pawns, or the bishop, but nothing too dangerous. So, I tried something more interesting... at a blitz sight.
Now I am the one that threats the white diagonal, and the nasty knight is mine. Look: incredibly enough, it is not that easy for him to defend d3! It just lacks of a minor piece behind it! Let's see what he does.
A lot of things are possible, here. If dxe6, the white bishop can take b7, threatening my rook, and e6 can take f7, giving check and weakening my king's position. On the other side, my bishop is threatening the rook f1, and the knight is approaching to a fork on c2. Normally, those forks are bad, because I will lose two pieces for a rook. BUT I had the feeling (I couldn't calculate it) that the knight will survive: look, after he takes the rook e1 (it will be there if he tries to save it), the queen would have taken the bishop and I will be able to play NxBf3 with check, so no danger...
He did the first part. I would have played dxe6, leaving me the decision to be greedy (BxRf1) or try to save the day with fxe6. This one is bad, since white throws in Bh5+ and my king goes dangerously out in the worst possible way, no matter BxR or Nc2, winning another rook, I will probably be lost. But he behaves... good boy!
I still have Nc2, but I didn't want to give away the B unless necessary. This way, I prevent some bad surprise on the diagonal, ensuring a retreat point for my bishop, etc. I think I could have though about c4, solidifying the bishop and making Nc2 much more dangerous, but I was not sure about e6xf7+...
Yes, the only flaw in the plan. But too bad and too late. Anyway, I have won the exchange, I only have to keep the knight and don't lose it.
I won't lose my nice d5 pawn, of course. In fact, he is more or less the knight safeguard. Now, in a blitz, it is very easy to become nervous and play Nc2, but I had the feeling it would have just made me lose the knight. So,the most important thing: "keep (or exchange) the knight".
I know he can exchange it, and probably he will get the pawn, too, but it is still better than lose the knight stupidly.
Too bad. I have to limit a little the action of the Nd4, and I thought the big diagonal would have been a fantastic place for my bishop, "looking" at b2.
Not accurate. It was not so dangerous Na5.
Now I'm playing changing plans: I thought that after a4 the knight have to fly, and my rook can go to c1. To change plans in the middle of one of them is always dangerous (if not bad).
No, I'm not trapping the rook, I just want to stay calm and exchange it so to avoid possible tricks. A pity, in a timed game this position deserves more accurate calculations.
In doing so, the a pawn will fall to my bishop, that is playing without moving (I love it!)
I know all the stuff about active pieces etc. etc.Probably Nb2 would have been better, but then Nc2 defends the a pawn... and, in the endgame to come, a bishop is good for him, so...
Now see what happens: his knight must fly soon, and I will take c3... or not?
He cannot keep his knight in the right position. Note that, being my king away, Nb1 forces me to use the rook to defend the a pawn, and he will win this fight with the help of his king.
Of course, the b pawn is my great secret weapon, and he doesn't want to let me use it. (For beginners: funny, isn't it? My rook's actios is blocked by my own pieces, so the ONLY way I have to break into white's "fortress" is with the "b" pawn - even if helped with the rest of the pieces. Great frustration comes when you are up in material and you lose... you always have to identify the "unbalancing" piece of manouvre of a "won" position, if you want to cash the full point. I fail in it often...)
Now I realized the king was not THE piece to break in with, so I avoided more checks.
White surrendered here. A pity. But another pawn will fall, and it was matter of time (and a little technique).
1. ........ Nf6 - the most popular reply to d4.  This game seems a non event, but a decoy tactic at the end livens it up and I hope will whet your appetite for the tactical melee game against patzerblitzer.
6. ......... Nbd7 - challenges the e5 knight.
10........... Be6 - my position seems rather cramped, but I somehow manage to get round the problem.
27. ......... Qc5  - ganging up on the passed c pawn.  For once I decline an invitation to swap queens!!!
30 ........... Bd4!! - this move forces instant resignation as the white queen is pinned to the king.  If the queen captures the bishop then white cops Old Matey on e1 by 31........ Qxe1#.  This is an example of a pin/decoy.
Team Match. Having played an awful lot of Sicilian Defense lately, I decide to take a break and try the Open Game, letting my opponent pick the opening. Probably unwise, but I felt like I needed a break from Sicily.
My Ruy Lopez. The opening I prefer when I'm white, but now the shoe's on the other foot. I fear I'm about to find out the hard way why I like this opening so much as white. I respond with the Morphy Defense.
The best move for black in the World DB, it prevents the white knight from playing to c4, forking queen and e5 pawn.
White prepares to push his pawn to d4 and also makes a hole for his knight on a3. Black pins the other knight to its queen.
We're quickly running out of DB games. This move was played once, by Ulrich Zenker (2282) as black vs. Stefan Pruefer (2202) and is the only one of the 3 moves in the DB with a favorable outcome for black. It puts quite a bit of pressure on the knight on f3, threatening to ruin the white kingside pawn structure without trading queens. However, 8. ... Qf3 threatens the same pawn structure and is harder for white to thwart effectively. Other alternatives that look appealing were 8. ... c5 and 8. ... Nf6. Still, I like to be aggressive, and Mr. Zenker did all right with this move, so I went with it.
The black bishop was en prise, and black's plans of pawn structure damage were thwarted by the knight on e3, so the bishop must either retreat (losing tempo) or attack. And now black develops with a threat against e5. Actually, at the time, I thought this was quite clever, since white has no way to save the pawn.
White found a great response. Initially, I considered 11. ... Qxe4 but I chickened out. In retrospect, this may be where this game took a turn for the worse. After 12. ... Bd6 the position looks secure enough and the queen looks safe enough, and black could castle to either side as he sees fit. And I would have been a pawn up. But that e4 pawn looks poisonous. I can't put my finger on it. I don't like my king and queen on the same open file, even when I have a pawn on the file. Further, if white could drive away the black queen, then black's e5 pawn would fall. Two reasons to be wary, though I couldn't see any way for white to exploit either of them. Still, my hackles raised, I avoided the pawn for reasons unseen.
A move ago, with my e5 pawn lacking support, Qxe4 looked dangerous. Now it looks much more appealing. White's threat on b5 is not yet worriesome; it offers black a chance to undouble his c-pawns if white exchanges.
I was feeling pretty good about this game right about now. A pawn ahead and a solid position. Let's try to exchange the big guns and win the endgame.
The black rook on a8 was en prise, and 15. ... e4 saves the rook and establishes a 4-3 kingside pawn majority.
16. ... Qe6?! was a weak move by black. 17. Qxe6 fxe6 accomplishes part of my goal of exchanging the big guns, but at a horrible cost to black's pawn structure. Still, I think it would be worth it. In retrospect, I think I would do something differently next time. Maybe 0-0-0.
This seemed quite equitable to me at the time. White's queenside pawns are ruined and black still has a 3-2 kingside pawn advantage. White does gain a passed pawn in the center, but it is easily attacked.
21. Qf3! is powerful. It pins black's knight on e5 and it puts a lot of pressure on black's pawn on f7, tying black's queen to defend two different directions - always a danger. Even worse, black's backward pawn on a6 is also in danger, though it is adequately defended, but black is defending it with a queen and a rook, two pieces that should have better things to do. Black's plan is to play 22. ... f5 to defend the knight and eliminate most of white's threat down the f-file.
White gives black no time for his own plans, first attacking the queen then then knight. However, with one attacker removed from f7, the king isn't needed to defend that pawn anymore. This was probably black's losing move, however. The idea was to get the king off of the open e-file before white's rook can skewer the queen to the king. This frees up black's queen and knight to move again, rather than being stuck in defensive mode. It also puts pressure on white's d-pawn. Unfortunately, these advantages are gained at the cost of the now defenseless a6 pawn, a cost I felt black could afford, since I was ahead by a pawn. But now I'm not so sure this was the right plan. I think black would have been better off sticking with 23. ... f5.
26. Nc2! is an amazing move. So quiet, yet so powerful. White leaves his rook on a5 hanging, free for black to gobble it up. Sure, white gains black's knight on e4, so black only wins the exchange, but there seems no other threat. So I looked deeper. No way my opponent gave up the exchange for nothing. The knight on c2 attacks b4 and keeps the black king from using that as an escape route against the checks to come. I quickly realize that white is about to win black's queen and knight for the cost of two rooks, and that I have no way out of it. Not taking the rook on a5 is worse than taking it.
White threatened mate in 2 with Ra1+, so black's king must retreat in order to escape to b7.
And now the material has been exchanged and black's bishop was en prise. White doesn't have enough material to force a won endgame. I'm hoping to stick it out for a draw, beginning with doubling the rooks on the d-file. Again, I miss a killer response by white.
Final position. White's pawn threatens the black bishop. Black can capture that pawn in two different ways, or retreat the bishop. Any retreat is met with 33. Qa8#. 32. ... Rxd6? is met with 33. Qa8+ and 34. Qxh8. And 32. Bxd6 is met with 33. Qa8+ Bb8 34. Qc6+ Rc7 35. Qa6+ Kd1 36. Qf6+ (any) 37. Qxh8. No matter what black does, he loses at least a rook. Time for black to resign. An excellent win for white. Well played.
Black makes this move centering his knight with tempo, however it is very vulnerable to being trapped with c3.
It's hard to miss how completely undefended the light squares are for black.
Keeping the black queen along the 8th rank; as if it left, Qe8# follows.
Bringing the knight in on the attack
This game was a relatively short one with mistakes from both sides. I was white, and my opponent was black. In this game, I decided to play 1. e4 in order to free diagonals for my bishop and queen, and to place a pawn in the center. This pawn, as seen in many games, can be a hindrance to Black's offensive play because this is the first move that takes control of the center.
This is not the best move because Black gets a development lead after 2. ...Nxe4 3. Bxf7+ Kxf7 4. Qh5+ g6 5. Qd5+ d6 6. Qxe4. At this stage, White's pieces are chatting on the back rank while Black already has a semi-secure king and lines for his pieces to develop. In addition, a Queen in the center is not a good thing.<n><n>When I played this move, I wanted to see what would happen. In tournament situations, nine times out of ten I would play 2. e5.<n><n>Viable Alternatives: e5, Nc3, and others which are proven.
I suppose this is an okay move. I myself have never witnessed this, but it seems like Black wants to play a system. Black likely knew that the e4 pawn was a gambit.<n><n>Viable Alternatives: e5, d5, e6, or other sound moves.
I overlooked Nxe5 with this move. After 4. ...Nxe4 5. Nxe4 d5!, the "Fork Trick", my e4 pawn is lost, and I am left with a clumsy f4 pawn. It would have proved to be hard to recover from.<n><n>Viable Alternatives: d3, Nf3
This move was my expected outcome. Black loses his center pawn, and I can freely play d4. The idea of leaving my king-side diagonal exposed appalled me, so I remedied that.
This move takes control of the center, seals up the imaginary exposed diagonal, an prevents most future movements of the Black f4 pawn. In the King's Gambit and other similar openings, this move is infrequently omitted.<n><n>Viable Alternatives: d3 and d4 possibly
Was this move to protect the f4 pawn? The rest of Black's moves from here on out were not the best. In this case, although the bishop is developed, Black gets to castle, and the f4 pawn is protected, it is dangerous to have a bishop and knight abreast to a semi-open file with a pawn that is ready to fork them. In addition, the d7 pawn is blocked. Without having to remove the bishop from d6, the only way the c8-bishop can develop is with ...b6, and this is deemed slow in King's Pawn Openings.
I knew that Bd6 was not a very sound move, so I decided to play safe. This move gets the king safer, and is one step closer to the connection between the rooks.<n><n>Viable Alternatives: d3, d4
Beware of Greeks bearing gifts. I was sure that this was not one of those.<n><n>I might have played Qe2 or Re1, but a winning exchange is a winning exchange. In my mind, there was no reason to take chances.
Was that a move to castle? On the bright side, Rf8 prepares for an eventual f5 pawn push. This never happened in the game.<n><n>On the dark side, this move clusters the king, and this was the reason why I won in a meager nine moves.
This was an inaccuracy by me. I should have played Nxd6 to get Black double-isolated-d-pawns, and finally play those moves to crush the king. I considered it, but I decided to take a chance. Besides, I was already up a knight.
This is an excellent move as it prepares for a defended f5 pawn push. This push will retreat my knight and the king-side pawns will eventually smother White.<n><n>This would have been an excellent move under different circumstances in a different game. As of now, this is a blunder as it lets me checkmate in two ways.
I chose the foreman, winning the bishop.<n><n>I understand that this was not the most instructive game due to the four mistakes Black had played in succession, but for novices, this game might teach a little about the opening and center control.<n><n>For more advanced players, I don't think this helped too much, but more experience leads to stronger play, right? I hope you all enjoyed, and a belated Happy New Year!
Strange decision to play this move. For instance, all white has to do is to capture on c4 with the bishop, and he has already the threat Qb3. The light squared bishop is poorly placed. In this opening, we will see that simply following the fundamental(and mistakenly called "beginner" or "basic") principles, we can find the BEST move in each of the positions quickly. Here, black should have played ...Nf6, getting the least active piece. I should also note that without any calculation, this move is not best The bishop was already active, so we shouldn't move it again.
It's a necessary move to make. Now white should simply castle or play Nc3, but we can also do the move h3, which should be best, putting the question to the bishop.
Once again, we should have simply played with the least active piece Nf6. Really, we can find the best moves in one second if we just use the base principles. Who knows, maybe this bishop would like to go to e7. In that case, there is an issue of flexibility as well.
White now needed to play the move of 8.e4 with a good position. If the move of e5 gets to happen, a piece will be lost, and white will have a permanent space advantage in the kingside(at least for the whole middlegame, good for an attack). Not only that, black could not even have played move of 8...e5 9.dxe5 Bxe5 10.Bxf7+ and white is simply winning. I should also mention that the move e4 would free the dark squares bishop.
I would not have played this move. It weakens the kingside light squares, and is just making too great of a concession on the kingside. At least, if a kingside weakening is called for, play h3 instead, and Bh2+ gives black nothing.
Not the best move. It has a clear idea to stop the white development of his dark squared bishop, but white can easily stop the idea. He should have simply played Nbd7, then considered a choice break move, of e5 probably, but c5 could also be possible in some lines.
White needs to move his piece again to free himself, and the move is actually not so bad.
When there is a contact between the pieces, we should keep it up unless it gives us a real tactic. Usually, releasing the tension gives the opponent activity. Now black has lost his defensive knight on the kingside, while white has freed himself nicely. Black should have played Nbd7.
It fails to a tactical shot, which to white's credit, he finds. Many players rated in that area would not be able to find the move.
I don't think the rest of the game needed an annotation-Black slowly converted his advantage.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This game was played nearly two years ago against my mentor, Ionadowman.  It has only been now that I could bring myself to annotate it as I was the victim here.  Some mistakes stay in the memory for a long time.  I had almost forgotten that game until my buddy Bob Jacobs lost big material in a recent game (which I will be annotating shortly as The Perils of Giving a Check) against me because he was lulled into a false sense of security by giving a check - it therefore revived the painful memories and I thought that some catharsis was necessary to try and get this loss out of my system once and for all.  One constructive way of doing this is to put this annotation into the Knights Coaching Project Forum because I feel it will be a useful learning tool for the guys who are taking part in Master Freddy's minefield of a Knights Coaching Project Mini-tournament.  Anyhow, the game becomes a Four Knights Game.   We start with the move 1. e4 which is a common starter among players and especially recommended to beginners because it opens lines for the WB on c1 - also to the WQ who can get to h5 - although Master Freddy played the Patzer Opening against me, regicide manuals do not recommend it to beginners!
5. Nd5 - Ion does not recapture with Nxd4 - Qxd4?? is scuicidal because the WQ who in this instance I call the Wicked Witch of the West (enemy queen and very wicked she can be!) will drop to the black knight placed on c6.  This move is called The Belgrade Gambit - possibly because it was popular in that particular country!
5. ..... Be7 - this developing move is in accordance with my style, it develops a piece and prepares castling.  You, the Inquest Jury - feel free to study the immediate play of 6. Nxe4 or Nxd5 by using the database.
7. 0-0 - both sides tuck their kings away on the kingside.  I now open up the diagonal for my lsb (named Fou Leblanc) by playing d6.  This move holds back e5 and now follows a plethora of exchanges.
11. Qd3 - Fou Lenoir (my dark square bishop) forces the Witch to retreat - she chooses d3 which indirectly hits at h7, with a lsb on the board I must watch out for Old Matey (checkmate) on h7.
11. c6 - this move drives back the lsb.  Let's see if I can use this to gain better piece placement here.
14. ..... g6 - a precaution against such a line up and indeed it is necessary to prevent Fou Lenoir being lost to Ion's pawn plonking himself on e5.  You wouldn't think this move would be possible would you?  It is when your opponent finds himself in Old Matey's shadow (threatened with mate) and has no holding checks available to escape from the discovered attack.
17. ...... Rxd8 - queen trade - I like this trade because it enables me to centralise my QR which now occupies the open d column.  Rooks do belong on open and half-open files.
23. ..... Bg7 - If I move Henry my king to e7 then I lose Fou Leblanc outright to Bxe4 so I play this move.  Now Henry is decoyed from the BR on e8 by Bxg7+.  Henry must recapture and now Ion plays the deadening Re1 putting Fou Leblanc in a pin.  I have 3 options, I can lose Fou Leblanc, I can drop the exchange or I can wave the white flag (resign) on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  I chose Option 3.  If you, the Inquest Jury (dear readers) have any comments on an alternative plan to 22. ...... Be4 please feel free to comment.  Hope you have had a good read - bye for now - Joanne
Black built up a series of small advantages to break through and win a pawn on move 20.  The game continued with a rook on the 2nd rank that confined white's king, allowed black to advance up the board, and mate.<n><n>Please feel free to message me if you have comments, questions, or find any mistakes.
The Sicilian defence breaks symmetry by contesting the d4 square with the c pawn rather than the e pawn.  White often attacks the kingside while black obtains a queenside advantage.<n><n>Grandmaster John Nunn noted that the reason for the Sicilian Defence%u2019s popularity %u201Cis its combative nature; in many lines Black is playing not just for equality, but for the advantage. The drawback is that White often obtains an early initiative, so Black has to take care not to fall victim to a quick attack.%u201D
?! - Dubious.  White's kingside bishop can already be developed via e2, so weakening the kingside castle is unneccessary.<n><n>Better is Nc3, contesting the center d6 square.
?! - Dubious.  Developing the queen too early often leads to a loss of tempo as she is attacked and forced to move multiple times.<n><n>Better is Nc3.
After the exchange, white is left with a backward pawn on the half-open d file.  This will become the focus for an attack.
Developing with tempo.
Moving the rook off of the long diagonal and preparing to fianchetto the lightsquared bishop to counter white's bishop.  It may have been better to play b6, allowing Bb7 next move.
Finally developing the 2nd white knight, but too late to influence the earlier exchange.
Opening up the bishop and threatening black's knight.  Also threatens mate (Qxh7#) if black's f6 knight can be lured away.
Forcing the queen to retreat again.
White's queen has moved 4 times and returned to her original square, effectively wasting 4 moves.  During that time, black has developed all but one of his pieces and constructed a solid pawn chain supporting a centralized knight.<n><n>However, advantages in development and time are temporary and need to be taken advantage of immediately or the opponent will have the opportunity to equalize.
Countering the strong white bishop.
Exchanging the bishops leaves the pawns around white's king weak.  The exchange also lifted black's rook, enabling black to to easily double pieces on the half-open d file.
Attempting to trade off black's dominating centralized knight.
Protecting the rook from Nf3 (or Bb2, though that would give up the d pawn).<n><n>16...Ne4?! 17. Nxe4 Rxe4 18. Bb2 would isolate black's rook in the center and give white some counterplay.
Ne4 may have been better as this regulates the knight to the edge of the board for most of the rest of the game.  Perhaps white was expecting to follow it up with Ng4, forcing the rook to retreat.
Eliminating the potentially dangerous bishop.
The exchange leaves black with a rook on the 2nd rank, where it will dominate the rest of the game.<n><n>The power of a rook on the 2nd rank is two fold: it confines the king to the back rank and forces the opponent to defend pawns with pieces.
Attempting to defend the a pawn.  Unfortunately, white has few alternatives.  Ng5 (or Ng4) followed by h3 would have driven the black knight off, but would have surrendered the queenside pawns in the process.  <n><n>Ng5 followed by Nf3 would have forced black to either give up the d file or the 2nd rank.  If black could have seized the d file, it may have been worth the a and b pawns.
Preventing Nf4.<n><n>If 27. Kf3 then f5 traps the king and forces a further loss of time.
Abandons the h pawn, hoping to attack the rook.
Offering to trade the a pawn for black's e pawn.
Since the d file is now closed, black feels safe enough to pick up the unprotected a pawn.
Finally mobilizing the king.  As more pieces leave the board, the king becomes more and more powerful.  He'll need to escort the pawns forward and eventually help give mate.
The check just pushes black's king where he wants it.  Better would be Rd8 forcing black to be careful of the pawn.
leaving the center fight for after. Is it a good strategy ? I think that there is no hurry to place paws in the center.
this pawn will be soon exposed and then black will have to defend it
preventing the treath on g7, but opening the h5/e8dangerous diagonal. It will serve me after
i can tak this risk because the black queen cannont go to h5 for the moment, so i have the time to play this gambit, taking back with queen or knight, i still dont decided it
better with the knight in order to castle
this is good, but if i play carrefully, there is no problem for the moment i can go on
in order to move my DSB in c1 to take the h6 black knight
was it good this  move ? i stil ask my self, any way i will go on attacking, ignoring the exchange of pawns, and this is the better response because if i take c5, then black take back whith there DSB and they will make white castle impossible
i have to move the king
now i have the way to h5 opened
now the black king have to move an loose castle possibility
anticipating the treath on f7, of course i will try to get advantage on it, instead of the 2 knight preventing it...
i whant to Rf1xf6, so i will take the black DSB, the black queen will have to take back and f6 will be mine. But first i will take Ke5 to open f colon king's protections
Easy, i will win the black queen and then mate this poor black king !
Not really sure why white played this, other than that it may have been in the DB. It invites some early exchanges but it doesn't seem to be overly advantageous.
Pinning the black knight to... nothing.
The black pawn on d6 is pinned so it's time to charge in and make a nuissance of myself.
13. ... Nxd6 seems natural, but it loses a pawn. Better was 13. ... Qxd6 which seems to hold on to even material at the cost of isolating a black pawn on the d-file.
Black avoids exchanging queens, but white is eager to eliminate material now. This move has the added advantage of defending the white pawn on a2 that was en prise and it forks the black queen and the black pawn on b7.
Forks the black queen and the pawn on a7. I thought surely this would force the issue, trade queens, since black wouldn't want to lose another pawn.
Black threatened a mate in 2.
Sights on e8, though not quite enough firepower on that square to make it work yet.
Defending mate in 1. I'm beginning to wonder if I can win this position. Black has multiple powerful attacks down the half-open files at white's king, and white has no similar attacking avenues because of the very two pawns by which he ahead in material.
Black threatens the white rook on e1. It's defended, but I've been known to move the wrong rook in other games... My goal here is to get my rooks in front of my king and block the attacks on the half-open files, maybe trade some rooks while I'm at it, and maybe even triple my attack down the d-file hoping for a back-rank mate.
And there's my blunder. 27. Rc3?? just throws away the rook for nothing. My thinking? I glanced at the position, I knew I wanted to use my rooks on the third rank to block black's files, and the rook is guarded by two pieces. Even better, after black moves his queen, white would play Rxc8 and exchange one pair of rooks. I moved too fast, completely overlooking the fact that the pawn on b2 is pinned. The position just seemed so safe, I didn't give it the attention it deserved. I hardly gave it any attention at all.
And that's it, from ahead by two pawns to down by a rook. I wonder if there's still a win, or a draw, here, banking on three adjacent pawns, supported by a rook and king. Can white promote? Can white threaten to promote strongly enough that black must give up a rook to prevent it? I played out numerous continuations from here, but I didn't find a way to force that to happen. Not much to see from this point on...
Trying to be sneaky. I'm dead anyway, might as well bait the trap. If black plays 32. ... Rxb4??? then white wins with 33. Rd8#. I know, it's too obvious, but hey, so was 27. Rc3?? and I still blew it. One can always hope for a little tit for tat.
Now I'm mostly just stalling. Frankly, I had a nice winning streak going and had several other games about to reach favorable conclusions (including my other match game against this opponent), thereby extending the streak. So I'm dragging my feet a bit. Hey, if black wants a quick win, he should force a quick win. Too petty? Well, until black breaks up his pawns, or at least plays Kf8, I'm still hoping he might slip up. And at least I had the courtesy to tell him directly over the e-board in the game comments.
Most players play e5 here, where dxe5 dxe5 Nxe5 Nxe4! usually favors Black, but I prefer the c5-break since e5 O-O Nc6 d5 Ne7 Ne1 usually favors White.
The Accelerated Dragon from the Sicilian could reach this position, and also a lot of different Nf3 openings. The Maroczy Bind is feared by some players, but I am happy playing against it since I am familiar with its principles. White wants to consolidate and slowly grind me down, so I need to break the bind before White can consolidate
I couldn't find a clear plan here, so I prepared to bring my king to the center in the ensuing endgame.
White is following the rule about bringing the king to the center in the endgame, but he really overdid it in this game. The king doesn't have a role yet.
Not really a good move, I wasn't going to trade my good knight for that crappy bishop
There's no hope for White now, try to find the mate.
White resigned, as there is no way to stop Rc5#, this goes to show that king in the center is not always a good rule to follow, it usually is good to put the king in the center during the endgame, just don't get mated!
I decide not to risk the b pawn.
Black decides to retreat.
A useful in between move before White brings the Q over to the h file.
Better to play 4. ... Nf6 or 4. ... Nd7 since it is better to get the knights out before the bishops.
27. Rxg2!! nails down the knight because, if he moves, the king is checkmate!
This is the better move! If 30. ... Kh8, then 31. Bxf2 Bxf3 32. Bd4  and white wins, instead of black. Goes to show you that you have to be careful, even in the face of victory!
must block the b1-h7 diagonal for my King if I want to take the b5-Pawn.
In today's episode of I annotate a game I enjoyed playing, we play a peculiar opening, I sac a piece for an attack, my opponent defends reasonably well, I wonder if I'm winning, and then rely on a mass of pawns to carry me to victory. In all seriousness this game was a lot of fun to play and I think shows one possible way to break down a fiancetto structure and also shows some mistakes not to fall into. This was a game in a GK tournament against a lower rated opponent and I really wanted to play well. Let's see what happened.
Not the french after all. This is already something of an odd move that I don't see very much. This is a Lengfellner system and seems to be good for white. It's not that this is so much of a mistake as it is just very passive. Black can play g7 and b7 and aim for some sort of hedgehog system or something similar, but giving white this nice center and easy development seems not to be such a great idea. On the other hand if you play this a lot as black you'll run into people who don't know how to break such structures down and can get an opening advantage from just general lack of knowledge on how to play against these systems.
With the pawns on d6 and e6 black needs to develop somehow.
The most natural square for the Knight. It seems likely black will play Nf3 or Ne7, Bg7 and O-O. I might be able to jump into g5 and really pressure this structure with this move.
A fine place for the bishop. I was currently thinking of Qd2 O-O-O and some sort of kingside attack.
This move seems slow and as Nc6 is probably coming at some point kind of tangles up black's pieces in a needless way. If I were to play black I might suggest b6 aiming for Bb7. Not how I normally play but probably fine.
Still passive but probably reasonably solid. I wonder if this is aiming at some f5 break after O-O. Not sure if that's good as white is clearly going queenside and so opening the kingside seems better for white but it is a plan.
This right now looks dubious to me. At least some Nc6 here develops and lets black consider going queenside as well. This is asking white to jam the h-pawn up the board. So of course I...
don.t. Clever me. This move is actually fine and something I plan on playing. Bxh6 Qxh6 with N5 to follow is clearly not good for black so taking is kind of out of the question right now and the bishop is pinned to the rook so this structure isn't going anywhere. Any time white wants to they can take on g7 and rid black of his best defender. But if I were to do it again h4 h5 and g4 g5 are really asking to be played here. Not a mistake, but also not the best. Against this structure with opposite side castles always h4. Look at the dragon. Same idea.
This is very weakening. Striking in the center is a good idea if you're being attacking in the flank to try to create some counterplay but here d5 looks better. The main reason why I like d5 so much more than e5 is because of the holes that lead straight to the king. Also Bxh6 is...ok. Not great with pieces gathering to attack, but ok. Maybe Nc6 is also fine. Nothing to panic about yet.
Developing with tempo and forcing the king to a corner where white controls all the square around the black king.
The computer suggesting giving the d pawn to white with 10..d5 11. Nxd5 Be6 but to me that idea almost asks white to come and rip their position open with a nice easy 12. dxe5 and it looks like black is falling apart. This is not great either but perhaps white will make a mistake in the attack? so far material is equal.
?? oh no. This is much too hasty and gives back a lot of the advantage that white has. Why? Because now g5 closes a lot of white's pieces out of the position. Better is g4 or taking on g7 and trying to rip open the center with dxe5 and taking advantage of the pressure and development. Not a game losing mistake, but white has gone from much better to slightly better with this move.
Too soon. 11..Bxh6 12. Qxh6 g5 locks the queen up in the corner where she isn't so useful. White can now take on g7 and strike in the center or something similar. Trapping the opponent's queen so close to your king with no escape square seems rough but it would slow white's attack down and give black time to develop and try a counterattack or something.
!? A sweet piece sacrifice. At the time I thought this was winning by force but I didn't calculate as well as I should have. White is winning pawns for the pieces and with a weak black king is still better but this is not as good as the more solid (also more natural) dxe5. Consider the following line options. 13. dxe5 fxe5 14. Qxg5+. Clearly good for white, getting the same check in without giving up the piece. 13. dxe5 dxe6 14. Nxe5! (see how with the open d-file with a pin against the bishop the Knight sacrifice is suddenly much stronger) fxe5 15. Qxg5+ Ng6 (15..Kh8 is mate in 2. Nice little puzzle if you missed it) and then just 16. Qg3 with many pins to win. White is winning back the piece easily, will be up at least 2 pawns, open and controlled h file, pinning the bishop down the d file a bishop and knight controlling important squares around the king and getting ready to make a mating net. Other options are also 13. h6+ (flexible move stopping black playing it at some point but maybe the king is safer on h8 where Qxg5 isn't a check? hard to say.)
Alright. When you sac you have ask yourself what concrete things you get for the sac and weigh them against the sac. Here white has given up a knight and in return gets: 1. 2 pawns (not material equality but not so bad) 2. A free tempo (very useful in this sharp position) 3. Black has a very airy king (making his position hard to play due to tactics that might be coming. 4. more active play (also easier to make moves) (This of course would be true without the piece sacrifice and is really the reason that not sacrificing is better). <n>So white is better, and clearly has compensation for the piece. White just had a better line.
Of course not Ng6 giving back the piece + better position. Only way to try to hold on.
As I look over this game I wonder why it was so hard to see dxe5. It is better here also. Again pinning down the d-file seems like something to be desired. White had a tempo and used it to...allow the knight into a better square? offer a queen trade. Not my finest set of moves in a row.
With a clear threat of taking on c7 gaining back an exchange and a pawn. Taking on d5 here allows the knight into the center of the board to become a monster. it would now be a mistake.
Hey look! I played. like...6 moves too late. But it's still fine here. I assumed knight would take back and I would be able to play f4 with tempo later on. Seems fine. Either way I'm still gainin the c7 pawn.
Well. Not gaining c7 after all. But gaining a much less good a6 pawn, or so I thought when I first saw this move. After I moved to c7 it dawned on me that this actually lets me take the d6 pawn, which is much better. This is a blunder I think. White has better (only slightly at this point) piece activity and better pawns and more pawns (technically material is equal) but this move allows for 3 connected passed pawns down the middle with rooks to back them up. taking on e5 and giving up 2 pawns for piece activity is probably the way to go. Maybe white is still better (computer seems to think white is slightly better there) but there are fighting chances.
This seems to lose a tempo. This pawn doesn't matter much and black needs to unravel somehow.
Preparing to push the pawns.
Nope. Gives a pawn back but win the piece back with passers to spare. I also considered taking on e6 here, but as it turns out, both are fine. 24. Nxe6 Bxe6 25. F4 with connected passer should still be enough to win.
The computer tells me Nxe1 is mate in 9. I knew that after 27. dxc8=Q Rxc8 28. Rxe1 I was up a piece and had a passer on the 6th rank. Which seemed good.
One of the main problems that becomes clear in black's postion is that he has back rank problems. For example if Rcxc2 then Re8 is mate on the spot. This second weakness (back rank) is really the reason white is so far ahead. That and the fact that they're material up and close to queening.
The rest is somewhat uninteresting. I'll show the rest with a few comment but the pawn is too strong. The plan is just Nc5 and pawn to d7 and Re1 -> e8 and queening. Simple. hard to stop. winning.
That pawn is untouchable because of mate on back rank but also must be taken because Re8 is mate after queening on e8
And black resigns. They are losing another pawn (or two) giving white a passer. The pawn on h6 is still annoying and if white ever wins the h7 pawn is close to queening. This position is so hard because there really isn't counterplay. Just sit around and hope for a mistake. Thanks for reading. I really enjoying playing this game and thought I was totally winning somewhere around the sacrifice but missing dxe5 meant I really had to try. Both my opponent and I made some mistakes in the midgame but it was hard fought and I thought we both fought back as well as well could.
h6 was surprise for me, but after a short thinking I decided to play as I usually play when Saco is passive and open my pieces
On that move I replied with quick castling and from now I felt I will be ready to attack very soon as his queen is open to my attacks
Qf6 only gave me option to open my knight, but I was thinking about c3 or d4, which for some reason I didn't like and as his queen is still out I felt I can use my small pieces to attack quicker
once again, c6 was total surprise to me... Only logical explanation is if I play Nd5, but there I would lose rook instantly...
with this move queen was able to move back to square 1!
This was my chance to take bishop and terminate 2 bishops strength later in the game where they would become powerful.
I had to work my way to remove his queen from e6 pawn...
Re5 attacking open queen and his queen was slowly running out of safe squares... One idea was if he plays it to f6 then Rxe6+ and taking queen for rook and bishop, but...
This was only safe square and it appeared far away from king...
After long thinking about possibilities here, I finally decided to gambit my bishop... Weighing certain loss of this game if I was unsuccessful in my combination...
After he took that bishop I knew I had to play my queen in and best one was with a check
I had to take this valuable pawn from centre and perhaps hope for Qe8#, but Saco is not bad player to miss such a threat
I wanted to open d6 square
Saco offered exchange, but being one piece down, I couldn't afford to take it and ease his situation
I thought if I take this piece with queen I would lose my momentum and my rook would't be as useful, so I attacked with rook, leaving my queen to take his rook if desired next, or...
Finally his queen is gone and I can take his rook after this move...
I guess this move was to move pinned pawn away and open bishop there attacking my queen, yet...
It is time to move in my final artillery piece in and try to work out mate soon, especially as all of his pieces are in awkward positions
Forced, note that if 11...Kf8 12.Nxa8 Qxa8 13.Qd6+! followed by 14.Qa3 and 15.b4 will snare my bishop. I'm not so sure about 11...Ke7 though, if anyone has analysis that would be great.
I couldn't find a good plan besides trying to get the knight to that newly created hole on d4 via f8 and e6 and trying to get my a7 knight back into play with Nb8, planning Nac6. I didn't like the looks of 21...Nxb5 because it gives up the A file.
Encouraging 26.fxe5 because after i take with the D pawn, i get the D file.
Here i thought he had to take with the rook and then i had Nc2, but it doesn't really matter now.
The bishop is very strong here, as it guards f7 and b7, and still keeps a eye on g2. Also, when my king gets off the seventh rank, it will almost be impossible to advance his passed pawns.
The best move to try for a win.
Haha, my king is in the center but he can't mate me!
Probably not the best. White cannot save a pawn here e.g. 51.g3 Nf3+ 52.Kh3 Be6+ 53.Kg2 Nxh4+, but i think giving up the H pawn is better then giving up the G pawn.
I could not find a continuation for 51...Rxg2+ after 52.Kh3. Also, this threatens mate with the nice Nf3#
Stopping Qxh7 (not that it matters too much) and trying to weave a mating net around white's entrapped king.
rook came to give life
Fleeing the King
Hi everyone, here is a game between me and my buddy dmaestro.  It starts out with a Bird's Opening 1.f4 and transposes into a King's Gambit.  This has not been my most successful opening, particularly with this opponent, but, somehow I find the best opening moves and gradually get through the middle game without too many probs and end up in a drawish endgame.  I steel myself to play out the 50 move rule, but, jury, just look at my opponent's stats and see how many games he has drawn.  Nevertheless it looks to be heading that way this time, but at the end there was a twist to the tale in my favour!
10. Nxf4 - I now get my pawn back.  Black develops his knight to c6 putting pressure on d4 to which I counter with a threat to c7 with Nb5.
13. Qf2 - contests f file and relieves pin on f4 horsie.
15. Nc3 - after a pawn swap my knight retreats to c3.
18. ....... hxg6 - after a plethora of exchanges the position has changed a lot in the space of a few moves.  Now comes an exchange of bishop for knight.
38. ........ d5 - a pawn move.  Dmaestro has no further safe pawn moves so it looks as though we may have to play out the 50 move rule.
41. Ke5 - I dare not stray from f4 - I need to avoid a f4 pawn break if Henry goes to d6 for example.
47. ....... Ke6?? - with 40 moves of the 50 move rule to play out black leaves his bishop en prise.  He realises this and resigns before I play Kxe3.  It is quite easy to fall asleep in an endgame like this.  Beware - you could be in for a very rude awakening!
one of the most dangerous setups against the Sicilian. White is very clear about his intent to over run black on the king side with a quick g2-g4-g5.
The a solid but semi passive approach that develops the bishop and prepares to castle king side. Which in my opinion is risky because white's whole game is on the king side so often if black does not play accurate can get crushed very quickly. If I were playing this game I would have opted for the alternative 7. ...Qc7 with the plan of mobilizing the queen side as quickly as possible and planting a knight on c5. For example, 7...Qc7 8. Qd2 Nbd7 9. g4 h6 is relatively unexplored territory. Which is kinda weird for the Sicilian.
a very active move that takes advantage of the fact that black is playing somewhat passive. Furthermore, there is some major dangers for black in ignoring his queen side development. Especially since the most common way for black to handle white's king side attack is to create a strong attack on the queen side. When playing the Sicilian one must take on the attitude of the boxer. When your opponent punches right you punch left. So sitting back and playing "sound positional" chess usually lands you in hot water. For me the warning signals are already going off for black here because g4 is coming and black has virtually no counter play against it.
The best way to deal with a wing attack is to counter in the center. The only issue I have about this move for black is that it deflects a key defender away from the king and gives almost no hope for a win. Black is essentially playing for a draw.
white keeps up with the pressure and methodically continues with his plan. Still unless white can manage to create a chink in black's armor there is no winning formula.
developing the queen but I think the more active 11...b5 is preferable. At very least black has a chance to create some much needed activity on the queen side with for example, 11. ...b5 12. a3 Bb7 13. 0-0 Nb6+=
Hum, at first glance this looks like a good move. But White's follow up refutes this as it exploits black's king safety issue. I have to admit that it is very hard to provide an improvement to this move. However, based upon the results of this game and my over the board analysis perhaps black can hope for 12. ...Rd8 13. Qh5 g6 14. Qg4 Bb4 15. h4 Bxc3 16. bxf3 Qxf3+ 17. Ke2 being unclear. But the main point of 12...Rd8 is that it allows the d7-knight to go to f8 defending the king side. In such situations the knight is a much better defender than the rook.
The oh no moment for black as I am sure he realized that 15...g6 fails to the 16. Qg4 and 17. h4 combination. This move leads to a clear advantage for white. Best in my opinion is to allow white to try his luck on the king side via. 15...Rd8( takes real ball to play this) 16. g6 fxg6 17. Qxg6 Bf8 aiming for the queen exchange later on. As exchanging the queens would reduce white's chances of a win.
planning the Rg3-h3 to threaten mate on h8
black has to move his rook to give the king an escape route
In summary, black played a near perfect game. White just simply was able to take advantage of a couple slight oversights that lesser mortals would have gotten away with. The most telling feature of this game was the issue of king safety as black through out the game did very little to slow the white advance on the king side. While at the same time doing little to create counter chances on the queen side. This necessarily does not mean black should loss but it does mean that his life is made much harder if he ignores whites' king side overtures. It is telling that for most of the game black's queen side forces remained undeveloped. Finally, it is difficult to pin point the exact point where black went astray but maybe the line 7. ...Be7 needs to be reexamined in favor of 7...Qc7 8. Qd2 Nbd7 9. g4 h6. Another possible improvement may come on move 12 where black played 12. Nc5 going for activity but ultimately taking a key king side defender away from where it is needed the most. This is why I suggest 12...Rd8 allowing the d7-knight to come back to the defense of the king quickly via f8.
Why I was drawn to this move - I honestly cannot say, I rarely play such gambits against players, let alone computers. But I had been practicing it recently, and it was worth a try to see how a computer dealt with it.
I assumed this would be the continuation that Excalibur would select. Computers tend to grab material wherever they can. I predict the computer will return to c5.
I chose the most active continuation in what is now a rare, if not dead, opening. In a twisted way, White has surrendered a flank pawn (and isolated the a-pawn) in exchange for dominance in the centre of the board. This means that White must play positionally, or attempt to win materal back if this isn't possible. Common variations usually see a bishop on a3, a queen in b3, and the rooks firing ominously down the centre.
Not the most common line. The most frequently played is the Cordel variation (6...Na5 7.Nxe5...) With strong position for White. Instead, Black tries to fragment the correspondence between my central pawns.<n>VARIANT TREE of 7.dxe5...<n>V1. 7...Nxe4  V1a. 8.Qd5...(V1ai. 8...0-0 9.Qxe4... +/-)(V1aii. 8...Ng5 9.Bxg5... +/-) V1b. 8.Bxf7+... (V1bi.8...Kf8 =)(V1bii.8...Kxf7 9.Qd5+... =)<n>V2. 7...Ng4 V2a. 8.Qd5+... +/- V2b. 8.Bf4... =<n>V3. 7...Ng8 V3a. 8.Qd5... +/- V3b. 8.0-0... =
I take full charge of opening position, and deliver an early checkmate threat that forces Black to react with 8...0-0. Now I can force on the Black kingsid3. It should be noted that although I have a dominant centre, and a position benevolent to my cause, I have paid the price with my disturbed pawn structure.
The question for White is, what next? 9.Bxh6 gxh6 leaves an exposed king, but needs a lot of time to generate an efficient attack, a saviour to him. Since the knight cannot actually move anywhere (safely), this move will wait. 9.g4... threatens 10.g5... with a piece lost on Black's part.
Black opens up the c8-bishop to attack the g4 and h3 pawns. Also, he threatens 11...dxe5, attacking both the centre, my queen and my material chances.
Black simply postpones the material loss, either on e5 now, or on h6 later.
I have lost position for material gain, but I can now respond strongly, and try to take back a controlling stance.
Black joins a rook into the fray, and regains central stature.
This is the most useful move. All squares on my kingside are now secure. The vulnerable e4-pawn is now protected, and the h6-knight cannot infiltrate onto g4.
Black can threaten 22...b4, which is why the c3-pawn needs defenders. After the king moves, the a1-rook will also be safe.
The g-file has been sealed shut. e6 is no longer strong for Black, so a knight there would be benefical. Although Black can develop his knight to f7, the e5-square can be defended.
Black's rook is both hampered and a hindrance to Black himself.
After repositioning the king, it would be wise of Black to try and remove the d5-pawn.
A strong threat, if the a3-awn were to be removed, then the a6-rook becomes strong, and can support the then passed a-pawn.
With this move, Black's a4-rook has no valued influence on the 4th rank. Also the c7-pawn is under fire, and I now have time to manoeuvre the h1-rook.
Black makes en passant on c6 impossible, and the passed pawn would be caught before he came to any use. He also threatens 31...b4 (32.cxb4 cxb4) and danger looms.
I give Black a chance to free his f6-rook after moving his king. In return, I can play Rhe1 and control the e-file, as well as move my knight to c6.
(?) A slight error : this allows me to deliver check on the subsequent move, and hence 'gain' a move.
The position now favours me. The advance on b4 is protected by the c6-knight, and even if the rook could move along the 4th rank, then the h7-pawn would fall.
My goal is to infiltrate onto a5, and cause chaos on Black's side. I can even develop a rook onto e6, and via Nb3-Na5-Nb7, threatens the d6-pawn.
I am willing to gamble a passed pawn on the kingside in order to defuse queenside tension.
Black is beginning to make inroads. I have to rid the b2-rook, get my knights back in play, and counter the kingside mass.
Black can now march. My pieces need to relocate very quickly.
I have been offered an exchange on d6 (44.Ncxd6 Rxd6 45.Nxd6 Nxc3). However, this concession of position would pretty much force a draw after the g7 and h7 pawns are captured, as well as the a-pawn
Black composes pieces to attack on either e3 with the knight, or to attack the a-file with the rook via Re6-Re2-Ra2.
Black now appears to attack the f3-pawn, but maybe also wants to support his advance down the g + h files.
Blakc has missed his chance to prevent the a6-pawn from advancing, unkess he plays the rook down the board.
Of course, Black can play 49...Rg1+, and win the b1-rook, but I still gain.
I will lose the b1-rook, but I can respond strongly.
If 52...Ke8 or 52...Ke6, then 53.Nc7+... wins the b1-rook.
(61...Kf4 and 62.Nxf4... destroys Black).
The checking spree has ended, and the three pawns that Black boasted are gone.
Black had chances to push his kingside pawns earlier, but chose to tustle positionally and lost out due to this.
I was looking to get the Fianchetto bishop set. Control the center  without owning it.
Some pawn movements... The last move was a little pressure on the horse.
The exchanges 12....a4 would not be good. Had to back up the b4 pawn and bring in help.
After the exchange, the 2 horse attack starts, and my opp. makes some not good moves.
Now I have the horses in position for the attack
I didn't want to exchange the pawns on f4. I didn't like the outcome.
Minor pawn movement, not a strong part of the game.I would like comments on better moves here.... Since I am up 3 points, I can wait to get the attacking angles right.
That exchange ended not good for the opp. - was forced to move the bishop to h5, gave me tempo.
Opp. must of forgot of the bishop....???? 34Rg1 ????
I want the exchange...
With Qd7 white thinks--the knight is pinned (not the queen).  Bxc6 forks the rook and pin-forks the queen.  Qd7 is the seventh time black has moved this piece, sacrificing development of the board (though still up white's knight).
Forcing trades is probably not in black's best interest, rook to knight, as the inexorable law of increasing ratio makes white's remaining rook all the more valuable.
Although exchanges strengthen white's material advantage, black's response (Pxg5) opens the pawn @ h2 to attack.  Mm, or not--white stupidly thought Ng4 was an option for black.  Actually, Nxg5 (white's bishop), followed by Nf3+ and black's rook pawn slides down to create havoc and mayhem.
This was a questionable move as black's bishop is more valuable than the white knight.  White thinks, "trade up while I'm ahead?  Free pawn (Rxf7) to boot!"
There is a lot of pressure on the pawn @ g5.  The wise thing for white would be to trade pawns @ h6.
White elects to push the rook of that file instead, opening an attack on the knight @ b7.  Black brings more power on white's pawn @ c3.
The one work I have on the French doesn't cover the exchange variation, so it is all me from here on out, but, with a little experience in the Sicilian and Tarrasch defenses, I gave it a try.
This surprised me a bit here.  The thematic response to the Yugoslav attack is the d5 break.  This has also already occurred.  The Yugoslav is a fairly good tool by white against the Dragon variation of the Sicilian defense.  Some notable differences are present here:  Black gained time by deploying the bishop to e7 where the g6 pawn push was unnecessary.  If white exchanges knight for bishop, Black will have a strongly fortified g7 square and the diagonal control sought by the typical fianchetto move.  Also, Black can  defend the d5 pawn without too much trouble.  Opposite castling quite often leads to pawn storms.  Because Black is more secure than in the pure Dragon formations, he has more leeway to start a strong queen-side initiative.
The bishop's diagonal is obscured, but Black believes the c5 break should remedy this.
First f4 is advisable.  White's gameplan calls for a king-side push, and Nf3 prevents the f pawn from cooperating in the attack.
Three main purposes exist here.  First, c5 is now possible as b4 can no longer discourage the black advance owing to Qxb4.  Second, c8 is a great place for a rook.  Third, the knight needs to be developed.  If Qd7, then the b knight must wait for pawn advances or obscure a pawn's cooperation in the initiative.
White is wasting time to see how black will begin, but this is very dangerous.  Black's attack, once begun, is likely to be fast.  White is behind in development and has neglected the typical counterplay.  The only useful motive here is freeing the c knight from the defense of the a pawn.  White has a handful of more useful moves most of which mobilize the kingside.
I neglected the threat of Nxd5.  This line is at least equal, if not better, for white.  Black has no reason to fear Nxe6.
To my eyes, the most promising line was 13.Nxd5 Bxd5 14.Nxe6 winning a pawn and maintaining pressure on black to play accurately.
Black not only gets rid of the isolated pawn but secures a fairly strong center too.  This comes at the cost of the bishop pair.
Time for black to catch up in development and start a minority attack.
Faced with a decision of pawn or rook, I save the rook.  I am not even sure that my next move here is correct.  I think White has at least a draw owing to the quickness of his attack.  e.g. Qxg7 , Bg6, Rhe1!, Qh8.
I solve the weakness of the pawn to a limited extent, but I neglect the greater threat as proposed at move 19.
I knew Kf7 was terrible after Bg6  where white gets to continue the plan with tempo.
The weaker move.  Kf7 creates a discovered attack against the White queen.  White has in essence given time to black once again.  Black gladly uses the time to prepare a defense of his King.
Perhaps Ne7 was better because it also controls f5, but I liked the move because I needed the c pawn's defender removed.  It also dampens the threat of Re1.  (The idea of trading rook for a major defender of the black kingside is probably worth exploring.)
I think this works to my favor.
White currently has a comfortable game but has to play carefully.  Black must be wary too because the black king is vulnerable.
Now I can withdraw the knight.
He now must deal with a strong attack on his b pawn.  He lost the initiative and is on the defensive.  I think Re1 has been called for repeatedly in this game.  He can still storm with g4, but his King will get flushed out into the open board before he can capitalize on the weak black Kingside.
Let me help the collapse!  I honestly expected a resignation from my opponent after this move.  If Kc1 now, the black initiative is strong allowing black to accumulate advantages.
Perhaps a resignation after this move?  It is clear at this point that the only way to prevent mate is to give back some of the material black sacrifised.  I considered Qc3 prior to Rxb3 , but the move reveals the hand earlier so to speak, and White could play Kc1 stepping out of the net if Black plays Qa1 .
I really didn't have to think too long to come up with a plan to deal with this.  White would love to force a draw by threefold repetition here.
Expected anything else because all I want is to move my queen to the 1st rank.
He sees that the challenge is fruitless, but given that he had not resigned I expected them to continue until the rook was captured followed by b4 and a5.
An invitation to the Richter Veresov attack, which is not played very much these days on the high levels.
Not a good move. I would suggest an idea like 5. - b6 followed by Ba6 to exchange the "bad" French Bishop. Now it is buried behind his own pawns. 5. - Ne7 right away could also be played.
The King has to go forward, or else the White Queen goes to h5 with a quick conclusion.
Only move. 11. Kf5 leads to mate in one (Qf3++).
The "fork" which costs the Black Queen, and 2 light pieces is not enough compensation. White still has a tremendous attack, and the Black queen-side of the board is totally undeveloped. Black resigned.
i would like to show one of my games where the win came about as a result in the difference in development. i developed faster than my opponent and as a result i gained space and the initiative to attack. all the tactics that arose in my opinion are a result most of all of that decisive factor.
if white tries to take a pawn by 15 Qxh7 then 15...Qg4 16Bg3 Nxg3 17.hxg3 Qxg3 with even material initiative and attacking prospects in the kingside.
an important moment. black is about to force an exchange here. lets look at the position here. both black rooks are developed and attack the kingside. the white colored bishop on c6 is well placed and can create threats the queen is fine on d7 and so are the knight and bishop. on the other hand blacks queen is threatened the knights arent doing all that much and the rook on a1 isnt developed yet.
black was threating to take the knight on f3.
here black resigned. after 26.Nxf4 Qxg3+ 27.Kh1 Bxf3+ 28.Rxf3 Qxf3+ 29Ng2 h3 mate is close by. so in this game white lost time and gave black the opportunity to attack. if you see the final position the rooks and knights are passive and out of place. after the exchange of queen for rooks which was forced whites position simply collapsed. but the tactics involved were a a natural result of lack of development.
That was a fun move to play. The point, of course, is that White will slightly spoil Black's Kingside pawn structure by capturing on f6. Certainly that's not a winning thing by itself; but wasn't it Capablanca who taught us that positional games are won through the accumulation of small advantages, like grains of sand falling into a bowl? Sooner of later, after enough grains have fallen, the bowl will fill and then begin to overflow, and finally will be buried.
It would tickle White pink to be able to play c3 right in here, to get the Queen to b3, but he can't because of the double attack on d3. So the text denies Black's immediate intentions to play ...b5 to get some Q-side activity under way.
A little too transparent. In my opinion 13. ...Bg7 was better.
One alternative here is 29. ...Kg7 which seems to lead to a pawn-up endgame (though not necessarily a winning one) for Black after 30. c3 Be4  31. cd4 Bd5  32. Bd5 cd5  33. Rb1 Ra2  34. Kf1 Rd2  35. Rb5 Rd3  36. de5 fe5  37. Ke2 Rd4  38. Ke3 f5  39. g3 f4  40. gf4 Rf4  41. Rd5 Kf6  42. Rd8, although I think White might be able to improve on his 38th move. The text exchange obviously stops both 30. c3 and 30. Nxf6.
?! -- 30. fe4 is obviously a move that maintains a static equality on the Q-side, and must be considered the sounder choice. But I wanted to keep things dynamic, and after 30. ...c5  31. c4 Ra3  32. Rd3 bc4  33. Bc4 Rd3  34. Bd3 White has the same sort of ability to create a passed pawn on the h-file (as in the previous game) as a way to keep Black honest with his c-pawn.
Tease! White wants Black to pursue the Bishop to the Queenside, neglecting his Kingside in the process.
Black's c-pawn can't advance at any rate, and White's h-pawn is unimportant, so why not try to wring as much out of the position as possible?
Now White has the only meaningful pawn on the board. Black should have simply played his Bishop to c3 and offered the draw which would have been immediately accepted.
It's pretty hard to go wrong here. White can drive the c-pawn forward regardless of Black's desires. Eg.: 50. ...Bc3  51. Kc4 and the pawn moves to c3 next, and beyond, and there's nothing Black can do to stop it except race his King to the Q-side or give up his Bishop.
White has just about the ideal position now, with his pawn on a square the LSB can defend. Now it's will be a matter of finding out if White can trick or compel Black to lose a vital tempo that either advances the pawn or allows the White King to slip in behind Blacks pawns.
Black cracks just enough here to raise spectres of doubt concerning his ability to defend the position. He should have played 85. ...Bb8 and offered the draw.
This move steps away from the QG flavored alternatives into a French like position for black, except Nc3 is a full French, and Nf3 differs in that it moves the fight for d5 to a fight for e5, and it provides for rapid short castling.
It seemed a logical step to achieve castling rapidly, and this move also makes d4 very secure.
Black signals intent to castle, and this move while not aggressive as ...Bb4 does allow black to attain the goal quickly.
I decided on Nd2 so that the c pawn is free, and this move now provides against ...Ne4.
!? I decide to engage black a little early because I have good control of e4 and will be able to gain some reasonable play by pawn exchange, or positionally if the pawn is pushed to e5 where it will knock the knight off of f6. I expect a sequence of exchanges to follow which will open up the position some, and I hope to my favor due to the locked c8 bishop. I intend to use the white squares in an attack kingside, where my active bishop will be able to play a strong part.
The bishop stands reasonably well and targets h7, which can be useful if coordinated with the queen.
An interesting move where it is possible that black seeks to replace the knight at f6. The move is good because it does not block the c7 pawn, and can present an attack on the bishop, and develops a piece into the arena. A bishop check was also possible, but would seem to yield no encouraging results for black.
Black continues with back rank clearance so the rooks can be tied, and the bishop can be repositioned outside the pawn chain. An alternative could have been to push ...b6 followed by ...Bb7 to put pressure on the castle by way of the knight, and to provide for a future possibility of developing a kingside attack.
I decide to poke a stick in the nest of hornets to see what I can shake loose. The knight is not particularly invulnerable here, but it does apply some good positional control while menacing a bishop.
Attacking the defender, typically a good strategy, but the offending knight is not under attack and this allows white to play a positionally developing move.
!? An attempt to rid myself of the knight that holds h7, a pawn is sacrificed in the attempt.
I could have exchanged knights, but decide that I prefer ...Nxg4 as opposed to Nxf6, because it enables the queen access to the b1 diagonal at e4 next move. I move the knight back to e5 to give myself some time to consider some options for positional improvement.
Black seeks to provoke an exchange of the bad bishop for a good knight.
Black improves the bad bishop, still enticing NxB which can irmprove the center by bringing in another pawn, perhaps creating a central thrust of pawns as a strategy.
Giving it another try, enticing NxN to develop the queen into the kingside attack.
Black seeks the move ...e5-e4 to shut out the bishop, and while a worthy strategy this move does leave f5 open for the white queen.
Removes the threat and opens a bishop line.
Black accepts the loss of a pawn to save the bishop, a tough decision, but necessary to prevent mate and to maintain the best material balance.
I consider this better than the simple Qxg7 which only leaves the queen in agony under the pressing attack of a rook. The text move forces the king to seek refuge in the central squares. The attack is not at a stage of realized potential, it is just building slowly, but giving chase to the king offers white some advantage.
?! A move that seems logical to protect f7, but it encourages further pressure from white due to the white square the king resides on.
!? Creating a pin, and brings another piece into the fight, the rook is well aligned on the e file where is can be used in an exchange sacrifice at e5, or used with Bf4 for further threats.
? Black seeks to strengthen e5, but the queen takes up position on a vulnerable square, not from a piece, but from a pawn attack. The position makes it difficult to find a better move, even the alternative 23...Qd6 may hold some difficulties due to the threat of exchange sacrifice by Rxe5+ fxe5, and then a followup attack by Bg6+
! Deflection to enable the exchange sacrifice.
! Accepting the sacrifice by 25...fxe5 will allow Bg5+ and the activation of the a1 rook into the attack.
Black threatens the rook with KxR, but there is a small defect in that idea.
The position becomes more complicated as the threat of revealed attack is enabled, the rook is immune from fxe5 due to the pin of pawn to king, and the threat of mate is not far due to the lack of available squares around the king. Black should consider ...Kc7 to gain ...Kb6 in an effort to escape.
?? Made with the idea of hiding the king behind the bishop at b7, but this misses a move by white that refutes this plan.
She has to move the attacked knight
She attacks f7. Now I don't want to play e6 immediately, so first I decided to develop with tempo with....
I have to take the queen of course. This is not on the World Gameknot Database, but it is on the database of Gameknot games.
I decide to attack with my knight, but probably the move in Kr�l Wladyslaw (2423) vs. Porkolab Sandor (2000)  2007, Bg7 is better.
This is a wonderful square for the knight. I need to exchange off these knights.
Not a great square for a rook! I need to exchange both pieces and pawns and open up the board for my queen, which can't do much while there is so much material on the board.
She builds up on e6 again
I now prevent her from putting a piece on e6. Post-match computer now puts me as up 0.92 and I have to agree. I can stabilise the weak squares in the centre with e6, maybe put my rooks on f8 and e8. This isn't bad for me now.
I think this is poor, allowing me to exchamge knights and clear more wood from the board. The idea no doubt was to connect her rooks, which is something she needs to do, but maybe Kd2 followed by Ra1-d1 and Kc1 was better.
So I hop in, with the chance of hopping again to d4 if she doesn't take. Computer puts me 1.07 up now.
I take with the king.
I hit it again. I am opening up the position, but she has chances in the more open position too.
I retreat, blocking the connection of my rooks, but I can't afford to either advance to d6 nor to let the pawn on e7 drop. Ke8, walking into a pin along the e file doesn't look clever either. Computer puts me as 1.85 ahead now.
I throw in a check.  Computer gives this as a mistake and gives gxh2 31. Kxh2 b5 32. Re4 bxa4 33. Rxa4 Qb6 34. Kg3 Qd6+ 35. Kg2 Qd5+ 36. Re4 Qf7 37. Kh1 Qf2 38. Rde1 Qxc2, with black 3.56 ahead. It thinks black is 0.87 ahead now.
And I take. Although this looks logical to me, the computer thinks this is a mistake and favours … Rf7 32. h4 Qb4 33. Re4 Qb6 34. Re6 Qa5 35. h5 Qb4 36. Be5 Rf8 37. d4 c4 38. bxc4 Qxc4 with black 1.05 ahead. After this blunder computer thinks white is 2.34 ahead and gives the continuation Rxc2 32. Be5 Qb4 33. Rg6 Qxb3 34. Be6 Qxa4 35. Rg8+ Qe8 36. Rxe8+ Kxe8 37. Bd5 Rd8 38. Bxb7 Kd7 39. h4 Rf8 40. Bf4
Computer gives this as a massive mistake and gives 33. h3 Qxb3 34. Rf1 Rc4 35. Rf8+ Kd7 36. Re4+ Kd6 37. Re6+ Kd7 as the best way to maintain the equality.
13. Bh2 - I'm glad I played h3 - wasn't too worried about Ion's bishop going to g4 but this created a foxhole for Fou Lenoir.  I thought that the h2 to b8 diagonal was a good one for this prelate to be on.  Also, I did not exchange pawns on d5 due to the fact that Ion's rook was on the same file as Glenda and I did not want any discoveries from Ion.
15. a3 - creating a foxhole for my other bishop, Fou Leblanc to keep him on the a2-g8 diagonal.
16. 0-0 - at last both sides castle kingside.
17. Rbd1 - now that Glenda is defending (does she do anything else?) the b pawn, I decide to improve the position of my queen rook, move it to d1 and perhaps lay the ground for some trades a few moves down the line.
20. Bxe5 - that black horsie of Ion's looked too well centralised so I decided to trade in Fou Lenoir for it.  This is not the end of the trades though.
24. Rxd8?! - in retrospect maybe I could have delayed this trade by playing Bc2 and then b4.  This move may well have enabled me to have put my e2 knight on d4 after the second rook trade and this may well have made the vital difference between another loss to Ion and a high draw.
25. ....... Qe7 - Ion decides not to trade queens.  If that had happened, even though Ion had the bishop pair and a slight spatial edge, my drawing chances would have been good sans les reines.  Glenda's "control" of the d file is somewhat illusory, only d2 is available to her.
26. Nd4 - my knight does go to d4, but because there is a black pawn on c6 he will not be able to stay there.  See my note on move 24.
27. Kf1 - even though the queens are still on the board, my gut instinct tells me to move Henry towards the centre.  This turned out to be a good plan.
29. a4?! - a double edged plan here.  I try to create more mobility for Glenda, and try to get some more space for my pieces.  This, unfortunately, will backfire on me.
32. ........ Sss, the Wicked Witch of the West now makes her presence felt.  She defends Ion's lsb and takes control of the d file and threatens to invade on d2.  Henry bravely takes one step to the left to prevent the Witch from landing there.
33. Ke1 - It was here that I decided to offer Ion a draw.  If my knight had been able to have kept his outpost on d4 my offer would have been successful (notwithstanding my previous diabolical form against the Experts and Masters).  However, because of Ion having the bishop pair and superior mobility, Ion declined.  He got it right, sigh!
35. Qb6 - trying to keep the BQ and BB tied down to the queenside pawns.
37. c4?? - Ion pointed out to me in the post match pm that he thought that this was the losing move.  This will allow the Witch to invade on d2 with disastrous consequences.  Maybe I should have just shuttled Glenda from a6-b6 maintaining her hold on the black queenside pawns but I have done things like this in other games and it just seemed so tedious.  Here it would have saved my neck I think!
42. Qb1 - worried about back rank checks from the Witch I decided to move Glenda to b1.  Glenda and Fou Leblanc now defend each other.  I now lose a pawn though.
48. Bxg6 - material is back to even but after Ion's next move, Be4!! interfering with Fou Leblanc's defense of c2 I decided to wave the white flag.  Unless I gave up Fou Leblanc, that c2 pawn was going to crown and then Ion would have soon forced checkmate.  At least this game was one of my better efforts against Ion, in fact I think the best since The Battle of the Wings - apart from my draws against Patrick Scott and therealjimfriar that third half point against 2000+ oppo remains elusive - but with a game like this I still live in hope.
This is the starting position of the Tchigorin Defence. Revived lastly by the top GM Alexander Morozevich. Much less explored than the Slav 2...c6, Queen's Gambit Accepted 2...dxc4 or Orthodox Systems beginning with 2...e6. I very much like the development of the Nc6 here as it is quite justified by the c2-c4 pawn advance wich make possible immediate pressure on Pawn d4. One drawback of this method is the obligatory investment of Black's pair of Bishops to maintain his opening goals, but Knights are pleasant beasts also in combat.
Black should not fear to make such clear pawn pushes in the Tchigorin Defence, his play must stay active, clear-cut and strategical if he wants to make the most of his journey.
The pin is almost obligatory, compensation for the future exchange on c3 lies also in quick development.
Taking on d4 to saddle White with an Isolani was an illusion, because if 7..exd4 instead White plays the subtle 8.Ne2 with an interesting battle ahead. But wait... this is the move advised by theory !  What is this 7...Nge7 for ? First, 7...Nge7 is loosing a pawn but accelerates development. Second, should Black recover the e5 pawn, White in the meantime could have made significant positional progresses to take the advantage. In short this is on these kind of imbalance that new theoritical paths are growing until the initial question is more or less solved, or not...
Ok here we are : Black is threatening to take on c3 and then regaining his pawn on e5 with good prospects.
Excellent or crazy move, I do not know, on the one hand trivialy escaping the pin and connecting Rooks, on the other hand apparently sacrificing another pawn.
In fact, the pawn invested by 10...Ke7 is immediately regained due to the Rb1  trick that threatens the h1 Rook, but not any kind of pawn, the only one that could oppose to the a file runner : a7.
Each time in the ending that you can put a waiting Rook behind a passed pawn, do it immediately... it is almost every time the best move at hand, even if the computer analysis ater the game actually says "no". Now Black has two compensations for the lost pawn in the opening : a minor one, Bishop tends to coordinate better with Rooks, and a major one, a very dangerous passed a Pawn assisted by Rook and Bishop. Position assesment now, should be "unclear"
White must seek rapid development and coordination for his pieces because Black is ready to push a5. Castling king-side is merely forced as 16.Ke2 Rb2  is not good.
Everything is in order. Now is the time to push the a pawn.
Perhaps not 21.Rb2 because this Rook will end on the a-file and the first Rank is preferable as on square a1 the Bishop will not  gain time because the Rook cannot  be attacked there.
Not 22.Rd1 as it will simply loose time to place the Black Bishop to the superb c4 square.
I had the feeling that Black could not increase the pressure by his pieces alone, so I activated my King.
Securing e5 Pawn but at the cost of giving more freedom of action to Black Bishop and King.
Profiting from a Pawn move, to make another Pawn move that restricts White Knight jumping spots. It can be said also that c5 pawn could be equally dangerous to pawn a if the c3 pawn falls.
Alas, after 29...Rb1 the penetration of Black's Rook is not decisive and the a pawn is quite in danger. For the moment, supporting the pawn on the a-file is stronger.
White is also playing for a win. My opponent could have put me in front of quite a problem, if he had just returned the Knight by 30.Na3, I would have had the choice between a draw by move repetition (30.Na3 Ra8 31.Nb5 etc.), or trying to find a better alternative.<n>As I said in the previous note, it is too early to seize the b-file. This is perhaps some kind of backfiring of Black's static 28th move. Anyway, a draw would have been a perfectly reasonable outcome, because my opponent has not made the slightest mistake and produced good moves.
Reason of this subtle move is quite obscure but I think valid. First, I cannot play 31...a3 immediately since 32.e4 ! and the pawn is untouchable : 32...Bxe4?? 33.Nb3  and the Rook on a5 is lost ; 32...Kxe4? 33.e6! with a dangerous passed pawn since 33...fxe6? 33. Re1  loses material. I needed a good waiting move, renewing the threat of the "a pawn" push : 31...Ra8 was perfect, because there the Rook stayed best away Knight forking tricks.
White continue to play for a win, 32.Ra1 a3 33.Nb5 Rb8 and even if Black's Rook enter White's camp through the b-file, chances of drawing are quite good.
If Black's Rook can pass behind the White pawns before they can prove dangerous the game will soon be over for White.The idea is accessing second Rank by the manoeuvre Ra3-b3-b2.
Here I intend on temporarily sacrificing my bishop to get a slight advantage in material.
A horrific blunder. 8.Kf3?? leaves the king in a vulnerable position in the center of the board. Moving back to either c1 or d1 would've been better. Being ahead in material would be nice, but a bigger prize is in sight.
The first move in a mate in 3. White resigned here. Here are the possible continuations:<n><n>9. Ke5 f5+ 10. Kd5 c6++ (my conditional moves were set for this continuation)<n>9. Ke5 f5+ 10. Kd5 Be6++<n>9. Ke5 Bf5+ 10. Kd5 c6++<n><n>I was very fortunate to get a golden opportunity this early in the game. The main lesson that I got out of this game is that it's almost never a good idea to bring your king out to the center of the board this early in the game. It's far too risky with this many pieces on the board.
An interesting move.  Maintains protection of the King's pawn by protecting the threatened knight with the other knight.  <n><n>This implies that Black will financhetto his dark square bishop which will allow more force to be brought to protect the king pawn although it might lead to the bishop being cramped if the pawn is too heavily protected to tempt white to exchange it at some point.
Black is proactively protecting his knight's freedom by stoppping White from pinning the knight to the king.  However white can still develope his bishop but Black's pawn move has no other obejective.  It would seem that Black has lost a tempo here.
White developes another piece with a subtle threat of d5 threatening the supporting knight.  However this threat would be easily countered by ...d6 which would relieve the knight on the c file of its protection duties and remove the need to defend the knight with another knight.
Black forces the white bishop to act before the knight on c3 can come forward to lend its suuport.  Perhaps Black wants the white knight off the diagonal which also contains the white king before playing ...d6
A bold move.  The threat against White's pawns is not an overpowering one.  A an exchange can be forced on e4 which will strip White's king pawn of its defender but being as there are no follow up attacks this is unlikely to worry White too much.<n><n>The real threat for Black is to advance the f pawn to f4 and cramp White's dark square bishop whilst capturing a large amount of territory on the Queen side.
The diagonal pawn line is taking shape and Black's light square bishop is free.
?<n>This allows White to use a knight exchange to half open the Black king's file.  Black will have trouble castling King side due to the light square bishop blocking the path and Queen side castling does not offer much protection
White moves his threatned knight to threaten Black's remaining knight.  Perhaps White is looking to reduce the amount of black pieces that might block the way to the king.
Black tries to drive the knight away and open a diagonal for his queen to  bindside the white attack.
The bell tolls ...
Alas Black does not have time to bring his rooks to the Bishop's aid.  Moving the king away from the bishop results in the Bishop (and possibly the game) being instantly lost.<n>However, White has seen an openning ....
The Gruenfeld Defence. Black offers White the chance to grab a big pawn centre, which he will then try to undermine. The sharp Classical Exchange Variation runs 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3, and White has a massive pawn centre, but Black will place intense pressure on this pawn centre with 6...Bg7 7...c5 8...Nc6. However, if White can hold on to his pawn centre, he can expect an edge in the middlegame.
5.b4 a5! 6.a3? bxa4 and White's a-pawn is pinned, so this continuation is clearly losing for White. When I used to mess around with 3.c5 or 4.c5 for White in queen pawn openings, I soon realised this, so I used to try to complicate things and throw a spanner in Black's works with Qa5+. Clearly my opponent was thinking along the same lines. For an example of extremely active queenside play in an annotated game - my first ever! when I used this strategy as White, try here: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/lrr-rules.pl?gm=18725
Blocking and developing with tempo as the queen must do something about this threat.
An apparently powerful move, trying to pick up material on Black's queenside. However, despite White's seemingly strong continuations, I believe that Black can still gain a superior position. I am planning to play ...c5 and ...e5, grabbing a huge share of the centre and exploiting White's lost d- and c-pawns - products of his poor 4th move.
The only move that saves material, and this is a strong move since it forces White to react to Black's counter-threat.
Obviously 10.Nxa8?? Bxb7 and Black will gain queen and knight for rook.
Fleeing, and targeting the pawn on f7. Can this compensate for the knight? Even if it was a free pawn, it wouldn't, and this pawn will certainly give Black indigestion...
White has no resistance left. He is down by a queen for a pawn, and massively behind on development - not that that matters when you're a queen behind! If it's OK with everyone, I'm not going to comment any further on this game, since Black has so clearly won in this position :-).
This is a semi tarrash setup. Black will end up with a isolated d-pawn. The theory is that this pawn is more of a liability than a assets. Of course that all depends on who you are talking too. Some players do like the isolated pawn because if it can not be effectively blockaded it can be a one man wrecking crew.
a sharp sortie that invites black into murky waters. If black plays 8. ...Nxb4 then white will win the past d5 pawn. The point of 8. b4 is that black can not afford to allow white to fortify c5. I had this move played against me in a similar position but in that game White did not get much out of it.  <n><n>http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13695200&fb=1&rnd=0.29218792156024276
Because of 8. ...Nxb4 is that the black knight is a little out of position. Black will have to waste a small tempo in order to get it back into the game. Furthermore, the b-file has been cleared for use by the rook. With the light bishops on d7 b7 becomes an easy target. <n><n>Black now has three major weak points b7, d5, f6
? Black does not want to trade piece in a IQP position. The reason why is that as the pieces come off the board the IQP becomes harder to defend.
Rook is won but Black has managed to get some counter play for it.
a good move that I did not appreciate at the time when I started the combo. It made me question whither or not the rook was worth it.
the idea is to push the knight to a less ideal square and bring the bishop back into the game via Bxf6
These rooks are going to rule the world some day
elevating the rook and attacking the knight
Sorry mate but the rook is not yours
when in the endgame trade pieces not pawn! Trading the knights are ideal for me because with all the pawns on the board my rooks are going to have a field day.
this may be the slower way to win but it is the safest. I learned for Aleckine and Petrison to methodically improve your position one move at a time. I rarely win games using flashy combos, instead I am like a boa constrictor slowly squeeze the life of you
This is what happens when you put on the squeeze! you will do anything to just to relieve the pressure. Even giving up a pawn and a rook.
The main reason I believe that this is a good trap to commit to memory is because many of the moves I made may not have been the best moves but to me were perfectly logical to me at the time and I believe relaively sound (save a select few) and there is a very good chance that players of all ratings below 1800 might make similar moves.<n><n>Again, just my inexperianced thoughts.  this was my first move.. I think it's pretty popular. ;)
Keep in mind that this is a trap you can set if you play black and the great thing about it is that it involves pretty normal looking moves to set up.  Like this one.
again not unusual, but this is the key piece to this trap and it happens so early in the game that it's likely to be forgotten about, which is what almost happened to me.
I'm not any sort of expert on chess openings, but this seemed to me to be a good time to bring out my other Knight creating something that looked like a 4 Knights Defence<n><n>I know now, after doing some research for this annotation that my opponent was playing the Two Knights Defence and I actually replied with a transposition into the Italian For Knights. (yay for me!) ;)<n><n>The main point here is that so far, we haven't deviated that far from things you could possibly see in actual play.  Even though I found out that this move is actually an inferior move to many other choices.
It's suggested that Ktxe4 is a better move because it leads to:<n><n>KtxKt .. Pd5 (which forks White's Bishop and Knight).  This tends to go the path of:<n><n>Bd3 .. PxKt<n>BxP .. Bd6<n>0-0 .. 0-0<n><n>Which ends up with equality, but with good play black probably has the advantage.  However, considering that the standard series of moves leads to equality the following series of moves could work out to be even better.<n><n>This is the one move that I don't quite understand... one explination is probably that Black was not thinking of the "trap" at this point.  He is most likely getting ready to fiancetto his Light Bishop.
Black appears to have  taken the bait and white is confident that he will gain control of the center.<n><n>The expected exchanges take place.
White makes a reasonable move and takes the oppurtunity to check Black's King, perhaps hoping to make him move his King and lose tempo.
black chooses instead to block the attack with his Queen.
Also not a totally crazy move and something you might encounter white doing in this situation.  At the moment White has Black's Queen pinned and now has his own Queen protected.  Black can't castle without losing his Queen so it's reasonable for White to assume that he might be able to get an advantage in the future.
This is the only move in the whole series that would possibly tip White off that something was strange.  <n><n>I did think this was weird and so took a moment to think about the situation and saw Black's dubious plan
Thankfully I did not take the bait (although in the actual game I ended up losing anyway)<n><n>Had I taken the bishop sacrifice...
ouch!  My King and Queen are forked<n><n>What follows is some random moves that could have happened.  Basically White is severly crippled after falling for this trap.<n><n>I would be interested in any thoughts some more experienced players have on this trap including, but no limited to variations on how to get there, and perhaps maybe some ways that White could get out of this trap at move 10.<n><n>Good luck and have fun!
Nbd7 leads a practically forced draw. If black is going to fight for a win then this is the only move he can play.
Taking time out to prevent b7-b5 before the bishop is booted
preventing the e4-e5 break and adding pressure on e4.
With e4-e5 out of the picture for now I shift my focus on to a less well known break for white. Namely the f4-f5 break.
Black continues to pile up his forces on the queen side.
Black has focused much of his forces on the queen side and has almost abandoned the kingside
This is a Latvian Gambit mini-tourney so the first three moves are set for each player.  I annotated it to try to explain to myself why this crazy opening, in which Black allows White to ransack his position early on and gain a significant material advantage, actually gives Black some winning chances.  The game ended in an interesting  opposite colored bishops stalemate, which makes the ending pretty interesting too.
Black offers a pawn.  why?  to speed his development and also, as most of the games in this tourney show, to open lines for his pieces (which is tantamount to development).
white chooses to target f7.  The other option is 4. Nd4 but the move chosen by White puts Black in a more stressful position because the threatened Qh5  has more venom with the knight here than on d4.  Why? because at 55 the knight puts pressure on the g6 square as well.
Black tries to kick the white knight out.  Plus he opens the line for his c8 bishop and threatens the capture of that f5 pawn.
Black has to move his king.  why is the opening still used by players with the black pieces?  Now I can't even castle....
On top of that, White has forked Black's queen and rook on move 7.  Isn't Black supposed to get some initiative since he's the one who gave up the pawn??
This move saves the queen and it doubles the attack on white's Bishop if the knight takes the rook off the board.
White gets the other knight into play. Other options were to (1) 8. Nxh8, taking the rook; (2) 8. Nxd6, discovering an attack on the Black queen and later, if Black liquidates queens on h5, to take the unprotected c8 bishop.
Here Black cracks under the pressure and takes the bishop with the knight.  It might have been better to simply move the rook to g8.
and Black has to move his king...
and here is where I believe white played into the true spirit of Black's aims in Latvian gambit - he goes for material superiority at all costs.  It was from here on out that I began to understand this opening and why Black allows this dreadful position to arise in which none of his remaining pieces are developed, his king is using the other guy's pawns as shelter, and his rook is about to be taken off the table.
First things first, Black gets rid of that pawn, and hopefully he can exchange queens to lessen the threats to his exposes king.
Ok, mission accomplished.  Now take a look at this position.  True, none of Black's remaining pieces have moved from their starting positions, however he has massive amounts of open lines.  By virtue of the fact that Black has only five pawns to White's seven pawns, Black has open lines for his h8 rook, his c8 bishop.  And though the f8 bishop is blocked in, it won't be for long.   By comparison, White has all of his pawns in their original positions (except for the one that took part in the gambit) and his one active piece is about to corner itself all the way back on a8.
This move serves two purposes:  it opens a line for the c1 bishop (threatening to check at b2 and win the exchange for Black's h8 rook) and it seeks to advance further to give the knight an escape after it captures on a8.
Obviously this is the best move.  Black gets his bishop on that nice diagonal with a gain of time since white will have to take a move to get his rook out of the way.
But white chooses to close off the diagonal.   Not the best decision for two reasons:  (1) since white is less developed than Black (remember, Black has lots of open lines for his pieces, even though his pieces have not moved) he should encourage exchanges of material;  (2) white no longer has his light squared bishop, so he will be unable to defend this light squared weaknesses he has created with this move (this is exacerbated by the fact that Black still has his light squared bishop); (3) By moving the c2 pawn to c3, white has obstructed the mobility and influence of his bishop.  It would have been better to simply exchange it.
Based on the errors made in the previous two notes, Black plays in the spirit of this opening and sacrifices another pawn.  This is why:  (1) that e4 pawn was simply in Black's way.  It was doing Black more harm than good.  The reason for this is that Black wants his c8 bishop mobilized to f5 to take advantage of all of those juicy light squared weaknesses.
white has to take with the f pawn otherwise he would lose a pawn and a rook if he took with the d pawn.
occupies the light squares and plans to head for d3.
This was not the best move.  better was an immediate 17. ...Bd3, preventing White from castling, but Black suspected that White would not castle on the next move anyway, as he has played to gain that rook for free for the past several moves.
Black stands better because now White cannot castle and he cannot even use f1 as a post for his h1 rook ad he can't mobolize his a1 rook either.
Black moves quickly to take advantage of his superiority in development as he is down a whole rook.  This move is designed to shield the d6 pawn from white bishop that is about to jump to a3.
Now Black's knight jumps to an active position and it protects the d6 pawn.
Good move for two reasons:  (1) it threatens Black's g7 bishop (remember that white would love to begin wholesale exchanges here so as to realize his material superiority) and (2) it takes the coveted f8 square from Black's rook.
Black saves jis bishop from the knight and he further reinforces that weak d6 pawn, thus blunting the scope of white's a3 bishop.
This was not the best as it creates a backward pawn on the half-open h-file and it allows for some tactics that favor Black.  Better was to immediately move the knight to f4 where it could have smoked out that troublesome d6 bishop and defended those light squares.
This move was played to prevent the knight from occupying f4, where it would be able to block off the f-file and defend those light squares that Black has dominance over.  It would also have threatened Black's light squared bishop, the crown jewel in his position.
Now that white can't get his knight to f4, he tries to somehow mobilize his bishop to a better square.
This move opens the line for Black's h8 rook, which, although it has not moved once in the game, is as fully "developed" as any piece on the board.
White moves the knight to e5 but it does no good from here as there is no time left to avert the following combination.
attacks the knight , but this move allows black to win a valuable pawn...
The exchange of rooks is designed to force the White King into the corner of the board - an endgame disadvantage.
Black figures that by forcing the white King all the way back to a1, he will have a king position advantage in the endgame.
Forks the bishop and d2 pawn.
and here is where Black makes a decisive mistake.  He wanted to block the advance of white's e pawn, thus not allowing his Bishop to have access to the queening square, but in mmaking this move he allowed a worse evil:  He allows an opposite colored bishops ending which takes away his winning chances.  Had he simply advanced his pawn to g4, he would have been on the way to a clearly winning endgame.
Black played this move with a defensive mindset - He was feeling the effects of his higher-rated opponent's endgame skills and he wanted to make it harder on him to clear a path for his queenside pawns.
Black  moved his king here to that he could get get in front of the pawn.  If he were to advance the pawn first, then White could move his bishop to e7 to take away the h4 square from my king.
Black continues trying to advance the king in front of his pawn.
Good move - white further frustrates the Black king's efforts to escort the pawn.  Black can't use the f4 square and if he moves my king to h4, then the pawn is pinned.
Now Black has to back-track to let the pawn go first.
Black tries to salvage the a pawn.
White offers the e pawn to clear the way for the a pawn.
Black refuses the offer as the game depends on frustrating Whites efforts to queen the a-pawn.
Black decides to take the e-pawn and deal with the a-pawn later.
Now it is a two against one pawn majority in an opposite colored bishops game.  Black does jis best to save the game by getting his king into a useful position and by taking advantage of the Bishop's ability to occupy both of white's queening squares.
Black tries to get his king back to play defence.
Black gains a move on his king march by attacking the bishop...
And white puts his bishop on the best square.  The other diagonal (g1-a7) would not have been as good because he wants to occupy the squares between the Black king and the white pawns).
Best move as it prevents the a-pawn's advance and blockades the c pawn.
White allows Black's king in, but he wants to get that a-pawn moving as that is the key to his winning chances.
Not the best move - White should have mobilized his king down to b8 - a safe square and one that would allow the queening of his pawn.
White advances his other pawn - there is no way Black would take it of course.  The bishop is needed, at every second, to watch over a8.
The other pawn comes in to apply some pressure, but will it be enough?
White shuffles the bishop hoping that the white king will have to give ground when it is Black's turn to move.  He now commences a clever maneuver in which he uses lots of endgame trickery- triangulation zugzwang and other nuances to crack Black's defences.
But the black king can shuffle back and forth...for now.
The black king shuffles again, now to d8.
Black's king continues shuffling , while it can...
And white continues to net the Black king into a box.
and now white achieves his final aim:  Zugzwang (forcing the other guy to move in an way that is unfavorable for him).  Black has the choice of moving either the bishop or the pawn (since the king now has no legal moves left).
The Bishop retreats...
and now black can resume his shuffling since he controls a8 and b7.  If black takes away the b7 square, then, in this position...
One the always dangerous past pawn - which I had two of in this game<n>The power a pawn sac can give your other pieces by opening lines for bishops - in this game my opponent did not take the pawn and allowed my to get the past pawns but I still got to open the lines!!  Thanks to my friend WINECAPE who showed me this in one of his other games I will be using that trick more often!!! <n><n>This was a rematch, I was one pawn up in the 1st game when I grabbed another pawn and my opponent split my queen and King with a bishop and accordingly I resigned the game. Greed - still one of the 7 deadly sins!!<n><n>I wanted to show the power a pawns in this game in two ways.
Instead of my ussual Kc3 I wanted to open up the game and get a centralized queen early on
SO I tried to stop it with empasant - not seeing my pawn was pinned by his queen..... small mistake
No option but to move it and d3 seems to be the best outpost for the time
Rex to safety
I was hoping to get his queen out of the midfield, i saw the split and also saw the way out
So here comes the power of the pawns, Here I was willing to sac two pawns to open lines for my bishops, a trick I learned from my friend WINECAPE.  It is more important to keep your pieces in the game than to be a pawn up or down!!!  So sac a pawn to open the lines for your bishops
So I saw we both wanted to push the pawns and take a bishop, I had a plan, and I dont think my oponent saw it yet or saw the flaw in his own plan, I new I would sacrafice the knight on e4
Still not taking the bait, Recalculating and it is looking beter now
planned, now he has trouble, he could not play dxc2 due to the queen hanging, he could not play Qxf7 due to the lines that I opened with the pawns - after Qxf7 e7with a discovered check wins the queen.  But why worry when he has a free knight
I was thinking of Bf6, but after Qxe6 I would lose my best weapon - my two passed pawns after bxe7 qxe7 the pawn is  neutrulized and I would have to through everything at keeping the pawn, note he can still not take c2 as his rook will be lost
SLight mistake - So i thought and had to trade up - rook for bishop
The immediate exchange would cost me a pawn or give him time to play Kg6 which would give double defense to f8 - so trying to keep them in play
So I am up 7 - and I started to force the exchanges - worst case I would trade two pawns for knight and bishop
As planned - he has two options face 2 rooks or a rook and queen in the endgame.  Kxe7 Rexe7 would lose quickly after Rxa7 and the Rook on f7 going to B7 and then B8 check mate.<n><n>He chose the second
Most chess players prefer the Queen's Gambit declined over the Accepted version. Mostly because it is impossible for black to retain the extra pawn without giving up to much.
black can not allow d5.
one of the ways to defeat a gambit is to develop normally and make calm moves that strengthen your positon. Bd3 is a very strong developing move that prepares for kingside attacks. As well it clears the kingside back rank so that white can castle.
White can also play Bf4 to prevent black from developing his queen to c7
This allows my queen and bishop some room to move at the cost of allowing black to post a Knight at d5.
Not 12. Nxd5 allowing black to free up his position. The advantage of this move is that I win a pawn and create a weakness in front of Black's king with tempo
By refusing to capture the knight on d5 I force black to clarify the position.
A weakening move that creates a serious hole on g6. If Black's idea is to attack white's centre, then c5 was a better try.
White jumps on the opportunity to get rid of blacks strong Knight by exploiting the overwelmed f7 bishop. Plus this dflects the f7 bishop from gaurding g6.
prepares for the capture of the pawn on e5 with the idea of centralizing the bishop on e5
aiming to get rid of white's strong bishop.
This is the best move because if black captures on e5 then the Rook gets lifted to e5. By which, white maintains his positional superiority over black.
Black resign with loss of more material. If black plays 27. ...Qg4  28. Kh1 wins the rook.
The Tarrasch variation, in my view the most difficult line for Black to meet.  Also popular are 3.Nc3 (Classical) and 3.e5 (Advance variation).
[!?]  Guimard Variation.  This used to be my stock response to White's 3rd move, and  I had a lot of success with it, even against strong opposition.  I did not use it to initiate piece play by a central break ...e5, but to play lines more akin to Owen's Defence, combined with a slower breakout with ...f6.  The fact is, though, that there is a bit of a down side to 3...Nc6, in that it blocks the thematic ...c5 pawn break.  This was not helped by my clumsy handling of the line during the next few moves.
Most circumspect and probably best, though it does make bit of a problem out of the c8-bishop.  5...Ne4 is possibly playable, but it is not a move I would be happy to contemplate in this type of position.
To keep the knight snug on b3.
A good development that exploits Black inability to strike at it by ...a6.  The threat is to exchange at the moment White considers most propitious, and, apart from the unappealing ...Na7, Black can't do much about it.
As White omitted to exchange on f6, an alternative well worth thinking about was 8...fxe5 9.dxe5 ... (9.Nxe5 Ncxe5 10.dxe5 c6 would have been great for Black) 9...Be7 10.Nbd4 Ndb8  11.0-0 0-0 12.c3 Bd7 and Black's game looks reasonable enough.
[?] What was I thinking?!  The knight recapture simply had to be the better option.  I think I might have had the ...e5 break in mind, but that was never going to happen.
The e-pawn is under attack - what can be done about it?  Maybe I ought to have carried on, for better or for worse, 11...e5!? 12.Bxc6 bxc6  13.Nxe5 Nxe5 14.dxe5 Be7, but the position doesn't look very comfortable.  Another idea might have been 11...Re8  12.Bf4 Na7  13.Bd3 Nc6.  Instead, I tried to revivify my game - and redress my earlier mishandling -  with a pawn sacrifice.  Had I thought this through more, I might well have chosen differently.
The move I expected, and probably best.  But White could have contemplated a an exchange sacrifice, here, with 13.Rxc6!? bxc6 14.Bxc6 Ra7 15.Ne5 ... with plenty of activity to offset the slight material imbalance.
Breaks the pin, but more importantly, prevents an exchange that would have scrambled White's K-side.  Now there is no question of Bxc6 to break up Black's Q-side.
This looks good, and brings a rather aloof knight back into the action.  Once again, 16.c3, to reinforce the centre, might have been considered.
!?  At the time, I thought this a fine move to bring Black back to an approximate equality, or only a very slight minus.  The Gameknot Engine calls this a mistake: 16… Nxd4 17. Nxb7 Nxe2+ 18. Rxe2 Qe8 19. Qxd5+ Kh8 20. Bd4 Bxf3 21. gxf3 Nf6 22. Qb5 Qxb5 23. axb5 Rae8 24. Rxe8 Nxe8 with a nigh-on winning end game for White.  But Black might have done better (after 17.Nxb7) with 17...Nxf3ch! and whether White takes with pawn or bishop, 18...Bxh2ch! keeps Black in the game.  To maintain an edge, maybe White would have to retreat 19.Kf1.  This is all very well: during the game I barely glanced at the 17.Nxb7 line.  However, I could have looked at alternatives such as 16...Bxc5 or 16...Qe8.
Forced, as taking the f8-bishop would have left Black the exchange down and a lost game.
Black plans to offer the exchange of queens.
There was no compelling reason for White to go along with this exchange (e.g. 24.Qg4ch was playable), but no particular reason not to, either.
Now, with White to play, the game enters a whole new phase.  Time to pause and reflect.  White has rook and two pawns for bishop and knight.  According to the standard scale of values, White is a pawn ahead, but practice indicates that (R+2) and (B+N) are close to equal.  For the moment White has no real weaknesses, though c2 is likely to become one.  It can't really be said Black has any, neither.  White has a 3-1 majority on the K-side, the pawns are level, and the f-pawn is 'passed' - Black can stop its promotion only with pieces or the king.  This sounds good for White, but there is a down side: White will have to look to the K-side only to make progress, unless he can induce a vulnerable weakness on the other wing.  Black's advantage is in the flexibility - handiness - of his pieces.  Bishop, knight and rook work pretty well together.  I assess the game here as roughly level.  Maybe White has a whisker of an edge, but no more.  On the other hand, both sides have plenty to play for, for now.
To make any progress at all, White has to do something with his major trumps: his majority and the passed pawn.  This move prepares the advance of the f-pawn.
The advance of the g-pawn does come at the cost of leaving weaknesses that Black might try and exploit.  This knight move eyes ...Nd4 with attacks on c2 and f3.  They aren't much, but White isn't giving much away.
Partly to place a half-pin on the bishop, preventing ...Bc5, but also to prevent ...Nd4.  Black's options are fairly limited at the moment.
Taking time out also to tidy up the Q-side.  A useful 'waiting' move to see how White will proceed.  Note that now the bishop has sanctuaries on d6, c5 and b4, which could prove useful.
Cagily giving nothing away, and keeping it tight.  Around now I was thinking that this game was going to end in a draw.  I felt that I could hold, but that winning chances for Black were approximately nil.
Probing, but also with the idea of bringing the rook to the 5th rank (...Rg5), where it can probe more effectively by moving along the rank unimpeded by his own pawns and pieces.
Had White played 29.Rh4, I had intended 29...h5.  Normally when defending with pawn(s) minus, I prefer to keep them right back on their own rank or maybe 'up one', where they are strongest and most easily defended.  But I felt that in this game that won't do.  The h-pawn will be used to try and break up White's K-side, or at least make them easier to blockade.  That will require its exchange it the right moment.  As it transpired, the career of the Black h-pawn was to take an unexpected turn, later on.
Instead, the plausible-looking 31.g4 ... was met by 31...Nxf4ch!  If then 32.Rxf4(??) Bxf4 and, one way or another, Black wins a piece.  Not even the pin by 33.Rf2 will do in view of ...Rxh2ch.  White would have to play something like 32.Kh1 (instead of Rxf4), when after 32...Rc5, Black keeps the pawn.   However, Kf3 was possible.
The knight had to move, of course, but why here, and not ...Nc5?  No reason, that I can see now: c5 would have been a much better square for the knight.  Fortunately I haven't much damaged Black's position.  All the same, it starts to look as though White is making progress.
Closing up the Q-side and transforming the weakness at c2 into a strength at c4.  But there are downsides to this.  Is a bit harder (though not impossible, as you will see) for White to induce a serious weakness in Black's Q-side, which right now is very strong.  That tends to localise White's attack to the centre and K-side, where Black is well enough placed to meet it.
Black tries to hamper the g4 advance.  Normally I prefer to keep the pawns back when I am defending with pawn(s) minus, to make them harder to attack.  That policy should probably have held good here, as well.  But I was looking to stymie White's majority once and for all if I could.
That the immediate exchange by Black would have left White with two joined passed pawns unopposed by enemy pawns is less an issue than another file opening up that would probably be of more use to White.  This retreat is intended instead to induce the g-pawn to advance.
? - During the game I felt sure this was a mistake, and the Gameknot Analysis Engine agrees.  The pawn become a weakness that Black's handier pieces, the knight in particular, can just about reach.  A new phase begins, with Black making a serious bid for the initiative.
Immediately driving one rook into a passive position, as the h-pawn has to be defended.  During the sequel, the knight will conduct hit and run raids hither and thither, using this square as his base of operations.
Pulling the rook back into reserve.  Black will be shifting his attention to the centre, and, given the weak point at b3, the Q-side as well.  The threats won't amount to much, but, by inducing a reaction, enable Black to make some sort of progress.  Such at least was the hope.
I am supposing White wanted to get the rook off the bishop's diagonal, and h1 placed the rooks a knight-fork apart (a possible ...Ng3 attacking both).    But the rook is also placed so as to defend the b3-pawn should it come under attack by the knight at c5 or d4.  For the moment, meanwhile, White's passed pawns are going nowhere.
I do not want to exchange rooks just yet - not unless there is a 'sweetener' in the deal.  What the sweetener might be - who knows?  Time, position, material - one keeps an open mind.  After 39...Re8?, 40.Rxe8 Kxe8  41.Ke4 Ne7  42.f5! with a plus for White.
With a vague threat of ...Rb2 and ...Nd4 to attack the b-pawn.
Sensible,  Defends against the threat and also frees the king from the back rank.
Still wants to keep his rook on.  Black values his flexibility to continue probes and threats that force White to respond.
Don't sell easily parried short ranged threats below their value, just because they are short ranged and easily parried.  They are often a means to an end.  The threat now is ...Rxf4ch.  Black definitely has the initiative for the moment, but can he keep it?
By covering squares on the e-file, this frees the minor pieces to move.
Fortunately, I was able to rewind, here.  White dare not exchange rooks right now owing to the knight fork (Rxd4?? Nxd4ch)
Threatens ...Nd4ch.  For the moment, progress for both sides has stalled.  It was beginning to look as though I would have to try my chances after all with the exchange of rooks.
Forces the rook exchange, and just at the right moment, too. If now 54.Rxd6 Bxd6 attacks f- and h-pawns both: 54.Rh1 Bxf5 and White can not play 55.Rf1 on account of 55...Ne3ch.
! Now if Black exchanges, the White king is handily placed near the centre.
But there was nothing to stop this.  After the win of the pawn Black at last has a passed pawn of his own to play with.  Possibly White might, somewhere during the sequel, have considered a plan to give up his two pawns on the K-side for Black's h-pawn.  Then with the pawns equal on the Q-side defied Black to make good his material advantage.  I spent a lot of time studying such endings that might have arisen, with the conclusion that, with care, White might well have held.
! - In my view the alternative, 57...Ng7 is less pressurising, though it has its points: 58.Ke4 Ne6  59.g6ch Kf6!  60.Rg2 h4  61.Rg4! h3!  62.g7 Nxg7  63.Rh4 Ne6  64.Rxh3 Nxg4.  Could Black have won from here, with B and N vs R and pawns level and symmetrical?  I thought the chances problematical, and elected to try something a bit more forcing.
A tempo gainer.  The King will take over the protection of the h-pawn, whilst the minor pieces continue their operations elsewhere.
Preventing the knight fork ...Nd4ch.  But now the Black King is permitted to invade via g4.  But after, say, 64.Rb2 or Rh3, then ...Ne7 aiming for ...Ng6, leads to a strong attack for Black anyway.  Probably best was 64.Rh1, which seems to lead to Black having to let go the h-pawn to round up the White g- and f-pawns: 64.Rh1 and [A] 64...Nd4ch 65.Ke4 Nxb3 (...Ne2 might offer more) 66.Rd1 Nc5ch? (...Kg6 is better) 67.Kf5 h3  68.Rg1! Nxa4 (really greedy, eh?) 69.Rg3 Kh4 70.Rg4ch Kh5 71.Rg3 Kh4 etc and a draw by repetition.  [B] 64...Be7(!) 65.Rd1 h3 66.Rd7 h2  67.Kg2 Bd6 68.Kxh2 Bxf4ch when Black has an edge, but, as earlier discussed, maybe not enough.
White has threats of his own!  If White allows the pawn to advance on more square, then ...Nxg7; Rg2ch wins for White.  This probably represents as good a chance as any for White, but now the game begins to slip away from him.  About now I was starting to fancy my chances of a win.
Forced, to allow ...Ng3 in response to Rg2ch (were White to play that).
Dual purpose.  The bishop and knight together effectively blockade the g-pawn - or at least have it under close surveillance.  At the same time, the bishop covers the f2-square, allowing the king to threaten the f-pawn.
To regain access to the f-file, and so the f-pawn is once again protected (68...Kxf4?? 69.Rf1ch wins a piece).
! - Played to prevent Kd5.  I did consider 68...c5, here, but was a bit concerned about the exposure of the b6-pawn to attack. This move leaves the c6-pawn weak, but it seemed to me that it were better to give that one up for the two White K-side pawns than to relinquish the h-pawn.  I was by now valuing the h-pawn as worth a rook.  It was not long before White reached the same conclusion.
!? - The alternative was a case of 'as you were': 71...Nf5ch 72,Ke5, and then try 72...Ng3.  I could have played ...Ng3 at move 70, but felt that the king was the better piece to guide the h-pawn home.
Naturally, 74.Rxd4 is hopeless.  But the rook will have to be given up for the pawn.  Black has now a winning game - for a given value of 'winning'.  White isn't going to give this one away.
! - Grand master Paul Keres once remarked that few positions are so hopeless as to offer no hope whatever of offering resistance.  White realises that he can wipe out Black's last remaining pawns, leaving himself with the bare King-bishop-knight end game.  Now, if he can force Black to give up a piece for a fast running passed pawn, the game would be drawn.  Which will be the runner?  White's a-pawn!
! - This is how to force an exchange or the win of material.  Immobilise the target, then attack it.  Well, Black's pawn was immobilised way back at move 6, but the principle is the same.  Black will have no pawns left.
! - A useful intermezzo.  Even if unessential, one should not pass up a tempo if it will help the cause.  This check means that even after the removal of the Black pawn, there will still be an obstacle to a straight run by White's a-pawn.  Black will have gained an extra move to round up the g-pawn.  (Ironically, later on Black 'has' to play a waiting move - a tempo-losing move - but 'time' is one of the three elements of chess: material, space and time).
Aiming for b7, combined with the advance of the a-pawn.  Had Black time to snaffle the g-pawn and then to reel in the a-pawn?  Let's see, shall we?
Just two moves and White will have his drawing position of K on b7 and P on a6.  Black has, before the pawn can move to a7, to get his knight SAFELY onto one of the squares b5, c6 or c8.  How will he achieve that?
During the game, I thought 84...Ne6 would have been a mistake, but in fact it is just as effective as the text.  The aim here is ...Nd6, whence he can choose from the 2 squares b5 and c8 according to which is available.
Edges closer, whilst the knight is being held off by the King.  No use would have been 85...Kb7 as 86.Nd6ch immediately brought the pawn to book.
? - Better was Kd7 or Kd5.  White has to be careful himself, here, as he doesn't want his king to be cornered with no escape.  Once it becomes clear that Black can stop and win the pawn without the loss of a piece, White could at once take his chances in the infamous king-bishop-knight vs king end game.  Though it is a winning endgame, it is not so easy.  I have had such endings before - three times, and won all three.  But they were all pick-up games, and from positions a deal more favourable to me than would probably have obtained in this game.  At this point I was certain we were in for my second ever 100-mover, stretching maybe into 120 moves or more.  For the first 100-mover check out: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/great-snakes-batman-a-100-mover?gm=18341
After this, Black can not cover both b5 and c8.
? - Now was White's last chance to prolong the game...
How to round up the enemy King.  Box him in and and tighten the screws.  But be sure to leave him with at least ONE square to move to, until you are ready to deliver the KO.
A waiting move.  Equally effective would have been ...Bf2 and ...Bg1, or even ...Bc5.  Not ...Bb6, though.  There, it would get in the way.
And not 95.a7 this time, neither, as at once would then come 95.Be5#.
One of those game that I was lucky to win, with nothing much in it - maybe a slight edge for White - for 35 moves, and even when the balance tipped Black's way, it was not easy to see a way to win, even when Black gained a passed pawn of his own.  It wasn't until it became clear that White would have to give up a rook to prevent the Black h-pawn's promotion that Black's winning prospects looked realistic.
One of the many defences named after Aaron Nimzowitsch.
Black is attempting to simplify to success.
Confining the king to one row.  All the pieces sre ready for the finale.
The c3 knight is forced to guard the b5 bishop leaving the e4 pawn exposed.

!! Kd8 Kd5 and black is in Kf8 the best move would loosen the death grip on blacks position giving chances.
In order to free up the knight, and give threat to f4.
Forcing the queen to move.
??? e6 would have given black some chance of continued play but this just ends it.
Hi everyone!<n><n>I know some of you think I take my rating too seriously.  I must plead guilty to that.  For a long, long, time, ever since that Battle of the Wings game against Coach Ion I have harboured dreams of getting to Expertdom.  Well, I got as far as 1857 before Black Friday which put me back to 1809.  Fortunately, due to several timeouts from a 1950+ opponent and this victory I still manage to stay in the 1800s, although there are some losses just around the corner.  I must confess that though I have been trying to get my games level down I was invited to a mini-tournament where an IM was playing in it.  It is not very often I get a chance to play someone at that level so I joined the MT along with Freddy's Traxler MT.  Because that MT contains fast players I really am struggling, but I have only myself to blame.  So, this victory helps take the pressure off just that little bit .....
9. ...... e5 - we pick up the action from here.  So far Bg7 has been found to be an improvement on this move and I will play it the next time I have black but for now at least things work out OK here.
13. ........ Na6 - aiming to clear the decks.
26. ....... Qf8 - I see a possible knight fork on f6 but I am prepared to give up my rook for this pesky horsie.  Dmaestro's dsb will go into the bargain.
32. ....... Qc3 - Glenda does not wish to be caught up in Re7+ so she makes a little nest for herself on c3.  She defends the weak c6 pawn and dissuades dmaestro from moving his e6 rook off the e file.
34. ...... Qxa3 - Glenda snatches off the a3 pawn giving me an isolated passer on the a column.
35. ...... Qc1+ - Glenda decides to be a nuisance on the back row.  This check at least temporarily diverts dmaestro's e5 rook away from my kingside pawns.  If dmaestro moves his king I may hassle him further with checks from my good Witch of the North.  Indeed, her proximity to the WK gives dmaestro the heebie-jeebies, so much so that he waves the white flag.  Ah well, that's my fourth victory in the Annotation Pt. 2 mini-tournament.
So I am annotating this game,  for one reason, I haven't annotated but one other and I only got about halfway through the game doing it ...  then finished it out later.  The other reason is as per my comment to my opponent...<n>"I am going to annotate this one since I only partially annotated another, also, annotating against a superior player may help, or at least be humorous reading..."
I mean why in the heck would anyone open up his king side like this??
I have to get some material back.so now I am only down what...  a queen to a Knight and a Bishop?
The temptation is to take e4 and get material back,  but I am thinking the more I can keep his King from being in a happy place the better off I am.  then there is the deal with his knight getting down there and forking me at c2.  I have been killed by that.  where is the rum???
MAN!  another conditional move triggered !  how many games of this has he played???!!!  I better check the mini tournament board....  and run to the liquor store...
I check the tourney board,  Easy19 has played 10 and won 10,  I check the clock,  still time to get to the liquor store....<n><n>I can't stand the aforementioned knight fork ..  so I am going to "cut my knight in half" to guard against it, and be able to harass his king again later..
one of the few times a move has just jumped out for me.  i see a couple of places he can put his king now, and a couple of things favorable for me to respond with.  My head still hurts from a 'lack of caffeine hangover'  but the Penguins beat Detroit last night in game 7, and I am absorbing coffee as fast as I can..  Life is good...  now  if i could just win the lottery and buy a blow-up doll factory...
a Knight fork,  maybe i get 2 points back and stuff the king in a corner, possibly buying me some time to get mine in a safe place...  I still don't like it....  I wonder if possible he will be gracious and give me the Lady....I would like that...  move 13..  it would be nice to have a plan....
sooo,  I guess he isn't that interested in my Knight at c7 on the return trip (if i ever do extract it), a greater interest on my weak king side...  and knight at c4,  sure why not...  ok  not a lot of options here...  through my bishop down to e6 giving up the f pawn..  or.......
yeah,  open up my stuck black bishop...I am still kind of hurt that easy doesn't want to donate at least 1 point in this tourney to some lucky person ....  it's Saturday...  wonder if i can get to the gym...  maybe the liquor store...  which one first....  hmmm...
oh !  I get to exercise my conditional move !!!
ok,  so his little bitch is continuing to give me hell,  now why did I agree to this tourney...?  I am thinking that since the gym is one of those 24/7 places,  the liquor store should come first...  it is already noon here...
I have to decide which pawn to save (and maybe my a$$)..  I figure maybe if i can tuck my king nicely into a corner like he did,  I can ...  awww...  I won't be able to do crap but maybe last till move 30....
well,  there I go,  back down another pawn,  I wonder if i offered the sultry little wh0re a couple of grand if she would go away....
Just figured out I don't have a couple grand to offer...  I'm a married man...  who btw desperately needs a drink...  I am still hoping to push my friend there out of the middle of my playground,  so i can get some safety...
so he backed off,  I made the mistake of going to the gym first rather than the liquor store. the loss of oxygen to my brain is causing typos and certainly not helping me come up with a good response...  why i n the hell can't I think more than 2 moves ahead?  I guess I will check my still,  it has to have a move in there..
well now I am pissed,  not only have my muscles robbed my brain of thinking oxygen, but my sweet mash is tired from the too high ph and not making alcohol,  going to have to add some sour (mash) after all and ruin the taste of the bourbon I had going, damn !...  i make a move... any move,  to stall till my brain returns to normal...  like it matters ...
so he moves his king up attacking my knight,whoopee,  tghe liquor store is getting better,  wonder if there is a law about driving without oxygen on the brani..and ,,,  does tghe body break down ethanol to free up the the oxygen??/  i could use some o2 right about now...
i get a pawn back  to make me feel good for a min,  this is kind of like standing around the bonfires on the coast where tehe NARCs are burening the bales of pot thrown overboard by the shrimpers from Biloxi in rough seas,,  feels pretty good at the time,  but there just seems to be something sinister about it...
so now he wants my pawn there...this is really beginning to suck,  well  actually  it started around move..6,  no  when I accepted the Project invite... this isn't helping my rating any, <n>well  I don't see any advantage to taking either pawn, g5 then Qx thus attacking g2 AND R at c1.  if i take e5,  then... Bxc5 and there is no nice thing there....  soo I will do....
So the king wants to jump my horse...  Perverted King !!
Horse wants to ride the queen...and not be ridden by perverted King
Bishop,  wants to poke at the Queen...  These relationship type games are miserable.  Especially when losing....  wonder if I watch "The Note" with the wife if that could be worse.....  a glass of wine is in order....
yeah,  I am about tired of this...  I am going down a piece,  and that little wh0re in the middle has been strutting her stuff the whole game...about the best I can see is stringing this out to maybe 35 moves now,  two rooks can beat a rook and a queen right?
hmm,,  it appears he likes my knight and bishop for a bishop trade...  weird...
I offer a draw....  it almost worked ,  here are our ensuing comments on the board...<n><n>easy19:  ....  Aldo i almost pushed the yes button by mistake.<n>You: LOL, I am laughing my butt off, I didn't expect you to accept, just trying to add humor  to this futile game.<n>easy19:  I alreadh have hick-ups from the laughing :-)
I think he understands by now I want a queen gift,  possibly because he is reading my annotations...  I tuck my king away and set a new goal of 40 moves....  very aggressive for me..  I decide to go to church with wife,,,  maybe I will have some inspiration  to ...  well  last to 42 moves...
I decide to give my king a new place to hide if needed...  42 moves  a worthy goal...
now just teasing me...  wants me to push f5 I am sure,  of course  I theraten with....
i didn't want to mess up my pawn structure,  this is really important right now right?  I did the 'coin toss method' on deciding where to move the king...
I decide that if my friend's lady wants my pieces,  it will at least cost one more move...<n>maybe he will forget my rook is guarding f5 and Qxf5...  I could still win !
The King as an offensive weapon,  I read about that somewhere.....
I decide I can't handle this any longer ~ my head hurts,  if he wants to play on, he can trade his sweet lady (NOT!) for my castle....  hmm  It seems I traded a house for a lady once before....  familiar...
Bg5 is the text book move, but I wanted to develope my bishop to where I could use it to attack either side of the board. I am fairly new to this sport, so I do not know if this is a strong move.
I plan to push my g and h pawns to his king. I will be ready to attack after O-O-O.
I have to trade this piece I had no place to put my bishop. If 9.Bb5, a7, 10.Bxc6 where black would follow with with bxc6 opening the b file for an attack on my queen side which would be bad for a O-O-O. I think I annotated all of those moves right.
cxe6 weakens the pawn protection for his king but also opens the f file for rook.
This may not have been the best move, but I need someplace to put my knight when black plays b4. I am starting to feel the pressure of blacks attack and definitely feel he has the upper hand and I am now in defense mode.
My only defense for what is to come with a both rooks on the b file. Now I know he will start to push his pawns on the d and e files.
I thought he would have taken this with his queen. I like this better I can start to see where I might be able to work an attack now. I think the queen would have been crippling on d5 challenging my knight on f3.
I have to break up these pawns before they challenge my bishop on c3.
Got him, I am starting to feel the pressure relieve I know we will exchange some pieces here, but I intend on removing the pressure on my king.
I did not expect this move. I can see the light now. After 26.bxc3 I will start my attack.
Exactly as I expected. I am not real threatened by this though. He will be able to put me in check a few times and eat up a pawn or two if he wants, but I clearly have the advantage. I think???
This move is the Sicilian defense. The idea is to bring pressure on the center with the c-pawn and  trade it for white's d-pawn. White has many responses, sometimes allowing the trade, sometimes avoiding it. There are many versions of the Sicilian, some quiet and positional, and others, like the dragon (which I prefer), that are very sharp.
The idea here is that the c pawn can be used to recapture after the exchange on d4, allowing white to keep two center pawns.
My idea is that it is now impossible for the b-knight to protect the e4 pawn, and I want to force some other move that will slow white's development and be something other than white's plan. <n><n>Normally I would avoid Nf6 until after I had played d6 in order to avoid e5 driving my f6 Knight away. In this case, however, I think e5 is overstretching for white, and after I play Ng4, white will either have difficulty keeping his e5 pawn or at least be giving up initiative.<n><n>I'm not sure I really know what I'm talking about here. I do know, however, that I rarely regret taking the initiative. Initiative means that you are forcing your opponent to constantly respond to your plans, rather than advancing on his own plans. To me, the strongest aspect of 3 ... Nf6 is that it takes the initiative and will probably keep it for a few moves.<n><n>There is danger in Ng4 if white plays e5. My N is exposed to the white Q without the protection of the white bishop as soon as the white Knight moves from f3. I think that's not a problem, though, as the most likely place for the f3 N to move is to e5, and I can trade my g4 Knight for it there. Also, if e5 is played, I will be playing d6 shortly thereafter, allowing my bishop to protect the Knight at g4.<n><n>This is a long comment, and if this were simply an annotated game, most of it would be unnecessary. However, in a training game, I'm trying to give all my thoughts in why I chose a move, even if it exposes my plans to my opponent.
I think this is not the strongest move, because it blocks the d-pawn, severely limiting white's mobility. d3 is much better, allowing the development of the c-1 bishop and the b-1 Knight, which not only has both its best spots blocked, but now has no good way to get them opened.<n><n>Bd3 allows a quick castle, but that benefit is small compared to the drawbacks. That is especially true in a Sicilian, where black's development is always slow, anyway. in a Sicilian quick development and limiting black's space and development is what you want. Notice that Black's K and Q pawns have not moved yet. The white King is in no danger and has no need to hurry into castling.<n><n>I wrote a lot about e5 on the last move. I don't think e5 would be a good move here, but I do think it's better than Bd3. I'm not a master, so I can't see all the ramifications of e5, but it seems like overextension to me.
Prevents e5 and opens the door for Ne5, attacking the d3 Bishop. Making the Bishop move a second time slows white's development. In this case, however, it's probably superfluous, because the Bishop will have to move a second time, anyway, in order to mobilize white's Q-side.
This purely defensive move is forced by Bd3. Black's Bg4 cannot be defended by Be2 because the Bishop is needed to defend the e4 pawn.
The Sicilian is a slow development opening, and White's move are calling for quick action on black's part. That may be impossible, but black is trying. f4 is an excellent spot for black's knight, attacking d3, g2, and h3. At some point e5 will allow it to be defended by a pawn there and allow black's Q to get into the game quickly. White's b-1 knight is at least two moves away from challenging that square. g3 isn't a real good option for white because of weakening the Q-side (or giving away the h3 pawn if white has castled).
Frees d3 so the Q-pawn can move and Queen Bishop can be developed and leaves the King Bishop on a strong diagonal.
I'm a 1600 player, not 2400. This may not even be a good move. The drawbacks are that it's the 3rd time I've moved this N in six moves and my King Bishop cannot develop yet.<n><n>The reasons for the move are that it attacks the g7 pawn and puts pressure on d3 and h3. It may force castling, though white may have done anyway. e5 will follow, protecting the N and opening up the King Bishop and the king side to the Queen. White has developed slowly, so this move is aggressive for possible rapid aggression on black's part.
Protects Knight, frees King Bishop and Queen and reinforces d4.
Frees Queen Bishop and attacks the f4 Knight. This traps the c2 Bishop, but d5 can be played at any point to free it. This was a good move. It also gives some freedom to the b-1 Knight, though it can also go a3-c4 if there's time.
I hope the idea of a training game is to learn, not for me to play excellently. This, too, might be a mistake. The idea is to get my pieces in play rapidly while the white pieces are on the Q-side. This not only frees my King Bishop, but it opens the g-file if white trades his B for my f4 N and further blocks his mobility when I retake. the g5 pawn can also go to g4 to boot the f3 Knight should I decide it's worth eliminating the h3 and g2 pawns. It is highly dangerous, because my Q-side isn't real suitable for castling, and it wouldn't be too hard to open up the e-file if my King stays in the middle.
Ouch! This move has to get a 9. g4??. The h3 pawn is no longer protected, and this plays into black's hands, letting me get the h3 and g4 pawns without the cost of a piece. I'm much more mobile, so this is frightening!
This move gets the rook in play, and it offers to trade off pieces, which can only help white. Another option here was Nb1-d2, but this further blocks off white's pieces.
I opted for this rather than trade off pieces. White can trade his bishop for my knight here, but when I play g5xf4, the g-file is opened and white's pieces are further blocked off. Right now, even sitting at its home square, the c-1 Bishop is a key defender.
Scandinavian Defence.I must admit this came as a surprise to me as I expected my opponent to play the silicilian or ruy lopez
Trying 2 get black to trade his current best develop piece
The idea is to get black to make a mistake
If 6...Qxb4 then 7.Rb1 Queen moves then I take on b7
I think this was the best move to try an win the game as quick as possible because after my Queen gets to c7 I win start winning material
Trying to move the queen out the way lose to Qc8#
Preparing to mate with Rd8+
Game over. As soon as I promote my b-pawn ,even if promote it to a knight I will still win easy
Normally Black plays e6 or c6 protecting the d pawn with another pawn.
? Black did not like retreating his knight to b8 and gives an opportunity for us to enjoy this entertaining miniature.
! This is an unusual pin of the knight on f6. If knight moves then bishop on g7 is lost. If Black castles then the knight on f6 is lost. If Black plays 12...Nh5 13. dxc6 Bxd4 14. cxd7+ Bxd7 Nxd4 loses a piece.
Queen enters into another pin to protect the knight.
Now, d6 is interesting... I know there is a lot of theory about all this, but I don't have any access to it, unless I spend more time than reasonable to find out... e4-e5, if allowed, can be deadly for black, unless he defends properly...
I read somewhere that this is one of the quietest moves white can do, being preferred Nf3 or e4 as more aggressive. I wanted to delay e4 and use the tempoes for developement, since I'm not doing well currently.
I found nothing better than guard the queenside. Nb5 is a shot in the dark, and just returns tempo loss after a6.
I had just this tempo to make something out of the knight's "sortie". It could have been Qa4, but I felt it premature and pointless. Another chance was Ba5, provoking b6, NxN, QxN, Bc3.
Being impossible to go there with the bishop, I push the pawn in.
Interestingly enough, the game is completely switched to queenside fight, and the kingside is left completely alone. Be aware of sudden opening by black. I have thre pieces completely inactive, by the way, so I can't say I have the edge. Let's see if the queenside incursion will give some return. For now, I avoid Qb6 by black. If b6, I'll hold.
Very interesting: black aims to open the way for Rb8, with pressure on b2, combined with the bishop. So I have to act with great care.
Not axb6, giving space to his knight to came out (Ne5 doesn't worry me).
Here I leave the initiative to black, right, but he has to think hard which pawn to advance (if ever).
Kind of a loss of tempo, but allows me to fee my lsb.
No way for black to lose the exchange.
This makes me some damage, disrupting the kingside's pawn. Now, if black gets to overcome his own pawn's chain, he will crush my exposed king.
I won't try to defend f4. I have to go my way, and fast!
Lazyness by black: d5! was the route to the win.
? Probably played with the intention of diverting my queen from the defence of a7, but it was lost anyway. O he just blundered the knight!
Here, I lose my pawn, but he accomplish a mission: to leave black heavily restricted.
...and black is lost. The line g5 leads to a) 5. Qe6+	Kh5? 36.	Bg4+, Kh4,  37. Qh6#, but the shown sequence is not mate but leaves black without a chance.
seems to quiet.
to the center
There are a few interesting lines where black delays castling in order to throw white off his staple kingside attack.
The main move for the Yugoslav attack but nowadays it's losing favor to immediate long castling where there many lines to chose from for white, unlike this older main line.
Going for the usual style of attack in this line. However, this move might be a little slow as black won't give white enough time to mount the attack.
Sadly this isn't it. It's still hard finding anything that would work for White here. 13.Be2 is the only move, and now after 13...Nxf3 14.Bxe2 Bxb5 15.Nxb5 Rxb5, black has a very pleasant position, recovered the pawn and is en route to a heavy attack.
The tactical refutation of white's last mistake. Now c3 is again undefended and the king is forced on the open b-file under black's line of fire.
White must have thought he was going to get mated if he took the rook. 18.Kxb1 Qxc3. However he missed the defensive move 19.Kc1 and there is no mate so black has to be satisfied with taking some of the material back. 19...Qb2+ 20. Kd2 Qb4+ 21.Kc1 Bxg4, winning white's queen.
I had intended 22...Qc6 here trying to weave a matting net against the white monarch but my opponent saw the futility of his resistance and resigned here.
I overlook his Queen and lose a pawn in trades.
This seemed to be the only way to stop the fork without trading material. Besides, without the Queens on the board and my opponent's Rooks nestled in their beds, I figured that not castling would be okay. The only negative to this move that I could find is that it blocks in my LSB.
Keeps control of the long diagonal, pins the pawn, and ties down the Knight to protection duty.
I try to trade trade my passive Knight for White's active Bishop. Then I can retake with pawn, and if White moves the Knight, I win the c-pawn, thus restoring balance and gaining a tempo a major piece with the King-Rook fork.
Pressuring the unprotected Bishop.
I don't want to separate my a- and b-pawns, and now that White's Rook is activated, my King did not feel safe on the open file.
Finally able to activate the Bishop, which will become a thorn in my side.
After I connect my Rooks, of course!
Daring the pawn to advance.
I x-ray the Bishop.
I intend to open the h-file, and line up my Rook.
Now I can move my Rook to h6, but White's DSB can block.
Until he does that. I assume it was to protect the Rook after a back-rank check when I force the King to the first rank.
I think that placing the Bishop there would have been more beneficial, to leave the Rook free to defend the e-file.
But the King can still escape to e2...
Yup. I don't normally like to make a non-checking move when I'm attacking, but nothing here worked, because the King could escape to e2. So I came up with the next move. Can you see it? It's not very hard, but it seals the deal.
My opponent try to kill my important pawn.
I try to stop this pawn.
Because the mission to stop his pawn become too hard for me I decided to put a trap.
e6, for castling it also protects d5 in variations an annoying spacial cramp for black
trying to get a tempo on the queen, but i prepared for this already
Qe7, where it wanted to go anyway. many many moves for my queen to make now
trying to create more tempo on the queen
knight c5! holds b7 and gains a tempo
f5, positions the pawn in a solid position to cramp whites movement and close space around the king. Note that the knight on e2 is very weak for it is limited, as in the queen now
g4! as it seems black is in trouble perhaps with gxf5 as it is pinned , followed by pawn to f6 threatening mate and queen
Qg5, most of whites threats now harmless and it is time for more counter play. can you spot the move now?
a blunder, exposes the king and white doesnt gain anything from this
f4, no concern i move in on the king
pinning the knight to the king
Rg2 and my opponent resigned. Continuation of either h4 or h6 results in a Rh7 mate. same result with knight to g3 which is an insult to injury if played. Perhaps the most important thing learnt from this game is anticipation, calm when under pressure and use of counter play
A much better move than 6...h6. Be7 relieves the pin on the knight without weakening Black's king-side pawn structure while developing and preparing to castle.
7. Bxf6 represents a conflict between chess principles. Firstly, since the game is currently closed in the middle, a knight is slightly more valuable than a bishop. Trading a bishop for a knight in a closed game is a good trade. However, White is trading an active bishop for a passive knight: Black's knight had no central squares to move to. Secondly (and much more importantly), White is trading his good bishop for Black's knight. Since White's pawn structure is locked down on the light squares, White's dark-colored bishop is much more valuable than his light-colored bishop since it isn't blocked by his pawns. The game will soon open up, leaving White with one weak bishop and Black with a powerful bishop pair. Better would have been more development, such as 7. Nc3 or 7. Be2.
Black gladly accepts the trade.
White occupies his d5 outpost, available now since White traded off Black's knight on f6. The move is moot though, because White has left the b4 square unprotected. Black's knight can move there to dislodge White's knight.
This trade leaves Black with doubled pawns. However, it further locks down White's pawns on light squares. Black will want to move his pawns to a5 and b6 to lock in White's bishop and stop all counterplay on the queen-side.
? Another pointless waiting move. It also completely shuts off White's bishop and queen from easy access to the queen-side. Better would have been more development, such as 13. Qd2.
This move could have waited until it was needed after White's pawn push to a3. Better would have been 13...Rfc8 or 13...Rac8, taking control of the half-open c-file.
?? Now White has completely locked himself in on the queen-side. White should trade down his extremely weak bishop soon to have any chance at the endgame.
When deciding which rook to move to the open or half-open file, one must consider various aspects of the current state of the board. Black's pawns on b4 and a5 have shut in White's queen, bishop, and rook on the queen-side. Black's f-file rook is important to the protection of the king-side, where White still has good attacking chances. Naturally, the a-file rook is the correct rook to move. Black is slightly ahead, heading into the middlegame.
! An excellent developing move, preparing 16. Ng5 or 16. h4 then 17. Ng5. White's bishop, queen, and knight are all aimed at Black's king-side, ready for an assault on the king's position.
White finally decides to trade off his weak bishop.
Black is ahead in material and will gladly trade down to get closer to the endgame.
Black finds a slightly safer square for his king. Things will open up on the king-side soon (the king-side pawns are the only ones White can push), and the king will be safer closer to his pawns. King safety is important since all of the action is on the king-side.
! Forcing White's queen to a less active square, and locking down White's king-side pawns on the same color as Black's bishop. These pawns will become targets for Black's bishop in the endgame.
Attacking Black's bishop. It must retreat.
24. Ra2 prepares 25. Rd2, setting up a battery with White's rook and queen on the soon to be half-open d-file after White plays d4.
In this position, Black's queen can control the d4 square, pin White's f2 pawn, and put pressure on White's king on g1, once the rook is out of the way. Also, if the f7 square comes under attack, the pawn push b7-b6 will open up the Black queen's defense of that square.
?? White moves the only protection his king has against Black's queen. Black can now take White's pawn on c4 with his rook with discovered check. Not only that, Black can then place his rook on the c3 outpost deep in White's territory protected by the pawn on b4. White never recovers from this blunder.
Black's rook occupies a powerful outpost. Four of White's pawns are on this rank, and the rook is protected by Black's b pawn. Only White's rooks can dislodge the Black rook from this square, which would give Black a passed pawn deep behind enemy lines.
? White's h4 pawn is still hanging. White missed his chance to further open up Black's defenses by 29. h5, forcing Black to either leave his king open to attack or give a pawn back to White.
Black's 24...Qa8 plan comes to fruition. 30...b6 protects Black's f7 pawn, as well as protecting the a5 pawn.
Black's rook protects the bishop and prepares a potential discovered attack on White's queen by the rook and White's rook by the bishop by 32...Bg5.
?? White fails to see Black's plan and moves his pawn right into the line of fire. White will lose a pawn and a rook. White has little chance of drawing now.
Black captures the hanging d pawn and protects his bishop.
? White is defending a losing position and shouldn't trade down material. White gives up by offering this trade. Better would have been a last chance attack on the Black king or on Black's pawn structure.
Black gladly accepts the trade.
37...Qh4 offers a trade of queens, and also indirectly defends Black's bishop. If 38. Qxd2??, then ...Qh2+!! loses White's queen. White's position is hopeless, and he will soon be mated.
maine line in order to castle an and develop h rook on f colon for later
preventing Kg5, i could play Ke5, but this whould be to early and to easy for master ADA45
this looks strange because it blocks the b knight, some body help about his plan at this moment ?...
in order to fianchetto my DSB and put pressure on king side
is not a problem i will bring my knight to the  king side in order to attack black castle
i tough  lot of time to do this move with is maybe not so good, the truth is that i was not able to find a way to attack honorably the black position. What would you do if you where me ?
now i'm about to have a plan : something like sacrifice the  e5 knight on f7 or g6 and then use the  f4 knight resting to fork some rook and queen, i must find the way, the good combination...
now i have to find the mate
i know the treat on h2, but there is nothing so serious coming after, and i need more power to attack the king castle resting
now the better answer is to exchange the queen, it's becoming to dangerous
occupy the e colon, maybe i will have the opportunity to bring the rook on e8 with is protected with the LSB (of course not for the moment there is a black rook and the knight...)
good opportunity to occupyg6 with my LSB,and blocking the king which is a good first step to mate
I did not know what to do with this bishop ! o good opportunity to give him some job ! and it will open the h colon, it could help if i can bring a rook there
opportunity to move to the h colon
this was a mistake from me considering my plan to bring the rook to the h colon !
and sorry guys, that's all folks for to day, Ada45 loose because TIMEOUT ! he should be very worried to forget time !<n>I hope you had enjoyed this game and you will give it a good rate !
Another part of my opening setup, allowing the queen to go to c7 and guarding the d5 square.
I respond with the same idea.  It is still possible for him to play e4 if he wants to.
Instead he opts to fianchetto the bishop.  This doesn't seem to me like the best setup against a pawn on c6 and a queen on c7, but maybe he counted on pressure on the long diagonal.
I continue to prepare for an e5 push.
He completes the fianchetto, and looks ready to castle on the kingside.
The e5 break is finally here, and it is up to white whether to exchange the pawn or let it remain there.
White adds pressure to e5 and is ready to castle.
I add defense to e5 and have the queen well placed to guard c6 as well.
I was concerned about a b4 push and a queenside attack on the c6 pawn.  This move is thematic in this opening, but it is not always good as it leaves a hole on b6 that can be reached by the c3 knight via a4.
I take the opportunity to castle.  Development is about even except for my c8 bishop which is trapped at the moment.
I'm not sure that this is a great place for the rook, because I won't exchange on d4 but he might exchange on e5.  d1 and c1 would be good places for the white rooks.
Planning to relocate to e6.  This also allows the c8 bishop out.
Keeps the knight off e6 and starting to lock the center.
Continuing to apply pressure on the kingside.
This kicks the bishop but creates a weakness on the kingside.  Now the bishop and queen can line up to target the pawn.
Retreats the bishop and waiting to attack the h3 pawn.
This is not a good move because it takes the a4 square away from the knight.  It also creates a weak pawn on b3, which will be an important factor later.
Attempting to provoke g4 after which the knight will go to f4.
Solidifying the kingside.
Trying to break up the kingside with f4.
Moving further into the kingside and clearing the path of the bishop to attack h3.
Locking the kingside pawns and forcing the knight back.
Threatening to play Nxg4+ and win a pawn because the h4 knight is hanging.
Preventing the Nxg4 tactic.
Continuing to break up the kingside.
White is trying to win the d6 pawn and black can't really guard it.  I decide to try to set a trap instead.
Here my plan is to play Nd4 and trap a piece after black takes the pawn.
I exchange in order to trap the rook.
Now the rook is trapped.  The bishop is under attack and I can play Kf7 and Bf8 and win the rook.
I take the bishop and now my bishop is unguarded.
And I win the exchange.  I have a rook for a knight and two pawns, but my pieces can coordinate better.
Trying to win the e file.
Rc7 would be much better by keeping up the pressure.  This allows me to completely dominate the e file.
Planning to go to d7 and then d5 to pile up on the b3 pawn.
Forcing the bishop to give way.
I would have kept the bishops on to maintain some counter play, but white is in big trouble either way.
This knight is heading to c1 to defend b3 again.
Double attack on b3, forcing both knights to stay where they are.
Bringing the king to help the pawn.
White is close to zugswang, so he sticks to moving the king.
I was low on time, so I tried to think of a winning plan on his time.
Trying to free up the knights.  Here I saw what I needed to do and forced the knight back to c1.
Attacking the knight and it has no where to go.  Nf1 loses to the fork Rd1.
Another mistake.  My opponent missed that the capture was with check.  The check would have been avoided if the pawn hadn't been moved from f2 to f3.
Here white resigned.  This game is a pretty good example of how to play with a rook versus a knight and pawns.  I got an open file for my rook and tied his knights down to defending pawns.  With white reduced to passivity, it was relatively easily for me to break down his defensive wall.
This was an ashameful loss. It was a tough work time for me. Some lines saved from the analysis engine may be found interesting. I'd like to have a better way to show them than copypaste GK algebraic annotation... I hope some beginner will find something useful in my mistakes.
Now, the logical move was Bd3, but I thought it was too "naive". I wanted to move the rook on d7 before. But not just now, without the other supporting it. Castilng would have been very interesting. Or g4.   But I choosed the wrong path.
?? The attacking blunder that throws away the game. The bishop has to go to d3 before than the knight covers this square. Even if it is not a mating threat, it is pressure. You must increase pressure. rejecting this knight from here is no pressure. I was pondering if to play against the queenside pawns, instead, since I didn't see clearly the winning attack on the kingside. But this was bad strategy, since my attack should be winning, if quick and precise.

?? Again, it was not necessary to weaken like this. I wanted to make vulnerable the e6 pawn, but I made wrong calculations.
Now he can play it.
Manouvering so to make my pieces useful. It came black had the edge, due to my weak king. I think I am slowly improving.
The passive Qg3 fails. I have to take my chances.
Or Bg6. I thought that exchanging the rooks would have facilitaded my taks stopping the pawn and the mate.
Now, Bg2 was definitory. If Qxc3, or Qd1+, Kh2, and black has to stop Bd5+.
?? A blunder from my part, I didn't see the check in f2 that deprives me from the chance to survive. I had other choices, like checking in e6 or Bg2.
Welcome to my Trompowsky annotation. This opponent had previously employed the Samisch to attack my King's Indian Defense when we last played with the same colors. The success of the KID in that game had me on red alert for what to expect from this encounter.
This introduces the Trompowsky Attack. White does not want a conventional King's Indian Defense and intends to take the game into original territory by exchanging bishop for knight and doubling Black's f-pawns.
White has essentially put the question to the knight (and the pawns that would have had to recapture). Black has a number of responses here including 2_c5, 2_e6, and the text. I prefer the text because it often leads to active positional play and because I also like reflecting White's strategy by putting the question back on the bishop.
Both sides have a minor piece that has been developed, attacked, and moved again. Black plays 3_c5 hoping to maintain the knight on e4 or at least gain a concession before retreating it.
Now White enters one of the most popular lines of the Tromp. Whether the game remains open or closed (and it can do both from this tabia in my experience) the play is usually very sharp. Since my worthy opponent had previously employed the Samisch it seems fitting here that he employs a system with a similar pawn structure (f3) that is so thematic in that opening as well. This move does challenge the knight on the e4 square but it does so at the cost of White taking away the best development square from his own knight (see previous note).
This is the point of Black's previous move. It allows the knight on e4 to influence White's game before it has to retreat (or be exchanged).
6.d5 is a strong alternative that grabs space. The text, however, is usually going for an endgame where White's better pawns are mitigated by Black's bishop pair.
Freeing my Queen from having to recapture on the next move and exposing the fifth rank to my queen's influence (no Bg5 repetitions thank you!).
I was expecting 9.cxd4 when White has a formidable center that Black will have to be careful about handling. With the piece recapture it gives Black, at the cost of a few forced moves, an easier game in my opinion.
Keeping the knight away from b5 and c7.
Logical. Improving the White position, releasing the White squared bishop (that once deployed will allow the g1 knight an opportunity on the e2 square), and threatening 11.e5.
This felt forced for me. Its obvious I'm trying to punish the knight recapture on move 9 with a fork on the e5 square. But the text also prevents 11.e5 and opens the diagonal for my own White squared bishop.
Avoiding the fork and putting an eye on the a5 square.
This was going to be a KID if you remember. I was hoping to get in Be6 & d5 (potentially with a knight on b6 and a rook on d8 defending) making the d6 pawn backward only temporarily. White could prevent it but would have to forgo developing his kingside pieces.
Of course. He did play a Tromp against me to avoid the KID if you remember. 8)
I continue with my plan. I thought about playing Be7 and then castling but with the queens overboard I wanted to make sure I wouldn't be hustling my King from the corner back to the center in an endgame. If he wants to relinquish the bishop pair then he can but the doubled f-pawns, though annoying, won't be the structural disaster it would have been on move 3.
A knight on b6 would support the d5 push (that's where this knight is headed). It also releases the a8 rook and removes the annoying potential for doubled f-pawns.
I considered 14_b5 directly here but it appeared to give Black some counterplay with 15.b3 and 16.c4. Here is where I made the real decision that losing the d6 pawn is ok AND that castling would actually remove Black's king from its important influence in the center.
I'm glad I didn't waste a tempo putting the bishop on e7.
Now Black really isn't threatening the White rook (which can simply move away) but the text does free the other Black rook. That said, now look at the White kingside.
Where else was it going to go?
The d6 pawn is avenged! If I can keep the d-file from being infiltrated by a White rook battery with my king and minor pieces then I can attack the queenside freely wih my rooks.
I can always retreat the bishop and be happy with it on e6 so I decide to meet the possibility of 21.f4.
The bishop had to get free somehow.
Taking away squares for the knight. And once my bishop almost inevitably retreats e6 I will have f-file ideas of my own.
It was going to happen eventually.
This stops any Bb3 ideas from Black and prepares for more queenside influence.
Black continues trying to break through on the queenside.
Bringing the knight closer to the fray.
Keeping up the pressure.
White's king bolsters for a possible f4 push but the queenside will quickly draw the knight away from any supporting duties in that plan.
Black breaks through knowing that White now has the forces to liquidate the queenside pawns.
Black accepts the trade.
The knight attacks the White rook while preparing for Nd4 and leaves a discovered attack on White's knight on c3.
A hard move to make.
This is not so much my resisting the pawn grab 35_Rxg2 in as much as its my failing to resist a mate threat with 36_f4.
I can still grab a pawn on the Black kingside. But that mate threat...has it really been nullified?
And now that I am up the exchange I will surely grab the h2 pawn and try to convert it to a win right? My last game with this opponent proved to me that I need every last advantage.
Making way for the king on the important e-file and lusting after the f3 pawn.
Originally I played this to pin the king down to the defense of the f-pawn. But then I realized that the pawns are equal in the number of their potential moves on the h-file. This seemed a small fact but it made my next move possible.
This was what I realized on my last move. Once the King recaptures there is nowhere for him to go that can protect the e4 pawn. And since the h-file is moot, he has no choice in the matter.
White follows through with his planned fianchetto and black creates the classical strong center.
White wants to un-kabosh his bishop, and who can blame him. Black responds by taking white's knight out of the exchange equation.
Defending the pinned knight. Not really necessary, and maybe 8. ... Re8 would have kept two defenders on the e5 pawn. But, I reasoned black wouldn't lose it for long.
White's bishop on e5 is en prise. If the bishop on g5 retreats anywhere but h4 then black's knight is free to capture on e4, winning a bishop. If the g5 bishop retreats with 11. Bh4 then 11. ... g5 wins the trapped h4 bishop. White only has one move.
Now white must save his bishop.
Dangerous play for white. The pawn on e2 is backward and awkward to defend on the open e-file.
14. Qh4?? was a mistake that will cost white at least a rook. Because of the pin on e2, white cannot simply play 15. Nf3 to block the attack by black's queen against the rook on h1. In fact, white has no way to save that rook. Note that white's vulnerability on the e-file and his vulnerability on the d5-h8 diagonal are both by-products of his first move. Sure, these vulnerabilities were exposed by later play, but it seems to me that a stronger opening choice such as 1. d4 or 1. e4 would have ruled out these two vulnerabilities right from the start.
Black captures the pawn on h2, but the pawn was not the objective. Getting a rook on black's 7th rank was the objective.
I bit offbeat but my idea is to transpose to KID of Benoni lines.
nice outpost for the knight with tempo. This knight will exchange itself on e3 to win a pawn in a few move. very pretty combo you may want to stay tuned.
The e3 pawn finally falls and Russ resigns. I think he learned his lesson, off beat moves(meaning moves to get masters out of book and playing on their own devices) does not work. And giving up centre pawns can cost you a lot. However, credit to Russ as he did have a plan and did try to execute it!
In Paris, Morphy suffered from a bout of intestinal influenza. In accordance with the medical wisdom of the time, he was treated with leeches, resulting in his losing a significant amount of blood. Although too weak to stand up unaided, Morphy insisted on going ahead with a match against the visiting German master Adolf Anderssen, considered by many to be Europe's leading player. Despite his illness Morphy triumphed easily, winning seven while losing two, with two draws. When asked about his defeat, Anderssen claimed to be out of practice, but also admitted that Morphy was in any event the stronger player and that he was fairly beaten. Anderssen also attested that in his opinion, Morphy was the strongest player ever to play the game, even stronger than the famous French champion Louis Charles Mahe De La Bourdonnais...
Karl Ernst Adolf Anderssen was a German chess master. He is considered to have been the world's leading chess player for much of the 1850s and 1860s. Although quite soundly defeated by Paul Morphy who toured Europe in 1858, Morphy retired from chess soon afterwards and Anderssen was again considered the leading player...
like clockwork; this is practically forcing e5 to preserve d6...
the next best move again; out of boredom? we will never know... directly winning however is of course f4!, threatening mate on Qg5; after exf4, e5+, Ke7, Qf7 mate; after Bb4+, c3, Ke7, Nxa8, clears all illusions... after Ke7, Qxe5+, Ne6, Nxe6, Qd6, Qg5+, Ke8, Nxg7+, Bxg7, Qxg7, Black can safely give up...
After his defeat by Steinitz in 1866, Anderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered—including the Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament, one of the strongest tournaments of the era. He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.<n><n>Anderssen is famous even today for his brilliant sacrificial attacking play, particularly in the "Immortal Game" (1851) and the "Evergreen Game" (1852). He was a very important figure in the development of chess problems, driving forward the transition from the "Old School" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions.<n><n>He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an "elder statesman" of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration...
At this point of the game, I very happy where this game was going. We are now playing into a style that I'm used to seeing all time. So I started to relax and play normal with no stress.
I wanted to get the last piece develop and also make the first attack in the game. f6 would be bad obviously because black would lose a pawn with 14. Qxe6  and I may even take the bishop as well. Not sure it that would be good but it's just a thought
Putting some pressure online the b8-h1 diagonal.
There's always a big difference as to which rook you move first. I really didn't like this rook to be moved because I thought it would be hard for me to get the other rook into play. I could be wrong but at the time I wish the other rook was moved instead.
I didn't like that rook on the e-file so I moved my Queen to d3 to put some pressure along the d-file and also attack the Knight rather than the bishop because I know that would be the first piece my opponent would have to move first. Obviously my opponent saw that coming so he moved it out the way.
I really wanted to trade off his good bishop at this point. I started to hate that bishop a lot because something about attacking along the diagonal wasn't making me feel comfortable at all.
I really started to think at this moment. I was trying to decide whether I wanted to take the Queens off the board or play a little bit longer with them on and see what happens. So I decided to keep the Queens in the game and I'm glad I did, which you would see later on.
White is looking really good at this point. White rook have the open d-file for attack mode and looking forward to putting it along the seventh rank later on. Black is okay but attacking chances are rather slow at this moment.
I put my queen there on purpose just to see if he would attack me. I was also looking at 24. Qa4 instead of g6, but then black wouldn't have control of the square I was planning on putting my queen at, which is e6.
I "REALLY" didn't like this move after I realize a few things about this position. Although my opponent knew I was attacking his knight, he missed a rather good move where actually the game could've turn tables and be in his favor. I was looking at 26....e4 27. Qxa6 exf3 (if 28. Qxa7 then fxg2 and black could easily take control at this point of the game and probably even push those pawns down) 28 gxf3 Qxf3 and black is by far in a good position then white at this point. in fact, we might say that he's clearly winning in some way.
French, except the bishop in f5.
Tempting White to overextend by chasing my knight
Now no pawns can attack d5, and my knight is posted there.
Defending with e6 isn't good because if White captures, I want to recapture towards the centre.
This forces White to trade because if b4, then I play a5 and White's pawn structure collapses.
If Qd3, then I would've played Ba6 with tempo, and if Qe3, then it could've continued Nc6 Ne2 Ba6 Nbc3 Bb4 and Black's position is tied up
White cannot defend against Nc2  without losing material. His king's position is all boxed in and his early pawn advances weakened his center. White is going to lose his rook for one of my minor pieces
With this second move, Black looks to defend the pawn on d5 with c6, so that the pawn on the e-file does not block the way for the light-squared bishop to develop. In the main lines, White looks to dominate through the center, where Black looks to control b4 and make a later push to the e5/c5 squares. The threat of taking on c4 now carries more weight since it can be covered by b5 (which is in turn protected by c6) creating a strong, dynamic queenside pawn mass.
Note: The immediate 4...Bf5 is a mistake due to 5.cxd5 cxd5 6.Qb3 where Black will have great difficulty defending b7. Black can only (reasonably) play Bf5 if he can keep the Queen from b3.
Black has won the pawn, threatening b5 to make the gain permanent and taking the b3-square from the White Queen (making Bf5 possible). While White looks to recapture, Black will complete development. On the downside, White will gain a stronger pawn center. Other common moves include 4...e6 to play the Semi-Slav (an entirely different beast) or the increasingly popular 4...a6 (a solid and flexible subvariation).
Not a strong developing move, but by far one of the most common replies (compared to e4/e3) looking to prevent b5. However, b4 becomes a critical weakness that Black will try to leverage.
Developing the light-squared bishop (Bg4 is also possible) and looking to prevent White from achieving e4. Black can continue with an ...e6 to create a solid pawn chain without trapping the light-squared bishop in.
White connects the pawns and frees the bishop to recapture the pawn, without commiting to a middlegame strategy, but blocking the dark-squared bishop.
Creating a modest yet solid pawn center to free the dark-squared bishop to get to b4 if desired. The knight will go to d7 (and the bishop can stay within the triangle) to create a very strong grip over the center.
A great square for the bishop - pinning the knight and free from threats of the a/c pawns.
or (O-O). This is pretty much the traditional setup - White has recaptured the pawn and brought his King to safety to begin his plan of e4. White will try to achieve this through either Qe2 of Nh4.
With this structure, Black looks to play the pawn breaks of e5 or c5 (e5 preferred to prevent White from playing e5). This move pins the knight to the Queen to keep the threat alive.
The Black Knight jumps to the new hole, looking to exchange and solidify the pawn structure.
13.Ne4 was also possible to keep the tension higher.
Meeting the threat. The followup plans include a rook to the open c-file and repositioning the knight to a more active square.
White builds tension by contesting the c-file. There's no need for either to take at the moment.
?! Looking to generate some counterplay by increasing the piece activity. At this point, as far as I know, theory is near exhausted, so rather than play a safe and drawish move I felt I could take a risk. Initially I was looking at a way to open the f-file. Qh3 is of course thematic, looking to take the bishop. While evaluating f6?!, I noticed that I would lose the e-pawn if played (in order to meet the threat of Qh7#), but that it would be a nice square for the knight to centralise.
Protecting the bishop and giving up the pawn. There are no alternatives (g6 is met by Qxe6+, Kh8, g4)
An attempt to push forward and strangle Black. After the game, while discussing ideas with my opponent, we came up with the clever 22. Bxg6 Qxg6 23.e6 Qe4 24.Qe3 Nd8 25.Qxe4 dxe4 26.d5 creating a pair of deadly passed pawns for White.
The f-file can now be opened for the rook, and e6 made safe for the knight through the exchange.
And now the knight has a bit more flexibility with any plans moving forward.
Black's position has now suddenly become much more dynamic with the potential to build threats - advanced knight, rook on the f-file, queen on the a6-f1 diagonal, and a strong (but "hidden") bishop.
?? A blunder which costs the game. Kh1 was probably the best to ensure King safety.
Rf2 doesn't win the Queen here anymore, unless the Queen can be mandated to stay on the 2nd rank, which can be accomplished by deflecting the tall-pawn to concede the c-file to the other rook to get to the 2nd.
And now Black is clearly winning with an impending mate.
Hi everyone!<n><n>My opponent, Master Chrisobee kindly invited me to take part in his MT called Amor Vincit Omnia ( Love conquers all).  Sadly here, the only thing that got conquered was Henry!  I expect you are wondering what the title of this annotation means.  Well, it means accept your opponent's undefended material with caution, especially when you are playing against an Expert or a Master.  It is true that even GMs blunder (remember, Messrs Nigel Short and Victor Korchnoi both blundered into mate in one - this was covered into Amatzia Avni's Danger in Chess) but it is RARE!  Nine times out of 10, if you take the offering, your opponent will either regain the sacrificed material with interest or, like me, you could cop Old Matey!  How did this happen?  Well, here is the Gameknot Analysis version: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16902121&rnd=0.25633523027782023.
2. Bc4 - after a double king pawn opening we get this move.  It is called The Bishop's Opening because the bishop comes out before the knight.  It can transpose into several openings, The Vienna, Guicco Piano and even, as in our game, the Ruy Lopez.
7...... c3 - Chris decided to advance his pawn to c3 rather than his knight.  Later on he will put the Wicked Witch of the West on that square (via d3) to disastrous effect for Yours Truly.
17. ..... Bb7 - rather than trade knights I decided to develop a piece, Fou Leblanc to defend my c6 knight.  Chris initiates the trade because he sees that my d6 isolani is a bit of a weakie.
20. ..... Rd7 - here I decided to add to the defense of my weak d pawn and to also line up my rook on the same file as the Wicked Witch.
24. .... Bc6 - if PxP?? then BxP skewering the rooks on d7 and e8.
25. .... Qa8? - The move looked OK but here Chris suggested PXP as an improvement which will lead to a trade off of our lsbs.
28. ..... axb3??? - here, after a series of exchanges, I decided to grab the bishop on b3.  This turned out to be fatal for Henry, although if I did not take the bishop then Gameknot Analysis' suggested alternative would have left Chris with a clear pawn up in a rook ending and an overall advantage in excess of +2 which, against an opponent of that calibre is, I believe, sufficient grounds for resignation due to ruinous loss of material.  But, as Master Freddy would say, even with a material deficit there is hope whereas if you resign or cop Old Matey there is none.
31. .... Kxg3 - and further up still where he will meet his ......
Hi everyone!<n><n>In this game I was the exchange and a pawn up.  You would think that it would have been a gift from heaven from Freddy, wouldn't you?  A real chance for me to get that elusive victory against Expert opposition and earn myself the username TheBlackQueen.  The reality was different.  Passivitis set in and allowed Freddy to mass all his pieces around Henry.  My own pieces were fairly close to Henry but were very poorly co-ordinated in defense.  When playing Freddy and Ion I am sometimes caught between two stools, to be aggressive prematurely - i.e. to use Glenda as a Lone Wolf or to dig in and become passive and hopefully ride out the storm.  I tried to get aggressive with Freddy and put Glenda on a4, preparing a possibility of a queenside mating attack.  Unfortunately this move was a waste of tempo and Glenda would have been better served on h1 to enable Henry to get sanctuary on the queenside and to stop the Wicked Witch and her henchmen pouring in via the kingside.  I will let you, the Inquest Jury decide how I should have prevented this invasion and converted my material advantage to victory.  But before you decide, here is how the action unfolded.
10. Ke2 - Henry must give up the right to castle.
12. Rxh3 - bishop trade.
14. Be3 - Freddy has a lead in development and I must now try and catch up!
16. Bxf2 - I decided to get rid of the nuisance pawn, but would a queen move to h1 been the order of the day here?
17. Qa4 - wrong decision, wrong decision, wrong decision!  If I could turn back the clock I would have moved Glenda to h1 and then the QR to g1.  The idea of a possible later Q or B x a7 seemed so inviting at the time.
21. dxe4 - pawn trade.  Now Henry is cut off from the c file due to a possible pin on my d2 knight which will remain on this square for the rest of the game.
26. Rd1 - a rook is pulled back to d1 to defend my knight.  I also have an idea of trying to trade rooks on the d file but this plan does not materialise.
This was the message that Freddy received from me: "Game won, congratulations! Resignation note from jstevens1: Hi Freddy, You are right. It is #7, viz:- Variation A 29. Kg1 Be3+ 30. Kf1 Nh2+ 31. Ke2 Qxg2+ 32. Kxe3 Ng4+ 33. Kf4 Rf8+ 34. Kg5 Ne3+ 35. Kxh5 Rh8# And there is an even shorter mate in:- Variation B 29. Ke1 Qxg2 30. Qc1 Bg3# I will be calling for Gameknot Analysis as soon as I hit the resign button and will start annotating this game in due course but for the record I am resigning our game on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate. Well played! Joanne" <n><n>So, four pieces were enough to weave a mating net around Henry.  Oh well, there will always be another game and in fact I am currently playing him as white.  At least until the outcome of that game, TheBlackQueen must wait.
Protecting the Rook

The King's Indian is designed to use the fianchetto. I was later than earlier to start it.
I have pressure on his d4 pawn while making a trade to isolate his "a" rank pawn. Why not?
With this move I make him trade queens at the outset before he can castle. He should not take my e5 pawn unless he wants to risk a centrally fixed king without shelter.
I am playing a 14 year old. And is he smart!  When he came into GK I thought he was just an ego that needed an ego beating. <n>So I do get a trade to open up my own fianchetto (the only time, usually, I ever employ the fianchetto is in the King's Indian Defense. It is a solid defense against d4 to date).
He had to go this way. If he had done e3xd4 then his pawns (and pawn skeleton) would be compromised.
I do this to engage but mostly to allow my queen to move about the d8-a5 diagonal. At the same time I am still ready to do QxQ if d4 takes c5. In the latter case White can't really castle. In the former case ????
He had to free the rooks into a tie together now. Rooks work better together.
I am just making it harder for white to use that pawn to take c5 pawn. Anytime a king is in the line of fire a pin is always recommended.
He knows his king needs to get out of where he was.
I have to do something in return to be alive.  I can't take the d4 pawn. It is protected x4 and I hav4 x3....
A pin to align my rooks x2.
An offer to trade rooks and deal with the after math.
I think it is best to deal with this....
Aftermath here. I have stacked pawns where his rook can come and get me and create havoc. I am thinking I have to take out the knight straightway....
He has to trade.
I am actually trying to clear the board for freedom. Get the stacked pawn out and get more maneuver.
I prevent his king from moving and take an open rank with my rook....
He is re positioning his bishop to a better location...
I decide to advance on the left...
I decide to engage....
He attacks d2 square. But in the meantime....
I am advancing on the left (for black).
Now his king is coming to intervene...
This was a pawn to take in the taking.  in retrospect I think this is where I sort of screwed up.  But not at the time....
I wanted to be able to do something about both h2 and a2 pawns at this point. It is not an aggressive move I admit but our kings are face to face here off color to attack from oppositional bishops. One bishop is always dedicated to one color and that makes it difficult when you have a bishop and the other has a bishop...
Protecting his f4 pawn with his h2 pawn in the same diagonal....
I am trying to get my bishop BEHIND his lines..
Trying to get behind HIS lines....
I brought the bishop back to go to the right side (black's) because the h3 pawn is trapped anyway.
Not ready to put my bishop into c5 for anything...instead
See if I can do something on the left to release action there....
I have no idea and this is the time to advance on the right to a5.
I want to attack the f4 pawn...
It looks good to go for....
Better to go back to the left side (black's) to deal with this....
Best place for my bishop...
Equal best place for his bishop...
He is not in the mood for a victory and neither am I.
Not sure about this move developing a bishop or castling would have seemed more logical to me, but I'm sure white is going to storm the kingside, I am going to storm the Queenside..
My knight is badly placed and this will allow me to get rid of the bishop
I chose the Caro-Kann opening because it develops a flank attack, gives black a good pawn structure, often with a central pawn majority, and it does not require much theoretical knowledge to play. I chose to annotate this game because of how simply the game developed, with no major mistakes by white, and no majorly brilliant moves by black, to give black a clear and easy win.
White played the opening quite effectively. Usually black develops his light squared bishop on the king's side, but white has made this impossible. His centrally fianchettoed light-squared bishop looks strong.
Allowing for the development of the dark-squared bishop. Since white has already constricted the light-square bishop on the king side, it is no great loss to block it in.
White begins to contest the c-file, but it would have been better to develop the knight first.
I decided against the fianchetto because I saw no way of clearing the diagonal in the near future.
Adding pressure on the c-file, but it is easily averted...
I'm not sure what I was thinking with this move, but it turned out to be the match-winning move. I suppose I guessed that white would exchange the rooks, leaving black in control of the c-file.
Another rook exchange is in the offing. White will gain control of the c-file with the queen, but at a large price. He will lose his bishop.
Trying to gain tempo on the white queen, but I also got the idea at this point that my best plan was to exchange off the major pieces and be left with material advantage in the end game.
Again a good square for white's queen. Queen and bishop in unison could have developed a threat on the black king earlier on, but the fruitless contest for the c-file prevented this. Best to remove the threat now.
Perhaps wanting to kick out the light square bishop one day, and attack the knight.
Continuing with the plan to exchange off pieces.
Off to assist the central pawn, but black will reach there in time to defend.
The advantage of the light square bishop at work. White has to waste a move putting the pawn out of danger before moving his king to the centre. c6 is a pivotal square for the light-square bishop, threatening the pawn groups on both sides of the board.
This move is intended to prompt the h3 pawn forward to give black's pawns scope to attack.
Now I want to expend time to force the white king to move. This square gives the white king the opportunity to move to f1, where a check mate is possible.
And mate beckons.
When I first learned to play, I learned to start with e4. But there is so much material to learn for the Sicilian that I decided with my coaches encouragement to change to d4 and later to c4 as my opening. I do not like to play e4 against players rated over 1600, but I feel I must do so as a surprise sometimes.
This move puts us either into the two Knights or four Knights and I am very comfortable with those. I am also comfortable with Bc5 and the the Evans Gambit. Too bad I didn't get to play that here.
I rarely play the Scotch, but my coach has encouraged me to do so, and I recently spent 4 hours of training on the opening with my coach, so I decided to play it for the experience.
exf6 is just not sound, and retreating the Bishop to b3 is good, but it does not seem to be in the spirit of this opening. so I choose to try and keep pressure on my opponents.
The first move I feel that really required some thought. This breaks the pin and starts an attack on the e5 pawn, but it is a bit ugly. Now the Bishop on c8 is a prisoner.
Opening theory has several options here. I could certainly exchange the Knight on c6, but the pawn structure hasn't been settled yet, and it could open up. I will hold onto the Bishop pair just a bit longer, to see how things unfold.
This is why I have trouble with correspondence chess. Sometimes you forget your plans from the day before. I should have continued to develop. But I forgot my plan to keep the Bishop pair, and I noticed I could get my pawn back without any trouble, so I did so.
This is Black's first really hard decision. I have taken us out of book with my mix-up, but Black must figure out what to do about the pawn on c6. I understand this move, but I think Nb8 is more accurate. It allows the Bishop to develop to a much better square. I think this Bishop stayed stuck for quite some time.
I considered Nc3 and Bf5, but I realized that the Bishop is already developed in this case. I am going to attack the King, and the Bishop can get there as easily from c1 as from any place else. I did not like Nc3 because it didn't support my idea of a King side attack. I think I missed the idea of Nd2, with Nf3 to follow, but it looked ugly to Block my Bishop and it seemed to take a long time for my attack to develop if I started with Nd2.
Okay...this is a mistake. The King will become exposed. I am going to have a very strong attack, based on the calculation Nh6+, Kg7, Nxf7, Kxf7 e6+! Kg8, exd7 which opens the King up for an attack and wins a pawn. I don't think we need to calculate beyond Nh6+, Kh8 we all know the Black Queen would be lost.
Maybe I should have developed the Knight instead, but I just saw the King and Rook lined up on that diagonal, and I just didn't feel I was losing too much time setting up the possible tactic. It couldn' lose too much time because Black must prevent the tactic before he can start his own operations.
Qxb7??...what a blunder! I had a comfortable lead, and I didn't take time to calculate Black's possible responses.
What can I do? I need time to regroup my pieces I am getting ready to resign. I can't cover my back or second rank sufficiently, and Qa5 can't work because of d3, and the threat of Bxf2+ winning the Queen.
Black has given me a break. Kg8 keeps the pressure on. You see, the Rook on f5 prevents the Queen from going back to a5 because of discovered attacks available.
Okay...it is bad, but I am starting to rebuild. e1 is now safe...the problem is the Knight on b2 and the Rook on a1. If I solve them both I can equalize.
Wow...The King on g7 and not g8 is the only opportunity for me to solve my problem.
This is the last real mistake. The King can be checked with the capture of the pawn, and White's pieces suddenly have a serious attack.
After taking the Bishop here, Black realized that g4 was mate, and resigned. But I think I had good control at this point...alternative moves seem to allow White to simplify the position or hold onto the lead.
black opened his defense and my attention got drawn to h6 ... unfortunately, I was blinded by ambition and tried to get to the h6 square at all costs ... and it cost me the game
... Instead, I broke up my King's protection and stacked my pawns on the f-file
This was an obvious blunder.  The move 15. Qd3 would have been much better as it negates the fork that results and protects the c-pawn ... further, if I'd made 13. Bg2, black wouldn't have found this peach of an opening.  This is just a continuation of the error on 13
Still thinking about a king side attack and I see a potential opening and an opportunity to win my piece back ... unfortunately, I forgot that black is allowed to move his pieces
... a chance to win back my piece ...
... Again, I forgot that black can move his pieces ... even his pawns.  I think I must have not looked a tthe board very well and thought that I had a double check and that the pawn couldn't take my bishop
I think I was trying to get my rook into the mix.
After my 5º move I would have waited a little longer to castle!
F5 was the best option, along with Bb7, because this allows
Thans God he did it. His final chance was to accept his mistakes with Qg6, and after Bxg6, take with the F pawn, and that would have given me some heavy work, but, I would still have the upper hand!
Finally, let's take the king to dance!
I really enjoyed this game, specially because fire works are not my strength! Nevertheless, it all came possible thanks to my opponent greed!<n>I hpe you liked it as well!
Taking the pawn looks suspect, though it seems playable if the number of responses in the database is anything to go by.
Black leaves e6 for the time being.
Getting a solid central pawn formation already. There's a definite risk to the Benoni, I read, and given the opening is where I usually gain ground against my opponent, I'm confident.
Finally Black contests my spearhead in the centre.
Black pins my Bishop.
I want to get my Bishop out, so decide to cover the b-pawn. It's perhaps a bit of a wasted tempo, since I'll want to move the Rook again at some point, and in fact could probably have played the Bishop out (13.Bg5?) anyway.
I think Black's Knight is heading to f6, to make up for the other's absence.
I hadn't expected this, and in retrospect I wish I had got rid of this Bishop when I had the chance, leaving Black with a hole on g7. Better still was retreating to f4, attacking the undefended d-pawn.
Instead of these options I go quite wrong. Interestingly, this would probably have been playable had the Black Knight still been on b8. But my caution in covering the b-pawn has given Black the chance to develop it, and he now has the chance to throw my game into disarray!
Black gets my pawns in the required mess.
Fortunately, Black misses this possibility too, and I get the chance for some very desperate defending...
I'm planning on doubling up my Rooks behind that weak h-pawn, but driving the Rook away with 20.f4 was a better plan.
Instead driving my King into the corner and stopping me doubling the Rooks behind the h-pawn.
Curiously missing a chance to line his big guns up against me with 22...Rh5
Adding to the h-pawn's defence. But placing my Queen on the open file is disastrous; after 24.Re8 and the forced exchange of my Rook on e1 I'm probably finished.
At the very least I can undouble my pawns. However, Black might have been better keeping his Queen on the board.
The King heads out, but it's going nowehere while my Rook controls the only open file. I've rather weathered the storm and am only a pawn down, and a Rook pawn at that. It could have been much worse. Usually this tiny advantage is enough for my opponent, but he's rather underestimated his lead. It's not going to be easy.
I need to get my King towards the centre.
I was also threatening to win the h-pawn after 30.Rh1.
It's supposedly not best to exchange pieces when a pawn down, but that pawn advantage is the h-pawn, which has a light Queening square, so I try to persuade my opponent to swap Bishops...
Always more assertive with pawn moves, now my b-pawn can't go to b4 any time soon.
Hoping to get my Rook to the b-file...
Planning to advance the b-pawn while I can force the opportunity.
This completely threw me. I was expecting something like 34...Re8, to force a path for the King. I didn't think enough about the implications, and carried on with my plan...
Now Black can afford to allow an exchange of Bishops and win another pawn into the bargain with 35. b3 axb3 36. Rxb3 Ba4 37. Rc3 Bxc2 38. Rxc2 Rxa3
Now I have finally got rid of that light-squared Bishop - the one that's supposed to have trouble finding its place in this opening and which has been the source of some irritation.
So I go for broke. Clearly it's better to keep this pawn covered and bring my King into the game. But then I just face a long grinding down, so I decide to take my chances...
Unfortunately, while Black's Rook is protected by his pawn, mine isn't, and I must give up another pawn...
I don't want to allow Black's King any headway, but this loses as after 45...h4 gxh4 the pawns are split and probably easier to pick off.
Black needs to get his King forward.
My Rook is the only thing stopping it, so i want to keep it on this rank.
He needs to push the c-pawn to allow the Rook out.
I get behind the danger pawn, but perhaps should have played 48.Ra7+, which, according to the analysis, drives the King to his back rank.
Finally Black has no option but to give up the c-pawn
I pondered and pondered on which was better - taking the pawn with the Rook or going after it with the King and so keeping Black's King from advancing. Of course I chose the wrong option!
The pawn falls! Only now do I see that after 50...Ra3 I can only play 51.Rc3 and after the exchange the Black King mops up.
Now I stop the Black Rook from going to a3.
He starts to exchange pawns. But with my Rook still on the board I have drawing chances. What's the saying - Rook and pawn endgames are all drawn?
There's a risk of going here if the Black Rook gets behind my King.
There's a lot of shuffling going on, and I see what Black's plan is - he wants to exchange but be able to recapture with his Rook, so he doesn't have a passed Rook pawn, which is harder to Queen than the g-pawn would be. I can't see any way of stopping this plan.
I know there's a draw here if I get it right, for it seems Black is shaping up to block any check with his Rook...
It's crucial that I go straight back rather than to f3. If I keep doing this the Black pawn can't Queen.
I need to have this position with Black to move.
If, for example, I'd played to f1 Black could play 73...Kf3 74.Kg1 g2  and my King must move out of the way to allow the pawn through.
I need to keep backing away straight.
Finally the draw is agreed. After 83.Kg1 Black must give up the pawn or stalemate me anyway.
3. ...... Qe7 - skewers my knight against my e4 pawn and winning it very soon.
6. ........ Qxe5 - after a knight trade on e5 black has now restored material equality.
8. Qd4 - Glenda decides to come out to play, ah, she still has to defend something though, the pawn on e4!
11. Bf3 - Fou Leblanc decides to lend more support to my e4 pawn.
13. ........ Qxg4 - after Glenda decides to go back indoors there follows a B for N trade.  Glenda moves to f3 to try to drive back the Wicked Witch of the West.  The Witch flies back to d7.
16. Kh1 - Henry moves into the corner because he does not want to see the Witch on b3!  He likes her not!
22. Qf2 - Glenda had to sidestep a discovery but now a combo from my opponent leads to the 2 piece for rook imbalance - hence the title of this annotation.
27. c3 - trying to shut off part of the enemy dsb's long diagonal.
34. Re3 - must defend the c3 pawn.
46. ...... Bc3+ - tightens the screw.
50. ...... f2 - black is very close to getting a queen.  Henry moves to e2 to stop it.
52. Kf1 - the only move to avoid immediate loss but Bd3+ forces Henry to g2 and the pawn will crown forcing me to give up my rook.  I therefore resign on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  Hope you've enjoyed this, part 2 will be coming up very shortly.
The Giuoco Piano is my current major subject of chess study.  I have been playing on FICS recently and in games so far I have noticed that most players diverge (if White) after 4. ... Nf6 or (if Black) after 5. d4.  The resulting games vary wildly.<n><n>Here, I play Black.  My opponent, after the initial moves, elects to exchange off as quickly as possible.  My goal in the game is to use this to my own advantage by dictating the timings and concentrating towards the center.
The normal 5. ... d5 is out.  On 6. exd5, 6. ... Nb5 7. Qa4 Nxc4 8. Qxc4 Bd6 has Black into full retreat with the loss of a pawn - and that's the best option.  The text covers White's planned intrusion and develops the Rook.
White persists in the attack.  6. O-O and development, or 6. d4 in the center would be preferable.  The result is going to be poor largely because of the Queen's over-ambition.
The exchange is a disaster for White, even though the count comes even.  Black is developed and controls the center: White is entirely not, and all his pieces are block in.<n><n>My game plan from here is to control the center, gain a pawn majority as the position permits, and roll to victory.
Retreat is not plausible, and the fiancetto'd Bishop will attack e4.
If 12. Bxc5 bxc5 the Knights and pawns control the middle still, and White loses his only developed piece - again.  The text aims to force a retreat but it's too early for White to resume his offensive as he gives away a pawn.  12. Nd2 was in order.  (Black follows with Bc7 or possibly Ng4.  If 12. ... Bxe3 13. fxe3 gives White a substantial center which will frustrate Black's control and threaten the Knight and King with O-O later.)
This plays into White's attack and Rook advantage.  23. ... Nd7 was better.  Then if 24. b5 c5 and Black's position is better than the text.
Until this point White's attack had done well enough but the pressure is off now and Black's Knight is home free.  27. Kg3 was better and might have won the game for White.<n><n>Black is now looking to trade down.  With the pawn line strongly held the advantage of an extra piece should force at least a draw - even with a poorly placed bishop and no rook.
protecting the king.
was willing to give up that knight  to get the queen.
my goal at this point  of game would be is to get rid of as many knights , bishops and rooks as I can but to protect my pieces at the same time.
protecting my queen because i need it to go forward with my plan.
leading the charge
knew what white was up to so I threat to take his knight.  I just knew my bishop was doomed and was going to get capture.
one good thing that came out of my mistake was that I was able to get his bishop
trying to get my queen or rook
gtting close to the king.
trying to get my queen
going to portection
leading an attack and saw a way to check my king.
trying to capture the knight before it could check my king.
white  went for my bait  and fell in to the   trap
White dodges it for now, and I'm certainly not going to open up my own King's position with P-KN4.
If White captures, I will have a half-open KB file for my KR to use. Of course, I would have to unpin my KN first so I could clear the decks.
This exposes my King in a dangerous manner, but I figure it's worth the gamble to win a piece.
Counterattack on the Rook.
I still have a fighting chance, with a Rook and Knight against a Queen and Pawn. The ending is a technical win for White, but I can put up a lot of resistance.
Preventing the Rook from checking on the KN file.
My Rook can now wander, not being confined to guarding the QRP.
Now White has just 1 piece left. If I can take his passed KRP off the board, I feel my chances of a draw are excellent.
Now White must either defend or advance the Pawn.
Here my opponent is trying to close down on my bishop, I had two options in my mind, a3 or a4, I played...
a3, because if 6. a4 bxa4 7. Bxa4, and my bishop is no longer on a2-g8 diagonal which I like so much.
I didn't know what to think about this move. For me the queen come out to quickly, but if more support is added to her, it could mean trouble.
Protecting my e and f pawn.
Another piece to protect my weak e pawn.
Whit this move I was trying to drive away the Queen, and put some pressure on e5 Knight.
And here I was starting to think about rook sacrifice. It was may turn to move, and if he goes for my rook, I could take my pieces closer to black King.
I took two pieces for rook, and another trap is set. If my opponent decided not to take the rook, instead he will play Kxd6, then Nxf7+, and his rook is gone too.
If my opponent wont take my Knight, which is protected with my Bishop on a2-g8 diagonal, than is mate in 3 or 2 ;).
Obviously the rook is too important for my opponent. Mate in 3 or 2 ;).
3. Checkmate. I think it was a good game, I like to see some comments, if you like this game too, and to correct me if I made some mistakes in the game. Have a nice day.
Locking in the strong point at Q4.
Adding support to *his* Pawn structure.
Preventing the Bishop move. But...
queens side pawns are sacrificed to gain advantage on the kings side
the plan is to get control of the e-file
press for an advantage on the e-file
press an attack
this move was premature but black must be concerned with the middle now
attacks my advanced pawn and opens up the white diagonal for his bishop
good defense ant attack at the same time - i need to get busy now or my opponent will exploit his material advantage
black is now in position to increase his material advantage
if he take the bishop i may have a winning continuation
and mate - whew!
Must mängib valge käigupuudusele!
now i'm -6, i can't imagine how to win whith a good player
and this was his mistake ...
Two Knights Tango. Leads to classical positions but surprises the opponent.
Although the idea of retaining a stronger center on Nxd6 is good, black needs to watch for a pin on the f6 knight in the future.
A damaging move. I have yet to castle to kingside. This may have been appropriate if I castled kingside.
Premature. Better would have been to develop the bishop on b7 and prepare for queenside castling.
The reason for this gambit was unclear to me. Maybe to shake off some pressure on f7,  but it does not seem validated. Black has ruined chances to castle queenside.
Alehine's defense, new to me, boy was I about to get a lesson in how this thing works.
four-pawn attack - I went this way because I'd rather die fighting then defending.
an ill-fated attempt at material recovery.<n><n>If instead<n>Knf3...QxB and I'll eventually be down 5 pts instead of 3<n><n>if Kg2...then Be4 and leads to me having half my pieces pinned
I'm surprised this knight didn't fall into the giant black hole in the centre of the board where my four-pawn attack used to be
I had I gone first with the bishop to e3 I could have prevented the loss of the P on c4
Another example of me missing a developmental weakness and hamstringing myself.  Also caused by not moving the bishop to e3 before castling
And the lackluster result, in hindsight, <n><n>If instead<n>Bf4, then e5 and I'm still running
Need to move the Knight to effective attack the e pawn, also allows me to capitalize on my poorly placed bishop to make him retreat for once
I don't mind this exchange, I'd prefer to keep the bishop as the board clears
At this point I am eyeing f4 as a great spot for my knight if I can support with the g and h pawns
Grab an open file now that the bishop is strong - looking to infiltrate to the 7th row because of where his knights are placed
looking to win a pawn
I think at this point I have done a good job of tying up his pieces but I cannot find a way to capitalize and start winning back material.  At a loss on this point I take up position on f4 as planned.
He (rightly so) attacks right away to prevent my support from g and h arriving.  Again, another example where I should have setup this positional move with support first (such as h4) before making it
The question I begin asking myself here is, is there any way to take advantage of his constricted position to back his king into the corner?
In this way I can capture e5 removing the Knight by c6 square.
To avoid a DISASTER.
Now, with 3 points up, I have good reasons to try to exchange.
To avoid DISASTER another time.
Very good move. This move threatens Q:b2 if I choose to not defend b2 pawn with my Queen; same with d3; f4 if I choose to not defend f4 pawn with my Rook and above all Bd5.
And now I start to play my easy endgame...
bishop exchange
Another computer analysis Inaccuracy:  Best was 11. Bd3 O-O 12. O-O Rab8 13. b3 Rfe8 14. Nb5 Nxe4 15. Nxc7 Re5 16. Nb5 a5 17. Bxe4 Bxe4 18. Nd6 Bd5 19. e4
bishop swap
had to retreat
thought it was good to get a pawn back.
After exchange black would bring his knight with tempo into the game.
symmetrical. I win a tempo after exchange.
To make more alternatives, which black must now calculate.
Black king is in safe, but after exchanges I want to bring in a pawn, that is why the king better stands in the middle.
Make contact between the rooks and centralize the king, too. The black knight has no good place, but must move.
I donot want to make better these pawns, so I try to exchange the lightfigures. If the knight goes away, the e5 pawn is over.
I want to give my knight for the d5 pawn, to get the a-b-c files, where I can make an isolated pawn, what black must catch, so I get time for win the fight on the kingside and push a pawn in.
black resigns, because have no pawnmoves and the d6 pawn hangs, so I can make the territory on the kingside mine.
8. Nf5 - after an exchange of bishops on d7 I move my knight to an aggressive square putting pressure on the backward d pawn.
9. .......... g6 - tries to drive the f5 knight away but .......
10. Nd5 - piling up on the pinned f6 knight and threatening a nasty bishop fork on f6 should the f5 knight be taken.  Black tries to wriggle out with a queen check on a5.
14. ........... Rg8 - up to here I have been following the database.  However, I look at the square f6 and my gut instinct tells me to analyse the board.  I therefore decide to exchange bishop for knight at e5.  This protects the c3 pawn for just one move.  I could have rounded up the pawn immediately but I think this is an improvement.  When playing through the analysis I noticed something else - the bishop taking on e5 also frees up the f6 square for my knight and bang we get a knight fork winning the g8 rook.  That is what will happen if black takes the f5 knight.  However, I also noticed that when I played out dxe5, Nf6 - the checkmate detector came on!  Wow, I thought.  I then set up conditional moves for both possible captures.  You can guess what black chose here, can't you?
16. Nf6# - yup, it is mate!  The pawn move onto the e file has opened up the d file for Glenda to control with fatal consequences for black!  A knight checkmate - cool!
I am now in a position to castle.
And I take his.
I check with my bishop, he now can't take my pawn due to the threat and he must block the check.
He could of taken the free pawn, but he got is bishop out of the way in order to castle.
I open up my bishop, protecting the e5 square for: e5.
I my pawn up to e5, as planned.
And I take his pawn with my own. :D
I threaten his queen with my own queen and my knight, seeing: 17. Qxd1 Ne7! 18. Kh8 Qxd1!
I capture his bishop… FOR FREE! and check his king, forcing him to move, which then allows me to capture his queen! :D
And I get his queen!
And I retreat.
I push up my rook…<n>And he resigns! :D What a game. I won with a bit of luck but it was a tight game in the end.
wastes a tempo and seems to achieve little
This was primarily to open up whites position and to make castling difficult for him
trying to tempt gxh6 Bxh6 as then whites h pawn gets in the way of his rook, notice also that his dsb has very limited scope as most of his pawns are on black squares
closing the area around the black king
The bishop here is an irritation but not much more. I was trying to figure out how to open up the position so I could get at whites exposed king
I would be happy to exchange queens as I am so close to promoting
I was thinking about under promoting to a knight, with hindsight it may have been wise as this is the move that meant I couldn't win
trying to win a pawn
attacking the black bishop
! if cxd5 then Qxc7 winning a pawn
? if black was going to exchange queens he should have taken the queen first. why? read the next comment
by far the best move if Ne7? then white goes Nxe7+ winning the rook on c8.
attacking the a7 pawn and the black rook
trying to push the b pawn and black is trying to push his a pawn, who win????
!! the best move of the game!! black sacs his rook for the horse cause after white takes, black goes a2 and queens!! hoped that you liked it? please comment and rate it on the star system.
I decide to recapture with my Knight and keep the g file open
he guards against Nf4 and I activate my Rook
lining up an attack on the b8 > h2 diagonal, also protecting f6 Pawn, freeing up the knight
so I retreat the Knight as planned and increase the pressure on the g file
hoping to eventually get my Knight to e4, via Nd6
so I defend it and the pressure build towards his King.
overlooking that Rxh4 is mate due to the pin on the g Pawn and that 32... exf3 covers the only other square available for his king.<n><n>okay a win against 'Fisher' not quite like winning against the great Bobby Fischer but still an enjoyable game..<n><n>Thanks for looking.
White has some good pressure on the h pawn and will probably look to utilise the open b file. Black is  thinking of castling long as I believe white will castle short, get greedy and take the h pawn allowing black some attacking opportunities. This is all very early and not sound thinking,however, it is what was going through my mind.
I think white should push the pawn here, freeing the bishop and controlling d6
Black develops the bishop trying to tempt black to weaken the kingside a little with h3
Black brings the Queen to a more active square
White chases the bishop, I am happy about this as I intend to castle long and may even give up kingside pawns if white castles short in order to bring rooks into very active positions on h8,g8 with the bishops also applying pressure
White is hoping to exchange and bring the queen to a better square, I am going to castle long and have ideas of sacrificing the rook if black castles short.
I think the sacrifice is on, but am unsure so will put the bishop on a stronger square
White has definate plans on the queen side but black is going to open up white's king side in explosive fashion ...RxP !! There are several options open to White:<n>PxR, QxP, N-F3 R-H8 threatening mate.<n><n>Black intends to double the rooks on the h file threatening mate, and may be given options to take the pawn on e3, <n><n>G3 is met by Rh1+ then Q-h3 which inturn threatens mate.
White is trying to escape,I am going to offer the sac again, if white moves kf1 then r-e2 pinning the knight. If nf3 then I may exchange as the q on h3 looks very strong.
Game over now,the rook trundles along to h8 and black has mate threats which white cannot answer:
Lets try to transpose to a Sicilian
tying the rook to the defence of the promotion threat
! to support e5, but even the black has Bc5+ to remove from the threat with tempo, I only need to be careful after Kh1
the open g1-a7 diagonal gives me an escape route removing the bishop from the fork with tempo...
maybe better was 16.Kh1 to set black a trap and then 17.e5
... to remove also the queen
?? the sacrifice of the pawn is beneficial to black as the h1-a8 diagonal is now open
and both my bishops are now aimed against the opponents king
bringing the queen to the fight near white's king
tying the knight to the defence of f4
I need to have caution against some tactics such as 1.Rxb2 Rxb2 2.Bh7+ ... 3.Rxd8 wining the b pawn, but I will play Bf3 as for now the threat Qf2-Qxg2++ is sufficient to prevent it
a new trap gxf3 Qxf3++, and the threat Bxe2 to Qxf4
conscientiously leaving the back rank week to deflect the d rook
a nice sacrifice, to finish, to deflect the knight from the 2nd rank and achieve Bxg2++ a smothered mate with a bishop!
A nice finish to a nice game, during the game some inaccuracies from white allowed black to achieve a two pawn advantage and create a strong passed pawn, that focalized white's defensive efforts, and abled black to develop an attack on the king.
i take full advatage of the situation and take the center board
and i take the unprotected pawn moving my queen up higher on the board
i decide to castle to get my rook active
i did this to get my bishop to back up my pawn
why not keep the rook on the 8 rank?
This is passive - he needs to castle and then hit my centre.
According to plan.
Also according to plan.
So that if I play Bh3 he can retreat his bishop.
And he with his.
As his Nb1 is committed to d2, I can play this - otherwise I would have taken back with the knight - although maybe this is a mistake too, as he could now have play Ne4, attacking Bc5 and f6, forcing me to play Bd5xNe4.
Perhaps stopping g5-g4 and the exchange of white squared bishops, but leaving his d pawn backwards on a semi-open file.
Threatening to exchange bishops.
Seldom played, but very good, in my view. It becomes difficult to work the pawn storm I normally plan here.
My aim is not d4. I want to break in into the kingside with g and h, while defending d4 even at cost of c3.
I can't avoid e5 forever, but it holds for now.
No, you won't put this knight on f5, to go to h4 supported by the queen... and I am free to play this now, I have to take it, now or never.
If cxd5, dxN, and d6 is not enough to compensate (bxce, Bxce+, forking the rook...). exd5 was dangerous, with the black queen still there, and e5 coming soon...
...and this allows black time to defend d5. Now what?
Black allows the discovered queen-check. Ok, now, which is the best square to move the knight on? I was trying to trap the black queen, or at least to force her to retire in a bad position, but it didn't seems possible. Can you see why?
...and for this reason, I should have played a3. The problem was that this allowed e5 by black, a threat I have to keep my eyes on. My position is lost. I am at the very bottom...
...so my opponent doesn't fall for it. Very good. I have a tempo to reorganize myself. Can this queen cause harm? Yes, on h4 it will be annoying. So, don't rush for some piece in c7, be wise...
... this also blocks a future Ba6. It becomes dangerous in some lines.
...but I have this resource. It is disastrous, since after axNb5, QxNb6, Rxa2, causing serious damage to my queenside.
I have to take, or I'll lose my rook. I could have escaped with Rxb7, but it was dangerous to leave the c column to black. d4 is coming, if ever I allow it.
Right place to move the rook, pleas?
Let's say I am tempting black to go Qxh5, allowing me some nasty trick on the queenside... and I can defend f1 in one tempo against the queen and the black's lsb, if needed. Of course, I expected axNb5, here, freeing my lsb for my good. But instead...
It had to come, sooner or later. I'm sure this was not the right timing. I can't allow black to open the e column, or I'll be lost! By the way: if you asked why I didn't take before b7, this can be part of the answer. The oher is Rb8.
I have to point all my cannons against f7: it's the only way to survive. And miracolously enough, black spared my knight, that now blocks the black queen's action on the d column. My position is still lost, but... my opponent is not playing accurately enough to take full advantage of it.
yes, yes, now I take it back, and Bh6 blocks my queen to the defence of e3... no, no, I have to drive the game to MY way. Can I? Maybe... yes, maybe...
...and that's it! Black now can play Qxh5, but I'm not sure he will get enough after KxB, Qf4+, Kg2...
Weird, but it's a way to make useful the lsb on f1. Now, another discovered queen threat is set. This is becoming pretty complicated. Black can play e4, because of Nxe4, Qxh5+, Ng3, Qh2+, Ke1, Bxb2... very, very dangerous.
More dangerous was e4, in my view. White can still use the queen to retire, in case of emergency.
Where to move the king? It can be a great difference.
A free tempo! Yuppie!!!!!!!
...but not as much as confusing as not to see this mate threat! Now, this will become a deadly fight for f7.
Yes, this is a "superpin", indeed... two hanging rooks pressuring a pinned f7... and a BLACK bishop... but wait, the white's king is still exposed... isn't it?
and now, the winning move!
...but unfortunately for the beauty of the game, black delays it one move. An useless move, I'd say...
To prevent the N from coming to b4.
This blocks the b-file and makes it difficult for Black to coordinate Rs.
Black opts to play aggressively, but this will cost another pawn.
Threatening f5.  If the Black N goes somewhere safe, RxN, KxR, and Nf7+ follow.
This is a mistake.  Black essentially pins the N in a position where it can be exploited.
Even with the R, there is no way for Black to stop all of the pawns.
This moves forces the exchange of Rs.  After this, White can simply promote a pawn.  Black resigned shortly.
I expect him to go for the "4 move checkmate" as there has been a lot of talk about it lately. The clever shimmy from the pony stops his queen making this move.
I've seen this one before. The young Tim has gone in for a dubious and half hearted attack on my wee poor pony.
Et voila. There isn't a lot I can do to move the horse from a danger into an attack, also, it would leave me open at the back.
Now, if I was a betting man, I'd say he'll move that pawn to threaten my pony again....
The Evans Gambit, a difficult line for Black to defend.
Black does need to weaken White's center, but this opens up the game prematurely. With his King in the center, Black should be looking to keep the game closed.
Now Black's King will be caught in the crossfire.
His second and final mistake. But Black misses the saving move: 17... Q-Q2! would put up a fight.
1st try to play the Sokolsky
Try to reinforce the center
Push the night away, but weakens the kingside. Now, I have a plan : Push h pawn to ruin the kingside and attack the king !!
In accordance with the plan, no queen exchange, and pressure on g6-h7
Try to found counter play on the queenside
How to continue the attack now ?
Not Rg7, Be6  Kf8, Qxg7   ! and Nf5
How to continue the attack now ?<n>If Be8 , then Kf8 and it seems under control
Threat is Be8  followed by Rh8. Rdc7 leads to mate after Bh7 , so
This game is by no means perfect with mistakes from both sides. If you like sacks then there's plenty of them here. This has to go down as one of the most enjoyable games i've played just because of the way it was won. It just shows that some sacks are sound and others are just plain lucky.<n>I know nothing of the Silician and don't like playing against it either but that's not what this is about.<n>My comments are from my perspective so feel free to add further comments if you wish. <n>hope you enjoy the game, however scrappy it gets :)
I'm not a fan of the Sicilian, but i know h6 is not very common. Not on move 2 anyway. Normally i'd expect Nc6 or e6, so h6 left me pretty optimistic. I suppose it stops me playing the knight to g5 or the bishop once it's developed but that does not concern me. Altho maybe it's just a waiting move to see what i'm going to do.
I could have and probably should have played Bd2 this time, with blacks next move most likely to be d5 after this. To complete the line 9. Nxd5 Bxd2  10. Nxd2 Nxd5 11. exd5 Qxd5 and it's even.<n>But i always like to be on the attack as you'll see, and i'll take risks to keep it that way.<n>So i took the e pawn with my knight, with the intention that when it's chased off by the rook, i'll sack it on f7.
Sure enough it is chased off. I could back it off and play Ng4!? but black just plays Nxe4 and gets the pawn back and also has the better position....
Castled to get my king to safety while i still could.
I have to retake. One advantage is that there are plenty of open files and diagonals for me to exploit and blacks king looks pretty vunerable.
Nxe4?? This is a very bad move. It gives white the piece back. After 12.Bxe4 Qf6 13.Qh5  g6 14.Bd5  Ke7 15.Qxh6 white is clearly winning. If black took the Bishop after Bxe4 then Qf3  wins the rook.
Fortunately for black and for the game in the end, i missed it and played Bc4 ?? throwing away the advantage. I was too busy concentrating on how to expose blacks king.
Both my bishops on strong diagonals.
Although i'll be material down, the game is actually egded in my favour.<n>With my queen under attack and while still wanting to exploit the black kings vunerability i decide to trade the queen for the rook and bishop to gain complete control of the e file.
I have to take with the rook and allows me to double up at some point too.
I missed the oppertunity yet again to solidfy my advantage. I should have played 19.Re7  Kg6 20.Bd3  Ne4 21.Rxe4 and the position is alot better for white.<n>I was too quick in moving though to spot this and doubled up the rooks instead. In effect this should have left the game in a stone cold draw after....
Nothing else i can do unless i want to give black the advantage.
But i did not see this and continued checking to see where black was intending to put their king.<n><n>(It has also been pointed out since publication that ''Instead of this, 23. Be7!? now, although not the best move, is actually still winning for white. White's other Bishop is better placed on d3 than e2. If after 23. Be7 Qb6 (not 23...Nxe7?? 24. R1e5 g5 25. Rxf6 when Black must give up his Queen to avoid mate.) 24. Bxf6 gxf6 25. Rxf6 Rg8 26. g3 Qd8 27. Ree6! and Black, again, has to give back his Queen.'' Thanks for agmac for pointing this out.<n><n>With Blacks knight covering e5 and my White squared bishop blocking the kings escape it would make sense and give the sack a purpose.<n>however i was always thinking about black playing g5 and would have preferred blacks king on the g file rather than the h file, meaning that g5 isn't an option.)
Running out of ideas i decided to try something crazy, which if you ever play me regulary you will learn to expect. Also you'll notice that i tend to be pretty ignorant towards defence. I'm all about attack, attack, attack, and as one last throw of the dice, i played Be7??<n>'A good sacrifice is one that is not nesscessarily sound but leaves your opponent dazed and confused' - Rudolph Splelmann.<n>The main aim of this move was to divert the attention away from my attack and i didn't really need my bishop anyway.
Nf5 is the move here giving black excellent chances to hold on for the win but....<n>perphaps underestimating the strength of whites current attack, black maybe thinks that Nc6?? is sufficient.
Black will get mated which ever square the king moves to.
Checkmate!<n>I appreciate that this game is not the best for tactical awareness and probably could have been won easier, but it is worth mentioning that when sacrificing pieces, if you take too long thinking over whether the sack is sound or not your oppontent is going to catch on that you want them to take it which is why i didn't especially take the time over my moves and didn't nesscessarily play what was best. However i hope the final outcome makes up for all this , after all not every game is won when you're the equivalent of 13 pawns down :)<n>Thanks to Oinegue for playing and thanks to everybody who looks at my game.<n>comments are much appreciated, even if it's just about how bad my spelling is, lol
trying to attack. maybe Be6 with Rf8 was a bit better.
??? a mate was missed here...<n>16... Kf8 was losing the queen.<n>16... Ke7 17. Rae1  Kd7 (17... Kd8 18. Ne6 ) 18. Nb5 is still lost but can play on...
Now I am a pawn ahead.  With my lack of endgame technique, there is no obvious win, but I guess that my best chances are on the Q side where I have a majority.
Putting the question to the pawn immediately.
Another mistake.  If I play bxc4, it might be a draw because his K can clearly get to my a-pawn.
And I have time to get to his c=pawn.
the Caro-kann
black acepts the offer
attemps to open up the centre
doubles up rooks in an attempt to smach down the a file
Here, Black can capture on d4 and give White an isolated pawn, but then White gets the c-file.
This is a dubious move. The knight was well-posted on e5. Now White prepares to exchange this piece.
If White tries to win the pinned knight with 23. b3 Rc8 24. c4 Nf6 and the Black rooks defend each other.
The bishop is heading for d4.
Black advances his kingside pawns.
No much choice left to black to deffend here. The rook is already out of the game:(
Keeping the presure in the center.
The black center is attacked.
...and covered.
The queen is free to flee, but black wants at least the bishop in return for the given rook.
And black gets it with a chess.
Way too many black pieces are pointed on this sqare for white to hope covering it with this move.
One of black's knights has to be sacrificed and black decides to set a small trap.
White sees it and moves the rook.
And the bishop too:)
My final game in the Annotation Project and my last chance to crow :-)  Although I outgraded scalawag, I could hardly take winning for granted as I have blown several games against lower rated opposition recently, especially in this tournament (take a bow thebishop1000 and graderguy).  Anyway, at the time of writing, this win takes me to 4th place, leapfrogging yoshark, with whom I shared the points earlier, and ahead of fellow inveterate commentators, nuntar and dmaestro, over both of whom I was fortunate enough to do the double.  Congratulations to Freddy and Joanne for heading the pack and Steve for pushing into 3rd place.
Quickly developing the Bishop while attacking the Nh8 and pawn on f4, giving a materialistic White much to ponder.
The N couldn't yet be saved, but the pawn threatens to complicate things.  I'm happy to swap it off.  The Knight can wait.
Now the Queen can move and the Rook will threaten the Knight in her place.
Now the N defends both h7 and e4, freeing the Queen and Rook for action.
Now my Bishop prepares to pin White's d-pawn, thus further delaying freeing moves for White.
I preferred this to advancing the pawn as it looks like weakening White's pawn structure.  However, I'd overlooked White's reply.  I could probably have gained a greater advantage by advancing the pawn to e3.  Black was well placed to support it there.
Black recovers the pawn thanks to the hanging Bg5.
Planning to attack his centre.
! If Rxf7 Bd5!
! Now I can win one of his rooks...
My king has to help, too.
Got to get his king over on the queenside to help.
Now I can push to a2!
For those who don't know, my goal was to sacrifice a pawn to get a good attack on f7 (eventually) and to get a good center now that the pawn on e5 is gone. In most games, white will regain the pawn and will keep a good position. In other games, white will not regain the pawn, but will have a huge advance in development. Common moves for white now are Nf3, Bc4 and d4.
This move keeps pressure on the center and stops the black Queen from going to h4.
The most common move at this point. Black will try a quick attack on the king in some games, and in others, the goal was to defend f4 I hear h4 is good for white, but I don't see it.
If black doesn't take, my development would be great compared to black.
I have a bishop, Queen and rook all charging at f7. Black's goal is to defend without giving any pieces away.
Qxf4 would ruin the entire point of the attack.
Developing the bishop.
Black has to be careful, my attack is getting stronger (Can you believe that I'm going to lose in 3 moves.).
Black needs to defend. This was probobly the best move.
I wouldn't have been to disappointed if this game was a normal game, but this was in the 73rd gameknot tournament. I still have good chances of winning round 2, but I need to play slower now. I wonder if I would have won with d4.
defending the pawn and developing the piece
?! an odd move. "Knights on the rim are dim"
again,another odd move. Black prevents Bg5 but I was not planning to develop my bishop there.
fianchettoing the Bishop and attacking the pawn
This was the turning point for my attitude of the game. I was not going to lay down and die. I was going to win the game at all cost. Whatever it takes. For my friend.
not recapturing the piece. I'm going to need them
I take it,I want to double the pawns up. I at least want to win this pawn back.
bringing the queen into the fray and defending the knight
perhaps to lauch an attack on the kingside?
I am centralizing all of my pieces because I want to open the center,thus opening lines to the king!
a minor mistake IMO. The Knight will play an important role on e5
I want to play 17.f5. I do not have to worry about the a8-h1 diagonal being open now
I don't want to trade pawns,which brings it closer to a draw. I want a win!
no need to hurry. This gets the King involved and covers the 2nd rank
now White choses to get the pawn back
English opening.  Provides the queen access to the field, and all the major responses look favorable to white.
Pd3, however, seems to favor black in the database.
...or Nh4.  Actually, this is probably better than Nd2.  I like it.  Black can play Pd6 to attack the knight with the queen--but with the bishop protecting it the attack is pretty weak.
Now the white h knight has nowhere to move, and the bishop is stuck protecting it, which prevents Pg3.  On the other hand--free pawn.  Bxg4 is looking great!
I'm getting a thrill thinking about Ng6.  Rh7 protects the black rook, followed by NxPe5.  White's black bishop protects the knight, and white gains yet another pawn point.
This could have waited.  As Archduke_Piccolo noted in the comments, Bh5+ forces Ke7 or Kf8, either of which white replies with Ng6+ and then picks off Rh8.
Ng6 still looks good, but as AP notes Bh5+ remains perfectly viable.  NxB, QxN+ followed by Ke7 or Kf8--either of which Ng6+ and the black rook falls.
QxB looks good here.  Black will have to move the rook, Rf8, and white can move in one of the knights.  Things begin looking grim for black.
Oh no, QxB was SO much better.  That knight was fine where it was.  The bishop was free!
That bishop isn't going to sit there forever.
I liked the knight move best.  Rf7 black threatens the queen, but it is an empty threat because Qg8+ and black cannot move Ke7 while Ng6 was played.  Black interposes the rook, QxRf8#.  Game.  Set.  Match.  11 love.<n><n>Here Qe7, QxQ+, KxQ, Rfe1...  Fun, but now the game moves on past 20 moves.
But now comes the big surprise! More common is 5. e5 Nd7 and 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 7. f4 O-O or the gambit line 6. h4 Bxg5 7. hxg5 Qxg5. White is giving up the bishop pair for nothing.
This is fine. After 6. e5 I had planned 6...Bg5 and then if 7. Nf3 Bh6.
Keeping it simple. I cannot do anything to prevent e5 kicking the bishop back. 6...dxe4 7. Nxe4 is not any better. Since I probably will castle kingside anyway, this is the least commiting developing move.
And this is practically forced, since I do not want to lose my better bishop.
I want to play the thematic break move c5 at some point, so Nc6 would be wrong. In addition, I might need the knight's support on the kingside.
I take before it is too late. Usually Black wants to keep the tension in the centre as long as possible, but now c3, protecting d4, was the strategic threat.
This was probably not strictly necessary, but I wanted to rule out the possibility of Nd4-b5-d6 manouver.
At the moment, the rook is only protecting the e-pawn. Later, if I want to play the other break move f6, White will exchange at f6, after which the rook will aim at the e6-pawn. Combined with the knight on d4, this practically prevents the f6-idea.
Since there is no hope of getting rid of the e5-pawn, the knight does not have to pressure that square. Hitting the strong-looking bishop is the idea here. White either retreats the bishop or allows it to be exchanged with the knight.
I use the extra tempo to develop a bishop. Although the (French) bishop's range of motion is very limited, now the rooks are free to move on the back rank.
This is practical. It protects the d4-knight once again and gives the bishop the c2-square.
I do not want to see the bishop and queen line up on the b1-h7 diagonal, so I make the exchange. Also something like Bc2 and b4 would have been very annoying. In addition, White has the space advantage, so exchanging makes my position less cramped.
I decided it was time to put the rooks where they belong to. At this point, it is useful to stop and think about the future. I have the bishop pair, but while the position is closed, it is really not an advantage. My goal is to open the position a bit to make the bishops stronger. On the other hand, I probably want to make my moves on the queenside, while White is more interested in attacking on the kingside. This is dictated by the central pawn structure. White's ideas may involve Ng5 threatening h7-square. I want to answer this with g6. This leaves the dark square a bit weak, but since White's dark-squared bishop is off the board, that does not matter so much. Now that a moved the rook out of the f8-square, the bishop can back up there, giving the king adequate protection for the time being. At the same time, I discard any ideas involving f6 or f5, since that would weaken my king's position too much while my other pieces are on the queenside. But White's rook on e1 and knight on d4 make such ideas risky anyway. Basically, what I want to do next is proceed with pawns on the queenside. After I move my queen away, b5-advance is obvious. After preparation, I can think about b4. If I can then exchange two pair of pawns on the queenside, it should be possible to pressure on the last White pawn and perhaps win it. In that case, the d5-pawn will guarantee the win for me.
OK. White is preparing a kingside attack, but the knight goes to a different square. If White can induce Black to play g6, then the knight has f6 and h6 squares.
White does a rook lift. Rf3 and Rg3 are now possible, but it is not clear, what does that do for White. Black bishops can always retreat to the back rank and cover the vital squares in front of the king.
So there is no reason to change the plan. Next, some preparation is needed for further pawn pushes.
This move is apparently designed to stop the b-pawn. White might even play b4 next. That does not matter, since I will play Rb8 and a5 in most variations anyway. While White is trying to stop Black's ideas, the initiative is given to Black.
I follow my plan and prepare b4.
Now I am becoming a little worried, since the knight can check at f6 or h6 and Black cannot take with the pinned g-pawn. If the king moves f7 or h7 squares become weak. If it does not move, I have to decide how to respond to the knight check.
This is what I decided to do the get rid of the pin. Perhaps 21...Kh8 was still better.
The idea is simply to push the pawn and exchange on g6. The pawn is en prise, but taking it would open the h-file for the rook. A computer would probably take the pawn.
Another knight is transferred to a better attacking position. I am calculating what to do after Ng5+, and think I can escape.
I try to exchange the queens to release the pressure.
I took with f pawn to open the f-file
I whent away to bring Knight to f4
The WINDMILL- a DREADED trap, leading to a win on move #29, always satisfying. Also involving a neat deflection trick on move 20. I read about the windmill 3 months ago and was dying to practise it. Repeated use of a dicovered check. Amazing what you can pick up by reading a book- Killer chess tactics- Keene et al. Pl comment freely and pl rate. Fasten your seat belts for here we go...
my lsb points at his kingside, plan is to advance f pawn and attack there. note that the f rook is also part of the plot. But things hazy at present
stop b5, also allow lsb space to withdraw to a2 maintaining the attack on f7
almost certainly his bishop will come to c8 so I withdraw, i plan to--
--plan to move my knight up. I am suddenly dreaming of a WINDMILL, but need an uncluttered f file for my rook
why did I do that- I needed to deflect his knight off e5. Why- watch
he wants to exchange with my dsb, actually I am not bothered for--
need to remove his rook off the f file and temporarily put his b rook out of action. no idea how it will go
queen moves up.<n> if he moves to g8, the windmill will strike again (28. Ng5  followed by Qxh7 mate
Need to do the castling asap, I think. I was also planning on delaying it and doing it on the queen´s side, but requires too many moves.
Didn´t see this. I thought 7...Nbd7 was a good one, since there is 8...Nb6 if  change is not accepted; and if so, black has a strong attack on the king´s side.
Knowing that black will activate his rook after cxd, but castling seemed to be a priority here.
I didn´t feel like giving up my pawn, but I thought it was going to be the safest move. Also I found out (After I made the move) that I had a nice attack if Bxd5.
Best and only one, I think. With the idea of Nf8 or Ne5 and then Ng3
But maybe there is not much more to do. Now R is not pressing on f6 and the check seems to be a waste.
Queen needs to move and if exchanged, I lose even that pawn I didn´t feel it was enough before! Tables have turned for me now. What to do, what to do?...
So I tried to keep the pressure up and thought about moving 21.Ng4 in case of 20...f5, but it was a complicated situation, and did not see it clear.
All my pieces are developed and cooperate in a good way. My king is protected within the ideal King Indian setup and I can start preparing my attack
Crucial mistake for white. By not paying attention, white let me take one of his rook. The game is getting better and better for black.However, black still need to pay attention as the small slip can cost the game
Because I was a Rook ahead, I wanted here to exchange queens and move closer to an endgame.Didn't work out that well. <n>In spite of losing a rook, white plays well and as you will see, causes me a few problems
5 ... Nb4 doesn't reclaim the pawn or advance black's development.  It does make a threat of capture on c2 which has to be answered.    6. O-O is a straightforward answer, taking away the possibility of a fork (and if black still tries to grab the c-pawn, either 7. Nc3 or 7. Bd3 will make him pay for it).  6. Na3 would also defend the square in a straightforward way.  6.   Nc3 is a less obvious defense by making a counterthreat.
With 7. Bd2, white missed an opportunity to gain material.  Left as an exercise for the reader.  Tactics!
12. e6 might not be as effective as Nh4 would have been, but the idea behind it is simple:  Black's king is still in the center and has no good castling opportunities.  The white e-pawn, one way or another, is going to remove a little bit of defense and expose it even more.
Pinning the knight so that it can't defend c6, and incidentally stationing a rook on an open central file (with a chance to station the queen's rook on the open d-file later as well).
15 ... O-O-O would have relieved the pin for black and brought his rook into a good position.
From this point, black has mostly only unhappy decisions to make.
Ng6 is clearly coming, and one of the unhappy decisions is what to do about it.  Rh6 would prevent the dangerous knight's advance, but then 21. Bc4 would answer pretty firmly.
Which piece to capture?  Nxe7 keeps the knight in play, so black still has as many threats as possible to deal with.  The rook on h8 is not doing much, or likely to do much, so there's no sense diminishing the attacking force to remove it.
Black was alert to the possibility of Nd6 attacking the queen with discovered check if he kept his king on the b1-h7 diagonal, or Bc4 fatally pinning the queen if ...Kg7.  That left Kf8.
This is the start of Freddy's many game tournament.  This game ends in a drawn though as white I threw the win away.  Normally during this tourney white will go for blacks king quickly.  But as my opponent develops I notice the poor placement of the pieces so I continue to develop and attack when I'm ready.
Here both black and white are fully developed though I feel white has a slight edge due to the placement of the pieces.
I begin by trying to attack the queen.  Though my threat may or not be dxe4.  A sightly stronger threat is Nxe4 Be5! though I'm not sure I'll have time for that one.
My opponent decides to move the queen to safety.
So I grab the pawn and the center.
Rd6 finally moves the rook away from Nxd8 though I like my knight more than that rook on d8 for the moment.  Maybe Black was hopping to double on the d file Rd8 but I stopped it with...
Be5 pinning the rook to the queen if Rd8 I can play Nxd8 Qxd8 Bxd6.
Though it exposes another weakness now black must now deal with the treat of dxc5+...
Finally take the rook when it's good for me.
Now I have a threat Rxd6+.  This is a difficult threat to deal with.  Rd8 fails to Nxd8 Qxd8 Rxd6+.  Bf8 fails to Nxf8 Rxf8 Rxc6+.
Suddenly things look bleak for black.  I was looking at Rxc7 Rxc7 Qd6??? Rxa7+ Kb4 Rc8 with a3 or c3 mate to follow.
Desperation as my opponent put it.  This move threw me for a loop.  This is where I give black drawing chances.  Best was Kxc2 (the obvious move...) Qc6+ Kd2 (black has no more checks) a6 defends Rxb5+ a4! now I believe blacks life is short.
So I sacrifice a pawn to try to avoid perpetual.
There's the push.
Looking for counterplay on the Queen side.  This threatens to win a pawn, actually, and I'm not sure black's best response.  Perhaps bxa4, followed by a rook trade, is best.  This does allow white a good knight on c5, however.  But black opted for...
Easily dealt with, allowing me to trade a weak knight for a strong one.
The pawn is won, if I'm not mistaken.
Black tries to keep up the attack, but plays a dangerous game with the a and b files.
c1 was an interesting try, doubling the attack on c6; but I wanted to avoid a rook inflitration.
Black tries to keep the attack going, but his plan is too slow.
Breaks the pin
Perhaps maneuvering the rook to the 8th rank was a better plan, but Black is lost.
Black goes all in, hoping for a slip.  I had about 1:00 left on the clock, but apparently that wasn't enough for me to find a forced mate with two queens and a rook on the stranded king.  Oh well.  Back to the tactical training for me.
?  Qh8, denying the retreat down the h file, was needed, followed by a Qb8 to c7 or d6.
I prefer to "close" the Sicilian myself when playing against it, but as I rarely play the Sicilian myself I'm unsure of continuations.  The straight-forward 2. ... Nc6 I dislike by virtue of mirrored knights; 2. ... d6 is just ugly aesthetically in my opinion.  2. ... Nf6 3. e5 looked unappealing.
There's the possibility from here of Black driving an attack down the Queen's column.
Cuts off the bishop: the full 5. d5 may be a bit too adventurous but it does force the exchange to White's at least temporary advantage if the fiancetto is delayed on 5. cxd5 6. Nxd5 Nxd5 7. Qxd5 Nf3.  Problem would be on 6. ... Bg2, but 7. Be3 seems satisfactory as does 7. Nxc3.
White rushes in at the promise of an open King's column and the attack.
White is clearly thinking 9. Bxd5 wins the QP since 9. ... Qxd5? 10. Nc7! wins Black's queen, right? - and moving the king has the same problem, although to a lesser degree since Black gets the two minor pieces for a Rook and a pawn.<n><n>Not 8. Qe7, as discussed.  8. ... Ne7 looks most conventional.  From Black's point of view, this is best because it clear the Queen-side for action, even though the bishop is pinned.
White chooses the poorest approach to blocking the Queen, but is determined to save his pin.
White, for all he lost a piece, does still have development, the attack, a pin, and the ability to force the column open on his side - but he forgot about the Rook.
Why not Nce7?  Um.  Good question.  it would free the Queen to defend, too.
The final combination simply appeared: but White was too busy trying to maintain an attack with insufficient material and could not watch his position.  It would have happened eventually; any attempt to regroup would return the attack and the tempo to Black.  Game.
The correct recapture. No need to disrupt the Pawn structure.
Black looks to plant this Knight on KN5.
White is severely cramped on the K-side. He needs to try and free his position.
im attacking his knights. in my opinion knights are strong and can attack and take things which i easily miss :D
protecting his knight also opning for bishop
check has to move to g8
? an unusual response from Black (or at least, the first time Black played this against me) The most obvious drawback is that knight can't reach the c6 square
This justifies Black's last move to some extent - by the look of it Black wasn't too keen on bringing its queen out too early. It also allows the dark-square knight to move to d7.
Black either overlooked the pawn capture or chose to ignore it and develop instead. Either way, it opens up a counterattacking option for White...
? Black chooses to ignore the threat entirely...
And White nabs a pawn. Because the c-pawn is pinned to the king by the queen, both Bxd5 and cxd5 are not an option here
Bd7 would have been the only move to stop another pawn loss, but since Black chose to ignore the threat again...
Black chooses to exchange, whch isn't a good idea when you're down in points (though each side still has all of its pieces on the board - maybe it isn't so bad in that situation if you can use exchanges to get a better position) but then again, that c-pawn was dangerous there
a bishop-for-knight exchange
one of three moves to stop Black from playing Bc6. The other two moves (Qf3 and Qg2) are dangerous because of Qc8 (or Rc8), and White would be forced to drop its bishop to stop Black's bishop from taking the rook (e.g 9.Qe2? Rc8! 10.f3 Rxc1+ with a check as the cherry on top of the cake!)
This move gives the rook squares to escape to as well as opening up castling opportunities...
?! I'm not sure about this move anymore... it would probably have been better to move the knight away. This move forces Black to make a choice, and it wouldn't want to waste time retreating...
Black now has to make a decision - either capture the bishop with the king or capture the knight with the queen (capturing the bishop with the queen isn't an option because of Nc2+)
after a bit of thinking, I decided on taking the knight - I wanted to leave an opportunity for castling
I chose this square to leave an escape route to White's kingside. The biggest problem here is that White is horribly undeveloped, and needs to catch up fast!
and the queen escapes (Qg2 was a better square, as here the queen blocks the f-pawn). Black has no more (immediate) threats
With White's backward development, this would actually be beneficial for Black. It also stops my plan to exchange queens with Qd5 (I know I just said exchanges may be good for Black but after the exchange, my knight becomes a bit of a thorn in Black's side)
a challenge to the e-pawn, and with the hopes of bringing my rook to the f-file. I am now completely focused in achieving that goal
Black sees the danger, and protects f7 with his bishop.
and bearing in mind that I had three days to move...*sighs*
exchanging pawns and breaking open my kingside defence
let me just take a little bit of time to say how I -bleep-ing hate it when this -bleep- happens! (pardon my French) Black's now going to slowly mop up White's pawns, one by one, until White's defence is destroyed. Black's pieces are in a much better position than White's, meaning that Black has a winning endgame here. (this has happened a lot in my games - my opponent gets his rook behind my pawns before I can do anything about it)
'the best defence is a good offence' I needed to launch an attack of my own if I wanted to steal a win from this
saving Black's rook, keeping it where the black bishop couldn't touch it
I was fully aware of the face that Black was about to take my rook - but what could I do about it? if Ke2 or Kf2 the White queen would simply play Qh2+ and since White would not wish to move back to the first rank, it'd have to move to the third rank, which is bad no matter where it moves; 27. Kf2 Qh2+ 28.Kf3 Qxd2, forking the two pawns on the c-file. Alternatively; 27. Ke2 Qg2+ 28. Kd3 Red8+ 29.Bd6 Qd5+ and Black wins the bishop. The last alternative would be Bb2, and though I could then move the c3 pawn for my attack, Black would me more likely to make a move that destroys my attack. Though as for the bishop, Bc5 would have ended things quicker, actually... I'll explain later (although if you know what I pan to do, you'd already know why Bc5 was better)
and Black takes the rook and threatens to steal another pawn
I have to attack; I can't afford to defend
and now all of a sudden White has a mating threat! If, at move 27, I had moved Bc5, it would now be at Bd4, then all Black would have is Kf8, then; 31.Qd6+ Kg8 32.Qf6 then Black would have been forced to accept a draw. Here, Black has another option....
and although it's a Rook-for-Bishop exchange...
2. .... d5 - after a second flank pawn move by Charlotte I decided to control the centre of the board.
8. dxc3 - naturally Charlotte gets a pawn back for the piece.  Now I decided to trade queens here as I am ahead on material.
9. ..... Bf5 - after the queen trade I am planning to put Henry away on the queenside.
12. ..... Bxf2 - I take on f2 and I now have a dastardly plan which will unveil itself in the next few moves.
14. ..... Ba7 - an innocuous looking move but it involves a square clearance for my knight to come into f2 with check.
17. ..... gxh6 - and now, Charlotte being the equivalent of a whole queen to the bad, now waves the white flag.  Better luck next time, Charlotte!
Counter-attack on the Rook.
Now I must move the Knight. But I gain a tempo by again attacking the Rook.
I'd rather the pin not remain.
Completing the exchange.
White now has two pawns in the field, a queen and bishop, and is set to castle on the king's side.  Black has two pawns, making him a little underdeveloped.
Nothing is protecting BxNa7.  White will probably move Bd5+ first, then nab the knight for free.  My recommendation is Pc6, to first trap the bishop behind its enemy lines.
White is likely to play RxPa6.  Ahead 7 points (or 8), white can then afford to trade down, increasing piece value in the process.  RxRf6 would be disastrous for white, because QxRa1+ would be followed by QxRf6.  Though black would only pick up 5 points-black has a lot of catching up to do.  And white probably won't make that mistake anyway.
18....exd5?!!! i wanted to open file for my bishop on d7 and olso be ready to play Re8.
very big mistake. now it is mate in 5.
this made the mate faster.Better was 25.f4 but it will be mate in 4.
A trade off between aggression and defence.  The pin is broken but there is not any immediate pressure being placed against black's king side.
Restricting Black's light square bishop and making the way clear for Nf3.
Protecting the bishop's pawn and threatening an exchange which will double white pawns and thus weaken the King's pawn.
This is a questionable maneuver, the black bishop has been driven to a more useful diagonal by a pawn charge which has no sustainable attack.
It would appear that black is preparing to launch an attack aimed as disrupting white%u2019s central pawn structure
Forces white to tie up either the queen or the bishop or lose material
Black now has a very strong king side attack whilst white%u2019s queen is tied to the knight and cannot assist in the defence.
White has given the only active piece on the king side and allowed black to half open the file in front of the white king.
hey hey all. i wanted to save this game because it is short and sweet. it is the story of the 2nd match against the host of a mini tournament i am in.
currently im happy with my result in the tournament. its given me a nice annotation against the leader of the tournament and im placed second.  i can still win but i left my victory in the hands of the current leader. Where he has to lose his last two games and i must win my final 1 to win.  if he loses 1 and wins 1 we tie etc..
A little back story before this game which may make it more enjoyable as you read.  this is my second mini tournament on game knot where i won the first. and i was able to pull a game like this in each tournment.
so my plan this game was to look for an even faster pawn race from the get go, and just see what develops as i assumed my opponent was not well accustomed to defending a fast racing pawn.
i open this up in case he comes down with b5 instead of d5.  i was really hoping he was going to go d5
check! more often then not black players will block with their LSB to get an easy trade off of LSB's maybe it is wiser to block with the knight in this instance with the hopes to reinforce the d5 pawn with the b7 pawn if white decides to trade his lsb for a knight.
tries to get the pawn immediately
exploits the pin
now the knight is set up to defend the pawn for when he is allowed access to the b6 square
gives my pawn access to the b6 square!
ill take it! 2 steps away now!
preparing pressure for the pawn and also taking control of the open file probably one of his best current replies
develops bishop so ill take his DSB off for a knight
defend bishop push the rook around
i think this was a mistake for my opponent, i think his effort was to prevent my pawn from coming up to b5 but this invites a4 to gain time on the rook again
so now i can take control of the open file and it sets up a deadly check attack
reapplies pressure to b6 and that skewer is right there!
but he decides to apply triple pressure to the pawn and this temporarily defends against the skewer
so natural response, i thought, to also open the way to the b pawn or the a pawn now becomes the racer.
i believe n7xb6 was better to not have the skewer unprotected.
and so im able to get it
i still grab it. if he takes my pawn i save my DSB if not hes in big trouble considering my rook and the fact i follow through with axb7
i think this was mistimed by him overlooking a bit of finesse in the rook sacrifice. i was thinking it was going to play out 25 ...nbxa4 26 Rc8+ Ke7 27 b8=Q ndxb8 28 Rbx8  costing me the pawn for the knight and being in a good position to end it.
This move promises an interesting game. Black counterattacks White's e-pawn but blocks the queen's defence of g5, meaning that after 4. Ng5 Black has to give at least a pawn to stop the attack on f7.
And this is the Traxler, the starting point for this mini-tournament. Black ignores f7 completely and eyes up the pawn on f2. There are several ways the game can go from here, but most of them are pretty wild. Instead, 4... d5 is usual, blocking the attack on f7; after 5. exd5 Black has several options including my own favourite 5... b5.
So far I've played this move over Nxf7 as I think it's what I'd be more likely to play if I face this opening "in real life", and I wanted to practise it and explore some variations. After 5. Nxf7, Black can play 5... Bxf2+ 6. Kxf2 Nxe4+ with a bizarre position. The game move instead grabs a pawn and forces Black to move the king, preventing future castling.
This seems to be preferred over Kf8, perhaps because f8 is a good square for the rook. However, even though the king is in no immediate danger on e7, Black must be wary of the skewer Bg5+ should the f6 knight stray away from home.
In my first game in this mini-tournament, 6... Nxd5? was played, but after that move Black simply does not have enough compensation for the pawn and his exposed king. Freddy played 6... d6. The rook move lines up the pawn on f2, threatening 7... Bxf2+ 8. Kxf2 Nxe4++.
In my game with Freddy I left the bishop on d5 for too long and it got snapped up. Here I exchange it off, followed by retreating the knight, hoping for a quieter position in which White can enjoy his extra pawn in peace.
...White has this counter. Now 11... Bb6 (suggested by the DB) leads to 12. dxe5 dxe5 13. Qxd8+ R(either)xd8 14. Nxe5 regaining the pawn and leaving Black with far the worse pawn structure. Black could instead swap B+N for R+P on move 12 but this is rarely a good idea.
I think Black should nonetheless have played the line given in my last note. This allows White to pin the knight and threaten to regain at least a pawn.
But, as the saying goes, when you have a good move (14. Nc3) look for a better. This skewers the king and queen (a possibility I mentioned several notes back) and the pinned knight can neither take the bishop nor block the check. Black must give the rook, and with its loss the attack on f2 is greatly diminished.
Now, getting onto that queen sac I promised earlier. Of course 16. Ne5 was the first move I looked at in this position, but I don't think the time is yet right: 16... Bxd1 17. Nxc6+ Ke8 (trying to get out of the pin with Kf8 loses, since the knight can look back on d4 via Ne6+) 18. Nxd8 Bxd4 and now 19. Nc3 seems to have everything covered, but there's a flaw: 19... Bxf2+ is still possible even with the knight pinned. So, for now, I bide my time.
Obeying the maxim "When in front, seek exchanges". The immediate Ne5 is possible now, and I did consider it, but I didn't like leaving the knight on e4. In fact this was wrong and it poses no threat: 17. Ne5 Bxd1 18. Nxc6+ Ke8 19. Nxd8 Bxd4 20. Nxe4 is winning. However, exchanging first seems to be okay for White as well.
I wondered if taking with the other pawn was better, as it opens a second line of attack onto d4 and keeps the g4 bishop defended, but I don't see that Black can derive much advantage from this. 17... dxe4 18. Ne5 Qd6 19. Nxg4 fxg4 20. Qxg4 Qxd4 and now White has the simple Qxe4+ winning. Anyway, whichever pawn Black captures with, he probably hoped to win back some material now thanks to the pin.
This move was a surprise to me, but evidently Black decided that after 18... Bxd1 19. Nxc6+ Ke8 20. Nxd8 being able to take the d4 pawn does not offset the fact that the material difference of rook for bishop becomes more significant with queens are off. Having taken with the f-pawn, moving the queen is no longer a possibility (due to Nxg4) so really this is the only other defence.
Of course I looked at Qh5, but since I couldn't see a clear win I decided to bring another piece into the attack while holding onto the d4 pawn. At the moment that pawn is worth its weight in gold, since it supports the knight's strong outpost.
(?!) Surely 19... Qe8, supporting c6 and defending h5, was the better queen move here? True, it loses a pawn, since after 20. f3 Black must take evasive action with the king and queen lined up on the file, but it still seems preferable compared with the game continuation.
Now White is willing to exchange off his strong knight, since it further reduces material, wins a pawn, and, most importantly, if Black takes, the rook has a strong grip on the squares around Black's exposed king.
Black decides not to take but instead to threaten winning a piece. An unexpected move, but I think it was a good attempt to defend in a very difficult position.
Now that d4 is defended is the time to attack! If Black takes the knight, Qh6+ regains the piece, and the rook and queen create numerous mating threats (unless Black blocks the check with Qe6, in which case White exchanges, still regains the piece on c6, and has the strong advantage of R+R against R+B in the endgame).
Thanks to my opponent for the game, and to Freddy for this mini-tournament!
Stalhandske challenged me to a dual because in a early annotated game in which he was played the Alekine defense I made the pompous statement that Alekine defense was dead and a guaranteed win for white in all lines. So he challenged me to walk the talk and prove it.  FYI if there are many grammar and spelling mistake please excuse them as this was done in a rush.
Black tempts white into advancing the e-pawn beyond the 4th rank in order to prove some time in the near future that white's "big" center is weak not strong.
black has now wasted tempo by moving the knight twice. This is perfectly ok because White done the same thing by pushing the e-pawn and not developing pieces.
White defends the e-pawn and tries to hang onto his space advantage in the center.
Objective complete! Black has eliminates white's center superiority and the game is equal. I am not a fan of the main alternative 4. ...Bg4 5. Be2 e6 6. 0-0 in my view is more pleasant for white.
This in hindsight was not as good as I thought. While it gains space at the expense of the knight it makes defending the d-pawn extremely difficult for white.
I like this move a lot!  Black counters white's threat with threatening to eliminate a key defender of d4 and allowing white to double up his pawns on the d-file.
Maybe this is not the best move but it still leaves me in charge in the center. The gameknot engine suggested 6. Ne5 as best. But here are my thoughts. I have already resigned to the fact that white has gained absolutely nothing from the opening. At this point I am visualizing how I might be able to make something happen on the king side. I see that first I must strengthen the D-pawn my last bastion in the center. Then I see the glimmer of excitement when I have a bishop on c2 and the queen on d3. But this is not enough in of itself. I must provoke black into making some positional concessions on the king side. So maybe Bg5 with the help of h4-h5 will be often to break the dead lock.
Again black continues to pound away at white's center. I love the beautiful simplicity of black's strategic plan.
With d4 being so weak the last thing I want to do is help black build pressure up against it. 8. dxc6 Nxc6 is in my view better for black this is what the gameknot engine suggested.
Now black threatens to solidify his stake in the center with ...cxd5. So this forces white to expose d4.
Since I have a choose on which piece black will develop I am going to choose the one that puts less pressure on d4. The gameknot engine disagrees slightly by suggesting that 9. dxc6 nxc6 10.d5!? is slightly in whites favor. This maybe true objectively but I am sensing that Stalhandske would do quite well in such open positions. Feeling this I decide to play the possibly inferior dxe6 in order to steer the game into where quiet positional maneuvering is required. I therefore, make this move confidently that my positional skills are superior to Stalhandske's rewarding me with the mating opportunity that I dream about.
Stalhandske commented at this point during the game that he felt he had succeeded in proving that the Alekine defense is not dead. Myself of course with a lump in my throat had to agree. It is in my opinion that in this current position black is slightly better. He has no serious pawn weaknesses, his pieces are able to mobilize freely and quickly. the only real drawback for black is that he has no real prospects of attack. This however, did not discourage me, I will continue on executing my term plans and rely on my strong positional skills to create some magic. I intend to do a dance(the shuffle) to reorganize my pieces put pressure on the king side. My fingers are crossed that Stalhandske will assist me by playing moves like ...h6 and maybe if I am so lucky ...g6.
This knight is quite strong here where it eyes c5 and e5 and can possible go to d5 via b6 or f6
Now the game takes on a very masterful feel where both sides make small moves that have long term significant. It is important to note that neither side is looking for knock out blows( this is in stark contrast to amateur games where one side will make a ration move looking for that quick strike). it is here where the position is absolutely level where master games are won and lost. It is imperative to be patient, make small improvements and make no weaknesses. With that said we can see that while 11. ...Bb4 is good it is not ideal because it is short sighted in that the pin on c3 is of no real consequence. So what is can black do to gain something down the road. Maybe the answer is 11. ...Bd6!? controlling the b8-h2 diagonal which will become really important 10 moves from now.
I do not think black is too serious about capturing on c3 since it helps support the d-pawn. Now 12. Bd3 is short sighted since after 12. ...Nf6 13. 0-0 Nd5 black is creating magic on c3. By playing 12. Be2 I earn the right to castle but more critically I keep the 3rd rank clear to defend c3 with my queen, rook and bishop.
Breaking the pin.
Now here I have to say that black is slightly better than white because of the weakness of the d-pawn. From here the game shifts into a quiet positional battle where each player seeks to slowly improve their pieces without creating any more weaknesses. My plan is to stack up my rooks on the e-file, place the LSB on c2 with the support of the queen on d3 to eye h7 and g6 and play g4-g5 or h4-h5 to rattle black's cage in hopes of spooking him. It is a long shot I know but hey it is the best I got.
With the king castled I no longer fear the capture on c3 as it no longer benefits black in anyway. Though it is still quite playable for black
In order to stack my rooks I have to put a rook on e5 which has its risks since black still has his DSB.
creating the possibility of long term threats on h3 and clearing the bank ranks to connect the rooks.
defends c3 if black wants to go that route but also allows me to play Qd3 forcing black to play ...g6.
it is hard to slap Stalhandske's hands for this since there is no way he could foresee the long term consequences of conceding the g6 square to white. But it has to be said that this is where it starts to go south for black. This is considered as a "positional concession" and one like this one is not too bad but the problem is that it is like kicking a hornets nest, it causes more problems than it solves. In this game the hornets nest is the light square weakness on g6 and h7.
not a bad move but I think black is under estimating the weakness on b1-h7 diagonal. It is clear that black wants to keep his DSB. However, on a5 it is less active and short sighted. It ignores the possibility of an attack on the king side via h4-h5 or g4-g5. Perhaps the idea behind Stalhandske's logical is that he intends to play ...Bc7 controlling the critical b8-h2 diagonal. If Stalhandske was thinking long term he maybe had opted for the prophylactic 18. ...Bf8 anticipating the impeding attack.
Of the two players I must say that white has improved his position much more than black. This is a result of the contrasting approaches to the position. Black who has chosen to active piece development that have immediate short term prospects is running out of useful moves. Furthermore, his pieces are not as harmonious as their counterparts. Compared to white who has chosen to resist immediate attacking prospects for long term advantages. From here on out all of white's patient maneuvering begins to pay dividends as black now starts to scramble just to keep up with white.
Is this the forbearer of doom? As the knight feels obliged to abandon his active post on d5 in order to return to the defense of h7.
Challenging black for control of all the open diagonals. This forces blacks hand as he can not allow white to control this diagonal. This is the germ seed of my ultimate plan of doubling my rooks on the e-file. I am envisioning a rook on e5 that ties black completely down. Yet, I still can not see a clear line for a win.
With the Dark square bishops gone I have gained soul possession of the e5 outpost. It is now safe to put a rook there.
Eliminating the primary defender of the light squares in front of the king is the next step of softening the defenses for h4-h5.
Black has nothing useful to but sit and wait. This is one of the major drawbacks of the Alekine defense. It is a defensive juggernaut but it sorely lacks attacking resources.
Stalhandske also completes his positional maneuvering. However, white has the edge due to the fact that his pieces are better coordinated and superior to their counterparts. Yet, the edge is not enough to win because of the lack of exploitable weaknesses. This is not unusually in master games and it is one of the distinguishing features between a master game and an amateur game. When all things are equal the true strength is pulling a magic rabbit out of your hat.
The first signal to black that it is game on!
Stalhandske is sticking true to his character by choosing the most immediate active defense. I assume he wants to play ...Bc4 but I have something bigger in mind. I think to myself if I can get my rook on e5 then just maybe the support of Qg3 combined with either H4-h5 or Rh5 is looking pretty good for white.
This all but forces black to make a further concession in front of his king because he does not have a knight on f6 anymore thanks to 22. Ne4
The immediate 28. h5 is parried with 28. ...Bf5! It is here that white's long term planning is beginning to take shape. White can continue to nurse his advantages at his own pace while black is reduced to passive waiting.
?? This is the losing blunder, either Stalhandske did not understand why he had to play 27. Kh7(perhaps just seeing the immediate need to protect g6) in the first place or he just cracked under the mounting pressure. Now black can not stop the break through. Best was 28. ...Bf5 which is made possible because of the king on h7 which leads to a slight advantage for white.
Black is pretty much bound and gaged. As the old saying says  "If you want to rob a man blind in his own house you first must bind the man!"
Black can only passively wait on white to move.
Now this is interesting! Black has managed to create a threat. The idea is that if 36. b3 axb3 37. axb3 Ra8 or Rf8!? is given black a chance to make things interesting. But I doubt that is enough to hold to the end. If anything it does create complications
now black is dead in the water all he can really do is move his rook back and forth while white continues to push forward.
Kh2 and f3 lead to the same drawing lines.
Now 42. f3 followed by Kf1 going to e3 prevents black from exchanging queens. On e3 the king will defend d4 and after f3-f4 white will end up with two past pawns for the win. Stalhandske resigns. In conclusion, Stalhandske did prove that Alekine defense is still alive and doing well. However, the true test of the Alekine test does not lay in the opening but in the ending. It has to be said that white does have most of the chances to win coming out of the opening. yet, despite this advantage I am quite confident that I could have easily defended this game to a draw after 28. ...Bf5! In short, this is a great defense for amateur players because of it's great defensive resources. Because of the rating difference it was up to me to prove that my positional skills were better than Stalhandske's. Had Stalhanske found and played 28. ...Bf5 then he would have achieved a great victory by achieving a draw over a player most likely 400 points north of his own.
He opts for a Leningrad formation, with his bishop on g7 rather than playing e7-e6 and developing it along the f8-a3 diagonal.
I play the natural developing move too. I am planning 0-0 and Ne2-c3 to back up the knight on e4.
I am not sure about this move. After my next, the range of his Bg7 is limited, and my minor piece on e4 is unable to be shifted by a pawn.
This is a double edged move. If I can maintain this pawn here, it may be very hard for him to develop his queen-side pieces. This d6 pawn also cuts his position in two and may hinder him from moving pieces from the queen-side to the king-side and vice versa. On the other hand this advanced pawn could end up being weak and lost. Also d5-d6 allows his knight to develop to c6 and then d5.
b3 is played so that I can move my Bc1 without losing the b2 pawn. Also, if he does play Nd4, I can take with the knight and then protect d6 by the bishop on either a3 or f4. I may also be able to play Bg5-e7 in some variations.
This is the only square for the queen. if Qd1 i just lose the d6 pawn to Rf6. If now Rf6 16. Rd1	Bf8 17. Bb2	and if Rxd6 then Bxe5+ or Bxd6 then Qg5, in both cases with advantage to white. So black's best is to retreat the knight and threaten Nd4 again.
and now I have to play Qd5 again, otherwise Nd4 is going to cut off my support of my d6 pawn.
This should reveal how narrow my book knowledge is. I'm going purely on whatever general precepts there are. Here, I'm just trying to control as much of the center as possible. My opponent, I imagine, was suspicious of d3 and was playing it coy.
I personally think that 4.Nf3 and 5.e3 are a mistake. White may play 4. e3 and 5. Ne2, because in this position the Bishop can't attack  the white in g4 (6. f3).
Ah. An opportunity to develop with time?
Maybe Nd5 was better, but I was not ready to exchange Knights yet.
Leaving my Knight no where to go thus forcing an exchange of Queens.  I looked upon such an exchange favorably as he had already moved his Queen thrice and this would be my only Queen move.
Before withdrawing the Knight I elect to exchange on the Queenside, leaving him with doubled pawns there.
Opens the Bishop's diagonal attacking the pawn at f3, eyes the c4 square and stops f4 temporarily.
The Knight can not be driven from this post by a pawn.  White finds it necessary to move his Bishop again.
Continuing his Kingside pawn march.
This provides an open file to his King.
The pawn activity was undertaken to simplify the center and provide me with some time to decide the best course for my pieces.  Unfortunately, as White's next demonstatrates I have taken away the withdrawal point for my c4 Knight.
I was really wishing I could get his Knight off f4 at this point.
Exchanging Rooks on the 2nd rank is no longer an option but an exchange on the fifth rank can now be forced.  After reveiwing the board I decided that his h pawn could be handled.
He discovers attack on my g5 pawn.
I felt (perhaps wrongly) that g4 followed by f4 was too drawish and I had better chances with my queenside pawns (a thought that I needed to pay better attention to, later).
To force an exchange of my Knight and his Bishop or win a pawn.
Heading to the kingside to stop his h pawn.
I am not sure where he was headed with this but it provided my King some additional time on his way to the h file.  Perhaps he wanted to keep the diagonal h5-e8 blocked by my pawn.
My King is in position to stop the h pawn and the Bishop now has a way to approach the pawn.
To keep his King from getting thru to e5.  And my Bishop also has an avenue by which it can become active again.
It is around here that my focus has been drawn away from the queenside pawns.
Now I am thinking about getting my King to the queenside via the first rank.
After a good deal of analysis, I decided that my King had to take a longer route to the other side of the board and that the f pawn's best use would be in exchanging off the minor pieces.
This was the move I found in my analyis that lets me get my King over to the queenside.
happy to exchange followed by Nxe2 and good development
tries to get rid of bishop that protects C5
Õnnetu käik. Must kuningas jääb f8-l tempotule alla.
Sure enough, I ignore the Bishop and continue with my plan.
Now I regret sending my Bishop to c4.
The answer: Black's Bishop bought a getaway-for-free ticket. I so far played crummy moves and who knows what Black can do to my position disaster.
After this move, I decided to play a lot more cautiously.
Black was rather wise to skip 13...exd4?.
I'm trying to wake up now, with a threat on c6!
The Bishop's Revenge.
Now is a good time for my Rook to go back to it's starting place: a1.
Black decides to castle while I am in pain.
I only took Black's d4 pawn to have my Queen quickly guard as much material as it can, preferably my Knight and my d3 pawn.
A stunning mate came right into play thanks to Black's weak back rank and the file that unfolds into an open rank. At first sight, it was hard for me to believe that it was really possible.
I open more lines and now threaten to bring my QB into the attack as well.
Black defends the KNP and opens a line for his B to participate in the defense.
Black brings his Knight to the center.
My most powerful piece joins the attack. The Black Knight is a goner.
A mistake. Down in material, Black's strategy should be to keep the Q's on the board and seek complications.
Now it must fall.
Black resigns, as he has no way to avoid having his Rook be exchanged off.
6.Bxc6 is a grind to face....
The start position of the game from the thematic tournament.  When I went through the CHESS OPENINGS link on GK's front page I found absolutely no annotated Spanish Game: Marshall Attacks to reference as I prepared to start games in two separate thematic tournaments on the site.  So....I will remedy that to a degree.  Not saying these are necessarily outstanding examples of the Marshall, but they are indicative of the tactical nature of the line.
Milos Pavlovic in "Fighting the Ruy Lopez" (Everyman Chess, 2009), on page 12, calls 11...Bb7 one Black's strongest replies.  More common are 11...c6 and the "original Marshall" 11...Nf6.
Both Pavlovic and David Vigorito in "Understanding the Marshall Attack" (Gambit, 2010), p. 6, prefer 12...Bd6.  There is probably nothing wrong with the overprotection, but it does greatly limit the scope of the Bishop in an attacking system.  My gut feeling is White benefits more from the overprotection of the d5 Knight than Black...  Of course after I wrote all this and plugged the position into Stockfish 7 the silicon beast says 12...c6 and 12...Bd6 are Black's two best choices at a depth of 21.  At 22. the move 12....Bd6 is slightly favored at 0.25 to 0.32.  No real edge to White there!
Materialy even now as I have blundered back the gambit pawn.  And now Black's Bishops are well placed for an attack!
A safe square before the Queen is forced to run.  Perhaps the seeds of a counter attack after a future Bg6.
!? ahhh... the stonewall, if i know the stonewall, black will attack my king.
guarding c4 and bringing my DSB to a good post.
im trying to get the e4 push.
i dont want to trade my DSB.
if black had played Bb4 i was going to go Nb1!?
here comes the attack!
! the best move for black.
i must activate my bishops.
resigns! why??? figure it out!! if any questions send my a PM and i will be happy to answer them. hope that you liked it? please comment can rate in on the star system. thanks.
an attempt to break open the centre.  Simular the lines in the advance french but a tempo down.
supporting the centre is an acceptable way to play it.  Other good moves include 7. Nbd2 and the strange looking 7. c4!?
?! Although gaining space, it is probably not the best move as the pawn chain can be broken and it neglects development.  Developing moves such as 7...Be7 are better.
I tried to get my bishiop into the game before I played Nd2 followed by b3.  Maybe I should have playe 8. Nbd2 before developing the Bc1
Finally, developing the Ng1.  White is ahead on development and has an advantage.
trying to exchange the weak a-pawn.
Better is 12. bxc4 picking up the c-pawn and the a pawn.<n><n>However, even with that slight inaccuracy, black has an issolated a-pawn, is behind in development, hasn't castled and controls less space than white.  Having said that he is still in the game but needs to get his act together quite quickly!
? This blunders the pawn and doesn't get massive compensation (if any).
Blacks appears to get more into the game, a pawn down having not castled in an open position.  Sound dangerous?
My plan here was to swap knights, capture the weak a-pawn and promote the c-pawn to victory.
Aims to swap the N for Be3.  I'm not worried about it because the N would have made 4 moves but the Be3 has made only one.  I tried to get my c-pawn protected by a rook
activates the Q, thretning the undefended Nc6
Not the strongest way of defending it.  The pin is still on.  Better is 16...Qd7 when the pin is more or less broken
?? This ignores the pin on the Nc6 and blunders the piece (or more if black blunders)
This makes use of the pin and at least wins the piece.  At this point, I was expecting 18...Nxe3 19. fxe3 0-0 where white has a massive advantage.
Black's only moves are 19...Kf8 and 19...Kd8 when white has a plesant choice between winning both of black's rooks and winning the Qa5.  So Black resigned.<n><n>Any comments and questions can be sent to sf115
I consider this one of my best games, not because it contains any brilliant sacrifices, but rather because of the subtle moves that lead to an end-game plus, despite good play from my opponent. <n>I, of course, started with my favourite king's pawn!
I opt for the closed Sicilian in order to steer the game into unfamiliar lines.
The knight wants to provoke 9. ..e5 so he can occupy d5 - while at the same time threatening to go to h5 and trade off knights to bring the queen to h5.
The pawn break which I had planned for a while in anticipation of Bxd5 - the idea (as will become clear) is to create an ugly passed pawn on d5 that black will have to blockade, as well as opening the f-file for my rooks.
the knight must move...
Not 14. Bxd4 because that gives black an advance pawn wedge and I want my bishop to keep ministering for a while yet!
The Queen is hoping to dethrone the black king with various moves including Bxh6 and Be4.
My opponent wisely protects f7 but leaves a convenient sally port on g6. <n>I analysed the bishop sac on h6 here but decided her Royal Highness needed some more manoeuvrings first.
Crude (and unlady-like) but the threat Bxh6 is now very real. The moves Be4 and Qh7+ are also looming which will storm the castle and give mate.
Cat fight! The only way to relieve the pressure is to let the wives have a scrap
I have the bishop pair, now I have to prove their worth. Ideas based on the long g1-h7 and hi-b7 diagonals begin marinading.
My gun-sights are fixed on a7. I plan 22. a5 and if 22...b6xa5 then Bxc5 and Rxa5. 22...b5 falls to bxc5 as well.
Hoping to harass the white bishop and start a pawn storm on the king-side.
A protecting move (to take the burden off d3) and a waiting move. I wait for the black rook to move to f6, further weakening the back rank and allowing the bishop to retreat to a happier hunting ground on the h1-h7 diagonal.
I allow myself a !! here. The weakness of black's back rank is his undoing. 25...c5xb4? 26.a5xb6 and the pawn cannot be taken by either the pawn on a7 nor the d8 bishop due to the pin on the rook at a8!<n>25...b6xa5 26.b4xc5 and a deadly centralised pawn mass emerges that black cannot stop.<n>Blacks only hope is to try and counter attack on the king-side.
The evil bishop stays on his powerful diagonal.
The pressure against the a8 square is ready to blow.
The beginning of a desperate attempt to relieve the pressure from the f2 bishop.
The position is hopeless for black as the white pawns will grind up the board relentlessly. e.g. 33...c5xb4 34.Rxa7 Rb8 35.c5 Nc8 36.Rc7. Black cannot retreat his rook to help on the back rank because his king is in the way!
My opponent graciously allows me to play the Ruy, definitely one of my favorite openings as white.
5. Nb4 does't seem to be suggested in my limited opening library, and it seems to cost black a pawn.
Now white is a pawn up and black doesn't seem to have any compensation for it. Note, 8. Qxd8 doesn't work as well for white, for after 8. ... Rxd8 white cannot take the pawn on e5 due to 9. ... Nxc2 . I didn't analyze it too far, but black may be in worse shape if he tries 8. ... Kxd8 because after he plays for his fork on c2, white has a similar fork on f7. I didn't expect black would play this line, which I decided that 8. Qxd8 Rxd8 would be weak for white and avoided it.
??? Apparently black was unwilling to trade queens, but I don't think he had anything better. His pawn at c7 was threatened, and his queen was on guard duty protecting it. She had to stand her ground, or maybe move to c8 or e7 if she really wanted to avoid being exchanged. As played, black couldn't have chosen a worse move on the board - this one earns the full three ? treatment.
9. ... Ke7 was forced, and white's reply 10. Qd7# is checkmate. This one was short and sweet and illustrates some of the dangers playing black in the Ruy Lopez.
! Both sides seemed to be focusing on developing, but now Black launches an attack... but didn't he just give up his knight?!?!
!? White could maintain material equality with 6.Bxd5 Qxd5 7.Nc3 Qa5 [this might have been better, but I'm not really sure] but I didn't see that line when I played this move. As for why I decided to save the knight instead of the bishop, there are two reasons for that; 1) after Bb3, dxe4 White has to waste an extra tempo moving the knight again, and 2) I didn't want the pawn in the centre of the board
advanced pawns this early in the game always end up being a bit of the bother for me, so I decide to do something about it as soon as possible....
...but what would I have done if Black hadn't gone through with the capture? if he had advanced the pawn to c3, I would have castled, then taken the pawn, and if Black had not done anything....then I'm not sure what I would have done (bxc doesn't look pretty because of the doubled pawns)
?! There is a purpose in this - provoking 10.c3? Nd3+! 11.Ke2 Nxb2, picking up the bishop. [12.Qc2 Nd3 13.Qxd3 Qxd3 14.Kxd3 gets back the piece, but Black is definitely better, an example is 14...0-0-0+] However, Black has just violated one of the opening rules - 'never move a piece twice in the opening'
and Black prepares his own castling
?! this move was made because of the lack of other obvious moves in this position [the c2 square seems preferable to e1 to break the pin on the f3 knight, and h3 could be met with Bxh3] but, as I explained back at move 9....
the knight had this square to jump to! now the fianchettoed bishop is threatened with capture!
not as good as the a1-h8 diagonal, of course, but this is still a good diagonal for the bishop
Breaking the pin on the knight
hmmm....not too sure what the purpose of this move is about.... better might have been e6 or g6 to open up lines for the dark-square bishop [or Bxf3, now that the queen can't capture back]
White decides that Black's knight have overstayed its welcome on the d3 square, and chases the knight off. The knight is defended once and twice attacked so...
there are two other alternatives to this, as far as I can see. One is defending the knight with the queen, but that would seem like a loss of tempo, given that Black had already moved his queen. The other alternative would be Nxe1, but that lets White occupy the half open file with the rook with tempo, and it threatens the e7 pawn with capture. This move is probably best
? There is sense behind the sacrifice; after the pawn-for-bishop exchange, Black will create a mate threat on the h2 square. White would then play Nf3, and White's weakened kingside defence (on the h-file) would make up for the 1 point material deficit. However, should White be able to immediately quell this attack, it becomes unsound....
connecting the rooks with tempo... this could be a good move in normal conditions, but Black is 4 points down! [or he just saw that White could exchange the bishop anyway)
Avoiding the threat, and putting more pressure on the a7 pawn
the d-pawn was threatened with capture, and this was the best way to defend it
Bringing my knight to a better square, and possibly eyeing the e5 square as a future knight outpost
Black starts a pawn storm kingside....
while I start one queenside! [not sure if this game is the best example, but this is probably why opposite-side castling leads to exciting play - if both sides attack, it'll all come down to who succeeds first :)]
Black's looking to the future with this move...
I was confident at this point that I was going to win (naturally) so I was looking for the quickest way to seal the deal... and that almost cost me the game (that has happened to me a couple of times before, and it's always a heavy blow to my 'chess playing morale' when it happens) I was playing round with the idea of Nc4, and had actually put the position on the board... I headed towards the 'submit button'.... then I noticed Qh2# - phew! so I quickly hit the reset button and played...
! saving the knight and covering the mating square, but Black's not finished yet...
attacking the e6 pawn, and threatening to get another piece into the attack
In this position, I would not hold it against Martin to resign - what attack does he have left?
White starts to get his pawns rolling!
It's obvious that Black doesn't really have any plan, but [although Black follows the 'don't trade when behind' rule] he shouldn't have let my pawns get so far into the Black position. Here, Black hopes for c7+, where Kc8 seems to hold the position.... though White now has a spectacular win...
!! This was the reason for White's Rc1, and also the reason for the title of this annotation - if Black takes the queen [bxa6], it is mate in 3 - 38.b7+ Kxb7 39.c8=Q+ Kb6 40.Qxa6# [the Rc1 supports the c-pawn] if Black does not take the queen...
If Black does not take the queen, it's still mate! (Martin did admit afterwards that he could have delayed the mate by taking the queen, but it all leads to the same result)
Korchnoi responds with d5 which is slightly odd for his style of play as most of the time (86% of the time in fact) Korchnoi replies to 1.d4 with Nf6 and either a Gruenfeld or an Indian. So with d5 Korchnoi might have something prepared... <n><n>On 1...d5 Black is simply mimicking white's move. This can lead to the many variations in the Queens Gambit Declined such as the Slav, Tarrasch, Semi-Tarrasch Defence as well as the Torre Attack and other uncommon opening variations. It is a perfectly logical and playable move.
Here we are at the Tarrasch Defence. <n><n>Usually in the QGD blacks main goals are e5 or c5. Here with the Tarrasch Defence black achieves this goal early however, it can lead to a slight strategic advantage to white.
By far the best and most common move. If 5...exd then the Tarrasch Defence is introduced or if 5...Nxd5 then the Semi-Tarrasch is introduced.<n><n>With the Tarrasch Defence black accepts an isolated d pawn for smooth development and plenty of space. Many GM's have played the Tarrasch Defence now and again including former World Champion Garry Kasparov until Karpov with the white pieces outplayed him in the World Championship match. In this defence white plays against black's isolated pawn while black tries to use his piece mobility to lauch an attack.<n><n>Unlike it's cousin, the Semi-Tarrasch Defence does not give black an islolated d-pawn but instead allows white to build a strong center. (See game)
After a slightly uncommon move order we reach the Semi-Tarrasch Defence. As said before white obtains an advantage after the following moves.
Logical and in my opinion the best move. Black is voluntarily allowing his knight to be driven around the board there is no reason why white should not do just that.
The only correct move as it gains tempi and trades off pieces to lessen a future attack. However the disadvantages are obvious as white's b pawn has now been converted to a c pawn increasing white's centeral majority.
A critical point in the opening. Black has allowed white to obtain a large central space advantage and with 3 minor pieces on the board he should be looking to trade off pieces to lessen a future attack of white's. This is exactly what this move and Bb4  accomplish.
As mentioned this is played to trade off the minor pieces however after the trade black will be left with a very passive white bishop compared to white's active bishop. Therefore other ways of reaching equality have been tried such as Nc6 9. Bc4 b5! as played by Fischer against Spassky as Bxb5 loses to Qa5 .
Now that the position has simplified we can analyse the position. There are only two sets of minor pieces on the board but white's bishop can come into play actively unlike black's white bishop while white's knight is also actively placed. White also has a large centeral majority and although the king looks awkward in the center its is perfectly safe. <n><n>Because of his small centeral majority, black's chances are on the queenside with his 2-1 pawn majority on the left wing. However, it will only be towards the endgame when black can exploit this and he must be content with developing and defending himself for now. <n><n>White on the other hand is looking for the d5 advance to create a passed pawn and even if it is not queened it will draw blacks forces away from his king where upon white will lauch an attack.
The best spot for the bishop as it helps the d5 advance. Furthermore, Bd3 and Be2 block the e and d files which white will want to place his rooks on.
At first sight this is a simply logical move as it develops the knight to the 'best' square. However, if white can get the d5 advance in black will be forced to lose time moving his knight a second time. Therefore there is alot to be said about Nd7. So, blacks move is completely in contrary with what is required and there is nothing wrong however it should be noted that Nd7 should also be considered as a possible move.
White needs his rooks on the open files to break through. Also after the coming d5 exd exd the e-file will be open and white's king could be vulnerable.
White has now completed his objective and has mobilised his rooks and is ready to play d5.
With this move black anticipates the coming d5 advance and although it is too late to stop the pawn, after d5 exd exd black has Nf5 and Nd6 to blockade the pawn.
It is necessary to exchange pawns to free the f5 square.
With the idea of Nd6 blockading the pawn but Petrosian has an excellent move.
! This is in my opinion an excellent move because it prepares to bring the knight to c6 where it will either cause much annoyance for black if he leaves it there or he will have to exchange it for his white bishop turning the passed d pawn into a passed c pawn meaning the blockading move Nd6 is useless.
! Now black has 3 choices<n>1. trade the bishop for the knight (See game)<n>2. Attempt to ignore the knight by Qf6 after which white will protect the bishop and black will have to endure a awful middle game due to the well placed knight.<n>3. An attempt to win a piece with 18...Nxc4 when after 19.Nxd8 Nxd2 20.Nxb7 Rab8 21.Na5!! bxa5 Rxd2 he is left with 2 doubled A pawns which have no chance of becoming passed while white still has the passed d pawn.
? From all the alternatives mentioned, this is the worst continuation although it temporarily wins a piece black has no way to block the future passed c pawn and with less pieces on the board white's passed pawn is increasing in power and this ultimately leads to blacks downfall.
With the sensible and logical idea of blockading the pawn.
Petrosian realises that black has no winning prospects and cannot do anything as his  pawn majority on the left wing is of no value in comparison to white's passed pawn. Therefore he takes his time, firstly by giving his king some 'luft' so that the Re1 is free to maneuvre if necessary.
Black wants to give his king some luft to prevent back rank mates as there could be many threats to the back rank to come. However, perhaps such a weakening of the kings position mightnt be necessary at this point in time as white has no direct threats against the back rank.
! With this move (and the next) White demonstrates his complete superiority over black as he can take his time to maneuvre since black cannot do anything productive. Rae8 loses to 24.Qxe8! Rxe8 25. Rxe8 Kh7 26.Red8 since the passed pawn is too strong.
With nothing to do, black hopes to at least prevent white from queening the pawn with all his forces. However, this allows white to launch an attack.
Black is simply bidding his time however I think this is a psycological surrender as Petrosian with his next move realises blacks 'surrender' and plans an attack.
Instead of the Rd7 which can be played anytime, Petrosian plans the attack. Now his rook can come to f4, g4, and h4.
! With black's forces distracted by the passed pawn white advances his king as well as the g pawn which will be used to break into black's king. This move becomes more apparent after black's 31st move as it also prevents any checks on the back rank.
! A very flexible move. The reason behind this move is that when white plays g5 black might block the position with h5 and g6 when the hole on f6 will become a weakness. Re2 allows the queen to come to f3 so that if the h5 g6 maneuvre is played, the queen can exploit the hole on f6. Furthermore, the rook is better positioned here as it can come to the c-file or d-file if necessary where as on e4 it cannot come to c4. It sometimes seems unecessary to do this move and if black had certain threats/counterplay it probably would be a waste of a move. However black do anything productive so white can afford to take his time.
!! Finally the g5 break. If hxg hxg black will lose quickly due to the open h-file.
White protects the rook so enabling his queen to come to f3. He doesn't mind giving up the e-file as it is of no use to him.
Black takes control of the e-file but this comes too late. Only now can one appreciate the importance of the 26.Kg2! move as if it were on g1 black would have drawing chances with Re1  and Rc1.
Black's f pawn is also a weakness and since the rook is doing nothing useful on the e-file he bolsters the pawn.
! Making full use of the weakness and applying more pressure to the f-pawn. Furthermore he threatens the decisive Rd7!
A final mistake. The point of this move was so that after Rd7 Qe8 the queen protects the f-pawn however, Korchnoi under time pressure misses the following combination.
?? Blunder due to time pressure but black was lost anyways.
An extremely complex game showing some ideas in the Semi-Tarrasch Defence, the importance of recognising a completely dominating position and taking your time to unleash the killer blow as well as how to set goals (such as the penetration of the weak f6 square) and work towards them.
The English Attack still has some sicilicide virtues.
This move comes in between the standard English Attck plan and the somewhat similar idea of the Keres variation. Contemporary theory indicates that this should be ok for Black, but there are at least two games won by Judit Polgar in this following line (one against Anand), so at first it doesn't seem like such a bad idea to give it a try in the furious complications that steam from the following piece sacrifice.
THAT piece sacrifice. It is clear that an knight move will lose the g4 pawn with a tempo, so sacrificing the knight has not only positional and tactical reasons but is also the only way here. Theory gives here Bg2 as the best try for White, but the game will follow an other setup.
The only way. Moving back the knight will get White a huge compensation for the material after something as simple as 10. Bc4, controling the d5 and aiming at the f7.
This is the critical position of the variation. There are several options for Black, curiously all involving the only good transit square for his pieces: the d7 point. This position is too much fun to spoil it with my analysis, but you all can work it out why Nc6 or moving the queen is not that great for Black. It will give you an idea of the punch packed in White's setup.
Not entirely sure about that. It looks a bit too forced of a line to give Black more that equal game. But (a) drawing with black is not bad, and (b) forced lines must be worked to the end by BOTH players. Sadly, this is not the case here.
What now? Material is equal. But white's knight on a8 is remote, and might get trapped after moves like Nd7 or Bc5, or, in some lines, after the simple b5. The bishop on e3 is also a problem. on the other hand, Black's king is in the centre and the presence of the white pawn on f6  make it dificult to develop and coordinate the pieces. on a more "long term" perspective, the nice pawn centre might fall, togheter with the f6 pawn, leading to a drawish engame. <n>White has the plan to head for the draw as soon as possible, before Black clears a way for his king. The theme idea is to capture in d4, using the lack of squares of the opponent king, for instance: 18. Bd4 ed4 19. Rd4 Nd7 (forced, Re8 Nc7 # Rc8 Bh3) 20. Bh3 Bc6 21. Nb6. The problem is now, however, 21. Bc5, and Black is winning. Since White could not see a way to make this work (although THERE IS ONE!) he decides to try and better his chances by playing an intermediate move, that seems to lead to an even more forced and beautiful draw, involving, as we will see, the same idea. <n>Now let us torn to the position after the sacrifice, to show the missed continuation that would have lead to complete equality. After 18. Bd4 ed4 19. Rd4 Nd7 20. Bh3 Bc6 white has 21. b4! Stopping Bc5. But this is not all. Black can try 21... Bh6 22. Kb1 b5 23. Nb6 Kc7 24. Nd7 Rd8 and it will again a piece! Anyway, after 25. Rh4!, white collects the pawns on the kingside and is in time to exchange everything on d7, obtaining an endgame with 3 pawns agains bishop that will be easy to draw.
Now that seems pretty clever. White puts the Bishop in h3 with tempo, anticipating the sacrifice on d4. Now if 18... Bc6, White has the chance to take another look at that sacrifice, and has also other chances. The only problems arise with the tempo-gaining move Bh3.
Now the plan was to sacrifice the bishop on d4, since bishop takes rook offers at least a draw by repetition: 19. Bd4 Bd1 20. Bd6! Re8 21. Nc7 and Na8 back. Of course, White can even try to win after capturing the black knight via a6. The problem is, sadly, that 19. Bd4 can be met by 19...Bh6!+ and if 20. Kb1, after Bd1 the Black king can escape on the kingside. Hence, after Bh6 white faces an endgame an exchange down. Disappointed, abandons the line and moves the rook. <n>However: with good game, sacrificing the exchange might have still offered good chances to draw, since the Black king is still awkward. Here is a sample: 19...Bh6+ 20. Be3+ Bd1 21. Bh6 Bf3 22. Bd2! (threatening Ba5) Nc6 23. Be3! (now Bb6) and after the almost obligatory 23...d4 24. c3 b5 25. cd ed, white has a nice opportunity to use the f6 pawn to level the chances, with 26. Bh6! Ba8 27. Be6!, and if Ke8 the Rook will be trapped.
In his disappointment, White misses the chance to complicate matters further by playing Rd3. It should be a lesson for you to always try to pin something (if it works). Now black has free hand
Activate the rook and announcing a possible mate in two.
all business.  a piece ahead and queens off the board black should win easily
Forces black to defend vulnerable f7.
Invites the exchange, hoping to open up the g file, while also bringing the queen into play.
While black has been preparing to castle, white has taken position to threaten the castled king on g8. White has maintained control over the centre of the board, and can dictate the pace of the game from here, provided he executes the correct moves.
Too little too late? Black attempts a strong counter, attacking the pawn on d4, but it's easily defended. Positioning is key in this game, and black just doesn't have enough of it.
A wasted move. It suggests b5 will follow, but black hasn't given enough space even for this at this late stage, as white tightens his grip.
White offers a pawn, aware that the natural sequence that follows sets the stage to wrap it up. The rook awaits deployment to d1, preventing dxc4 after 13...exd5.
An attempt to salvage something? No. White has seen this coming, and knows that the black queen can be forced out of the game.
Finally using the threat of the open g file to full advantage.
The only response? Ng6 is not possible, as Rxg6 would follow with the pawn on f7 pinned. The only advantage would have been an attempt to bring the queen back into the game, but it's too late for that now.
The sacrifice. The rook is far too tempting, especially given that it doubles as an attack on the white queen. Black hopes this will displace white's attack, but it merely sets the endgame in motion.
Once again pins the pawn on f7, but this time there's nothing to stop Rxg6
g5 would have been better, as it would have delayed an imminent mate. Perhaps black has noticed the game is lost and rather than resigning offers white the respect of showing his final moves.
8. h3 was better move I think , the idea is to avoid moves like Ng4 Nf6 and in case of caste-ling there is a window for the white king . but 8 . Qe2 is controlling the dark squares  and attend to move to h6 and attack the h6 f8 diagonal that the dark square bishop was defending it .
White attended to use the center advantage and space that it has , and wishes to open the D and E liens for the rooks . It have another option to move the white Knight  on e4 g3or g5 in the future .
because of the large advantage for the white in the center , black wishes to exchange the queens, and trays to control the D-line by Rd8 in the future .
Great move now the white now winning the game the best move to avoid the mate on f7 is 14....Nf6 ( 14.....Qc8,Qd6 or Qd8 will be .15.Qf7+Kd8.16. Qg7 and the blacks Rooke is traped ) 15. Qa4+ and winning the knight on a6 !
GM Josh Waitzkin uses this opening in a few annotated games on Chessmaster.  Though not too highly favored in the db. I find it quite interesting however, it fits in to my style I like to attack and I prefer slower closed games this game will evolve into such.
I feel Bc5 is slightly better.  This threatens the e4 pawn but white can simply ignore the threat and continue with Bg2.  5. Bg2 Bxc2 6. bxc2 Nxe4 7. Nxe5 winning back the pawn, and unleashing the light square bishop on g2.
Winning the bishop pair.
This was a poor move I'm planing on piling up on the h6 square with moves like Nh5-f5 and Kh2 Rh1 aiming for a king side attack.  I left the h3 pawn hanging though.
Once again continuing my plan of Nf5.  Rh1 will have some more power after the bishops are traded.  Notice that the bishop on h3 and g2 create an interesting relationship.  Black wants me to take the h3 bishop.  Bxh3 Qxh3 and the queen is very hard to remove from that square not to mention Ng4 is a threat.  I want him to trade so I can put my rook on h1. Bxg2 Kxg2 most anything Rh1.
I find this a mistake because it allows me to force my plan of trading on g2.
Taking the bishop back though I'm not greatly concerned the position isn't going to open up right away.  Though my bishop is a nice piece the knight can be slightly better in this position.
Good move here my king is not as secure as his breaking the center would be quite beneficial for black.
I don't like this move though black is going to lose something here.  This just feels bad for no other reason that it allows me to take a pawn and defend, and cuts blacks queen off from his king.  Blacks best plan in my opinion is to play Qd4 here and after Qxf7 Qf6
Offering a very real draw chance for white not much black can do to stop constant checks Qf5+ Kg8 Qe6+ Kh7 Qf5+ giving a draw.  Which is the best black can hope for.  Though it may seem abstract. The b-pawn due to the fact that they are so far from blacks king have little meaning.
Black decides to try to defend his main advantage the b5 pawn though in doing so black will have little protection from my active queen.
and the h6 pawn.
The other option though still not winning is Kxc4 e5 Kd5 Kf4 b4 Ke3 b3 Kd2 b2 Kc2 Kxe5 f4+ Kf5 Kxb2
Trying to catch his king in the center although he can easily castle. However, he had a wiseguy move.
Planting his knight on d5 was a strong move. I was not sure how to respond and just retreated my bishop.
His knight is stronger on d5 in my opinion. My passed pawn is dangerous but at least he can sacrifice it for the pawn if needed.
Separating the rooks. I like how strong this move is as it forces him to be passive and is not so narrow minded to only focus on promoting the pawn. Plus I get this strange feeling whenever I trap rooks in the queenside of Kasparov's game against Deep Blue.
This move I am uncertain about. I can take the rook and still have my pawn on the 7th rank or I can advance the pawn and gain a rook for a pawn.
I must have a forced mate at this point since computers sometimes will blunder if any move loses to try to survive a couple more moves.
The petrov, Italian variation. Usual, i have found, is 3. Nxe5, d6, 4. Nf3, Nxe4, 5. d5, d4. 6.Bd3....is more common, so this was quite exciting! As a kid i always played this opening as white to try and fork the queen and rook (Ng5, Nxf7), :) you could only ever do it straight off against beginners though. Nostalgic moment there!
This threatens whites bishop whilst creating pressure around the centre of the board. I will now develop, which should be carried out whilst gaining tempo thanks to whites retreat of the bishop (anticipated move).
(anticipated retreat of the bishop does not materialise) Had never played against this so it took me by surprise. now taking bishop leads to an exchange of minor pieces leaving white in a superior position, therefore gaining tempo from whites retreat is no longer on.
I think this is the best move. It prevents a discovered check if i move my e4 knight, it strengthens the centre of the board and it is constructive development.
Having to move the threatened knight or go for exchange. i don't like the exchange as afterwards white has control of the centre and would dictate the way i will play (dxc4, Qxe4, c6, white superior). moving knight gives me better defensive security and allows my development to continue at my pace and my say so.
Continuing development, and putting pressure on e5 knight as it is cause for concern.
c6 can be looked at as a strange move, it blocks the knights usual route out of the back line however it stabilises my position within the centre of the board. (I am also anticipating f4.)
Qb6  allows black the option of how future play will work out around my king side and as previously stated i believe the removal of the e5 knight is now essential.
gets rid of pesky knight and relieves pressure on the king side.
white seeing the threat to his bishop makes an escape route for him.
This now kick starts the battle to which i refer in the first page of this annotation was the main thing to look out for.
(At time my thinking: if white moves knight i win a piece, if not i win rook. can i escape with queen....should do. Good I have advantage.)
On move 14 we where even on points. now i am a pawn up. so i am ahead. if we exchange rooks i will be 4 points up when king takes bishop. what if i take rook then white takes knight....can he trap me.....oh! yes he can, if after Qxa1, Bxc5, then i move Re1, white can then Bb3, Na6, Bd4, c5, Na3, Qxf1 , Qxf1, cxd4, cxd4 am a point up but the future does not bode well.
what i expected. now i have to use my experiance. as i said on move 14 i was even. so if Qxa2, d4, g6, Bxf8, Kxf8 i am 2 points up and i have white pinned for a few moves so i am ahead and happy with my position. therefore.....
complete surprise. I think this is completley crazy when he can exchange bishop with rook. I see why he is doing it, holding on to the prospect of taking queen for free but now i can free rook from bishops sights and save queen whilst going 4 points up!
Rook, freed from bishop, onto the best square as this may result in a free pawn after Bf5....f6.
Black looks to execute an extremely flawed plan.
White resigns. I don't think this is a premature resignation as white has a material advantage and is positionally superior.<n><n>2 important points in this match were:<n><n> 1. the intricate battle around the black king side which is successful for black because of the c6 pawn which allowed the check and black to dictate the pattern of play. <n><n>2. the gamble white takes. clever as it was, these moves should be made when you are certain of success or position as failure can result in a loss of both.<n><n>another point to be made is discipline. if black sees only material gain then he losses queen and probably match, where as from that position being happy to gain the 2 point lead ultimately wins the match for black. <n><n>I would be grateful for comments from the higher rated players to see there take on this match.<n><n>Regards,<n><n>David.
I chose to play the Reti Opening for this game. I like it because it is a subtle aggression. Instead of attempting to blast the center with a 3 or 4 pawn attack White delays multiple pawn pushes and indirectly controls the center mostly with pieces (knights to c3 & f3, a fianchettoed LSB and later developing the DSB). Pawn to c4 is an exception as it is meant to be played early, then later d4 or d3. White usually gains a slight positional advantage.
I wanted to take your bishop with my knight for two reasons: <n>1. Knights are the stronger piece in cramped, closed positions, while bishops are stronger in open positions. You have to consider each game individually, but generally, pieces get traded off and closed positions in the opening, become open positions in the middle game and end game. So, although both pieces are technically the same value, the bishops are my piece of choice.<n><n>2. Since the bishop had no place to escape to, and no other pieces could defend the bishop, you would have to take back with a pawn, thus messing up your pawn structure.
(???) This move ensures that you will have doubled pawns with no compensation. You could have played 9. ... Bg6. That way, when I play 10. NxB (and I would), you could respond with 10. ... hg. This would be better for 4 reasons: 1. You would have an open file to my king with a rook already positioned on the file.<n>2. The doubled pawns would be closer to the edge of the board therefore they are not as important as the center pawns.<n>3. The move you made prevents you from playing e5, without further damaging your pawn structure. If later you play e5, I will take with my d-pawn, and you take back with a piece. That would leave you with 2 "isolated" doubled pawns. Isolated doubled pawns are even worse than doubled pawns because they can't protect each other at all. Before the pawn exchange, you would have a pawn on f7, e6 and f5. So the f7 pawn protects the e6 pawn which protects the one on f5. <n>4. The doubled pawn structure on f7, g7 and g8 would be harder for me to take advantage of.
I took one pawn here. Then you moved your knight to protect the b-pawn and I get to take a 2nd pawn. A 2 for 1 Sale! Woohoo!
In the end Satya, I'd say you have several options on how to handle this in the future. None of them are so much better or worse than each other, but more a matter of personal style.<n>Option 1: Don't let your bishop get trapped! Before blocking your bishop in with e6 (or d6; or if your playing white, e3 or d3) move your rook pawn forward one square to enable the bishop a retreat square. If you are like me, you prefer your bishops, so this may be best.<n>Option 2: When the knight attacks the bishop, move the bishop back to be defended by the rook-pawn. Then when your opponent takes it, you take back with the rook-pawn, opening a file to attack with. Then maybe queenside castle.<n>Option 3: Set up your position so that you have another piece ready and able to capture back. See our current game with you playing white for example. We have almost the same scenario, except that you have the option to move your queen knight to e7, defending the bishop.<n>Option 4: Move the bishop! You had the g4 square available!
I have made a mistake with g5, and I have paid the price under the form of the d4 pawn. If I allow major exchanges, I would be simply down. Can I do something? Here starts the combination. I'm sure you can see it, and it starts with a "bad" move...
...so now the Q retires, and NxN, losing another pawn... or not?
Black has to take it (Ne2+ would be deadly), and if hxN, Qxg6+. But black has fxN...
White goes on as a champion, even there is no mate (black can avoid the mate by defending h2 with Qe7, but then the B just retires and g6 should be mate in few.
The key move in all previous lines. Black can't prevent in one move the mate threat.
Still disguising the Modern Benoni, but leaving the option to transition it other openings.
This would appear to give white an advantage. D6 appears to be a weak pawn that white will attempt to capitalize on, without success.
Black prepares the DSB for fianchetto. This bishop appears to be key to this defense.
White opens up the attack on d6, perhaps a bit too soon.
Black continues his plan for the DSB powerhouse.
Seemed like a good idea, but in actual practice helps black develop the weak bishop and loses a tempo.
Black defends and threatens. However, the pawn on b7 is now weak.
Queen retreats and threatens b7. In addition, shores up the d5 defense. Elyhim warned me of his intent to advance the b pawn at this point in the game.
I debated moving Nxb5 here instead and perhaps should have made that move, but it left the d5 pawn vulnerable and I did not want to give up the central pawn. In addition, I wanted to stop the b5 advance based on discussion Elyhim had with me regarding his goal here. The a3 and b5 pawn stay in this position for the remainder of the game, cramping the Queen side white pieces quite a bit.
I've never been a fan of retreating, so I move the Queen to block the b advance and threaten the d6 pawn.
I expected Na6, one of many moves I did not anticipate during this game. Black castles to open the e8 square to push the Queen around when I take on d6. The black fortress is well established and white's King is still centered. Analysis shows white slightly ahead here, but not for long.
Unfortunately, I changed my strategy and decided to attack from the flank. I do enjoy fianchetto attacks and thought perhaps I could use this here to threaten the Queen side. I have learned (not well enough yet) when I change my strategy I usually don't fair well. I should have taken the d6 pawn here.
Black supports the d6 pawn, the white advantage is lost. The black DSB rules the diagonal and threatens the knight on c3.
Queen retreats to support the d6 pawn, the b2 pawn, and setup the diagonal threat with the DSB. The Queen is defensively overloaded. Although advanced, the black Queen side pawn storm seems to be held at bay for the moment. Black will need to find another way in. White will focus on defense from this point forward.
I decide to take another crack at d6
Denied, now the bishop is lost. Until the bishop move I think I was doing ok at only -1. Look at how influential the black DSB is at this point. Really supports the attack.
The Knights stay here for most of the rest of the game. I like this configuration. I only wish it was closer to the other side of the board.
White brings the rook into play. The white fianchetto seems a waste of time now, although it protects the d6 pawn.
Evade and provide another reason to not advance b5
Advancing the king side to try and activate a white offense. I intend on moving my pawns up the board.
I intend on moving the f2 pawn and don't want to pin it. I'd rather move the king on my terms than be forced to do it at black's whim.
I always like it when my queen and rook line up, but there doesn't seem to be much to do with it here.
My bishop was inactive, so the pawn allowed me to use it for something.
Pinned the knight. At this point, I believe white already knows he will trade in both his rooks.
Lining up the bishop to defend e4
And the attack begins
Exchange the rook
The end is near now, the question is can I make it to 50 moves?
The bishops lie in wait to finish the game, but I'm going to put up the good fight here.
I've been told it's always best to move king center at the end
Trying to stay close to center, will be impossible for long. Trying to make 50 moves now!
Keeping the pawns from doing the deed, the black queen will have to get her hands dirty
And she's up to it.
�The berlin?
When playing Bc5 in the spanish its preferible to delay castle in order of playing d6, so may the usual Bg5 move may have no effect due to h6 and g5, and black's king has not yet castle and may go to the queenside.
Now I try to attack the King side, still difficult.
Black Bishop went into the corner giving me little room to enter the middle.
In the process a pawn got down I got to recover it or I have to attack with the remaining pieces. This stage I'm bit nervous.
I have some plans to attack the black King while Queen is in the upper part of the board.
Finally, I launched the attack.
Here, got rid of the Queens leaving only to attack the King. Another thing is Bishop is attacking the pawn at f5, he has to defend them. He can use the Rook for the moment.
He has some different plans and Knight moved. Then I have a chance of earning a pawn.
Having a line of King attacks and loosing the Bishop.
Now he wants to march down a pawn to the opposite end and create a Queen that will dominate the game.
But again in trouble, that Knight move giving me to attack King steadily.
A peculiar looking move. Some players tend to go overboard when their opponent plays something out of the ordinary, trying to refute moves that they think are not in accordance to the position, to the point of ruining their own position on the process. I have to confess I am guilty of this sin and have lost many a game by over-pushing and trying to castigate strange moves.
Simple development, White isn't planning anything concrete with his last move, so there is no point to seek adventure in lines like 3...c5 4. d5 Qb6 5. Nc3 Qxb2 6. Be5 d6 7. Rb1 Qa3 8. Nb5 Qa5+ 9. Bc3 Qd8, after which Black's position might seem preferable but it offers White some compensation and justifies the development of the Bishop to f4.
White postpones again the development of his Knights and plays another strange move. Like I said before, experience has taught me that it's better not to over-react and play in accordance to your plans not your opponents.
Taking control of e4 and indirectly exploiting White's last two moves. The Bishop on f4 doesn't approve of capturing on d5 and if White will ever manage to push the pawn to e4, he would have lost an important tempo.
After this move, the position has transposed to the Bf4 lines in the Gruenfeld. My opponent seemed like a fish out of the water in what followed.
Releasing the center and a psychological bet. Taking with the Knight is objectively better, since White gets some activity but Black won't have much trouble in repulsing the early initiative. However, I was more than sure that my opponent will recapture with the pawn.
The first waste of a tempo. In what follows, it's pretty hard to find a single move which is wrong by White, what is revealed by his moves, though, is the lack of a plan of action. It takes a very active player to hold the balance in a position with an IQP (isolated Queen's pawn).
Releasing the final tension in the center. I am now ready to lay siege to the IQP.
Making White lose another tempo, since sooner or later he will be forced to retreat the Bishop to e2, thus having lost two moves. The d-pawn is also under direct attack.
Developing with tempo. 11. d5 leads to nothing good after either 11...Bxf3 or 11...Ne5.
The theoretical move was 12...Rc8. I wanted to begin mounting pressure on White's d-pawn instead.
Slightly better than 13...Bf5, because I have no desire to push the e-pawn right now and from here the Bishop controls the very important square d5.
Trying to defend a2 with the Queen can lead to disaster after 17...Bf5! 18. Bb5 (18. Qa1 loses the exchange after 18...Nc2) Qe6 19. Ng5 Qxe3! 20. fxe3 Bxb1 21. Nxd5 Nxd5 22. Rxc8 Rxc8 23. Rxb1 Nxe3 and not only has White lost a pawn, he's still stuck with a IQP, which is significantly weaker with fewer pieces on the board.
This strengthens White's d-pawn but it was necessary in order to clear the diagonal of the Bishop with tempo.
18. Qxe3 was better since it would have posed Black the question if he can really capture on a2. Here is a forced line that gives rise to an interesting endgame 18...Nxa2 19. Nxa2 Bxa2 20. b3 (trying to trap the Bishop) Rxc1 21. Rxc1 Bxd4 ( 21...Rc8 might offer more winning chances) 22. Nxd4 Qxd4 23. Qxe7 Bxb3 24. Rb1 Be6 25. Rd1 Qxd1+ 26. Bxd1 Rxd1+ 27. Kh2 Rd7 28. Qe8+ Kg7 29. Qb8! b6 which Black should win had not been for the weak dark squares around his King since White can force a perpetual.
The pawn is saved and now it's time to convert the extra material.
Preparing to push c4 and create a strong center that would ensure some counterplay.
Kicking away my Rook but I was prepared for this.
White avoids exchanges in order to make my life hard.
27. Rc2 was more accurate in order to double on the c-file.
I could have used the pin on the d-file to play more actively with 27...e5 but I was more concerned with exchanges. After 28. d5 Bf8!, the Bishop is very active and White has trouble coordinating his pieces and defending the d5-pawn.
So I can start pushing my extra pawn. It's not going to queen in four moves, but the threat alone is enough to make my opponent jumpy...
...and reply with this. Under different circumstance, such a trade could benefit White, for example if he had enough time to attack my castled position. But here it just hastens his defeat.
Notice the position of the Nb2 and Kh2? It's not hard to guess my next move.
Activating the Bishop with tempo and making sure the a-pawn will Queen.
White decides to save the Knight and attack my a-pawn.
A pretty mate, White's Queen and Knight are punished on the edge of the Board while the King is left at the mercy of the Rooks and Bishop.
nice square for my bishop
my preferd way to castle.
push the king to a mte square
I open up the diagonal for my f1 bishop.
I have two opening databases on my Gameknot system. One is the world database of over-the-board games played by the top players and the other is the database of openings played by the best Gameknot players. This move 6....Nc6 is not even in the world database - and for good reasons. In this variation, black usually plays at some time either c7-c6 strengthening the centre, or c7-c5 contesting the centre. This rules out both these options for the time being.
I played this to stop any idea he may have of e6-e5.
This is another mistake. My Bh4 is my bad bishop, being on the same colour as my pawns in the centre on d4 and e3. His Be7 is his good bishop, being on the opposite colour to his pawns on e6 and d5. Yet he invites me to exchange my good bishop for his bad bishop.
This is another slight inaccuracy, allowing my Bf1 to develop with tempo.
I hit his queen and gain more space.
With ideas of either moving across to help a king side attack, or go over to d3 to help with a d4-d5 push.
And my rooks supports the d pawn.
and the bishop drops back to discover an attack on the d pawn.
With the idea of coming across to the d file also to support the d pawn advance.
He also seems to be planning to bring his other rook to d8.
I decide to strike.
This discovered attack wins the exchange.
Gameknot criticises this move too, preferring 27. e5 Qb6+ 28. Rc5 Ne6 29. Qd7 Bc6 30. Qe7 Be4 31. f5 Ng5 32. h4 Nf3+ 33. Kf2 Qb8 34. Qxf7+ Kh8 35. f6 gxf6 36. exf6 Qa7 37. Qg8# but this looks good. If he checks on b6 I can drop my rook back to c5 and if Ne6 I can take his knight with my bishop.
I hadn't considered this! Now if I take he has Qb7+ winning the rook on c8.
Another check. Some fancy footwork is now required to escape the checks.
Now my queen has an x-ray attack on the knight.
And now the threat is taking the knight with mate, now that h7 is covered. <n>Black now resigned.<n>Many thanks for reading this, please rate this annotation on the star system, and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!
This is my first game in this tournament, and what a way to start it! Right off the bat, it looks as if I could have already backed myself into a corner early on, but it soon  opens up into an open, action-packed game, where both sides go on the attack a number of times...
the starting position of the Traxler Variation - to quote Freddy's take on this; "This bold move ignores White's attack on f7 and leads to wild tactical play"
connecting the queen and rook
retreating the bishop and keeping pressure on that f7 square (here, I didn't want Bb3 because of a future doubled pawns on the b-file, and I didn't want Bd5 because of Nxd5, though as Joanne pointed out in her annotation it seems to be the most popular)
Black starts to build up pressure on that f2 pawn with a discovered attack (e.g 7...Bxf2 8.Kxf2? Nxe4+!)
?! this was not the best way to protect my king. Better alternatives would have been 7.0-0 or maybe even 7.f3 (though that move isn't as strong - it stops White castling)<n><n>-
forces the queen away from protecting f2, but at the same time blocks Black's dsb
at this point, I was already starting to panic. I realised that with this move, there was nowhere that my knight could go, and my queenside wasn't looking too good. I was considering, after 9...Nc6, 10.b4, but that would most likely force Black to simply play Bxf2, and though Ne4+ isn't a possibility, it still breaks open my kingside defence (plus b4 wouldn't help much for my dsb.)  After a bit of playing around on the analyse board, however, I see another possibility...
the bishop attacks the knight, and the knight has no good square to retreat to. the only squares available are Nb8 (undevelopment) and Na5 (11.b4!) It seemed to me to be the only move available at the time, but maybe castling would have been a better idea. I had an idea of Qc4 to put pressure on e6, but...
but in this instance, White decides to defend with the knight. This move, however, leads to an impressive counter-attack from Black which really picks up the pace of the game...
preparing the attack....
and White is now only one material point down - a pawn, a rook and two bishops for a queen, a knight and a pawn (12 points v 13 points) Now this is where this game starts to get interesting...
I lure the queen away from the d8 square for...
now the c-pawn drops - Black can't defend with either Kd8 or Kc8 because of Rf8+, winning White's rook
let's take a look at the position here - material is even, and each side only has one developed piece. Black has the better piece - the queen - in no-man's land on the (White's) right side of the board, and while White has a weaker piece - the rook - it restricts the mobility of all of Black's pieces (for now, Black's Queen is stuck on the g-file protecting the pawn, as if she moves; 23. Rxg7, and unless the Black Queen had moved onto the h-file, Black's rook will soon be lost
Black saves his b-pawn from my rook
frees up Black's queen, and here I'm expecting Black to play Qxd5, and since I can't save it without weakening my pawn structure...
! I didn't see this - Black gains two passers on the g and h files (though I wouldn't have been able to stop it regardless)
I don't mind - I wanted my king on the third rank to stop a skewer of the king with the rook
! The queen now forces my rook to play defensively
not as potent now that White can get his rook to f2
but I rushed too quickly into this move, having seen the possibility of mate back at move 30. Now, Black can escape, and here I thought that I had no more attacks on Black...
Ka1?? I have no idea what I was thinking here, and as Ion had pointed out to me via PM, I still had an attack with 34.Rxg7! and White keeps on the pressure
keeping on the pressure
Although the Najdorf's 5...a6 is supposed to prepare the central thrust 6...e5, I've never seen it played against 6. Bg5, so I haven't tried it myself.  As it doesn't even appear in Nunn's book, or in the later Nunn's Chess Openings (NCO) published in 1999, I think I'm probably right!  6... Nc6 would transpose to the Richter-Rauzer line.  Black adopts the more flexible Scheveningen formation.
Black's main alternatives at this point are the Polugaevsky Variation and The Poisoned Pawn: the Polu has an immediate 7...b5, which avoids putting the bishop on e7, where it often proves vulnerable.  Play becomes very double-edged and I have not had great success with it.  The Poisoned Pawn was once almost eradicated but has made a comeback and fills 112 pages in Nunn's book.  I recently lost as White against a 2000+ player here on Gameknot in that variation.  Interestingly enough, some players have played 7...Qc7 against me here, which also has a whole chapter to itself in Nunn's book.  I've carried on with 8. Qf3, which Nunn describes as the critical line.
Black's standard response to 8. Qf3
This is one of three main alternatives to 10. g4 according to Nunn, though he also discusses 4 other choices briefly.
and again :-)  Here Nunn mentions that Black has often provoked White into a strong sacrifice here with 11...b4.  I recently successfully played such a sac in the annotated game http://gameknot.com/annotate.pl?id=28675, though that was from a slightly different position and move order and against a weaker player than Burt.
I continue with my plan to exploit the half-open c-file and avoid castling into White's kingside attack.  The drawback of this approach is that White is also well placed to attack Black's Queenside castled position, possibly with sacrifices on b5, d5 or e6.  Black has to be very careful.  White also has to resist temptation and not get carried away with sacrificial attacks that end in failure.
Now this takes us completely out of Nunn's book.  I recently lost another game (http://gameknot.com/annotate.pl?id=26547) in this sort of position when I didn't get my K off the c-file early enough.  In this position I have the added motivations of wanting to get off the White Q's diagonal h3-c8 and to make room for my R to come to c8, creating a battery on the half-open c-file.
This took me by surprise.  White adopts a cautious approach, not committing anything to an irreversible attack but waiting for Black to make a mistake (a fairly sure bet from me!)
Black continues with his plan but how is he going to divert all White's defenders if White doesn't himself attack?
The bishop now eyes c5, b6 and a7: something else for Black to worry about.
Black attacks the Bd3 and defends the Be7, not that it was attacked at this point but could soon have been.  Both players had so many options around here that every aspect of the position and every move required meticulous consideration.  This move also permits White to play e5 if he wants, when Black plans to play ...Nd5, inviting White to swap and clearing the way to c2.
I didn't want to tie my Q to the defence of the Be7, since I planned a line-opening ...d5 if conditions allowed.  Alternatively, White might have planned f5, when this gave me the option of taking on f5 as well as responding with ...e5
White prepares to double on either e-file or d-file and also over-defends c2: a good flexible move.  While the rooks aren't coordinated, there may be an opportunity to exploit, so I now spent some time looking to see if I could get my Be7 to b4 before White could complete his rook manoeuvre.  However, first I found it necessary to practice a little prophylaxis on the kingside.  I didn't want White to gobble up my unprotected pawns, with an easily won end-game, while I engaged in speculative adventures on the queenside.
As there's no longer a risk of the e-file being opened, this rook was free to move to a more active square.  I did, however, have to be careful to avoid a mass swap off on d8 unless it was safe.  Given White's response, perhaps it would have been better to take on a3.  White could also have swapped Qs and forced this R to move again with 25. Qb6+ Qxb6 26. Bxb6.
I decided I had to swap off my beautiful bishop for his evil knight, giving him doubled pawns into the bargain.
!?  Played as a deliberate provocation of the blunder to come.
??  I knew it was risky but I still did it as I thought my Q could dash back to defend on a7.  I should have looked this gift horse in the mouth and sent it back to the knacker's yard.
This is the first of a hopefully short series of games where I lose primarily after a single blunder. During my current slump in form and rating this has happened a little too often for my liking. I hope that others can learn from my mistakes. This particular game is I believe one of the classic finishes that I totally overlooked.
Scandinavian, my standard response as black to e4 with some mixed success
Perhaps not the best response but it is the third most common on the gameknot database.
Appears to threaten the white knight and the lsb which I was hoping to take, as the knight is pinned to the queen, my knight appears to be immune, however appearances can be deceptive as we will see.
I rashly assumed this was a blunder, I had anticipated the fork from Nxf7 but when I looked at the possibility of Bxf7, for some reason I overlooked that the knight was attacking d7
And there it is. Well played Mody7. <n><n><n>The moral of this tale is if you think you are safe, look again at least once more.
Very aggressive.  Expected Qxd5; Actually wanted it, but for some reason this move makes me think he wanted to exchange except the exchange makes no sense for him because his bishop will be 'biting on granite' as another annotator once stated.
The queen is now misplaced on b5, but I have to try and gain control of the a8-h1 diagonal simply because he wants it.
perhaps a mistep, but I would as soon trade on my terms.
His plan is clear: take advantage of the relative pin on the c pawn to win it.
Partially expected f4, but he probably thought it too weakening, and it is.
His move gives me my plan, moving my rooks to the open file.
! He understands the strength of the rooks battering the rank.
Let the guy castle and then attack his kingside- more entertainment than education. Blitzkrieg- works some times. The key was sacrificing a pawn to get his strong defensive bishop. Josep and I have had some good games. Enjoy.
he castles- i am in a dangerous mood. Plan to attack his kingside- fasten your seat belts.
this is the key move for me- i could have advanced my h pawn to protect my g pawn but his bishop on g row was too strong for me
he has to take it with the h pawn
now to advance the h pawn
i dont get the q over to the h row yet, better to advance the 2 rooks right down the h file and the q will come in later
next my knight will go to f6, he will go to e6, my queen will come to h3 etc. he resigns.
I take his in return
Develops the bishop, prepares to castle
Putting pressure on the d2 Knight.
Castling Kingside and breaking the pin on the d2 knight
Putting the question to the bishop
Probably not best, but I was hoping for 12. Qxd2 Qxd2  13. Nxd2 Bxe2, winning a piece
Now I understand; He shifted my rook away to break through the center.
I saw that after the mass exchange, I could take his a pawn and create a passed pawn!
! Forking the rook and the d pawn. The rook cannot move off the back rank, because Qb1 is mate in a few turns. Furthermore, his queen can't protect the his rook and his pawn at the same time
Taking the pawn, and setting up a deadly trap. I wonder if Qxd5 was safer though...
Dandomi il tempo di contrattaccare.
Cos� tolgo il re dalla diagonale bianca, e arrivo prima PER UN TEMPO. Pu� abbandonare.
8. Qe2?! - this seemed a reasonable choice from the database.  However, thinking back it was time to break free from it.  8. Bd2 may well have been better as it would have avoided the bust up of the queenside pawns.  <n><n>Ion did have this to say in the Chat, however - "I don't think there's anything wrong with the 6.d4 line. I think you have to count on Black exchanging at c3 - he doesn't particularly want to, but it's the best he's got probably. The pawn formation you get isn't really bad at all. It has its weaknesses (the isolated rook pawn, the doubled c-pawn), but it has its upaide as well. The pawns are "doubled towards the centre", your centre is very strong on the dark squares, and the e-pawn (in this game) remains mobile and hard to blockade effectively ."<n><n>Yes, this choice may not have been fatal, and it did have it's merits, but it does not pay to make your task harder - this is the one case where following the database (I used the World Database here) is not always a good thing.<n><n>So when playing an Expert 350 points north of your rating - keep it simple!
12. Be2 - Frere Leblanc dodges the pawn attack on c4 and adds support to my queen knight.  I think I have developed reasonably up to here but I now start to go wrong.  I play 13. a4 to give my queen rook more scope as I felt he would be tied to defending the a pawn.  In retrospect I think again that 13. Bd2 was the better move.
13. ............... Qa5! - Strong move, threatening pawn on c3 and tying my pieces down to defend it.
15. Ne1?! - Ion had this to say about this move.<n><n>"But 15.Ne1 was definitely a surprise. I thought I had the better of it after that. I had anticipated something like 15.Nh4 Bxc2 with this possible continuation: 16.Nf5 Bxf5 17.Qxf5 Nxd4! 18.cxd4 Qd2 with a fork against both your bishops. Probably you would get one pawn back, but you would probably have had to rely on a more active game for at least partial compensation for the other pawn deficit. <n><n>Even after 15.Ne1, though, I don't think you were out of it until 18.Qe2. That really was a mistake, though an understandable one. The only other move was 18.Qg3 (Rxf1  19.Kxf1 Rf8  20.Ke2 after which I was still tossing up whether to bring the Q back to d8 (preparing ...Bh4) or the N (preparing ...Ne6). Had your K dived back into the corner (20.Kg1) then it was definitely going to be the Q-move (20...Qd8)."
16. Bf3 - I decide to exchange bishops to get rid of the threat on the hind c pawn but with Ion's next move I risk opening the f file and will have really nasty consquences if I don't watch out!
21. ...................... Qb6  - strong move but I think Ion had a stronger move in Bc5  followed by the deadening Rf2 forcing Glenda to give up her life to try and save her other half.  A possible get out clause was mentioned in the post match analysis which I will reveal next turn.
22. ................... Rf2.  After this move I throw in the sponge thinking that I must give up Glenda to save Henry.  The initial material balance would be a R N for Q&P which does not sound too bad.  But, I did analyse that black could win my knight with a series of queen and bishop checks.  However, because Ion played Qb6  and not Bc5  I had the following get out clause as Ion states as follows:-<n><n>"Thanks for the game, Joanne. Yes, I thought your bishop might have gone the wrong way. I did think though, that you might try 23.a5 Qc4 24.Ba3. I had planned 24...Rxe2 25.Bxc5 Bxc5 with 26...Bf2 to come, though if 27.g3 Rf2 might be preferable."<n><n>So, if 21................ Bc5 !! I would not have had the get out move a5 to play as the pawn on a5 would have been blocked by The Wicked Witch of the West.<n><n>So, here ends another lesson.  Even with a bad pawn structure try and counter-attack.  You may suffer an initial loss of material but you may stand a chance of regaining it if you keep your pieces active.
Petrov's Defense. I favor taking the pawn, it leads to rapid engagement in the middle, and it seems most of the alternatives allow black to equalize early in the middle game.
Black was not supposed to play 3. ... Nxe4. Too soon. Now he must lose his knight. He cannot now play 4. ... N moves because 5. nc6  costs black his queen.
And now the knight falls.
I didn't expect black to be so willing to trade queens when he is behind in material. Developing the knight with an attack against black's queen almost forces the queen back (white gains a tempo) or to exchange queens - either of which favors white.
A hunting I will go. I truly expected black to retreat to f7 to keep defense on his pawn.
Unexpected move by black. I cannot pass up the free pawn, and now a threat on c7 to gain black's rook.
Not really sure of a good attack here right now. White is up a by a knight, but that is not enough to win in the endgame. I need to use my advantage to leverage more of an advantage. But black is bottled up pretty tight, defensively, so for now I'm just devoloping.
Again, I don't expect black to keep trading material while he's down. So I figure I will develop my bishop a little, and open up my queen's rook. I wouldn't mind the exchange either, if black wants to trade knights.
And now, I find my attack.
The pawn looks defended, but it wasn't. Now if 16. ... Pxf6, 17 Bxf6 forks the king and the rook. But, if black doesn't play that, moving his rook (to break the fork) lets white play 18 Nxh7. But moving his king allows white to play 18. Nxe7 Kxe7, 19 Bxg7. Maybe black's best answer is to relocate the bishop off of e7, such as with 16. ... Bf5.
Moving the threatened pawn seems preferable to defending it. I don't want my rooks tied to defense.
My g4 pawn is pinned and cannot take the bishop. Moving the king to break the pin loses the pawn. The only option is defense.
More unexpected exchanges. I am all in favor of clearing away the black pieces now. In fact, if I could exchange rooks, I would gladly sacrifice Rxd6 to eliminate his last piece, leaving me 3 pawns against 1 on the king-side.
And now my king-side pawns are all on squares his bishop cannot touch. I had thought this would give me time for rook maneuvers, or to bring my king forward to lend his support, all without worrying about black's bishop.
By not getting his rook in front of the pawn, black gives his permission to white. Permission granted, I gladly accept.
A sweet move if I do say so myself. If white takes the pawn, black recaptures with check and then he can maneuver his rook back to his back rank and defend f8 with both rook and bishop. Not at all what I want. Now black's rook is threatened, so Bf8 is out. Rg8 fails miserably. Black has nothing. White must gain a queen unless black leaves his rook to die.
And now black's rook dies. Black had nothing better. All six possible king moves allowed white's queen to fork the black king and rook.
Black try to trap my Rook!
This isn't what I would normally do, I tend to prefer Bc4 but I decided to give this a go
Well if he doesn't want his bishop I will (eventually) take it
Aiming the knight at h4 as then I still have the threat of a back rank mate if the white rook strays away
Look how he gets me here! This is awesome. I have the pawn defended by the knight on h6. They can't go for the instant mate.
Bam! He's got my knight, and I can't take his bishop back, because if  I do it's checkmate, so I move the pawn up allowing the bishop to escape.
She steps back, and although what I want to take that dang bishop, I'm already behind and the even trade won't help, so all I can get is a pawn for my troubles.<n><n>Having the bishop and queen in my space it seemed only a matter of time before I get wrecked. With only a potential knight fork to bargain with, I squeeze out of the game with a draw.
Here is an exciting game!  With a major surprise turnaround by black.  I am playing as black against smitya and get into trouble early.
Looking to fianchetto my bishop since he blocked it in with c5.
Oops!  I give my pawn to black.  This is not good!
Qb7 anything else and my queen is fried!  <n>13....Qd8 14.Nc6 Qe8 15. Nc7 forking my queen and rook, with nowhere for her to go.  <n>13....Qb8 14.Nc6 Qb8 I guess I did have another option, however I did not see that I could take the knight on c6 after 15.Nd6.
I need space, and can't trade anything right now.
That pawn starts to get at my nerves.
Take away the defender of the c pawn.
In order to understand why people play this move we have to look at what it does.<n>On d4 the White Knight controls some squares, but Black's pieces have very little interest in them. However, it serves as a target for Black's more tactical ideas like ...Ng4 and ...Nxe4. So really at this point the White Knight kind of exists in a limbo between good and bad, and the way that the game shapes up really determines its status.<n>Now, Black's Knight on c6 facilitates these tactical ideas, and blocks the pawn on e4's advance to e5. White would really like to play e5 and then f4 to start his kingside pawns rolling towards Black's eventual castle.<n>So basically, after taking the Knight on c6, White should plan to play e5 and drive Black's Knight on to an awkward square and launch his pawn storm.
This is the established way to capture here. I'm not quite sure why, but I think it's because Black's main idea is to castle into his strong castle, and so if he recaptured with the d-pawn, after White takes his Queen, Black can no longer castle.
White has missed his key idea! This doesn't appear to be a bad move, but it feels like an awkward square for the Queen. The best move would have been e5, but even if White didn't know that, then Qd2 is good and fairly thematic in Dragon positions. However, this develops the Queen to a pointless square where she's not making any real threats.
This is another awkward move. It puts the Knight in the Bishop's way and doesn't control any new squares. In fact, it  controls less squares than before and removes a defender from the pawn on e4.
Black takes advantage of his chance to develop his Bishop.<n>This move may look pretty strange, but it's thematic in this variation of the Accelerated Dragon. It often has the power to force White to castle queenside, straight into the scope of Black's Rook on a8, it just needs to move to b8.
This was the third awkward move in a row. It seems odd to me that White would want to place his Rook there without moving his King out of the way by castling. White would have had to deal with the open b-file, but then his King could breathe a little bit. Here, everything steps on everything else's toes, and we can already see a checkmate threat appearing along the a5-e1 diagonal.
The idea behind this move was to develop the Rook and to force b3. By forcing White to play b3 Black is removing defense from c3 which happens to lie along the a5-e1 diagonal and could block Black's mating ideas later.
Black wants to clear the Knight out of the way of his Bishop on g7 so that it can help raid the dark squares.
Black decides it's time to launch his attack.
As we'll see, Black is only temporarily sacrificing the Rook here. It opens up a1 for the Black Queen to invade and take advantage of the fact that White's pieces are so uncoordinated.
Now White has to give back a Rook and a Knight to have any hopes of survival!<n>If 17. Rd1 Qxd1#.
Now the Rook is forced to d1.
After Black recaptures the Rook he will be ahead in material.
Now if 19. Qxd1, the effect of Black's Bishops can really be felt when 19. ...Bc3 is mate. The look crazy and random, but really they're serving to constrict White's position.
White tries to eliminate the power of the Black Bishops but it's too late. According to Fritz it's mate in two or less for every move but Qxf7 , for which it's mate in three.<n>I leave you to finish the last two moves on your own as they are both forced.<n>However, I want to say that this was a really exciting game, and that if you start to see weaknesses (like the dark square weakness in this game) around your opponent's King you should try your best to exploit them, and reciprocally, if you see weaknesses developing around your own King you should try your best to patch them up or stop your opponent from exploiting them.
Black tries to open the F-file.
The Black knight will dominate the board on either d3 or c4.
Black will avoid the exchange sacrifice.
Now mate is inevitable. Black could sacrifice the bishop with Bf2, but then Black's up a whole rook, and mate is still threatened.
I'm playing a very characteristic Sicilian Dragon opening.  Knights are all in the right spot, the c pawn is gone, the d and g pawns are in position, and the black bishop fianchettoed nicely.  I mostly got this from "How to Think Ahead in Chess".
I was out of things to develop, and I wanted to open up the rook's file.  In this situation, white can choose between letting his white bishop run around and waste tempo, or he can just trade and double up pawns on the e file.  He chose to trade off.
To prevent Nb4
Protecting with tempo
My bishop advantage proves enough for the checkmate.
there is no rush to recover the pawn
this leads to some interesting play, but to white's disadvantage.
much analysis was done here.  It came down to a choice between 21 ... h5 and 21 ... Ng5.  ... h5 while possibly not bad is murky.  the main analysis involving ... Ng5 is as follows:<n><n>22 Qh4?? Nf3+ wins.  On the 22 Qh6 and 22 Qg2 lines 22 ... f3 leads to material gain for black.  the main things which had to be worked out were the correct way of recapturing on f3.  In terms of tactical details the possibility of bxc5 for white and Bxa1 for black had to be figured out.  In some lines white winds up a rook down.  In the line he chose in the game (which was best) he wound up down a piece for two pawns.
putting some pressure on the "e" pawn and preparing to put pressure on the "c" pawn as well.
hereabouts black was thinking in terms of how to get his light squared bishop into play.
this required a lot of work.  The point of this move was to force the rook off of f1 and bar that square to the other rook.  This is important in lines where white can play Rxf6 and black must be able to reply Qxf6 not having to worry about a Rf1 by white if black has played ... Kf8 in response to a queen check.  Whether black can force a win at this point is in question particularly if most of the pieces come off the board and white has a rook left at that point.
The hardest move to find in the game.  I believe this was the only winning chance.
I am inclined to view this as an error since white gets some chances in the ending.  Correct was 41 ... Qxe5 after which white has to do some thinking to find some moves.
a little jockeying with the bishop to force a zugswang and allow black to improve his position.
this finish is easily won for black thanks to the zugswang mechanism.
I take advantage of the opportunity to play this move.
This Pawn may prove difficult to guard.
Blocking my KP and sealing in my KB for the moment, but I'm confident I can untangle my pieces before it becomes a problem.
I was hoping to be able to move my B and develop my K-side pieces after this, but...
Now I can *actually* move my B away and complete my development.
I'm certainly not going to let him plant his Knight in the center.
Draw agreed. Neither side can make progress. My passed QBP can be blocked by 20 B-B3 and White can easily guard the backwards QRP with Rooks at QR1 and QR2 and the Q at QB1. In conjunction with P-KR4, this would set up a drawing fortress.
I try to gain space on the Q side.
Continuing to push.
Completing the exchange.
I'm hoping to move this Knight to KB5...
Giving support to the Pawns.
...this tactical shot, which ended the game with swift and thunderous suddenness. If I recapture the B my Q falls. No reason to drag out my resistance any longer, so I honorably resign. Well played by Joanne.
The London
Bringing his horse to a fairly goo place.
To get his Bishop out, I think.
The best piece to take it with, in my opinion.
Now, he will attack on the kingside, I, on the queenside.
Get my rooks in the game is best.
11... Nf3 ch wins the Queen for the Rook and the Knight.
It seems to me 17... Bxf1 winning the Rook was better. i.e. 17...Bxf1 18. Kxf1 Qh3 ch 19. Kg1 Qxh2 ch 20. Kf1 Qh1 ch 21. Ng1 (if 21. Bg1 Nh2 ch 22. Kf2 Qf3#) b6 etc.
! Strong move. If the bishop moves away from the b1 and h7 diagonal then Nc2  and winning a rook. If I move it away from f1 and a6 diagonal. Then Nc4 and then Knights can be well placed.
Checking the king.
I was to expecting to take with the king.
When black moves his bishop to b4 to pin my knight, I often play this so that if he exchanges I don't get doubled pawns or isolated pawns. This also threatens his bishop, and supports my c pawn.
With my queen defending my knight, I can safely chase away the bishop.
He doesn't bother to recapture.
I bring another attacker into play and threaten mate
Actually, I'm not sure what to call this. English? Queen pawn game? I call it a Slav because that's the pawn formation Black has chosen.
Now if (a) 12. ...Ne5  13. de5 Nd7  14. f4 with play; or (b) 13. ...Ne4  14. Ne4 de4  15. Qd8 Rfd8  16. Bc3=
Most of the smoke clears. White has more space and an attack on the K-side; Black has more space and a counter-attack brewing on the Queenside.
!? -- This move weakens White's Q-side considerably, but that's not where his King lives. White's speculating that his attack will make good before Black's counterattack, and he's willing not only to weaken his position on the Q-side to make it happen but to part with material too.
?! -- Stymies the aforementioned attack down the h-file. But White has a pawnstorm rolling now, and Black's King has few places to hide.
Giving up even more material to keep the attack alive.
A split-second pause to create a haven for the King, with tempo.
! - Gah! Only at this moment do I notice that if 35. Rg7+?? Black's Rook recaptures with check! Suddenly I think I'm losing, and I need to find a saving continuation NOW!
! -- I just hate players who keep making the correct moves!  >:-( ...Just kidding. Of course now my desired Queen check on g2 is no good because Black can just take the f-pawn with his King, because White's Rook can't go to f2. So ...
this gains a bishop for the knight.
I had expected 16 Rh3 Nf4 17 Rf3 Bxh4 18 Rxf4 Bg5 with an edge.  In this line it is a fair question whether black can get away with 16 ... g5 as there is a real possibility if the bishop doesn't get trapped the rook could get imprisoned by the pawns on the kingside.
the most fighting chances.  black should certainly whether the attack after 18 Re1 f4 19 Qh5 Kg7.
this allows black to protect the pawn on e6.  also the bishop won't run away.
the finish might have been 27 g3 hxg3 28 h3 Rde8 29 Qa4 Qd7! with mate to soon follow or the taking of the knight if 30 Qa3.
Now, the best option for black is f6, rejecting the knight, that has to go to d3 to recapture the bishop after the exchange. It gives black some advantage, since the knight in f4 is not well placed. But black went...
Not f6 now, because of Qh5+ and if g6, Nxg6.
Kind of surprise, but this pawn will stop black's developement, at the cost of the dsb's inactivity.
g6 can be considered better, and the weakness of the black squares is not so terrible until black's dsb is in the game.
Qg3 means that this knight will go to f5, and my lsb will have to exchange it, so...
In order to control d4 and solidify, but it allowed...
Not the best? Difficult to say.
I'm not interested in casting anymore. The king belongs to f2, defending g3.
The rook can penetrate, but...
Good, too. He wants to free his dsb.
Already foiled, but both of these pawns out like this leaving the king open probably not too good either.
Not the best move, but trying to threaten knight here
Force his bishop to move - also deadlocking centre pawns.
I think he was trying to expose my castled king by forcing me to take a pawn. I saw this coming and pressed to attack to prevent him from capatilising on this.
...because now I fork his king and queen. He must move the king so...
...I take his queen. At which point he resigned, which was probably for the best. I had a substantial material advantage and coul of easily moved to trap the king with the 2 rooks, or promoted a pawn to queen and done it with that.
Oh, really terrible idea.  QxPe2 seems better.  With this move black plays Bf6 pinning the queen against the rook at a1.
Ok, now taking the pawn is a terrible idea, because the king and queen are lined up beautifully for a rook pin, such as Re8.
Oops, NxRe2 would have been enormously better, helping free up the h rook.  This move leads to mate in two.
black easy equalize and get a good grip in the center.
now black has a problem with the king in center and the rook cant go to e8.
18. nd2 is a must. by playing f3 the black knught will go to g3 or f4.
a must. the king is poorly placed on f2.
?? why not going back with the king to g3?
(This is Game 2 of the rematch series Kasparov was having against IBM's Deep[er] Blue. All six games took place in May 1997.) Here, Deep Blue opens with e4. Now, before I go any further, I'd again like to repeat that I am a mere inferior advanced player, purely interested in Grandmaster annotations to better myself in the long run. I plan on doing these alongside my blitz and standard annotations, but in these ones especially, I am looking to compare my own thoughts of the position to what others make of the position. I am not stating that my opinions are correct- these are masters, and they would crush me any day. :P
Bb5 - we enter the Ruy Lopez. This is one of my favorite White openings, heralded as one of the best openings to get to play with as the White pieces. It's well known for the early castling and has one of the best chances to develop early for attacking sooner.
More popular is the variation where White doesn't capture Nc6. If the knight is taken, Black suffers an early Queenside scatter, but at the cost of the typically stronger bishop for White to have.
But it doesn't usually stop White from castling anyway, because there's a certain gambit if Nxe4, starting with Re1. That would mark the beginning of the Tarrasch Defense, where the knight retreats to c5 (usually), and then White plays Bxc6, scattering the Black's queenside further, and making Rxe5+ a possible move. It turns into a very violent and open game, definitely not something I'd opt for as Black.
Normally, Black instead plays this, the Closed variation to the Ruy. For good reason- the general, overall wide consensus of the Chess community back in 1997 was that when it comes down to Open games, tactics (trading, targetting pieces) tends to be where a computer is stronger, as opposed to Closed games, where strategy (no contact unless needed, more about winning control of squares rather than pieces), tends to be where people would evaluate positions stronger than computers back then. Kasparov himself was famous for inventing this approach, and he was very confident at the time that it was going to work to his advantage. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite work that way for him.
So the bishop retreats here, targetting f7. It's safe for now.
This is known as the Leonhardt Variation on GameKnot. As Kasparov was hoping, this was a good choice for a convoluted opening, because I think he was playing the best overall moves as Black from here. It involves a lot of re-arranging of pieces, transforming into a difficult knot in the center for White to untangle... d6 offers more strength to e5 after White clearly wants d4, and opens the light bishop into the game.
And for White, I also think Deep Blue was also choosing better moves. After d6, d4 now would be totally premature. c3 offers an additional defender to the d4 square, and gives c2 as a hiding place to the bishop in case of a5 or Na5.
Black castles now before delaying it starts getting in the way of his plans.
Black instead could have played Bg4, an aggressive move to pin the knight. It's not an option anymore, but I'm sure that wasn't a concern to Kasparov.
h6 - preventing Ng5 from White, who plans to trade the bishop-knight pair for Black's f7-rook. It would leave Black's king exposed on f7, but no real good way to attack it immediately with only the White Queen after the light bishop sacrifice. Still, this is a very passive response from Black, trying not to give Deep Blue any clear, fast entry into his domain.
Planning to defend e5 if White captures, no longer needing to worry about f7 falling after Ng5. Black could maybe entertain Bb7, to pressure e4, or perhaps Rb8, planning b4, but I think this is better.
Hmm... I can't remember if I've ever played this myself. White doesn't want this knight to stay here. He wants to move it to another square to continue guarding e4, eyeing Ng3. Be3 could be played at the expense of allowing Nxe4. White also had d5, but that simply is answered by Na5, chasing the bishop out. Or maybe even Na7 looks okay. I'm not sure of my analysis here.
Meanwhile, Black has this wonderful square for the dark bishop. It's a bonus guard to g7, to his back rank, influences h6, and remains sights on c5-d6. Really the only drawback to playing this is it being harder to rush down White with f5 any time soon, but that's more of an endgame concern at this point- Kasparov plans to take his time with the computer here.
The knight continues its journey to g3, and d4 is strengthened again.
Hmm... I'm not sure about this move from Kasparov, though. If it was time for the bishop to move, then why not Bb7? Is it because he wants Be6 to remain playable for the long term part of this match? I'm not sure why he's comfortable with blocking the queen's influence on the d-file like this.
The knight now lands on g3. Black no longer has any hope of attacking e4 any time soon, and White can return to further development to claiming more ground.
Kasparov notices this, and decides he needs to start pushing White back in order to gain ground of his own; this forces the bishop away, and frees his c-pawn for him to work out where it needs to go.
So now White has two back-rank pairings, with the knights and bishops. This is ideal, and another reason why I love the Ruy as White. The games can get complicated, but for situations like this...?
But for now, Kasparov gains space of his own with this, attempting to tempt White into capturing, and distorting the control of the center.
Black wants the knight in a better home, having a certain idea in mind if White pushes again...
And White grabs hold of d5, probably the most logical looking move at this point...
And finally, the knight retreats here, as planned. Let's take a moment to evaluate the position. I suppose this answers me why Kasparov elected for Bd7 instead of Bb7... somewhat. Nf5 is looking a little scary at this point, and it's a bit harder for White to break in from that way for now. It also answers why Black played c5 instead of c6 as a counter to White's d5, because this knight wouldn't have been able to fall back to e7 as easily, and now d5 is being fought back reasonably. But still... Grandmaster behind the black pieces aside, I definitely think Deep Blue was winning this game at this point. White has a clear mobility advantage, and both pairings of the back pieces prevent Black from reaching out just the same as Black's arrangement prevents White from coming in any further for now. Yes, Kasparov has three quite scary looking queen pawns that could bother White a little, and the Black Queen and Rooks can aid in such an attack, but Kasparov cannot ignore White's mobility to continue defending or attacking. Given that White clearly has more options, I say so too is the advantage a little clear in White's favour at this point, in my honest opinion.
Be3 - I'm guessing White wanted to develop the bishop off of the back rank for the rooks. There's not really any good squares for this bishop to have right now, so I'd imagine Deep Blue thought that it was going to get in the way somehow. I wonder why it didn't consider Bb2, though?
Though I guess that if Bb2 were going to be played, it would be seriously undermined by this move. Black copies White's knight pair, adding 2 more defenders to e5, making it more difficult for White to target it. Bb2 would be more to undermine an attempt to weaken the kingside defenses. Maybe this is why Be3 was better?
And now, White plays this. It definitely looks like there's a plan with the A-rook now, because Bxh6 is out of the question entirely with a position looking like this. Either that, or White's planning to go ahead with f4 eventually, and have the Queen there ready to help aid such a pawn push.
It looks like Kasparov thinks so too, so I'm guessing he's trying to hide the knight away, freeing his f-pawn and Queen to help aid in the kingside defenses. But surely he isn't planning ...f6, right? If f6, that knight is going to lose a lot more influence, and the Queen's ability to help in the kingside will be cut. So while I like this move, and I can't suggest any better ones... I also just have to wonder what he's thinking. Specifically, why Black isn't advancing more ground in the queenside? What's Kasparov waiting for before he does something that way?
Okay. From this part on, I'm openly going to predict that my annotations aren't going to be exactly accurate for the rest of the match, and this move signals it- the board has gotten far too complex for a player of my level. This move is a very interesting one, as it gives White even more space to control, and it begins to contest Black's scary looking queenside, but at the same time, I would be concerned about if Black played bxa4 on his 19th. White would have bxa4, but then Black could then play Rb8. White's Queen is stuck on d2, and would have to waste a tempo in order to return back, but Black would always have a grip on the b-file. I would think that such an exchange could help Kasparov, wouldn't it?
But no. Kasparov instead instigates a knight exchange. But quite honestly, I question if this is the best move Black has. That knight on g6 was a powerful one, and Black has more influence on the queenside, whereas White had more in the kingside. So the fact that this knight was helping undermine White, I don't think it's as valuable as White's Nf3! Further, it looks to me like White wants to play f4, so the Nf3 would have to move anyway, so the knight exchange would actually help accelerate White to play f4! I'm not sure how long it took Kasparov to come up with this move... but I really wonder why he went for it instead of something like bxa4.
It looks to me that Deep Blue agreed with my analysis, and accepts the knight trade. Interestingly enough, after twenty moves, this capture marks the first one of the match!
And now the Queen finishes the exchange. A bit soon, I think, for Black to play a bit wayward over here for my liking. The Queen is safe here for now, but isn't attacking anything of value at the end of this exchange. Back on d8, there seemed to have more options helping advance Black on the queenside.
Deep Blue comes up with this. Now, this, I'm less sure why. I'm not certain if it was because e4 needed another defender, if White plans on c4, or something else. Could White play a5 instead, and Black responding with b4 be not that bad?
As though she found a sale price before anyone else at the marketplace, Black's Queen rushes off back home as soon as she appeared. I'm more and more unsure if I appreciate 19 ...Nh4 at this point, because all I see is it giving White more of a tempo after that exchange. I'm back to thinking that maybe bxa4 back then was better.
Deep Blue must have thought that the board wasn't complicated enough, and out comes this. I like it, but again, I think it gets awfully twisted once you start asking, what happens if Black accepts bxa4? Is Black's light bishop too powerful to trade off on a4? Or does White just not mind the thought of c4?
After Rec1, I agree with Kasparov that this is probably best for Black. c3's looking a bit weak for White, but I be inclined to argue that if White plays a5 here, Bb6 looks like a really good outpost for White's dark bishop! After all, I can't say it's not doing much better on e3, and Black would be forced to move the queen again. There seems to be more that Deep Blue saw to this position than just winning Bb6 as an outpost, but here is where I have to re-evaluate the position in White's favour again. I think after the knight trade, White was able to use enough time to pierce a hold into Black's stronger part of the board, and Black seems to be running out of more and more counterplay in the meantime.
For example, Deep Blue thought it'd be a good idea to allow the rooks to be stacked down on the a-file, while defending c3 and making both axb5 as well as a5 to be powerful moves by White. If Black tries to respond with bxa4 right now, the rook stacking can still work after the bishop trade, and a6 is left hanging.
Given the previous comment, now I'm wondering about this. I'm not sure what Kasparov saw, but I'd be afraid of White entering through the a-file at this point. At the very least- wouldn't Reb1 have been better, to help in some way in case axb5? Maybe Kasparov played with the idea of stranding c4 in his idea of the lines, but I'm not sure if this was better for Black.
The rooks are stacked now. White's looking vicious and ready to open the board now. It seems that White's planning axb5 instead of a5 now- if axb5 from Black, then Rxa8 wins a rook for White, and Black cannot play bxa4 at all anymore, because once Bxa4, Black cannot avoid the bishop trade, and White will win the rook threat again.
And now, f4 is played! Yet another fascinating move from Deep Blue. Again, I'd be inclined to think that I would have liked to see the Queen on d2 for this. You know, just in case f4 needed another defender in case Black were to play exf4 here.
Instead, Kasparov plays this... and I have to wonder why. Won't White want to exchange on e5, now that Ng6 and Re8 aren't there anymore? Wouldn't f6 be better? It might expose the king and weaken the light squares around Kg8, but if White's pawn is stuck on d5 because d6 blocks it from moving, I would think White's light bishop wouldn't be able to come in to threaten the king just yet.
Pretty much forced. White now has a surpassed pawn on the d-file, and Black on the f-file. I think White's is clearly better, thanks to the guard on e4, and e5 is left miserably lonely...
But now Qf2. That's two wasted moves on White's part to the Queen! What was so useful about Qe2 in the first place, then? And why couldn't White have played Qf2 last turn? This Queen has been strengthening the dark bishop since the opening, so what was the knight doing on f6 that had this Queen hopping about when Qd2 -> Qf2 was a straight shot? Why such a detour? If White wasted any tempo this match, it was these two queen moves, and I'm sure Kasparov could have capitalized on this, if it weren't for the knight trade way back when... Those are just my thoughts.
Now, IF White had not wasted those moves... then this would be too late. Kasparov knew that Nd6 now aids in the position. White had Rf1, and would have been able to play Qxf7+ by now. Instead, Black has enough time to retreat this knight, to not only defend f7, but also prevent White from gaining any ground by being able to advance on d6 at this point. If Kasparov had any chance of a draw, I think here is where it all begins to look hopeful to recover again.
Qe8 - excellent, another f7 defender, and well needed, at that. It also strengthens a possibility of playing bxa4, a combination I think Black may want to consider for now...
R3a2. Interesting. Did Deep Blue see a line where the b4 pawn and Nd6 knight move, leaving the a3 rook under attack by Black's dark bishop?
Be7 - If Black was never going to entertain the idea of f6, I guess he's doing it now. But I wonder if Black has any better moves. f6 now, perhaps, or is Kasparov worried about White playing Nf5 in response to that?
Sure enough, Deep Blue is tired of this game being so closed. Can't say I disagree- that bishop looks very secure on c5. If Black tries to move the knight away, then White just plays Bxe7, forcing Qxe7, and the Queen has to take another move to defend anything of value; it will do nothing on e7.
Why not Nxf5? With that bishop gone, White is able to get away with axb5 even more now... and again, I don't think the dark bishop is worth keeping anymore, and Kxf8 doesn't look like a terrible square for the King to end up on...?
And here marks the pinnacle of stress for Kasparov. It took him some time to figure out this move. He wants to play e4, but isn't sure if e4 is going to work (after exchanging) should White play Be4, and then of course, totally ignoring this exchange means he loses yet another pawn. How can he keep material in balance, and if he can't, how can he use a deliberately lost pawn to generate positional advantage? He starts focusing in on the move e4, and realizes that Black can pierce through into the center that way. What gets me is his reasoning after this...
The thing is, I don't know what took him so long to play this move! Just by looking earlier, there was no way Black could just jump into e4, because, he would be down more than just a pawn at that point. Now this is where things get controversial. REMINDER: Please DO NOT comment on the legitimacy of the game played. I don't think this is the place for it, and I care slightly more about the rationale behind the moves being made. Kasparov believed, for his own reasons, that Deep Blue would get materialistic, and play Qb6, eventually winning the b5 pawn. He had one major concern. Lo and behold, the concern was played.
Be4. With this move, Black is horribly confined and locked down into place. Kasparov keeps his b5 pawn (for now), but ultimately loses a lot of choices in play for the next while. The only open file Black can get into the game with, is the same file where White has two stacked rooks and a Queen ready to invade. Kasparov loses a lot of composure here, but there is still plenty to talk about from the moves that followed, and those moves following this highly controversial one (but frankly... I can only think are the two only obvious moves as White), are why I'm annotating this game. I want to see what can be made of the endgame for Black following this point and onward.
Qd7? I suppose a last ditch effort to preserve the queen's mobility strength instead of confining her to the back rank; it also adds pressure to White's next move... an obvious one.
Qa7 - contesting the Black back ranks, and demanding that some action take place to help the Black Queen's lack of defenses.
...which White can play now without much concern. This gives the White Queen a firm hold on the weak pawn, and allows the rook to enter the back ranks.
An attempt to remove the White Queen without risking the Black one. Also prevents Ra7.
The Black King has to forfeit a tempo to White. But why not Kh7?
White's Queen needs to get off the b-file, and I'm not sure if Qc6 right now is any better.
Throwing in the check, as planned, and stacking the rook and Queen on the weak b-pawn.
Kf1 instead of Kh1. A move people have questioned before. There's yet another controversy on this move as well, as it seems to be that Black's Queen could have a perpetual on the White King that wouldn't otherwise exist if White had just played Kh1. This will come up again in a moment. Once again, I'm not interested in the comment of the computer's legitimacy- I'm concerning myself only with the draw outcome. Say if Kh1- is the draw completely averted right then and there?
Rb8- to forever remove the immediate threat of checkmate on e8, and chasing the rook away.
It instead comes here to help support the White Queen, as well as attack the Black Queen. Kasparov, at this point, had had it, and resigns in pure frustration. ---THE GAME ENDS HERE AND WHITE WINS---, but I'm going to continue a little bit longer to address a certain notation that was brought to Kasparov's attention in a restaurant after this game, and I'm wondering if our better players can help me see if this truly was an actual drawn outcome after this. The combination I hear that Kasparov apparently had- it confuses me...
Apparently, as Kasparov was told, it all begins here. Had he kept going, and not resign the match, Qe3 is threatening a perpetual on the White King. Black deliberately throws away the dark bishop- a move everyone was sure the computer would take, but this would become a problem for White, they were theorizing...
So White is apparently forced to take this bishop here, in order to preserve any winning chances. A very wonderful attack on the Black King appears, but apparently, according to the Kasparov team, it was all going to happen only a move too late...
Here is my first question about the draw theory- Why is Re8 required? I can see Qd7 now being blockable, mate probably completely averted after this. What I don't see, is why doesn't the Black Queen now begin checking the White King, probably starting on Qc1? What is stopping the perpetual checks after Qxd6, that it's necessary for Black to delay them with this move? If Kasparov truly had a draw, I don't see why his team were recommending this move to him after the fact, because the black rook itself doesn't seem to stop anything over on White's side of the board where the King rests.
I preface this by admitting that it was a Youtuber going by the name of "kingscrusher", who hints that the first move to secure Deep Blue's win, would next play Qd7+, should Black try Re8. Apparently, the Queen landing on Qd7, will allow White to play Qc6 after Black blocks the check with Re7. So it goes, if Black tried Qc1 after 47 ...Re7, Qc6. Then White would be able to manage d6 eventually, attacking the rook, and forcing Mate in 11 after a perpetual ending with the King on d1, where Black plays Qxc3.
So then... is it really true that White can be saved from the draw? Here is where I'll end the annotation- too many combinations derive from the perpetuals to try to recreate. Did Kasparov have a draw here, or is it theoretically possible for White to have stopped it? Thanks for reading the annotation, for tolerating my lower-level opinions, and I would love your feedback! :)
By now, the symmetry is getting frustrating. I take a while to look for clever ideas, and seriously consider plotting on the assumption that my opponent will mimic me. That doesn't lead me to any useful lines of thought, though so I try to station my rook on a file somewhat likely to be open up. But at the rate things are going, I don't expect a lot of action any time soon.
I was wrong. "Knights on the rim are grim (and/or dim)", the maxim goes. This surprises me, and I look for a way to turn it into an advantage.
Moving my queen to the fifth rank on my tenth move was decidedly not part of my plan prior to the game. It had been a long day, however, and my cautiousness had eventually been supplanted by the knowledge that my opponents are just as capable as me at making mistakes. It was a watershed realization.
I'm not sure my opponent meant to do this, but touch-move was in effect.
So I attack the queen. Perhaps Bg5 would be better? It develops the only minor piece I still have on the back rank. Nevertheless, this proves to be a useful square for my knight to occupy. I'm anything but conscious of that at the time, though.
And just when I was on a somewhat uncharacteristic attack, the momentum of the game changes drastically.
If ...Qxe1, Nf6#. (Ne7 would also win were it not for the knight guarding it.) I think my opponent realizes this before I do, but soon enough I catch on and my new objective becomes luring the queen off the f-file.
I think either this or the next move was written down incorrectly, but I'm pretty sure this is how it happened. I remember feeling safe from imminent defeat because I knew the pawn could serve as a buffer.
It's been said that a true sacrifice requires an element of uncertainty. I'd like to think that I'm being clever here, but there's some miscalculation involved--I think I forgot that capturing the bishop would give check. Nevertheless, this provides yet another juicy target (the rook on a1), and stands between the queen and the magical f6 square.
This square had fallen off my radar for most of the recent drama because it was guarded. This move didn't give mate, but it gave me the tempo I needed. I assume my opponent didn't see it coming.
I press on, though; trading off rooks is to my advantage at this point.
This is actually a fairly good square for one of my opponent's pieces to occupy, though that's not the piece.
However, I can now try for Rd7, Rxe7, and Qh7#.
This frees up f5 for the knight to fork. The good news is, I see that threat coming, and try to move my pieces so they're not forked their. Should I move the queen? Nah, she's pretty useful where she is. I'll move the king!
I'd seen how h8 was better than f8, but didn't see that coming. Under the circumstances, my opponent put up a strong if forlorn defense.
But it's not enough. From quick though quiet openings to startlingly aggressive shifts in momentum, it was a thrilling game. It's hard to feel safe in games like that, but I guess that's part of the fun.
wanted to save my knight for future use
needed to get opponents knights off the board
this i thought was a good move because i win the trade off... if there was one
my queens protected by the c1 bishop so i decided to take his bishop because qhis queen wont take it and hie knight wont take it either because his queen would be defenceless and i wuld take it
i knew what was goin to happen knight to e3 he then takes my rook...
needed to get rid of the bishop
trying to take down the f4 pawn
i still need my knight and d4 pawn for what i plan so i can sacrifice the a2 and b2 pawn to bide me time
it was in the way... lol
taking this pawn to d6 then knight to e5 then put blacks king in check with pawn moving to d7
this is where i was hoping to be in the end, i thought that c8 is a better move then e8 for the blacks king
this was near checkmate, because king has only 1 square to move g6 then i simply move my queen to h6 and there u go a checkmate! Great game!
Xb2, possible mate in the future from an open king, this works on so many levels.  not to mention that, if all else fails, I get free c5
Better would be Bxf6 and then taking this nice post for the knight
I learned my lesson; hopefully White also learned not to exchange quite so easily, as it gave up huge pressure and positional advantage.
Thanks for offering the draw, muginz; we both know you had this won.  I was planning to resign after you queened, but hey.
and the other one
Ok another attemp and attack a rock
OK, it is my pleasure to switch bishops,anyway i will get a rock<n>if he got my bishop by his queen , i will get his rock at d8 by my queen<n>or , if he got my bishop using his parock by moving my knight to "kg6+"<n><n>Bu i see that i will be near to checkmate using this move "Qf6+" then i have one move to the end "Qf7#" checkmate
3 moves to the end
The game starts off with the Giucco Piano.  Bc4 usually beckons this position, and I rarely enjoy the awkward situations that 3. ... Nf6 brings (with Ng5, threatening the f7 pawn).  <n><n>The opening was convenient, because I was in the mood for a nice, slow game.  Closed games like these tend to make mistakes and advantages in the game fairly subtle. <n><n>White has several options available.  Evans Gambit (4. b4) and the Italian Gambit (4. d4) are aggressive options.  Guicco Pianissimo (4. d3) is a tender approach where both sides rely on middle-game creativity.  Main line (4. c3) prepares to control the center on d4.
A nice, aggressive move by white.  7. h3 tends to be more common, but there's really little difference between the two options.<n><n>No move is without its disadvantages, though.  Finding those disadvantages is important to developing good strategy.<n>One disadvantage in this move is that it weakens a relatively clumsy white c3 pawn.  Initially pushed in order to support the d pawn's march to d4, the c-pawn now has to protect the b-pawn from the black knight while receiving little protection itself (presuming that white wants to develop the queenside knight).
White continues an admirably aggressive approach, hoping to trap the black-square bishop.<n><n>Pawn rushes like these must be treated carefully.  Even though the danger is somewhat minimized by having the kings castled on the same side, the strategy can succeed in disabling black's development or fail by overextending white's pawns.  The difference between success and failure in pawn rushes is subtle.
Black's pawn being pushed to g4 is an inevitability, because white's pin on the knight is beginning to make black's position uncomfortable.<n><n>11. g4 is withheld because, although Nxg5?! is unsound, it's not unsound by very much.  <n><n>This move brings the board to a position that could have happened anyway, but had much better odds of happening when performed in this order.  It has the advantage of developing the white-square bishop, and getting rid of the potential stickiness of having to prove a sacrifice wrong.
This position had precedent on GK, in the 1st Master Tournament.<n><n>The match is between flight2000it (white) and papani (black), and can be found on:<n>http://gameknot.com/chess.pl?bd=7038723<n><n>The queen move to d7 commits the d2 Knight to its current position (otherwise, ... Bxf3, gxf3, ... Qxh3 for a pawn advantage).  It also sets up black's queenside Knight for a long travel to a very powerful post on f4.
White's queen gets out of the way of the pin.  White may be hoping to open up the center with an eventual pawn push to d4.  An interesting move along the same idea would have been Qa4, especially considering black's plan involving the knight.
Pre-emptively retreating the bishop is a bit passive.  Part of black's plan involves papani's innovation of black coordinating with Bg6, Nh5, and Nf4.  So the bishop would likely have to move anyway.<n><n>Perhaps white was planning to play g4, for a more symmetrical (usually translating to even) game?<n><n>Alternatively, this could have been a good opportunity for white to take advantage of the knight's retreat.  16. d4 is now a feasible option that opens the game up a bit (notice white's queen is out of the game, otherwise), and makes white's white-square bishop less bad.
I hoped to create a back-up plan in case my knight didn't make it to its final destination.  Concerned about Bxe6 in the future, I planned the possibility of redirecting my attention towards the power-struggle in the center should things go awry.<n><n>Looking back, the move wasn't very wise.  It allows white another opportunity to temporarily distract black from his knight's plan, by playing 17. d4.
White wishes to keep the pawn pinned against the king (as I had done a few moves before).  This is also a better spot for the bishop to reside, compared to the c4 square.
Taking the knight may have been better, to deny black a rather strong post on f4 (especially after I committed all that time spent with the black knight on the back row, doing nothing).<n><n>18. Bxe6 Qxe6 19. Re1, and I'd say the game would stay even.
The black knight found its destination, and white reasonably had to remove it from the board.  The new threat against white is now the half-open file, and most of white's pieces are cordoned off by an unfortunate pawn structure.<n><n>White's best move here is d4.  It takes away the defender of the now-overextended f-pawn, and take away the initiative that could be used to manipulate the half-open g-file.
This is white's only concrete mistake.  The plan is to allow Bd1 to eliminate black's white-square bishop.  However, this puts a majority of white's pieces on the back rank, and gives the rooks even less room in an already tight position.  Furthermore, there's nowhere that the knight on f3 can go, except perhaps h2.<n><n>The mistake isn't game-breaking, and it's certainly playable given what transpires in the next few moves (20. ... Kh8 21. Kh1 Rg8 22. Nh4 Rg5 23. Bd1), but there are better and more offensive moves available.<n><n>I find that the alternative of d4 is the best alternative move to make.
Black's plan is clearly to double the rooks on the g-file and bully a way into an advantage.  This position gives the interesting dilemma of where black will place the rook in order to advance the plan.<n><n>If Rg2, then Nf5.  This blocks black's queen from targeting the potential weakspot, h3.<n><n>If Rg5, then Nf3, and white attacks the rook before being able to double.<n><n>If the rook moves anywhere else on the g-file, it gets captured by either a knight or a pawn.<n><n>If black doesn't double the rooks on the g-file right away, white will win an irreversibly strong outpost on f5 (effectively stealing black's original plan!).
The knight has to capture the bishop instead of the pawn, otherwise Qxh3#.<n><n>At this point, the rook could retreat to g7 and double the rooks as previously planned.  However, the problem that black faces is a return to Nh4, where the knight is difficult to remove.
...and this is the result. Now I couldn't make the Nxd5 move, as, after exd5, my opponent wins a knight for a pawn, also having my pawns on c file doubled. So I was forced to move my bishop either to a5, or to c5.
I try to make use of the fact that my opponent doesn't win material from pinning my f6 knight so I try to attack his bishop, as I will have it either chased, or traded with my
the score for black is -0.47
A move that comes into conflict with the chess principle "if you are up positionally, try to maintain the pressure and avoid trading"
I can't understand why did my opponent move like this. weakening the pawn structure on purpose and losing tempo<n>here my score is  +0.03 And I did my best to maintain it positive till the end of the game. Basically that's the point where I took the initiative.
I wanted to push my pawn to d5, but I had to defend my e5 pawn first.<n>Score: +0.10
I wonder why did my opponent move this way. Probably he was afraid that I would take his bishop and he still wanted to maintain that pawn on the f file, trying to push it forward. even so, the bishop was protected by the knight and my opponent even took my bishop with his knight at 17. g5 Bxe3 18. Nxe3, so this was a pointless move, copying mechanically  my 12th move. as result of this move, I gained tempo and my score was +0.17
Probably, my opponents intention was not to lose tempo in case of 18.Rxe3 d5, where he should have retreated with the knight in a more defensive position, as d, as my next move would have been d4, pushing my pawn forward and chase his knight, if he retreated to e3. If he chose 19.exd5 cxd5, no problem, he should have retreated with the knight, and I gained tempo anyway.
Aiming for Qd7 and then Qg4
The computer analysis suggests that my best move would have been Qh3+, aiming for 20. Ke2 Ne6 21. Qd1 Nf4+ 22. Kd2 d5 23. Rh1 Qe6 24. exd5 cxd5 25. Kc1 Rab8 26. Rb1 d4 27. Nc4 Rb5. Now, after the game, this sequence of moves makes sense to me, as I really could gain more pressure on White's King, however, during the game I tend to focus on material advantage and when I saw that after Qh3+ I couldn't capture his Knight, I considered this move to be pointless, not seing the potential check with my knight, but centralizing my pawns was also a good move, which gave me the score of +0.60
Even if the computer suggests that it is a mistake, as 26. Nc4 Nd6 27. Qxd4 Be4 28. f3 Nxc4 29. Qxc4 Qxc4+ 30. bxc4 Bxc2 31. Kf2 Bd3 32. c5 gave me an advantage of +1.26 and recommends Qg4 26. Rxe4 Rxe4 27. Qxc7 Ree8 28. Qg3 Qxg3 29. fxg3 Bxc2 30. Rc1 Rc8 31. Nc4 Bd3+ 32. Kf2 Bxc4 33. bxc4, which could give me an advantage of +3.50, I was almost sure that my opponent will try to attack my queen, forgetting about en passant
too late... Notice that from this point to the end of the game, My opponent made a large number of mistakes, because of the psychological factor. I won't judge my opponent's mistakes, as I don't have the right to criticize him, because this game was still disputed. I'm going to show you just the computer analysis.
I like this move. Not only it discovered the attack from Re8, it prevented the opponents king to run to d1
He could hold for one more pair of moves, giving up his queen, but it was pointless
Sure, Black's pawn on h6 was helping to stop my knight coming to g5, but I sensed that I had an advantage here.
I decide to recapture using the queen instead of the knight. Black is very open to attack and so has to be careful.
A mistake. I can now capture the pawn on g7.
Unfortunately, I didn't see it. Instead, I block the possibility. After 7. Qxg7, Black can only defend the rook with 7. ... Bf6, after which I can play Qxf7#.
This is similar to Scholar's Mate, but with one vital difference. Black's king can run to d7.
10.O-O-O<n><n>And now my development is near to be completed. <n><n>Look at the position. I have no real advantages, but the only piece I not already moved is the white-squares Bishop, which however controls an open side of the board. Moreover I control the d-file and I'm planning a kingside pawns ride. <n><n>Black position is worse: the Queen-Knight is still in b8, the e7-Bishop is blocked, the open c-file isn't useful yet...<n><n>I was feeling good.
10. ...h6<n><n>Maybe is better to develop. Besides, this could led in future to a bishop sacrifice in h6 to expose the black monarch.
12.h4<n><n>I gain other space. My pawns are uncomfortable for black.
12. ...Bxb3<n><n>Why? Development isn't made yet and my b3-Knight didn't threaten anything. And besides, this is the third Bishop's move in the last four moves.<n><n>Again... good for me! I was feeling still very good.
13.axb3<n><n>Obviously not 13.cxb3?! discovering the King in the c-open file.<n><n>What about the weakness of my shield pawns? No problem, what can do black here? Nothing! On the contrary now I don't have to go to b1 with my King to protect the a2 pawn! :)
13. ...Nh7<n><n>I think looking at g5. In only a single move g5 is reached by the Bishop, the Queen, the h7-Knight and the h6 pawn.
15.f4<n><n>Why not just Bxg5? I want to liberate myself from the backward f-pawn. Besides, f4 is not covered by the black Queen and, from here, is still visible the weak d6-pawn.
17.Qxf4<n><n>Exactly the position I was looking for. My Bishop is still at home, but is the same for the black Queen-Knight. My Queen and my d-Rook point towards d6 and the position of the black King is trembling for the my advanced pawns.
18.Rxd6<n><n>Grab the pawn and attacking the Queen. When things go well in chess, it's easy to find prophylactic moves.
18. ...Qa5<n><n>19.Qa1  could be check, but nothing else. If I moved the bishop in a not g2 place and my Knight away from c3, 20.Qa1  would win the rook. So, no threat.
19. ...Nf6<n><n>Running away from the uncomfortable h7 square. But this permits my next move, a Rook sacrifice to suddenly open the King position. <n><n>Better was 19. ...Ng5 and then ...Ne6 to put the Knight on the court.
24.Rxg5 <n><n>And now black must lose the Queen or suffer checkmate.<n><n>I hope you enjoy my annotations of the game. Don't hesitate to contact me for mistakes, bad advises, etc... I could have made. <n><n>Thanks to warvechaosone1 for the game and hope this comments can be useful even for him.
My limited knowledge of opening theory equals that I am out of the book (even if there was theory for this, I wouldn't know). White should play e4 instead of the text move to shut down the a8-h1 diagonal. The LSB will be a real nuisance, and White misses his chance to limit the Bishop.<n>I chose e3 instead, mainly because after e4, the queenside Knight would have to be developed to d2, also shutting off the DSB. c5 is a common move from Black in the closed games, and should it happen that Black takes the d-pawn, I prefer to take back with a pawn instead of the Knight, even if the pawn becomes isolated. While White's DSB should be developed to the Kingside before shutting him off, I have experienced that the DSB will either regain it's mobility after a pawn exchange in the centre, or can support a Queenside advance if the centre stays fixed. It probably is a consequence of my d-pawn preference.
A natural move. It supports c5 if Black wants to attack the centre, and the DSB has several options.
The pawn on b5 is hindering White's development. After Nc3, b4 will drive the Knight to a4. Black doesn't seem to care about defending that pawn, and white will have more trouble to take care of a pawn on b4, keeping in mind that due to the supported Rook on a8, a5 and c5 are possible. White will have to take the pawn to get the Knight to c3, which is needed there to have a look over the squares d5 and e4, consequence of 3. e3.<n>- The text move delays the exchange. If Black pushes the pawn now, White can get rid of it with 5. ...b4, 6.a3 a5 7.ab ab 8. Rxa8 Bxa8 9.Qa4. Now, Bc6 will be met with 10. Qb3 (followed by 11. c5, if necessary)
Strenghtening the control over the long diagonal. There is no need for Black to help White developing the LSB by taking the pawn.
White will have to snatch that pawn to sooner or later, but the later, the better. The pawn on b5 serves two purposes; preventing not only c5, but the queenside Knight cannot develop until that pawn disappears. Black's d-pawn won't move, otherwise e6 will get weak and allows counterplay, especially after Black castles. While c4 is a better square for White's LSB, 7. ...ab forces the retake immediatly. The text move is a bit more flexible, as it allows White to just give back the pawn and block it with b4.
I thought about keeping the King in the centre, as Black obviously will soon be attacking the Kingside. Castling long is not an option due to the (soon open) a-file. White has the option to push the Kingside pawns with the rooks behind them, while the Bishops provide support and protect the King from attacks from the Queenside. Unfortunately, it will take too long to manouvre the Rooks into proper positions, and f3 and f2 will be very vulnerable.
After the development of both sides is finished, White has to make a crucial decision. White is up a pawn in material, but Black's pieces are superior positioned. The LSB is a nuisence from the beginning. The DSB will show itself on d6 very soon, and with both Bishops aiming at the King's pawns, windmill and mating themes spring to mind automatically. White's main goal must be to exchange one of the Bishops before Black's attack gets underway, preferrably the LSB. Right now, there is no line for White to achieve that goal, though. White also has to put his DSB to use. On the positive, White has an eye on e5 to use as an outpost and the promise of pushing the queenside pawns.
Maybe a more passive defense was needed, but since I can't force the exchange of a Bishop, I am aiming to exchange Black's Kingside Knight to prevent it from joining the Kingside attack. White will give the central d-pawn to activate the DSB via c3. The central pawn isn't that valuable since -as has been said, Black's d-pawn will stay put, and by opening the d-file, Black's c-pawn will stay to support the DSB to allow the Black Queen to roam around.
If not this move, Black will either have to exchange the DSB for the Knight after 12. Nc5 or move the LSB, which is just as good for White.
Taking b4 away from the queenside Knight. If Black takes the DSB, he will have to deal with Nc5 afterwards.
So far, by giving back the pawn, White has activated his DSB and the Queen. Black still has the superior position, but White's options have slightly improved - slightly. White has cleared the path to either trying to defend the Kingside by retreating the LSB and pushing the pawns on the queenside, or to get rid of the remaining Knight and use e5 to actively defend.
I chose to defend the latter way. Freddy later remarked that it seems that I preferred active defense over passive defense, but I am not one that thinks "active defense or get off my lawn". The art of defense includes passive defense, and I don't shy away from it if I think I can hold it. While it seems inferior to exchange the Bishop for the Knight, it has its values for White. The LSB can't play against e6 as long as the pawn on d7 is there. It also can't switch to the Kingside, while the black Knight can. If the Knight appears on g6, the white Knight is again denied from e5. The main point of the exchange is to occupy e5 and block the b8-h2 diagonal. As long as the DSB stays on e6, the white Knight is a good compensation. Black has to move the LSB after the exchange, which gives White the needed tempo to prevent Qg5.<n><n>Freddy suggested 16. a4 after I had moved. Back then, I didn't see the point - just later I found that it was helping in keeping out the rook from a4.
This is what I imagined as defending position. The Black LSB is a powerhouse, but one diagonal is closed. At this point, I was aiming at sacrificing a rook for the LSB, hopefully destroying the pawn chain. If White manages to exchange the Queens, the DSB and the Knight will give White chances to hold out. If Black gives the DSB for the Knight, White's position also improves.
Again, white has to deal with the question of how to defend - active or passive? f3 has it's pros, but it also weakens not only the King's (un)safe haven even more, but also e3. It also keeps the queen commited to the Kingside with not much room to breathe.
I decided to stick to the plan, with the idea to operate against the Black King on f7 and g7. I calculated the now following text moves with the notable exception of Blacks move 25. A huge mistake from me. This move did not appear on my radar, believe it or not. If I had seen it, I probably would have played f3 instead. But see for yourselves.
White has two possible continuations if Black should slip on his way to victory. If Black disregards the pawn e6, White can attempt to threaten a smothered mate. If the Knight moves, g7 is under attack. 23. ...Bxe5 24.Qxd5 ed 25.Bxe5 gives away all immediate threats for a quick knockout.
(?) Looses the game. The intention was to regain the quality, using the mate "threat" on g7, while preventing covering it with Rg3. As I said before, I did not realize the next move, even when I played this one. Qa4 seems the best of the worst, after committing the Queen in the back ranks while she is need for the defense.
Winning the Queen. We agreed to play it out to the mate instead of resigning, but this is where the annotation ends. In the end, White overestimated his chances and missed the point to switch from active to passive defense. Don't hesitate to give a comment if you like.
Black wants to push the pawn, I am not going to allow it
Black is on the defensive
I want to shift the knight away
I am going to continue with my plan
This marks the two knights opening for the game (well, I think it does - correct me if I'm wrong) as White in this position, I like Black to play either this move or Bc5 (which marks the Giuoco Piano, where I would try out the Evans Gambit with b4)
There are some ways Black can answer to this threat; 4...d5, gaining centre control and blocking the attack on f7; 4...Bc5, the Traxler variation (I was half hoping that my opponent would play that because of the mini-tournament I'm in) and, checking the Database, there's even 4...Nxe4, sacrificing a knight to relieve the pressure (as much as I love sacrifices though, I wouldn't be comfortable with this particular one)
and now Black is down three points, with no compensation for the lost material (in fact, he's worse off, with all but the knight undeveloped and his own king hindering the development of his Queen and bishop)
but when the knight was threatened, I happily went along with the plan
! I saw the chance to attack! Of course, Black has to deal with the threat of the pawn to stop more material from being lost...
the attack begins!
my knight also takes part in this attack; Black would have dearly loved to have played Kf8, as it is much safer, but this move is now the only move available thanks to the knight
This was the reason for White's d4 earlier on
forced, if Black wants to preserve his queen
logical now I see it - Black needs to counterattack to have a chance in this game. But White had an interesting counter to this...
but doesn't see it; Kd2 was what I had in mind. I say interesting instead of crushing because after 13...gxf6 [best move now] 14.Bxf6+ Kxf6 15.Qh4+ {the king moves} 16.Qxd8 Nxa1 {the knight moves} 17...Nxb3 axb3, and it's 6 points in the favour of White making it all some sort of crazy trade (which favours White, of course) I think I was just afraid of an attack from the bishop
?! It gives Black tempo, but it gives up the attack on the rook
Wanting to keep the pressure on Black
I could have played Qh6, but I didn't want an excuse to give the Black queen to move. Besides, this move forces a trade
trying to get his light square bishop into play
The best square to retreat to, which doesn't block the rook and doesn't allow Black any more checks
I'm not concerned for my rook here because of the pin on the king... Black's bishops here, though, are well placed where they are, controlling the centre part of the board
Black can't retake because of Qd5+, winning the bishop
Black wisely gives extra protection to the bishop
since Black won't get anything from it (but if it weren't for the knight, Black could continue with 24...Qe3!, with a potentially devastating attack)
launching another attack on the king (and the a pawn proves its usefulness, because in this situaltion Black might have been safer with Kb5)
I was expecting Black to defend with the rook here (and probably cost him the game later on, as you will see)
and I take advantage of that! (I'm not going to take credit for allowing this sacrifice on purpose) White can nw launch a fresh attack
(!) This! Of course, Black can't recapture with the queen because of Qc7 mate
and Black launches a counterattack, offering a queen trade (and I would have accepted it too - if it wasn't for that meddling bishop! without the bishop; 30.Rxd8 Rxh7 31.Rc8+ Rc7 32.Rxc7# )
Hi everyone!<n><n>I decided to take another trip down memory lane.  This game ended on 21.08.08, over a year ago.  Somehow I get struck down by passivitis yet again, but as you will see, that passive position conceals a coiled serpent in the grass.  After a normal double king pawn start my opponent plays the Patzer's Opening, although, I have to say, that Master Freddy is not averse to playing the white side of it!  The move is 2. Qh5 trying for that evergreen famous Scholar's Mate.
3. c3 - sometimes the follow up is the standard Bc4.  Now I chase that Wicked Witch of the West away with a good developing move such as Nf6.
8. ...... Re8 - I see the exchange winning discovery (b5) and take evasive action.
12. dxc4 - bishop trade.
17. Qg4 - now the Witch is bearing down the g file and Henry is on it!  So, Glenda makes her only move in the game, Qd7.  The Dentist decided to trade queens.  I am so relieved because it will be very difficult for him to get Henry without the witch.
32. Nxe4 - this pawn + rook trade now results in the e4 knight being pinned.  Now that passive knight on c6 comes into action by piling up on that white steed.  The Dentist now backs it up with Ne2g3.
34. ..... Nxb2 - I can and now the black dsb drops off.
44. Kxg5 - pawn trade.  Now the c3 pawn drops off.  White can play Rc1 skewering Fou Lenoir and my c4 knight but Fou Lenoir can move out of the skewer with a bishop fork on d2 winning the rook and no doubt that if I was white I would certainly wave the white flag!
46. ..... Bd2+ - to separate the WK from the h6 pawn.
58. ..... Nc6+ - heading for b5 when the WR will have to give way to my a3 pawn, clearing the way to Glendadom.
The action starts to pick up. Black is trying to remove my Pawn center by attacking thae base of the Pawn-chain.
If i'm going to give up my Pawn center, I may as well get something for it. Now I can prevent Black from castling.
The exchange of Queens reduces the chance for fireworks.
Now I need to move my QB and connect my Rooks.
I hope to gain a tactical advantage with this pin.
Black, smartly, unpins immediately.
I'm still trying to think of a way to develop my QB.
Uh-oh. Black has seized the open file. I have to contest this with one of my Rooks ASAP.
Black elects to exchange.
This is an unrated game with Brigade Commander. Although I had the advantage at various points, the game was extremely sharp and I lost my way in the complications.
White needs to drive the Q back with tempo.
Necessary to try and get some sort of attack going.
!? Black wants to break up the pawns. However the GK computer suggests Rg8 13. Ke1 Na5 14. Bd3 d6 15. g4 Be6 16. Nxc7+ Bxc7 17. gxh5 dxe5 18. Rxg5 Rxg5 19. Bxg5.
I did not want to exchange the advanced N but at least I double the Black pawns.
I thought this was best, because I feared Qxf4 Qxf4 Bxf4 Nxd5. The GK computer prefers that line but seems to overlook that the Q exchange is good for Black.
At this point I realized it was time to resign, but I decided to play on for a couple moves.
not a good move. it opens the king side too soon.
maybe e6 was better. my fear is that white will play e5 and than the bishop is useless on g7.
black king is still in the center and its a bit dangerous.
???<n>allowing black to lock the center with e4 and to attack strongly on the king side.
an idea: 14.... 0-0-0 15.... Be7 16.... Rdg8 17.... g5.
Apparently Bf4 was slightly inaccurate and here I should have played Bd2 still allowing me an ability to castle Queenside after this move the queenside is too vulnerable to play over and to vulnerable for me to want to castle that way.
Can't move the knight.
He simply resigned as there is no hope in this position. This is a great game to study and analyze in depth and it might be fun to go through some of the comples lines.
? I began to think playing for f4 was better, but it was not. Better was Kg2 followed by h4.
I thought Black would exchange queens but really there was no imperative to do so, in fact, it encouraged overconfidence by White.
Trying to support e4 and defend the diagonal.
So my fellow comrades decide to play the Classical Kings Indain. Most times, it ends in a tactical draw. Though I think white has the better chances for a win. This opening choice no doubt has one of our better players on the team's influence. He is an expert in the KID. At this point I was aiming for a Catalan formation with g3 and Bg2
Discouraging black most natural way to free himself. Which is ....Nh5 followed by the tactical ...f5. At that is what black aims for most cases in the kings Indain.
In  a game back in 2005 Abitipower and I came to a similar position where I had played the much slower d4-d5(attempting to block out the DSB). Nowadays, Be3 is arguable the move of choice. For one it sets up the favorable Macrozy bind. According to the comments on the form page my comrades were expecting 7. d5 with a good chance that ...Nh5 and ...f5 are to follow.
!?<n>I like and dislike this move by my comrades. I like it because it gains valuable initiative on the E3-bishop. On the other hand black invests considerable king side weaknesses to gain that initiative.
!?<n>A critical moment in the game. Black has committed himself for boom or bust on the king side. Meanwhile, white still temporarily has his centre and a slight lead in development. All and all though the game is dynamically level. <n>Alternative variation: 9... Nc6 10. d5 Nd4 11. Nxd4 exd4 12. Qxd4 g5 13. Bg3 f5 [⩲]
expected black wants to get in his favored ...f5. At this point I see that there is no real good way for me to stop it so I decide not try. What I plan to do is make good use of the king side weakness. At this point I was not sure how I was going to do that.
⇄<n>Black has to play this double edged move if he hopes to get in ...f5. Reason being is that they have to deflect my f-knight away from contesting g5 so that ...f5 can be played without worrying about the weakness created on g5. Even so, the holes on black's king side begin to show signs of fatigue.
I kinda like this move. It hits at black's most pressing weakness while at the same time adds a much needed offensive to white's game. The opening of the h-file will be of great use for me. So I am willing to concede control of the F-file to black for the time being. This is a move that I expect came as a surprise to most engaged in the game.
I have no intention of wasting time castling. Along with 13. h4 I planed to activate my rook on the h-file.  The king will stay in the center to help support f2 for now.
The pressure on f2 begins to mount. I must admit that I knew instinctively that I was fine defensively but I also knew that I needed to get things going offensively quickly.
So far so good I have managed to frustrate my comrades on the f-file. Though they do have respectable pressure on f2 it is not enough for a break through. I would have to give them leading edge in this position. Especailly, after their next move.
!<n>A very awkward moment for me. I am forced to retreat the knight back to c3 and allow black greater share of the centre. Not to mention deflecting a piece away from the defense of f2. As you can see f2 becomes the focal point for sometime. Meanwhile the pawn on h6 lays quietly just waiting to be picked off.
!!<n>I give this a brilliance because the reason for it is obvious and subtle. The king is taking matters of his own safety into his hands by walking himself to g1. Castling is out because then black would be able to take on h6 with a guaranteed draw.  I would say that black is doing OK but the picture is starting to become very complex for him. Even the chess engine suggests 18.0-0 but I was felt that the rook had better chances of getting action via the h-file. I also felt that I had to keep the h6-pawn because it was controlling the critical mating square of g7.
This little sac is what makes 18. Kf1 so amazing. I mean who has the balls to put their king on a open file controled by the enemy rook+Queen!
!<n>The knight returns! This move is what makes 18.Kf1 work. Black does not have a discover check because of fork on his queen. Thus black will have to retreat the queen and allow white to regain the material. Still the wide open f-file dominated by the black rook keeps black in the game.
!! As my comrade Blunderball and Pawnrider pointed out 21. Qd5 leads to a long fighting draw. I found this move as an alternative. It services two purposes, first it guards f2 and gets the king off the hot f-file.  <n>Alternative move: 21. Qd5+?! Qxd5 22. cxd5 Ne5 23. Rh5 Bf5
Nasty little move isn't it! opens the a2-g8 diagonal for the LSB, undermines the e5-knight and gains tempo for Qd2. My plan is to gain control of the G-file. I feel that if I can succeed in that then my chances of success are really high.
controlling the critical g5 square.
+⁠−<n>Black's long standing pressure on f2 has been eliminated. While white has built a strong initiative on e5 and the g-file.
Black has multiple threats to deal with can you list them?
The king finally escapes from his dungeon but a little to little now.
the pawn on a5 will fall and there is no way of stopping the white rook pawn
It seems like Black is doing the reversed the Scholar's Mate. It doesn't compare with developement, however.
There are only two solutions to this problem. #1. 12.c3 and #2. 12.Be3
Black still tries to push his rook pawns, but why?
Black is going to lose a minor piece.
It's about time to bring out the unrepresented Rook.
Black still had a chance to prevent this mate in one by playing 34...Rf2.
Well, that's that. Through this game, Black's first critical blunder was where he gave up his Queen and he should be lucky that I did not find that forced mate. Black also seemed to be focusing on my Queenside until he attacked my Kingside and messed himself up.

Alfrom Namanamic Safeway, (playing as white) a chess-prodigy Kweedite from the Purple Ocean had been tournament champion for the last 4  Olympics and was particularly hoping for another win so he would hold the record as the only Kweedite to win 5 consecutive Chess Championships (This was Safeway's final year before his Phorphism - a Kweedite tradition where the first-born in each family must sacrifice themselves to the Phortanak Sharks in return for peace among Purple Ocean races).
Lord 'pawnonator' Jabborg (playing as black) was a newcomer to the Championship Chess scene and a favourite among the young chess audience (particularly Verpons). He had a controversial chess style - at the time, a respected only-recently-retired chess analyst commenting on one of his games, had remarked; 'his moves are stupid, his tactics are stupid, he's impatient and he's an outrageous cheater - If he gets to the final I'll retire'. This tournament was said to have been the first he had ever entered and won his first game against Garl Trowlaph (no. 4 in the Wackyworld chess standings) with an astonishing 600,000 to 1 odds against him.
And so, the 2nd black missile is fired;<n><n>Knight to e2 as expected
With another torpedo on it's way and the 'corner-fort defense' now in place, Safeway would likely begin to develop his remaining pieces
Safeway chooses to reinforce the corner-fort
According to chess records; it was noted that, after this move, Jabborg had very quietly begun muttering incoherently, his head had lowered and his intense chess-board-gaze was now cast on Safeway, almost as if he was gazing deep into his Kweedite head - other than a slightly vacant look, Safeway didn't seem distracted and so play was continued.
A very surprising move for Safeway - he's not usually known to move pieces that many squares in one move (particularly as his sitting-down-reach only facilitates moves as far as the 4th rank). <n><n>He had had to lean on the table to manage this move
Also noted in the chess records was the fiasco that erupted after Jabborg's pawn reached the final rank; with the pawn sitting on C1 and Jabborg continuing to stare at Safeway's head, the referee asked 'to what piece will you promote?', Jabborg immediately turned his gaze to the referee and  grunted in his thuggish tone 'What did you just say?', <n>the referee repeated 'which piece are you going to promote to?',<n>'I wanna promote to pawn' said Jabborg, <n>'that's not allowed', 'it's allowed if I says it's allowed', 'well I'm sorry but you have to choose between a rook, knight, bishop or queen' (the nervous phrappenite had begun to sweat), Jabborg's brutish arm had picked up the referee by his wings and threatened 'I don't think you heard me right mate, I promote to a pawn otherwise I'm going to promote you to a friggin sack of phrappenite body parts'. Before anyone got hurt, the Moonlagoom Hall staff-abuse stewards had intervened and after Jabborg settled down, he reluctantly promoted to a knight.
During the commotion, Chess records say that Safeway had suddenly jerked as if he had woken up from a trance and prior to this move, he was staring at the board in disbelief and insisted that Jabborg had hypnotised him. After the referee shrugged his shoulders and gestured to continue play, Safeway angrily grasped his d1 rook and violently swiped the newly promoted knight off the board, off the table and landing, with a loud 'clang-clang-splatch' in Jabborg's spittoon (Jabborg was rarely known to be without his spittoon - he was a regular grophacco chewer)
Feeling offended, Jabborg responded by grabbing the f7 bishop and, using his other hand, violently flicking the white queen off the table and smashing into a portrait of the 1st ever Kweedite chess champion 'The great Alphrom Saph', knocking it off the wall and falling to pieces on the ground. It was known that at this moment, Safeway stubbed out his gropherette, rolled up his sleeves, rubbed his hands and embarked on the most aggressive play ever known in Verponian chess history.
Safeway thrusts his rook into the opponents territory taking a bishop casualty.
A poor move, Jabborg was beginning to show signs of panic.
Jabborg was now down to 1 rook
Feeling vulnerable, Jabborg sweeps the other rook to a8 - <n>a desperate attempt to erect a corner-fort
For the sake of a pleasant interlude to this intense annotation, it may be of interest to know the origin of the expression 'grophworthy' -<n> a term derived from the Gopite/Draphenium hybrid mineral 'Grophenite'; now and again, Wackyworld's clouds turn a yolky colour due to an infection from a vapour-eating parasite known as Loshtophitus. Fortunately, a government-paid agency known as 'A Whiter Wackyworld' are responsible for directly administering 'Grophenite' into clouds when symptoms first emerge and the parasite is rapidly dissolved. For as long as 80 years, common citizens from the Graw City would point a finger to the sky at a yellow cloud remarking 'that cloud's grophworty', over the years, the expression was adopted in many sports including, cloud-surfing, cloud-skiing, cloud-jesting, cloud-chestnuting, cloud-chess and eventually chess.
Safeway, presumably feeling very confident, uncharacteristically allows Jabborg to capture his bishop. Jabborg had now built his corner fort.
The end to a succession of weak frantic moves by Safeway, now he reluctantly disconnects his king from the corner-fort
At this point, the game had reached a state of equilibrium and both players had now begun to collect themselves.
With both players reluctant to attack with their corner-fort resources, the game was apparently going nowhere. At this point, the referee suggested to both players that they take a break and then finish the game with a 'Habbajoop duel' - Jabborg and Safeway enthusiastically agreed and adjourned to their respective dressing rooms. The referee then activated the Moonlagoom Hall tannoy (which is also connected to a speaker system in Moonlagoom park) and announced that the game was to be decided by a 'Habbajoop duel' and a 5 minute intermission would take place.
During the intermission, the chess records explain that after the referee had set-up the board to habbajoop formation, there was curious discussion taking place within the audience - many spectators were asking each other if they knew what a 'habbajoop duel' was. The sympathetic Phrappenite referee decided to use the tannoy to explain the rules and use the chess board (which was projected on a wall in Moonlagoom hall as well as clearly visible to spectators outside via video screen) to demonstrate the nature of the game.
Thanks to a squoppulant scirbe present at the game, the referee's exact words were recorded; 'The rules to Habbajoop dueling are as follows; both players must use only their own knights and attempt to 'Joop' or 'Sandwich' 1 or both of the opposing knights whilst avoiding capturing any of the knights or checking the opponent's king -'
With Safeway and Jabborg returning from their dressing rooms, the referee rounded up his explanation; 'knights can only joop within the b7:G2 grid and players must make their moves immediately after their opponent has moved - only a split second delay is allowed, as soon as a player has been 'jooped', they must present their rook to a1 (if white) or h8 (if black) so that the opponent's king can capture and that colour will win the game!'
To any Verponian-Habbajoop-duel chess students who may be using this annotation, it may be helpful to use the annotation window (click the small window symbol) and rapidly click 'next move' between moves 109 and 127 to simulate the actual game which took place between these 2 chess titans.
Both Jabborg and Safeway were on their feet (Safeway stood on his chair) rapidly making their moves, one spectator present at the game had said 'their hands were a blur!' another spectator had likened this part of the game to a table-tennis match - particularly safeway, as he had to occasionally jump to achieve his moves.
Jabborg stays close to his king for protection
Safeway can't joop vertically because it would be outside the grid.
In the heat of the game, Safeway misses an opportunity for the diagonal joop on e3
After this move, a huge cheer had gone up in the audience, Safeway had gloriously punched his arms into the sky and Jabborg was just staring at the horizontal joop in utter disbelief.
Completely gutted, Jabborg, with a sulkish facial expression, reluctantly moved his rook to h8 (so that Safeway can capture the final rook and win the game - as the rule dictates)
Safeway, with a gladdened look of relief, calmly stretched from his chair to the other side of the board to capture the rook_____ But as he was about to, Jabborg suddenly, very violently kicked one of the legs of Safeway's chair causing him to come crashing down on to the chess board and seriously injuring his left shoulder! Lord Jabborg quickly stood up and roared; 'MAGGOT MOOSE!!!'. Jabborg (still stood up) viciously hurled Safeway off the chess board and after plonking the white rook on a1 -
Capturing! The spectators in Moonlagoom hall and the audience outside were stunned into silence. Lord Jabborg (holding up the recently-captured white rook in one hand and the Krompoborg trophy in the other) was staring out to the audience with a victorious mad glare laughing like a maniac. His evil laugh was apparently heard as far as the Graw City outskirts and a commentator of the match had likened his powerful winning-player manner to the intimidating personality of a political dictator. 1 month following this game, Lord Jabborg had become mayor of Graw city, 1 year later he had become president of Zaltang and 6 months after that, the Verponian race had declared war on the Purple ocean and many races (particularly Kweedites) had been chased out of their homes, separated from their families, brutally tortured or even destroyed. Good game!
it was a sacrifice in order to open the e file.
Move bishop to where it can threaten knight and then rook.
Place rook on f line to discourage queen from getting too close to my king. Rook can also threaten the f-pawn near Black's king.
Threaten the rook. I expect it to move to f6 to force a rook exchange, but instead ...
Black sacrifices the rook to disrupt my kingside pawn structure. Black used a knight and then a rook to take out 2 kingside pawns.
Bishop forks the queen and king!
Nxd4! Black now posts a discovered attack on the c4 bishop. White can't capture 12. Bxd4 like he wants to.
That move gains a pawn, with a discovered attack on the queen. If 13.Qd3 then Ne5. If 13.Qd2 then Rxc4. If 13.Qd5 then Nxe3. Qxa7 wouldn't work either.
The best option, in my opinion.
Trying to get the rook into the action.
It seems that black must defend against major threats already.
He can't take the knight because he will lose his queen and on 10. Qxb6, Nxb6 gets the knight out of trouble and after 11. e6xd7, Bxd7 gives black a nominal lead in development.
White threatens to win a pawn and make it difficult for black to castle.
The knight is pinned but it was time to get the king out of the center.
Reinforcing the f6 square and setting up to take on f4 perhaps.
The knight on e5 is pinned! 25. Qf2 would hold everything together but...
My opponent gave me a hard fight, but I managed to see the opportunity for a Smothered Mate, and it got there.  So, this annotation describes what to look for in setting up a SM.<n>The game starts with my usual opening, d4.  Typically, I play a Stonewall (e3 after ....d5 and then setting up a pawn structure with pawns at c3, d4, e3, and f4 with an outpost for the KN at e5).  <n><n>Here, I see I went into something that I am, frankly, less familiar with.  [DEAR READER:  I MADE A MISTAKE AND ANNOTATED AS IF I WERE PLAYING WHITE.... I DISCOVERED THE ERROR AT MOVE 11 OR SO AND CHANGED THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE NARRATIVE AT THAT POINT.]
White would love it if Black chose to trade his d pawn for White's c pawn.
Black adds tension to the Centre.  (I spelled it the old fashioned way on purpose.)
As I play this back, now, I'm wondering what I was thinking?  I would have thought Be2 or Bd3 would be better.  It could be preferable to leave the center tension where it is, and get my King safely castled ASAP.
After this series of exchanges, the center is half open, White is prepared to castle, and seems better developed overall.
Perhaps Black just doesn't want White to take a stab at occupying b5, or perhaps he intends b7-b5.  <n>White doesn't like his Bishop on d2, or the unprotected Bishop on c4.
Hmmmm.  I don't remember exactly why I made this move.  Maybe it was to give the d2 Bishop some scope, or to control d5 and/or to push d4-d5.<n>It does all of those things.<n><n>Oops.  A funny thing just happened:  I just realized that I am BLACK in this game!  <n><n>Oh well.  I will now continue the annotation from Black's perspective.
Black removes a key defender, and lures the Q to a less than optimal spot.
Of course.  This makes the d file available for a Rook, and makes White do something about the loose Bishop.  A problem for Black is the undeveloped Bishop and QR.
The aesthetics of White's position is not good, and the pawn defense of the B worsens this impression.  The Bishop, on the a2-g8 diagonal is "biting on granite," as they say, would have been better off defending the pawn on e4 ("over protection")
Now the formation of the Smothered Mate possibility appears!  The diagonal is open to the King, a Knight is in the vicinity.  When this plan comes to fruition, it is a beautiful thing to behold!
A spite check move in desperation.  Still, White's arsenal looks imposing:  A Q bearing down on g7, checked by the Bishop, Two Rooks converging on f7.  Once Black takes the Bishop, White cannot deliver a check and so must do something about his Queen.
Avevo pensato a mettere il re nell'angolo e, magari, portare le Torri sulla colonna g, ma, pensando di poterlo fare più tardi,  non ne ho più avuto il tempo.
possibility to castle
opening up the file for an escape? not going to happen.
Temptation to take with knight is pretty high. but the queen would just return to d2, and I will have pinned myself.<n>notice, though, possible 14 ...Nxc3 15... Qxe2#
the knight must die.
Trying to isolate the h7 pawn and open up another rank...
Was thinking of dropping queen to c3 as the diagonal to the king would be full of my pieces, handy for discovered checks...
Good square to hold black in at the back
R x d5 would lose after Qd1, so I took 15 minutes to go to where I had planned 2 moves previously...
I thought I was gone here with the Nf3 to follow up....
Queen's pawn.  Most of the responses to this move look pretty good for black.
Black ignores impending doom.
"This is not a good move.  You must play Nf6 to counter the Nf3 move in almost every queenside opening.  D5 is a critical square and you need to bear on it from f6 with the knight."
Is this a mistake? I play it regularly. I am aware it gives the white squares bishop, but it opens the h column (while I normally try to castle queenside, but if I can, I never got in troubles even with the h column open, because it takes white a long time to build up an attack on the kingside).<n>But he didn't play for that (and this was a surprise for me).<n><n>"This is the correct move when the knight is on f6.  It is not wrong here, just not best."
Strange, but the best, I fear. <n><n>"The Queen is taking advantage of the absence of the bishop from c1.  If the bishop were still on the original square this move would be less likely.  The queen attacks both d5 and b7 with this move."
My experience is that is better to take the pawn with e6xd5, because with c6xe5 my queen side becomes weak and exposed before I can castle kingside.
This is a crucial move. I spent a lot thinking, and I still don't know if it is a fatal mistake. The idea is that white is virtually blocked here. My white square bishop can eventually go to f7, his f3 knight cannot jump into the center, and my knight are free to develop in e7 and d7. I am on a defensive scheme, I know, but I am playing with black pieces against a 1900! :-)<n>Afterwards, I plan to start advancing pawns either on the king or queen side, depends on where he castles. Note that I can push in very few moves g5, a5, g4... I am not afraid to leave my king in the center or even to castle queenside!<n><n>"Not a good move, The knight belongs here because of the center.  He must put pressure on e4 and d5.  And you must clear the back rank for castling.	 "
Now, I had to choose between to develop the knights, although they cannot do much as well, but letting the white bishop go to a6, or expand my position with the h and g pawns, foreseeing an attack on the king side. Of course, in doing so I let my king without a good coverage, but... I thought white is resourceless. White's move I feared more was e4-e5, to which I would have answered with bishop e6. The plan was h7-h5, h4, g4... etc. I was wondering what if white castles on the queen side too. Very complex a position...
If pawn g4, the knight goes to a4, where I cannot attack it easily, and blocks my h pawns, so first I had to play h5, h4. But I thought not to develop was enough, so I got my knight out, thinking that I couldn't keep it forever defending my c6 weak point, still unattached (but what if Queen a4? I considered a sacrifice with the white knight, too).
If Rock c8, bishop a6, rock c7, probably it would have been all ok. But I had to get out my knights, and e7 is a good point to defend c6.
I didn't understand this move. Probably he was planning to bring his knight to b4 via a2... I thought on a5, with the intention to follow with a4... and avoiding the white bishop to go to a6!
I made this move, instead. The idea is simple: if I castle on the king side, my advance of the g pawn becomes useless, and it prevents me to go on with my future attack on this side. So, this unusual move got rocks communicate, with the intention to bring the a rock to the king side, when the moment had come. If white plays e3 to e4, my bishop goes to e6, and if then e5, queen retires to b1 (weird), and if e5 takes f6, the king takes f6, preventing the knight to take on g5. Anyway, even the knight check on g4 could have delivered a free g column for me, so...
How much hard thinking covering variants to e3-e4... and even the sacrifice knight x g5... Till now, my plan seemed to go on. I am attacking...
Another surprise. What is he seeking? The check on h5 is good for me, because after bishop f4 goes to g3, he has to play g2-g4 in order to save it, because mate in h2 is close. But now, he can play e3-e4 instead, and that is my worry.
So I decided to break the center myself, before he does. Now, I think it is a serious mistake. <n><n>Probably all my troubles went because I played some-moves-to-one-side, some-to-the-ohter, instead of straight with a single plan. The problem is that my king-side attack doesn' lead to nothing if I simply advance my pawns. My f column is weak.
Now, I spent a lot of time thinking about f2-f3, even in answering g4-g3, and if f3 takes the bishop in e4, g3xh2 , my queen can go to g3, and then my rock supports it... anyway, a lot of garbage, because...
...and I cannot take the knight without losing the rock on a8 after Kc7. Still, it would have been the best solution. But I thought that after...
If the bishop takes g5, it opens the g column for me.
I thought this move was pretty good. I expected f2-f3, then my queen goes to h7, and if he takes the bishop, rock a8-g8 or h3xg2, with still some chances to create some problems (even if h2-h3 would have saved white). But, again, he played "simple".
Now, he has a lot of chances... I had to prevent the bishop, or the knights to go to e6... nice checkmates where there.
If bishop a5 , it was a quick way to win.
I cannot admire this one, even if it is winning. I cannot take f5 with my bishop because of queen takes d5 , winning.
5. ...... Bxf2+ - this has become the standard response to the knight fork.  Both Qe7 and Nxe4 (sacrificing the queen) have been tried in the Gameknot DB.  Qe7 has transposed back into the main line however.
18. Nd6 - maybe instead of trading Glenda I should have played RxN allowing QxQ+ and then grab the rook in the corner.  Do you the Inquest Jury agree?
Re1?! I wanted a4 here and it was probably correct but I was to concerned about 11. a4 b4?!. Obviously now a simple 12. Nxd5 and I would have been fine but I don't generally like to trade early on.
I believe this cost white winning chances. Obviously offering up a trade for black's weak knight on d7 and eventually leading to the queen exchange and busted pawn structure that you will see for white in the next few moves. The intention was actually to strengthen my pawn structure kingside by moving the isolated d pawn to e file and after black castled launching a kingside attack. All of whites pieces are aimed that direction and ready to go just a simple miscalculation. Should have played 12. Nxd5 Bxd5 13. Ne5... and continued with the same idea and I think I would have been ok.
...Ba3??, not just a tempo a pawn. I should have played 18. Rda1 and swallowed my pride with an embarrassing back and forth but I decided to try and be tricky and playing against high rated opponents I've found they're not easily tricked. Was thinking maybe 18. Ba3 Rfwherever 19. Bb4 Bxb4 20. cxb4...still down a pawn but a much more playable position. Still no need to sugarcoat it, bad move 18. Rda1 should have been played.
Black taking advantage of the mistake Bxc3...free pawn as we move toward the endgame could be crushing for white. If you want to analyze it further you could go back to when the pawn structure was weakened and the c pawn and a pawn were left hanging causing the need for white to play defensively in this situation. If the structure was solid there would be more opportunity to play for open files and such.
Black claims the only open file on the board further strengthening their hold on the game. A nice play, white probably should have played 22. Rdc1 with the same idea but black is just a step ahead at this point.
fxe5?! I thought black let me slide here. Much better was Bb3 and that's what I was expecting but this move relieved a lot of tension for the moment instead of piling on the pressure. Bb3 obviously threatens my rook, white needs to keep the rook on the d file to prevent Bd4 check opening up the c file completely with tempo. But after 23. ....Bb3 24. Rd3?! Bc2 the file is opened anyway, possible pins on the e2 bishop, winning the a3 pawn, even mating threats are possible if white doesn't play it right.
I took a lot of time with this move. I felt there several possibilities. 25. Bd3 was the other option. K or B have to be moved because Rc2 would come with a nasty pin. I played 25. Kg3 with the hope of 25...Rc3+ 26. Rd3 giving me the possibility to remove black's powerful rook from the game.
With that, mission accomplished. I got the rook off the board, was it perfectly played probably not. Was it the perfect plan, probably not. Baby steps for white.
Simple idea here. If I take the bishop he has a passer up the c file after 28. Bxc4 bxc4 and my kings in the corner. If I play my king over to protect the bishop after 28. Kf2(Kf3) Bxe2 29. Kxe2, black has no passer and I've moved my king to center of the board. Black still has a 2 on 1 pawn majority queenside but baby steps for white.
I questioned this pawn sack by black at first, thinking for the past several moves Kf7 should be played not understanding what this sacrifice accomplished. It turned out to be a very clever way to get the king into the game and start a run up that side of the board.
After 32....Kf8 the idea of the sack is clear and it turns out to be a very short term sacrifice. The king will eventually capture the h5 pawn without resistance. I spent a lot of time studying this position and found this little move 33. Bf8. It indirectly protects the h5 pawn for the moment due to the fact that if Kxh5 is ever played then Bxg7 will follow. Also note that the g7 pawn cannot be pushed because of the h5 pawn and in this position the white king is dominating the black bishop not allowing it to protect.
I didn't calculate this into any my lines leading to the end when it was played so I thought I might be in trouble. I think a simple Bxh2 may have been better. Would it have changed the outcome? Probably not.
At this point with black retreating I think I've pulled off a save. 43. Kxh3 would lead to a draw after 43....Bxg5, eventually sacking the bishop for the last pawn.
Here Kf5 keeping it simple. Bd4 is also playable after 48. Bd4 e2 49. Bf2+, controlling the e1 queening square and holding. I chose to force the king to stay on the g5 pawn or lose it. If 48...e2 a simple 49. Bc3 will control the e1 square, the g5 pawn can't advance due to the h3 pawn controlling g4.
49. Kh5??? and white accepts the draw. I had been so fixed on getting the draw that I was glad when it was finally offered and without a second look accepted. Problem is 49. Kh5 turns out to be the biggest blunder of the game. 49....Be1!! 50. Kh6 51. Kg4 Kg6 52. Kf3(Bd2 Bc3)....at that point it doesn't matter the black king is sealed off the e pawn will fall, followed by the g pawn, and white wins easily. It didn't happen that way however but a good lesson.
seizing half open file by rook....if you notice my position. my weakness is d6 pawn. my light bishop at c8 and knight at b8 have no good place to be positioned. i was struggling in this game to develop my light bishop and knight. i think, this is a significant problem with benoni defense. experts advise me on how to develop these pieces on the way, pls...
i guessed his next move to be Nb4 to attack my weakness d6 with his second piece, then it is hard for me to defend. so i moved a6 to defend b4 square. computer suggests same move. i do computer analysis only after game. if do while playing it is cheating, i never do that. i never learn anything that way...
i moved b5 with a small plan. i want to move my knight at b8 to c4 . that was my plan.  right now, knight has no good square to go. i was focusing on developing...
he placed his rook to a good position. not a harm now. but it is indirectly challenging my rook. later in game he took advantage of it. a good move in my opinion.
i moved my knight with the aim to exchange my knight for his bishop. so my weakness at d6 is safe.
i want knight to move d7, so i moved my queen to c7 so it can continue to defend my weakness d6.
a brillant move in my opinion. when i was playing i didnt notice it. later when i analysed the game i understood his idea. he is making a potential pin. my queen and his rook is on same file. i completely ignored his move when i was playing. i dont have much experience in chess. it is a brillant move, making potential pin. later in the game he could take advantage of it. so it is important to place your piece at strategical position so later in the game you could take advantage. you may not see immediate benefit in such moves.
i moved my knight, focusing on development. i developed my knight before bishop. many study material advise to develop knight before bishop, i still dont know why. i just follow as if i am a robot.
he thought i am going to attack his knight by b4, so he defended it. but that was not my plan at all. my plan was knight to c5.
so i placed my knight c5. happy now. i found that it is attacking his weakness as well. i was not planning to attack earlier. i only thought for a good square for my knight. but i am getting an opportunity to attack as well.
he saw that as well. he moved his knight to defend his weakness. (that was my guess). i think that is only reason for this move.<n><n>think of this position now. i should have studied this when i was playing.<n><n>my pawn d6 is pinned by his bishop and it is defending my knight. it is not good for me. <n><n>my dark bishop at g7 could capture his knight at c3. i didnt see that. i could have removed one of his defender(defending his weakness pawn at e4) by capturing his knight with my bishop. i missed that opportunity. i didnt see that while playing.<n><n>so studying the position is so important. i will do it hereafter.
so retreated my knight to attack his weakness e4. now, 3 vs 2. my 3 attackers and his 2 defenders.
i went for capturing his weakness. my calculation was simple. 3 attackers vs 2 defenders. i am winning in this small battle.<n><n>later when i analysed the game, i felt that i should have gone for this battle. i have not developed my light bishop and i have not connected my rooks. because of this i suffered. even though my calculation was right. it was not wise to go for battle when pieces are not developed. a good lesson i learned. you watch the game you will see for yourself. how i suffered because of that...
a totally unexpected move. i guess this kind of move you can experience only with high rated players. all of sudden, table turned over. i am in small trouble now because my rooks are not connected. i could have moved away my knight to safety anytime if it was connected.<n><n>in this position, my knight is attacked by his 2 pieces and i have only defender. so my knight is gone. so my only option was to capture his light bishop. so my pieces would be even with him. <n><n>when i analysed in computer it suggets to capture his knight with by dark bishop. so that means it could have removed one of his attacker. but i didnt see that brillant move. when he made a totally unexpected move and i realised that i am in small trouble. it was not big trouble. i should have taken time to see possible variant moves. never come to a quick conclusion. when i saw i could capture his bishop i was satisified with that move and continued with that plan. always look for the best move. i learned that lesson.
i moved my bishop to defend my weakness.
he went for trading bishop. now, my question is to myself that, should i capture his bishop with my rook or my pawn. i thought for a while. if i capture with my pawn it would create a dangerous passed pawn for him at d5. i may suffer a lot with a passed pawn. i dont want myself in big trouble with his passed pawn.
so i caputerd his bishop with my rook.
i moved my queen to e7, actually not a good move. i creating pin position again. my rook activity gets limited. <n><n>one good lesson, activity of the pieces should be your priority. because of this move i reduced the activity of my rook. i should not do this in future.
alas!, he attacked my rook with his least army. how to defend this? i am in a big trouble. <n><n>see, my light square bishop is not developed all this while. and now i am going to lose my rook. i thought for a while. i found a escape route.
my next concern, where to place my rook? <n><n>i cant retreat my rook to e8. then his knight can call check by Nf6. <n>i cant move my rook to h5. then he would attack with his pawn by g4 then my rook would be trapped at h file.<n>only square i found was e7. then he could capture my pawn at d6. but i didnt find any other alternative.
i traded my rook, thought of simplification. many study material doesnt support that kind of move. i am 2 pawn behind then i should not trade. i forgot that. i was under pressure. his knight, rook in my border. so i thought of simplification.<n><n>if i could have defended my rook with my king instead of trade....i missed that..anyway...
finally i developed my bishop. another benoni weakness in my opinion. but that was stupid move. my opponent swiftly exploited it.<n><n>computer was suggesting bishop sacriface by capturing the pawn at h3. i also thought of it. but i could not find good continuation of it, so i dropped that idea.
i made this move after thinking a lot. a good move or not. i will tell you my idea.<n><n>my idea is to capture his pawn at f4 calling check same time attacking his knight or rook. if he captures my bishop with his knight. i can call check and win his rook. or if captures my bishop with his rook, i can call check and capture his knight.<n><n>that was my idea.
he captured my bishop with his knight. i was happy in my mind. because my plan was to call check at f4 and then capture his rook.
i thought of paralysing his rook. not a good idea. here, his rook has to defend his knight. but he can come out of it by calling check.
he moved his passed pawn.see, diagonal drawn from his pawn would reach at f8 and my king is behind it. so i cant defend it with my king. that is it. game over. i cant defend that anymore....<n><n>still i dont know why i was defeated. any comments from expert. any brains to help me..... i developed my bishop was my serious blunder move. all else was not that bad move in my opinion.
?! I can discern no good reason for this move. He gives up the bishop pair, dethrones his fianchetto along the a1-h8 diagonal, and allows my queen to step into play (perhaps a little earlier than I'd like, but he does not have any obvious moves to force tempi loss).
Encouraging the exchange.
d5 was planned, but the exchange would lead to a discovered check after Re1. This move was necessary.
Declining the pawn exchange. The proper move, and one I shamefully did not predict until just after I had submitted d5.
?? This loses the exchange. The rook is only a rank away from two pawns, and the Knight has just cut off his escape route.
And now the rook falls.
Setting up to command the e5 square after the capture and recapture on d3.
Purely defensive. I was ahead positionally and materially, but I didn't want to take any chances, and was willing to pay a tempi to solidify my king defensively.
The e-pawn was enough of an annoyance to remove.
Pressuring the Knight on e1. One of the links in this chain is bound to fail, and when it does, the whole defense will come crashing down.
Putting even more pressure on d3. The Knight on f3 is tied to that square. 25. Ne5 simply encourages an exchange of material, which is beneficial for Black, who is on top. The check following a recapture on e5 by White's Queen can easily be averted with Ka8, essentially removing all future threat from White. 25. Nh4? Rxd3 is even worse.
And here White resigned. Despite my far lower rating, a sharp tactical blow in the middlegame followed by a commanding presence on the d-file sealed the win.
This is also Black's 'favorite', though the other day it played an 'Ultra-fianchetto': 2...g6!?
Immediately staking his claim on the d4-square.  White hopes his light square hold will be the stronger and more decisive.
Possibly with the view to locking up the centre by ...e5, but this never eventuates.
Going after the exchange of minor pieces.  I probably ought to have exchanged on d4 (7.Nxd4 ) but, again, preferred to preserve time.
Willing to exchange my 'bad' bishop for Black's active knight...
(?!) I consider this exchange to be dubious, as it is my less useful bishop, and at the moment his more useful knight.  But in playing the knight to d4, Black had pretty much committed himself.
By developing the bishop ahead of the knight, Black dissuades White from playing a minor piece to g5.  Not that I particularly wanted to move anything to g5, but at least Black doesn't have to worry about weakening the K-side by ...h6.  But a few moves later he (I'll use a personal pronoun rather than the impersonal) played that pawn move anyway...
a fine spot for the bishop.  Black's knight is in no position to challenge this bishop's posting.
A 'dual purpose' move.  It's primary intent is to free the f-pawn to advance.  It also prevents ...Ng4, so the e3-bishop will not be molested where he stands.
Deciding that I wanted to keep the bishop on e3, I make sure the enemy knight is not going to make a nuisance of himself (...Ng4).
Beginning a general pawn advance against the Black King.
Capturing 'towards the centre'.  There are several reasons for this: 1.  It keeps the centre strong and closed; 2. an opened e-file would be much more useful to Black; 3. The half-opened g-file is very much in White's interest.  The fight develops into Black's effort to preserve the balance by attacking on the Q-side and in the centre; whilst White attacks the King directly and tries to hold the centre closed.
(!?) A little bit of a puzzle, this move.  It seems to involve some vague notion of attack against h3, or maybe the light squares on the Q-side.  Later on it infiltrates White's game via a6 and becomes a bit of an annoyance.
Offering to exchange knights.  I had no particular intention to exchange on f6 or e7 myself, but rather keep the knight on d5 if Black didn't exchange, just to keep the tension and tie up the centre.
Of course. I don't want to open the e-file.  This does leave a bit of a weak point at d3, which Black at once seeks to exploit.
Striking at d3.  This has to be taken seriously, as after ...Bf6, Black will have several nasty threats against the compromised center, e.g.: 19.Rad1?! Bf6!  20.b3 Rxe4! or 20.Qg2 Qa6 and Black will have wrested the initiative from White.  What, then , should White do now?
Hitting the Bishop.  If it drops back to a6, at least the Queen can't come to its support in attack.
(?!) I did not expect this!  I thought Black would simply move the King over to the h-file.  21.Bh6 is still playable, but there is little point after 21...Bf6.
Preparing to bring a rook in behind the Queen.
The expected counter-attack!  The threat is ...Qxd3, and undermine White e-pawn and the whole central position.  The battle is becoming more intense...
For the moment the d-pawn is safe: White threatens a direct mate.  Recall last time I mentioned the role of short-range threats that, though easily contained in themselves, yet can help to make progress one way or another.  The mate in one is stopped easily, but it preserves the White centre for an extra move whilst at the same time reinforces the attack down the g-file.
Among other things, this threatens ...Bxf5.  White's centre pawns are coming under enormous pressure, as are the dark squares.  There is a battle royal going on now that spans the whole width of the board.
Desperation?  The fact is that the threatened discovered check is so strong that Black requires extreme measures to defend.  This represents his best chance, but it ought not to be quite enough...
Protects the e-pawn.  Black can not capture it even with 3 attackers against 2, as he must at all costs keep the g-file closed.
Freeing up the bishop to take on e4.  The g-file pin is not so effective now, as the captures on e4 set up a counter pin on the light long diagonal.
(!) All out attack!  Will Black take the knight, or has the king once more to endure the hazards of the g-file?
I was expecting ...Rxe6, actually, though that loses the exchange with White's attack still ongoing.   Instead, ...fxe6 was immediately hopeless as 29.Qxg6 led to a quick checkmate.
Concerned about the centre, White reinforces it.  The eye was drawn to the possibility of 29.Qxg6ch but after 29...fxg6 30.Rxg6ch Kf7, White has insufficient attack.
(??) As it transpired, this allowed the attack I rejected the previous move.  I did give it a quick glance once again, but not thoroughly enough...
(!?)  The intention is, of course, 31.Qh6 and 32.Qg7#, but was this the best White could play?  It depends on whether Black had a viable defence.  The alternative line was this (temporary) Queen sacrifice: 30.Qxg6ch!? fxg6  31.Rxg6ch Kf7  32.Rg7ch!!  Kxf6  33.Rf1ch ... (This move was not available whilst the Queen stood at c4.)  33... Ke5  34. Rg5ch! Kxe4  35.Rf4ch Ke3  36.Rg3ch Ke2 37.Rxa4, with an extra knight for two pawns, and the Black king isolated and alone behind enemy lines.
BAM! Giving away a Queen for a mere pawn? The Black King will be subjected to a ferocious attack.
For a while this was the standard response with leading players when it was realised that 3.c4 allowed the dangerous Icelandic gambit with 3....e6 and 3.d4 allowed the ultra sharp Jadoul gambit with 3....Bg4!
Time to retreat the Queen to avoid any Ne4 ideas
Not afraid of 16. Bxa7 as b6 wins the Bishop.
Threatens mate with the idea of creating weaknesses to exploit.
Un covering another attack this time on the a5 pawn as well as removing the bishop from the firing line.
White cracks and makes a blunder though it was difficult to find a alternative. Probably best was d4 when 23....Bxa5 could be met by Re5. This position is another reason why 6.d3 was an error. 6.d4 should be best.
Now 2 pawns under attack and he can't defend both.
A quiet but very powerful move. The bishop is pinned now as if it moves it will be mate. The king can't move because of the bishop.
Ignoring Whites pawn play. The threat now is e4  and the king has to move and the pawn falls.<n><n>White is in a lot of trouble here, he needs to try and liquidate the position but Blacks control is too much. <n><n>34. axb  Kxb<n>35. bxc  Kxc is fairly best for him hard to suggest anything else. However if he follows up with 36. Ra6  expecting Kb7 when he can play 37.Rd6 surviving he would face diasaster with 36...kc7 when he has no checks and no way to meet 37....e4 <n><n>All of which led to white resigning here
By avoiding 1...P-Q4 in response, Tate opens the game up to be tactical at once.
Tate initiates the exchange...
...and Yermolinsky completes it.
Tate develops a piece and prepares to exchange off Yermolinsky's advanced Knight.
Yermolinsky prevents the exchange by means of a pin.
Tate frees his KB to develop and threatens Yermolinsky's Bishop.
This is unusual but playable. Black hopes to either get favorable variations of an Alekhine Defense type game or to be able to play an early ...d5 in one move.
Black's plan becomes evident. Develop and then use the central pawns to fend off attacks.
?! Opposing Queens opens up the possibility of tactics and hampers the LSB retreat. Better was Qe2 and Rc1<n>.
Now is the time to drive the bishop back.
?! My lower rated opponent sees that he could play Bf4 if the pawn protects the bishop. But a more skilled player does not create holes around the K unnecessarily. This move actually contributes to the final mating net. Here if Bf4, e5! anyway. So better was Rc1.
Finally...d5 in one move! Black has freed his position and is a pawn to the good.
Put the question to the Bishop.
This move is a luxury Black can afford. The idea is that an unopposed check on the Black rank or a Q move to f3 is fatal.
Attacks the Rook and opens the e file to rook exchanges.
I try to take advantage. But I overlook d5,
Will be the kingside my fate? I can take the offered pawn since after cxd, exd, Nxd, Be3, e5 holds, or Qxd, QxQ (forced), NxQ, Be3 is not a threat anymore. But I couldn't see all this during the game, so I played...
Launching an attack but losing tempo for developement.
Now I cannot take it anymore! :-(
A nice outpost, to block white's kingside intentions.
Looking forward to win d4.
I open with e4 because I have the most experience at that. but think I will come up with some slight variation early if i can figure one out.
normal response from Rob.  on the board, we are taking the normal cursory stabs at each other to keep it interesting.
I decide to see if i can get him to stack pawns or do something early he won't like.
he responds, and i think about this,  I can still get him to stack pawns, but not the ones I had hoped. So he is probably used to having stacked  b and c pawns  so I rethink that Idea
first, that I can still stack his pawns and get a pawn at e5 with my knight,  but then i remember it is kind of poisoned.  So i just back up a little
I open up the Queen on white squares and give my bishop a place to go too (if I need it.)
so now i am back to protecting the pawn (center) and maybe set to attack his bishop at c5.
he opens up his white bishop...  and probably other stuff i don't realize too.  My rating had been inflated from when before Christmas I had nothing to do at work and played with the analyzer for hours on each move.  It is back down to where it should be (  maybe 80 points at just under 1600)
I decided a4 wasn't such a bad move mostly because I figured i could keep more pressure on his pieces that are loaded on that side, also believing that if exd4,  I can still cxd4 and have the center of the board..<n>I decide to download his pgn files and see if i can do a search with notepad and find games he has played similar.
Ok  by this point I had downloaded his pgn files and done a search and found 5 games he played that were similar.  His record in those is 3-1-1 where he was black in each game...  <n>He moves Bb7,  kind of a surprise, since I had seen one of his opponents play h3 to cut off the Bg4 move .
Now all bets on past game history are off.  I play d5 to cut off his white bishop as much as anything else.  he is probably going to move the knight to e7 and keep it in the center, since a7 doesn't leave a retreat path for his black Bishop. I reveal to him on the message of the game I found he was 3-1-1 in games similar through move 6.
Its after 4 am.  I have been up for over 2 hours with no sleep.  normal  it was this move preventing me from proper rest.  I finally take the plunge If he doesn't move his knight off of e7 removing on piece off of d5,  I can force him (I think) to stack pawns on f.  Otherwise ~  I have Nf6 pinned ...  othere than that  I still don't have a plan...I need to go to sleep and dream something up.
I am not sure about this,  I haven't been sure about anything,  I did EXTREMELY poorly in OTB play yesterday including throwing away my Queen to Tag.  I am a moron.  I split his king side castle options but open up the g file.  I know he is good at defending the king in the middle   but I do this anyway.  Did I mention I am a moron?
So now I don't know what to do,  I move too fast.  some stupid comment about my poor OTB play and getting a draw if I can get all of his pieces off the board.  I am damn frustrated.  I resign two other games I was doing poorly in...
i think if i take material off the board, it is too my advantage,  it makes it less complicated for me...
I kind of suspected him to take with Queen to open up the a-file..
This pawn is the bait. If the queen captures it, the rook will get her.
Here we go!  The Hypermodernist's dream!<n><n>Black cedes control of the center without a fight.  Black intends to chip away at the center from the wings.
A very normal opening sequence.  3...d6 is subtle, but assured. It allows the Bishop some flexibility and prevents White's push to e5.  It does not beget white's center, but begins its attack.
This is where the author explains that 4...a6! is better.  He states, "back in the day...we all played ...c6 since it never occurred to us to play 4...a6!<n><n>The logic is convincing.  In the ...c6 lines, Black often plays ...b5, ...a6, ...Bb7, and ...c5 later on.  Now, in the ...a6 lines, Black actually saves tempo and cuts out an often unnecessary move.
Important here.  This Knight defends e5 and prepares the c-pawn thrust.  It also allows flexibility to f6 if the g-Knight goes to h6 or f6.  Many games even show the b-Knight going to b6 which begins management of c4! <n><n>Also important here may be the move order.  Later in the book, Lakdawala cites another game (game 5) where he plays Black and played 5...b5 before Nd7.  He suggests it is now probably inaccurate because Black lags in development and needs to catch up before allowing White a contact point to open the position.
White may have gained a pawn after 10.dxc6 bxc6 11.Nd4 Ne5 12.Nxc6! Nxc6 13.Qd5+ Nf7 14.Qxc6 Bd7.  However, Black may gain some Benko Gambit style compensation because of the two new open files.
Another "interesting, but maybe not the best move" notation here from the Author, who goes on to say that everyone else would have played 10...Ne5.<n><n>Trading off the dark-squared Bishop, especially for a Knight, is a theoretical error in the Modern Defense.  The Author defends Suttle's exchange by touting a subtle gain as Black takes control of e5.
If the Bishop took on d4, then 11...c5 12.Be3 f4 13.Bd2 Ne5 and the Bishop gets booted twice.
The Author offers an exercise here.  Black to play and win!
After the match-up, as normal I checked the internets and discovered this is called the "Sicilian - Grand Prix Attack". Not something I'm familiar with, again. At the time, although I was shocked to see it instead of something like Nf3, it seemed unsound to me. It looks to me like a quick d5. . .
. . . neutralises the threat of attack against my king.
Normally, I dislike throwing my queen out early. I've been learning to play by playing blitz chess every week for the last three months. My education has been hard, but I quickly learnt that exposing my queen early on was a good way to lose quickly. However, in this instance, although I was nervous it seemed the best possible move. The e-file is open in front of white's king, which, if a quick defense isn't sorted (perhaps d3?), will allow me to pick off the weakened f-pawn.
Finally, after having decimated white's pawn formation, I agree to the exchange
I think Bxd2 was better, allowing for 11...e5 12.b4 Nf6 13.b5 Ne7 14.Nf3 Ng6. This would've kept white in the game, whereas Nxd2 meant more of a loss of material.
Attacking white's bishop, protecting my passed pawn on d4 and advancing my other passed pawn to e5
White offers exchange of bishops. . . strangely. Although the ensuing exchange stops my ability to queen-side castle, it leaves me with a nice material advantage. Not sure if there was a better move availiable, I think white's ds-bishop was dead anyway.
Aiming at forking the white's king and rook. However, if that fails can use it as a quick way to defend against a check from white's rook on the e-file by moving to the protected square e3
As mentioned, protection along the e-file. Also closes off the spaces availiable to white's king, which can only move to b1 now
Planning on further disruptions to white's pawn structure and looking at the ds-bishop check on a3, which will force the white king to b1
Aiming at briging my knight into play at c4. The two knights will defend eachother, and will confine the white king to a1, a2 and b1.
White opens the d-file for me, and at this point I started to think about mate. The board pattern looks familiar, so I'm willing to suggest that Nf5 stepped into forced mate, if someone could confirm that I'd be grateful. I think Rxe3 was better.
And my opponent resigns. It was a fun game, and a good lesson in the power of pawns. Once white's pawns were gone, although he had more manoeuvrability with his major pieces, he also had no-where to hide. I believe it was this weakened defense that allowed me to dictate the game.
Introducing the "Dragadorf" (or Naja-Dragon), which for a time seemed as silly as its namesake. Black's early ...a6 suggests that he will continue ...b5  and attack along the b-file, a powerful plan both as a minority attack or simple mating attack. For a long time, however, top players considered this setup simply too slow to meet White's most aggressive option, the Yugoslav. In a sense it still is, but as we'll see Black has some concrete ideas that justify his play - at least for now!
A provocative idea, and entering "Accelerated Dragadorf" territory, which just means that Black will play for speed (often eschewing ..Bg7 and ..0-0 in the process!). This move also robs White of the useful move Bc4, which has pestered the Dragadorf more than the 0-0-0 Yugoslav, and prepares ..Bb7 (hitting the key d5 square).
Now we reach another "point" of this Accelerated system....White's clear and powerful plan of Bh6 and exchanging the Dragon bishop is not so useful with the bishop on f8! Indeed, in many lines Black doesn't intend to play ..Bg7 or . ..0-0 at all. In fact, he often plays ..h5 or ...h6 instead, preventing the idea altogether.
Abandoning the "Accelerated" plan in view of White's new setup, point being that Bh6 is not so worrying without a mating attack and Black's h8 rook ought to see some action.<n>Alternative variation: 10... Ne5 11. a4 b4 12. Nce2 Rb8
This move is rather ridiculous. Initiating a kingside pawn storm now with the king on g1 is a poor choice. It's not so much that White's king is in danger (he is protected by considerable space, and Black cannot retaliate successfully with ..h5, though the a7-g1 diagonal is worrisome), but that White's rooks are horribly uncoordinated. Flaunting the traditional Yugoslav setup is not really an option!<n>Alternative variation: [Of course White's best (and only!) plan is to play for queenside squares via 11.a4] 11. a4 b4 12. Nce2 a5 13. Bb5 O-O 14. Nc6 Bxc6 15. Bxc6 Rc8 16. Bb5 Qc7 [with a positional struggle]
Also fair is 11...h6, which is more concretely a "Dragadorf" move, intending to keep the king on e8 and protect the h6 square with pieces (thereby preventing Bh6, White's main kingside idea).
Out of one trap and into another! White sidesteps the a7-g1 diagonal and prepares to develop his rooks, but now he introduces tactics on e4 and g4 (note how powerful a knight fork on e4 would be). Also, this idea is simply slow....another reason why 0-0 and kingside pawn storms don't mesh in the Dragadorf!<n>Alternative variation: [The typical] 12. Bh6 [falls flat to] Bxh6 13. Qxh6 Qb6 [ when Black has taken over the board by exploiting the a7-g1 pin, e.g.] 14. Nce2 Nxd3 15. cxd3 e5 [and Black is winning.]
Here, White resigned as Black's threats are overwhelming. I was rather amused that Black's plan of speedy queenside invasion never transpired, and instead Black's central play and 2 bishops won the day. The game might have continued:
And Black is up one piece and will soon embarrass the d4 knight as well. I hope you'll consider adding 6...a6!? to your Dragon repertoire. If you have any experience in this system, or simply questions, shoot me a pm. And I'll add that my "Dragon Sicilian Thematic" is just starting up (starting at 5...g6) and open to all interested players...just ask for an invite. Cheers.
and so it this, preparing Nb1-c3
He prepares to put his bishop on g7
and he further prepares b7-b5. This is the Panno Variation of the Sämisch. Black prepares to respond appropriately depending on White's choice of plan. If White plays 0-0-0 and goes for a kingside attack, then 7...a6 prepares ...b7–b5 with a counterattack against White's castled position. If instead White plays more cautiously, then Black challenges White's centre with ...e5.
Black cannot afford to just wait for white's attack to break through. In the above-mentioned game, black tried e7-e5
This came as a surprise. Can't he see I can hang onto my bishop now?
Qh6 is the only move not to lose a piece.
I was playing for mate - and I thought I would mate him. Although not given as a mistake in the pmca, it gives as the best line for both sides as Rxb2 14. Bxf8 Qxf8 15. Qc1 Bd7 16. Nxc3 Qb8 17. d5 Nd4 18. Rb1 Rxb1 19. Qxb1 Qxb1+ 20. Nxb1 c5 21. Nc3, so maybe I should have grabbed the exchange
With threats of f takes on g4 oe e4, and his Rf8 comes to life. I decide to pick up the exchange at last
A difficult pin on my knight on e2. My Bf1 is now stuck protecting it, so uniting my rooks is impossible
So I exchange, with a view to opening the h file for my Rh1
I was afraid of his knight coming into c2, my rook moves, he plays Rb2xa2.
This looked very dangerous to me - how the heck can I stop the c pawn?
Pmca gives this as my final mistake, and the position as plus 6.31 to black now. Instead the pmca is given as "only" 3.07 for Rh8. In reality, black is winning in both lines.
I give up the bishop to try and stop the c pawn.
Threatening Rd2-d1+ and if 31. Kf1-e1 Nd4xf3+ wins. Time to resign I think. Pmca agrees, plus 8.71 to black now. Interesting how quickly I went from a plus position to a negative position. Many thanks for reading this, comments would be very much appreciated. Don't forget to rate the annotation with the "stars" scale please!
I'm at that point in my chess adventure that I have a few openings I feel comfortable with, and trust my tactical and positional instincts to get me through unknown lines. The French is one of those; I love its stable pawn structure and intense queenside play. However, I've learned chess "backwards" as to what is proper, concentrating on opening lines instead of endgame basis, and I often lose evenly matched endgames. Part of this is due to my limited ability to calculate long series of moves (as I'm no chess savant) and part of it is a fear of these types of endings (I'm much more comfortable mating in the late-middlegame).  So, this is exactly the type of game that I wish I had lost, or at least drawn - I made several severe severe endgame blunders that should have cost me the game, and I won only because my opponent (who had been playing extremely well) committed a more serious error than mine. In other words, a terrible way to win.<n><n>The middle game is an excellent (and surprisingly accurate) example of the subdued positional jockeying that branches off into a little used variant of the French Defense at the eighth move. The themes expressed in this game are typical themes of the French: queenside play and a stable center pawn structure by black, with a concession of space and development to white.<n><n>As always, all analysis has been supported by Crafty 20.14w32, the multi-threaded version of the Crafty engine.
Classical French system. Other options are: 3.Nd2 (Tarrasch:C03); 3. dxe4 (Exchange:C01); 3.c3 (also Exchange:C01), 3.e5 (Advance:C02).
Standard opening book.<n><n>Black's major plans are to advance the c-pawn to attack whites pawn chain, then ...Nc6 and ...Qb6, focusing all play on the queenside.  His light-bishop will obviously be an issue, being almost impossible to develop until the late middle-game.  This is a serious pain the ass, but not necessarily a major handicap; the conservative nature of the french means that as long as the black e- and d-pawns stand, it will be almost impossible for white to break through. <n><n>White's major plans are to defend his own center pawns and mount a kingside attack, often after both kings have been castled to opposite corners of the board.  Black can quickly overwhelm the d-pawn in particular, so careful play is needed. In the event that the d-pawn falls, the linked black center-pawns will eventually constitute a major advantage. In fact, these linked pawns are one of the biggest advantages of playing the French for black - these two pawns are often worth more than a rook in the end game (I give up a knight to maintain them in this game), and black's mission is to potect them at all cost!  Eventually, the d- and c- pawns will steamroll down the center of the board and promote early. In the event that white manages to shore up his pawn chain effectively, black will often sacrifice a knight to mount an attack.
This move marginalizes the white knight at the edge of the board, but alleviates the mounting pressure on the d-pawn by forcing the black queen to retreat. This drawback, however, is that this begin a long period of exile for the knight by placing it in a terrible position - always strive to centralize your knights - and white won't move him again until the 22nd move.
11. ...Nxd4 12. c3 (if 12.Bxb4 then 12. ...Nxc2!) was better
My pitiful 17th move now puts me between a rock and a hard place. I now have two options: give up the knight, or give up castling. 18. ...Nxd7?? 19. Qxg7! is terrible for me. Not only can I not castle in either direction, but I have to hide my king behind my center pawns where it will eventually be overwhelmed as white dominates every other area of the board.  Under these conditions, my vaunted linked center-pawns will be tied to providing cover for my king. 18. ...Kxd7 and the white knight comes back into the attack with a gain in tempo, 18. Nc5 !.<n><n>I decide to give up the piece to maintain my center pawns and castling rights, and press my pawns up the board, proving how bad it sucks to be on the receiving end of the French endgame. Crafty hates me for this, but that's because it can't understand positional advantages without calculating for days on end.
Advancing my center pawns with a gain in tempo. Now that most of the tension in the center has been resolved and there are no longer overwhelming tactical situations to consider, castling has become less necessary than gaining some momentum.
Crafty likes 20. ...e5. In the event of a queen trade, most of the pressure will be off the king to castle, and it can move up to support the pawn advance by moving up the board under cover of the pawns. Another option was 20. ...b6.
Forking my e- and b- pawns. My mission is to protect the center pawns at all costs, and after giving up a knight for them, I'm not about to lose them now.
The rook belongs on c2, c3, or c4, in an active position in front of the pawn chain, and must not let its only open avenue be closed down with Nc5. I liked Rc3 at the time, but craft tells me Rc2 was best, followed by Rc4, with Rc3 as the third choice. Rc4 would have had the advantage of stopping the impending queenside pawn advance.
White ends up getting his way in the end, however - I probably started forward with my pawns a few moves too early, and I can't push them to the 1st rank.
The game now reduces to a 3-pawn and rook endgame, exactly the sort I'm terrible at.
do not want to exchange queens
it would be better to take the pawn using bishop. after check made there is a bonus g7 pawn
?!  The computer begs for this move a few tempo ago but now it's too late.
?  I moved my K to h2 knowing that ...Bxh3 was annoying but I got blind to the result of .gxh3 Rxf3 and how the g-pawn protector of the f3 N is gone.  Thankfully he missed it too.
Computer says I'm almost back to even as of a few moves ago.  I foiled his threat and built my own attack with initiative.  But the text move is wimpy, slow and clunky.  Qe3 or even Bd1 would have been better.
Sets up possible e5 with discovered attack on his Q
Not dxe5 because 38...Ng5+!! is an obvious fork but also initiates a discovered attack on my Q if I reply with the natural fxg5.  Also watch that his h-pawn is doing absolutely nothing.
i give this move a question mark. Usually black develops the knight Nb8-c6 or d7-d6. I don't think pushing the pawn one square further is good for black, this does not look like a gambit but more like a blunder. Probably black though he could play a reversed sicilian like 1.e4, c5; 2.Nf3,Nc6; 3.d4. See if you can spot the one small difference.
this seems the only move. Attempts by black to defend the pawn on e5 are not on the list here.
let's destroy black center! I don't know what black has in mind, but even if he manages to make me waste some tempi with the knight i don't see how he can take the lead.
this exchange could be reasonable if it weren't for the fact that black is down in material and is exchanging his only developed piece
even if dxc3 probably leaves me a better structure i didn't like the idea of exchanging queens so early. My plan here was to continue with simple development and build up a big center with d2-d4 and e2-e4, and, after that, see how black will fight to destroy it. I though this could be an interesting battle, afterall...
this is really a blunder and deserves a double question mark. Although it looks like a normal harmless developing move this is indeed the loosing move. With this bishop move black leaves b7 undefended. Noticing the knight on e5 it didn't take long for me to see the next move...
clearly the strongest, and it must be played now or black will have the chance to defend.<n>Black can't defend the double threat of mate in f7 and Qxb7-Qxa8, so the game is an easy win now.
This simply overlooks the threat of Qxf7#. I think the best defence for black was 7...Be6, when it's true i take another pawn but at least he doesn't get mated!!<n>7...Qe7?; makes no sense, after 8.Qxb7, Qxe5; 9.Qxa8 black's best reply is something like c6 (c5 just limit the scope of his dark squared bishop).
Black played 3. ... a6 to keep white's pieces off of b5, and to prepare to play a black pawn to b5 sometime soon, so the move seemed reasonable. White responded with 4. a3 which seems to accomplish nothing. No black piece is held at bay, and the threat of white playing a pawn to b4 seems minimal at best. Evidently, white's intent was to allow the bishop a retreat along the a2-g8 diagonal after black plays a pawn to b5. Still, black now plays 4. ... Nc6 to cover b4 and prevent white from advancing that pawn easily.
Breakingt he pin and preparing to castle.
Preventing a 2nd pin that could arise from white playing Re1, although 10. ... 0-0 would have solved that problem too, leaving the black bishop free to roam up to g4 in a move or two.
A bit of a wasted tempo, but this seems a stronger square for the bishop.
I'm not really sure what I hoped to gain by this. It seems to leave the black pawn at d5 hanging, for white can win that pawn with 15. Bxf6 Bxf6, 16. Bxd5. However, then black replies 16. ... Bxb2 and evens the material with a minor positional advantage in pawn structures.
The black pawn at d5 was truly in danger this time, but rather than defend it, black pushes his pawn to c4, blocking the white bishop's attack against d5.
17. d4? looks to be a blunder, though maybe only a minor one. White cannot hold that pawn on d4, as black immediately demonstrates. The threat now is 18. ... Nxc2 forking the two white rooks.
I labored hard over this one. I knew white was going to play 20. Nxf6+ and ruin black's castle position and pawn structure and rob black of the bishop pair. Knowing all that made it hard to play 19. ... Qc5. But I liked the discovered attack on white's king too much to not play the move. With something safer, like 19. ... Qd6, 20. Nxf6+ Qxf6. 21. Rc1 defends the pawn and prevents the fork at c2.
Looking at a possible threat to the white king involving Qf2, Rd8 (pinning the white knight) and Nxf3. Not that any of that is forced, but white must respond to it.
Black wants to save the bishop at f5, but this little zwischenzug gets a rook on the open e-file with gain of a tempo. White must see to saving his queen, giving time for the en prise black bishop to retreat next move.
White cleverly gained a pawn while protecting his en prise knight. Black responds by getting a rook on the 7th (2nd really, but it's black's 7th rank), doubling the threat on the white knight, but also adding pressure on white's king.
Bringing in the final piece needed to pry the white king out of his ruined castle.

Overlooking Qxe5+ then Qxg7/
The queen is immune due to the knight on g5.
The only move, falling to the skewer.

breaks the pin on c6 knight
trying to drive away the bishop while maintaining the d4-e5 tension
?? Now white's strongly placed bishop on b2 will be squandered and black will hold the centre strongly
the bishop still has to retreat
white opens the way to castle, 11.Nf3 is slightly stronger, forcing the strong e5 knight to retreat
ready to attack white's castled kingside
trapping the bishop
the knight is far more useful here.  On h7 it was a liability, here it guards that square and controls e4
to prevent Nd4, dislodging black's bishop.  A counter-attack on e4 may have been better here
if 19.bxa5 then 19...Rxa5  20...Rxa3  21.Rxa3 Qxa3 giving black an opening on the queenside
a kingside attack, obstructed somewhat by the e3 pawn
the best place for the queen, if she can wriggle out to g3 black could be in trouble
moving the rook to safety
applying more pressure and forcing black to weaken his king's pawn defence
and white has come to grief in style
If 32.Nxd4 then 32...Qxf4   33...Qxd4
freeing up the rook on a8 to deliver the finishing blow
This is a quite short game I played recently. I want to test you to solve some intersting and basic positional and tactical ideas.<n>Take it as a quiz. <n>First of all, open the java window, so that you can see the flow of the game with my comments on the bottom. Flip the board, as you will be playing the black side.<n>Then, cover with a sheet the part of the screen with the moves. Don't look at the moves.<n>From time to time you will be asked to find a move on your own. When you read "IT'S YOUR TURN" you'll have to decide what move to make. MAKE SURE to have a plan behind the move you want to make, or to have the CORRECT tactical idea, otherwise IT'S LIKE YOU DID NOT ANSWER CORRECTLY. The first moves are theoretical and there will be no questions. Anyway, try to figure out what's going on.<n>There are 10 points available in total (some questions give 2 points or more, others give 1 point). At the end, tell me your score!<n>I think that players above 1800 should have few problems in analysing this game, but for those under 1500/1600 might be interesting.<n>Good luck and enjoy!
Black accepts the challenge. He gives White two pawns on the flank in exchange for active piece play. In fact, white will lose some important tempos to capture those pawns. Now Black must play vigorously, to undermine white's centre and take the initiative.
Up to now it's all theory. Anyway, before going on try to understand what's happening here. Black has almost completed development, though his pieces still need to find more aggressive posts to become really dangerous. White, on the other side, is still back in development, but if he manages to free himself he will be able to count on his strong passed h2 pawn. Black has a dynamic advantage (development, and if he can, initiative) while White has a static advantage (material and pawn structure)
2 points if you found this move. 14... Nf5 is also good (2 points, but only if you considered that after 15.Bf2 or 15.Bc5 there would follow 15...d4 anyway).<n><n>The fact is that there was a fight for the d4 square. If white managed to take control of that square, he will probably be able to complete smoothly his development. Moreover, the pawn on d5 was a negative factor for Black, because his pieces didn't have space enough. After that pawn disappears, the scope of the Rd8, the Bd7 and the Ne7 will be greatly increased. So many good things for just one pawn! Think Dynamic!<n><n>Add 2 more points if you also had in mind the following plan: exchange as many minor pieces as possible. In few moves we will see why.
1 point. Attacking the Queen this way, Black exchanges the last minor piece, and he will finally GET the INITIATIVE because of his powerful and active Rooks against an uncastled king and those poor undeveloped Rooks. Moreover, white now cannot take in a7 because of 19...Qc3 .<n>Not 18...Kb8? 19.Qd6!<n>Nor 18...Bc6 19. Qxa7! are good.<n>IMPORTANT: As you can see, Black is exchanging pieces even if is is down in material. You have probably been taught that when you have a material advange you should try to reach the endgame. BE CAREFUL with this approach! Don't always look for exchange of pieces when you are up with material. Instead, try to understand what is best to do in that situation! Sometimes it is necessary to fight with great determination even with a pawn up or two, because the player down in material may have some sort of dynamic compensation. In this case, for example, the more developed white pieces disappear, the bigger will be the difference in development between black and white.
2 Points, but only if you saw the variation 21.Rc1? Rd1 !! 22. Rxd1 Qxg2 !! (not 22...Qxd1? 0 points) with a quick win. Other white moves also lose badly, to you the pleasure to find them (eg. 21. Qc1?)<n><n>Look at the position. Despite being 1 pawn down, Black has a firm initiative now, because of his strong and very active Rooks and Queen ready to penetrate in the enemy camp.
1 point. A defensive and attacking move at the same time. After his move 21.g3, White was really threatening 22. Rc1 pinning the Queen. This move prevents this and also allows the doubling of Rooks along the d file (the Rg8 is no longer useful there).<n><n>0 points (or negative!) if you chose 21...Kb8. It is pointless.
Not sure what he was going for. I thought this allowed me to push the f pawn and gain some momentum.
This is to move the knight away from guarding e5. I have one more piece to sacrifice.
I chose not to take the gambit but I am not sure this is book.  (I will have to wait to see what the computer says after the game is analyzed.)
Now I have to wait and see if the b2 pawn gets caught in the crossfire between the Bishop and the Queen!
Time to trade Queens.
The Knight looks to move to d5. But Nf6 still covers d5, so black can counter.
White seems to give up d5 and changes to e5.
! Bg5 is threatened and Black wants to trade Knights.
! White must now defend Black's Rook attack on the f file very precisely.
! White can not hold the King side pawns any more. But Black is not strong enough to checkmate the King. Now, the King had to run across the board, into the arms of his Queen.
The King in the arms of his Queen. There, he will die...
White resigns, believing Black will take the Queen. But White is mate:  35. Kb4 a5  36. Kc5 Qxe5 37. Kxc6 Rf7 38. Rxb5 Rc7# It is up to the romantic reader to decide whether it is more beautiful  to let the King die side by side with his Queen or seeing him fall surrounded by enemies...
Of course. With the White's QB still on the board the sortie by the Black N to g4, threatening e3, carries no sting.
White already has a huge advantage in space. Now, to begin capitalizing on that ....
The other decent choice here was 16. Nd5, although I wanted to be able to keep a Knight there once played. That would have been impossible after 16. ...Nb6. The text move opens e3 for the N at c2; it incidentally also buttresses g3, one of White's few sensitive squares in the position.
Now that White has thrust his Queen into the thick of things, some care must be taken not to allow Black to clamber back into the game by attacking her with developing tempi.
Black hopes to whip up a K-side attack behind this sac.
With the text White's threats become numerous: mate is threatened at g7, compelling 37. ...Qb7 under a pin, after which White has a grab-bag of winning ways to proceed, beginning with renewing the mate threat by playing 38. e7. So, Black resigns.
Hi everyone!<n><n>After 9 successive losses I have finally managed to win a game.  In mitigation, most of the losses were against 2000+ oppo!  This victory came against my buddy dmaestro.  He seemed to have a slight edge in the middlegame but somehow, after a late tactical melee he ended up dropping the exchange as a result of a pin.  This game is another Latvian.  I kick off with the standard e4 and my opponent responds with the equally standard e5.  Another standard Nf3 follows and then ......
2. ...... f5 - the Latvian.
10. Nd2 - clears the decks.  A future plan is to play f3 and then put that knight on f3 after the resulting pawn trade on that square.
19. Rae1 - bolstering the defense of e5 as I notice a masked battery by white's lsb which screens off the rook on e8 - another attacker of e5.
20. Qd1 - after Qb6 pinning my d pawn it looks as though I am about to lose material.  However, things are not that simple as you will see!
23. Kh1 - Henry's only legal move.  True I can play Rf2?? but I do not wish to drop the exchange if I can help it thank you!
25. Bxd5 - with this move he has another think coming.  His rook is pinned and he will drop the exchange next move.  If he takes the pawn on b2 attempting to win back a pawn for the exchange then he will cop Old Matey on e8.  I woke up this morning to find that Dmaestro had waved the white flag - a pleasant awakening indeed!
Black has the biggest challenge in this new opening. Its been discussed between Freddy and I if it isn't worth taking the perpetual from blacks point of view. Black has one critical line chance though it doesn't look all that appealing either. Lets start the game on move 6 where the conditional moves run out.
Black has accepted the sacrifice and now must go on defense for the slight material gain. The king on b6 will be common place in this tournament.
Forcing the recapture of the knight. A waste of this complex game would be to repeat Ke8 Bf7 Kd7 Be6 and Ke8 Bf7+ draw though as mentioned before may be blacks best chance.
Getting away from the fork Ne6 and allowing white the chance to make an error.
This is the critical test for black to overcome due to the destructive power of the c1 bishop and the b1 knight as soon will be seen.
?? this is the first error crazy how quickly the game slides into whites favor over a move that doesn't look or seem all that bad. The test to see if black can survive will be 11... c5 where white has some options: Na3, Be3 b4 and a4 all look okay my preference though I haven't looked at it too deeply yet would be Na3 then Be3. 11... c5 being the best chance doesn't give much hope to blacks game.

Trying to open up lines for my dsb and defend it again so I can move my h8 rook.
Kxc3 would be mate I'm not sure if Freddy made a puzzle on it so I'm not going to show it. Ka5 also leads to mate.
The ruy lopez.
I like to harass bishops.=)
Looking to gain the two Bishops.
Adding pressure to the knight
I look to attack the weak doubled pawns in the future.
This move is not necessary but I like the Bishop's chances on the g1-a7 diagonal
Looking to maneuver the rook on the  open g-file
?A mistake,White should trade rooks and have good chances of drawing the Opposite color Bishop endgme.
? for the note to Black's 44th move.
Black is trying to march the h-pawn down,to no avail of course.
Necessary to defend the pawn.
I give up my light squared bishop in an attempt to dislodge his king.
Perhaps he thought he would win the exchange but it wouldn't be too good since i also had a pawn. I also thought his knight wasn't valuable and getting rid of his central pawn would allow me to rip open his kingside with f5 etc.. I believe Nc5 is a great multi purpose move. It attack the queen, It threatens to remove a defense of the f5 knight, it attacks b7 and prepares for a e6 fork. He can't defends against all these threats at once.
Forcing the exchange of queens
Activating my king and dark squared bishop although it's not going to have much use.
Before developing the knight, Black wants to get rid of the possibility of Ba6.
Black now has hanging pawns at c5 and d5.  Fischer gives a masterful lesson on how to play against hanging pawns.
White reaches his goal against hanging pawns.  Forcing one of them to move so they can be blockaded.  White now has an excellent outpost at c4 for his bishop.
Black has no counterplay and Fischer starts the attack
?  Pa4 thrown to the dogs.  It was safe back on a3 where it was invisible to black's white bishop.
???  White must now trade the rook for black's pawn, with Ph4+.
The Abbazia defence.Black does not make any attempt to hold on to his pawn yet.
!?Black gives the pawn back to catch up in development
Developing and holding on to the pawn on f4.
!Forces a double attack on f4 and f7.Black cannot defend both.
Sidestepping the pin.
So he can be able to move the a8-rook.
Protecting the knight and defending 27...Re1#
The critical juncture.
??The losing move!37...Rb1+! draws since after 38.Kg2 Rb2+ if he moves the King away from the pawn it is a draw.
Wanting to trade rooks which will give White the win.
Now the mirrored fianchetto position , classic development in this variation. BB will have an excellent control of a1-h8 whiles white's may be more limited in his control due to e4 blockade, which will prompt white to induce a future advance, being supported by either d4 or f4.
Black will hold the center and also will keep open the a1-h8 highway. A future rupture on d5 is also a plan here. Everything is most normal so far (to our level I mean)
Maybe 9.g4 would have been more aggressive and might have saved a time, but Be3 is a strong move, since is both aiming c5 and also allowing Qd2 with the corresponding attack on the fianchetto.
Black goes for a classical plan here, since it can support now the strong Nd4 with his tween after N7c6.
And there it goes. On the other hand , after white showing off his hand, maybe N on e7 would have been an excellent defensive piece.
Avoiding the exchange and adding the N onto the attack.
Golden rule in chess: When being attacked on one flank, counterattack (if possible on the center). It also seems to leave defence somehow weakened, but seems alright to me.
To keep with the plan.
Now this is a mistake, since black does not compensate for the loss of activity on his DSB. And yet, my opponent pushed me a lot to show the tactical advantage white gained after movement 15.
Threatening b2. It may be the nervous situation emerging from a recently gained advantage, but I started to feel compressed here. White needs to measure his next moves careful in order not to lose control of the flank.
Although it weakens c3, I thought it was the best, since now I can try h4 and then, slowly, shift my pieces towards the center and the Q'flank. Black will not help me, though.
Aa I said, now c3 is a weak spot. On the other hand, white has now the chance to expel BN on d4 if c3 is eventually allowed. White needs to exploit the narrow position black has on that area, not forgetting to try something on the BK castling though.
Now, as mentioned before, black will start pushing on the flank, exploiting the fact that white pieces are poorly coordinated there, including WB on g2. But then, black is moving pieces away from the castling, which makes me think about trying something there. The mate with N on h6 seems impossible, but then maybe something with the rook... Question is... would it be worth trying the advance h4? Or perhaps , since black has not advanced e5, Rf4 is the appropriate move?
I opted for the latter. This is a risky commitment, since, once on the "h" file, the rook will be of no support to the Queen's flank, and after ...e5, black can cut off any reinforcements white will like to bring onto the castling area.
But it seems Black is more interesting on pushing on the other flank. I thought ...e5 was going to be the move. I guess in case of ...e5, black will have to give up on the center. That (not giving up on the center) may also explain why it was Ra and not Rfa8 played.
Ne5 seems to be the right one, since is closer to the castling and also, as said, helping on c4 control. Moreover, it cannot retire without losing the pawn on d3 and in case of Bxe5, dxe5, LSB will also have his c8-h3 blocked and therefore, white can bring some firepower onto that flank to exploit BK weakened castling.
Nd-c6 was the other alternative, but then the c file is blocked.
A much more appealing position for white now presents on the castling flank. On the other hand, BQ is pointing to Rc1 and hence, Qg4 cannot be played immediately.
Making room for the queen to go to h4 and also, in case no attacking plan on the castling comes into my mind, the 3 rank is now indirectly defended by Rh3.
It took me a long time to figure out this (I think is the best) move, since it was so simple I didn't see it, as obsessed I was with leaving that rook undefended. As simple as it is, I feel like it was one, if not THE one, best moves I made. It gives me exactly the times I need to make the final attack.
And here comes the race! It is an extremely interesting ending. I couldn't calculate the outcome of it. I even thought about black trying something like Nf5 (later) to quench off white's attack.
Now it comes one of my last doubts. Could I continue with the quieter 26.axb3 or shall I go for straight for Nh5? I though that after axb3, Nf5 would have caused me much trouble (not that I went deep in the analysis of it though)
An interesting ending. I tried to calculate the most possible variants here, and sometimes I came with black having an ace under the sleeve and other times I couldn't find a way out for black. Calm was not on my "things to do" list. But everything seemed under control y played cautiously.
A must, to defend on f1.
And black surrendered. It was interesting that, after 32...Qc1, 33.Nd2! saved the day: it gives time for Rook to go back to h3 and at the same time is defending f1. A nice deviation sacrifice (in case I had the chance to use it). Fantastic two games played against my opponent here, including that miniature he made out of my careless development previously posted. Hope you have enjoyed both!
An irregular opening played by myself. I usually play 1.e4, to create a game where sacrifices and beutiful combonations are aplenty. When I played 1.d4, I created a slow positional game, which most masters prefer.<n><n>I however, wanted to try something new, and played 1.d4.
4.e5 would of given white better chances because of his early takeover of the centre. After 4.e5, white should then fianchetto the king bishop, then castle.
White has completed his development and now plans to swing the knight to h2 and then to g4 (An importand part of the game later on).
? I overlooked Nxe4, because of my plan to win the exchange. However, I have a reputation of my swindling, which actually gave the material advantage to me in this game.
An attempted trap that actually worked. After exf4, I would place the bishop on the f3 diagonal, then retake the pawn on c6. If 19... cxd5. I would follow through on my plan to win the exchange.
attempting to recover the pawn with a positional plus, because of the passed pawn on c6 after 21 dxc6
! When the Knight comes to f6, the king can not go to f8, because of Nxh7 <n>This move should draw with correct play.<n><n>Doing otherwise would allow a prepetual, drawing the game
The King of black is now in jeopardy. Before, he was up three pawns. Now he is down one point. Unfortunately, with proper attack by white, the king of black will be vagrant for the rest of his days.
This defers the attack. I personally was intiminated by the check because black may have a decent attack.
Now the King can't avoid a mate. This game is a decent example on how to win a lost game. 1. Get the initiative. This is the first move. Always importand when starting an attack. You may have to sacrifice a pawn or  two. 2. Attack. Threaten material. It may make him intiminated. 3. Win. I can't explain how a swindle actually works. This is the general idea.
Not the usual knight move in the Sicilian but is very transpositional in nature. Still I do think Nf3 ultimately give white the best winning chances. In the current position black has no trouble equalizing.
developing the knight and preparing for the exchange on d4.
The most direct approach, denying the white knight the ability to jump to d5.
Establishes a forward position for the knight and creating exchange threats on f3 and e2 if it is beneficial for black at some point. The strategic idea is to create a long term structural pawn weakness that can be exploited later on
with the up coming Bb2 e5 will be come a hot spot on the board so I play Bd6 to get some control and protection on it. Part of being a higher class player is being able to accurately predict what your opponent plans to do in the future and do something about it before it becomes a problem. Most chess players only respond to current threats not latent threats.
The knight is going to g6 where it can help in the fight for control of e5.
Interesting move that allows white to play Ne2 clearing the way for the DSB. White plans to exchange the strong black knight for his weaker one. While at the same time creating a weak pawn on d4 that is easy to attack.
Developing and anticipating to meet the knight exchange by playing Bxh2 creating a weakness of my own.
Now black has the great f4 outpost.
at first glance it looks like white will loss tempo against ...Nf4 but white can play for the exchange of queens and deny black the ability to castle. All of this is enough compensation for the threat of ....Nf4. However, black does get to create a further pawn structure weakness on d3. Which could prove difficult to defend if we end up in a rook+bishop endings.
defending b7 and limiting the influence of the white bishop. You always want to make sure that you have a firm control in the centre. Game are won and lost when players give up to much control in the center.
I plan to deflect that battle away from e5 and on to f6 where I am stronger. Placing the rook on f8 supporting f6 and deflecting my bishop to e7 will ensure I have equality.
another fantastic move that threatens to create a nice weak pawn on e6.
denying white the ability of his knight going to b4 in the event of an exchange on f6
forced but the black pawns on the queen side have potential to rip things wide open. Also to black's advantage is the pawn majority on the king side in the event that this becomes a two way horse race.
smart idea to get the king closer to the center
first real inaccuracy, though not a real game changer. For one it hinders the rook and add no real value to white. I wonder if Oddlord looked at 26. Ng4!? leading to further exchanges. Of course also worth looking at for white is stopping the queen pawn storm for good with 26. b4 when shifting everything to the king side and playing for a draw is inevitable.
denying white's main counterplay of Ng4 and gaining space on the kingside.
?! another small but important inaccuracy. I guess idea is to exchange and simplify but this give black two strong and mobile pawn chains.  I would have played 27. Bb4 rf7 28. d5 heading for d5 to liquidate an important strategic weakness
The idea is to stop the queen side pawn storm but black has a dagger up his sleave. Best to me is 28. Rxf6 gxf6 29. Then b4
!! Black seizes the initiative and with all of white's pieces on the back rank black may have time to convert his space advantage into a winning one
white looks ok by sealing the door on the queen side. However, if I can steer this game into a king+pawn ending I have strong wining chances. So I seek to exchange pieces then race to the center with my king.
?? the final nail in the coffin as exchanges benefit black not white. Also with black having retained his LSB the d3-pawn becomes near impossible to defend with a knight. I think the last chance for a draw is Rc3 but even after that white has to play precise chess.
racing to the centre
This move does two things. First it attacks the h5 pawn and allows the knight to go to e4 where it hopes to stop any advances of the king side pawns.
forcing the knight to e4 where I plan to trade it off for a easily won king+pawn ending. But strategically it prevents the knight from aiding in the king side defence
Moving closer to the center and bidding time.
with the king in the center and the extra pawn on the kingside this is a won endgame for black
I decided just to develop. Nf3 didn't seem the best cause it lets the black bishop to go on g4. So Bf4 seemed better.
That surprised me and scared me at the same time. It's surprising because for the first four moves black only plays with his pawns. So I'm much further in development. However, I thought that by attacking on d4, black would make me play e5 at some time. That would leave the f5 square for him.
I'm prety sure this is not a theory, but I still find the h4 move really precise. It's idea is playing early h5. It wouldbe badfor black's pawn structure, cause after me taking on g6 he would most certainly have to take with the f pawn. So the kingside would be easier to be attacked later. Usually there is a knight on f6, who prevents the h5 move. But now if black plays 5... Nf6 I'll play 6. e5 on the spot and still be able to play h5 in a while.
So that's the solution my opponent found. Of course I've seen it. I knew that later I would better attack h5 with g4. Now that isn't possible cause the c8 bishop keeps the g4 square. So my immediate plan is to block that c8 bishop.
Demanding the d5 pawn to be defended. If 7... Nf6 8. Be5 Bg7 9. Bxf6 Bxf6 10. Nxd5 Bxd4 and now I can take the d-line with castle wueenside or something, so I decided that such position is better for me. <n>The move that I didn't see, but now seems good for me is 7.... Be6
The the bishop is blocked. Now I can play g4 but I also noticed that the black squares of my opponent are weak.
Here I decided to sacrifice a pawn and count on good development and more equiped king-side.
Didn't want to exchange and lose my control on the black squares.
So now I had to defend my d4 pawn. I decided that Qe3 is the best, cause it prevents e5 and Nh6 at the same time.
If black had developed more, they could've get much better chances. I expected 14... Nf6 15. f3 Bd7 and me able to play g4 at some time. Now it happens even faster.
I have to admit that after Qxd4 my position is not the best. I guees I would've played 18. Qxd4 Nxd4 19. Rhe1 attacking on d5 and keeping the Bxg6 treat open.
That move was in a way needed cause I was treatening to play Bc7 and then attack his queen with my pawns, which would've lead to some problems for him. Qa5 also attacks my a2 pawn. I refused to return my knight on c3, cause I had just moved it.
Finaly he ends his development. Moves ahead I might start tinking about recapturing the h4 pawn and doing a nice king-side attack. The key moment here is that my pieces would more easily go to kingside and blacks bishop couldn't join the defence cause of the pawn structure.
Trying to fix the position there.
Now the pawn couldn't be promoted and there is nothing else to be done on the queen side. Black has to defend himself.
Qd8 and letting the pawn would have been better. It may lead to draw, but not now. The black King and rook are fixed and I have to manage to join other piece in the attack. One possibility was my rook moving as it followss to a1-a2-a1-h1-h8. It's long. There is another also that long plan. Moving my knight as it follows on g1-f3-h2-g4-f6. I decided thats stronger cause queen on d8 might help against rook on h8, but not that much against knight on f6.
Qd8 was still a possibility but then I at least take the bishop on b7.
My opponent surrendered. I guess he saw that After Rf7 I would take his rook and then manage to exchange the queens.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Found this old game to give me and Master Freddy's long-suffering opponents some inspiration.  I take my hat off to Pearl, the Class C player in this game and I am about to play through it to see how she managed to overcome The Master Mater who was an Expert at the time this game was played.  Freddy kicks off with the Reti Opening which is Nf3 - this move develops a piece and hits out at e5.
3. ....... d5 - black decided to counter in the centre.
6. Be2 - with such a lead in development I bet you are wondering, how on earth does black manage to pull off an Expert Victory?  Well, read on.
11. Bg5 - pin but it can be broken by Be7 and black plays it.
16. ...... Ne7 - the pawn on d5 was attacked twice and only defended by the BQ, therefore this move was necessary to protect the isolani on d4.  Be6, developing a piece fails to Qxb7.
19. Bxg4 - black trades her lsb for the knight on g4 to prevent her castled position being busted by Nxf6.  The move also clears the back row for black.  White has a terrific positional advantage though - it still seems inconceivable that he will end up on the losing side.
23. ....... Bb4 - now black tries some counterplay on the queenside but will it come off?
27. ...... Bxf2+ - there has been a plethora of exchanges and Pearl falls further behind in material but she is not gonna give up!
33. Rxb1 - Freddy is no doubt mighty glad to see the back of his Wicked Witch of the West, the BQ.
37. ..... Bg5 - black's dsb must take evasive action as Freddy's king marches to the centre of the board.
41. ...... Kg7 - Freddy might want to put his rook on f7 should the BR move off the seventh rank (black's second rank) with a nasty check - this move releases the BR for action elsewhere.
51. .... Kxd6 - at last the BK removes the pawn on d6.
52. ...... Ke5 - the BK moves over to assist the g6 pawn to march to promotion.  If Freddy's dsb tries to stop that pawn then K and R against bare K is enough to force checkmate.
? Pretty useless.  If he wanted the f-bishop to develop, why not e5?
Extra protection for the e-pawn, so the c-knight can move better.  Also allows the black squared bishop to develop.
unpinning the pin
best!... with the bishop! thanks
11.c3 is almost always played here. It allows the knight on a3 to get back into the game and also denies the Black knight access to d4 and b4. 11.Qd2 allows Black to improve the position of his bishop by attacking the queen: 11...Bg5.
Black decides to sacrifice a pawn to increase his lead in development.
Black has lost the plot. This pawn is not going anywhere and can be ignored. He needed to get his rooks into the game.
White wants early control of the center and has the initiative, so black concedes that for now. I thought giving up the the center early might be unexpected for my opponent. (Note: I've tried this strategy on 2000+ players and it NEVER works). The idea will be to attack the center from the flank later with force later. The DSB and the queen side knight will apply pressure on the d4 square, since the e file pawn has passed and can't defend. Black's DSB turns out to be pivotal to this game once it is in fianchetto position.
White confronts the black pawn on c5 which is undefended. The first instinct might be to defend. However, there are several reasons I decided to leave it undefended. (1) I need to stick to my strategy, (2) I already pushed g6 and weakened the future king-side castle, so I need to fianchetto, and (3) if white takes on c5, then my original goal of weakening white's center is accomplished, albeit at a material expense. A white pawn on c5 would be difficult to defend. I couldn't think of a good reason for defending the c5 pawn other than 1 point of material.
Following the plan to flank attack. Starting to apply pressure to d4. Analysis showed this as a black Inaccuracy and that I should have taken at d4. But the computer doesn't know my strategy.
White's LSB puts pressure on the weak f7 pawn and prepares for a future attack on the castle.
White needs to add a defender to d4. I think 6. Nf3 would have been better, but I'm not sure. This moves also solidifies white's intent to castle kind side.
I need to get the king side knight in play. However, if I need to ensure white cannot move to e5 and push my knight around, so I made this pawn move. This also opens up my bishop lines a bit. However, does allow white to pin my knight... we'll see.
so I put the knight in play. This has the temporary affect of reducing the tension on d4, but changes white's focus to the hanging pawn on e4.
During the game, this move struck me as a bit unusual. My first thought was white had overextended his pawns. I can't ignore the wall of white I'm facing, but they really aren't well supported. Post game analysis confirmed 9. f4 to be a mistake and the game turning point. The computer thinks the best move would be to defend d4 with the DSB.
pinned the defender and connected all the big guys! At this point, I was fairly certain I had this game. I really like the way everything connected up and was achieving my original goal of d4.
white attempts to remove the pin.. but I'm ahead in material, so...
take.. now white has to move the queen from defending d4 to handle the bishop.
I see the end now... I just need white to take the knight and we're done.
Check. White has successfully implemented a flank attack and now controls d4 with tempo. Look at how important the DSB has become. White has no counter attack potential on the black king and black has really taken center control. Note: If black takes d4 with the bishop instead of the queen, it sets up a potential pin opportunity for the white rook. The queen is much more adept here.
I thought about taking on b2 and offering a queen trade. However, this left e7 vulnerable and the white LSB still staring at my king. 16...e6 seemed like a good way to use the extra tempi.
still leaves the b2 pawn hanging and I was going to offer the exchange anyway. I don't like the fact that white owns the d file, but that doesn't really matter that much now. I notice the king is buried behind his pawns and see a potential tactical queen sacrifice if white doesn't choose the exchange.
offer the exchange.
b5 keeps the LSB bishop from interfering with the queen sac.
Rook to position, maybe white sees it now. If he moves his queen back, have to think of something else.
There's the queen sacrifice. I owe this one to my club (WoW)... we were just talking about queen sacrifices for advantage in a discussion list and started me thinking. <n><n>In the best case scenario for white, he loses the a7 rook. Worst case the game is over.<n><n>White chooses to resign. I would have liked to play this out, but white would have been seriously behind in material. <n><n>Thanks for the game shambobala and setting up this MT. I am looking forward to playing this tournament as white!
30...Nd4  This is my attempt to exchange a few pieces with the hope of pairing the rooks and the passed pawn against the queen.  It seemed to be a formidable threat, so that explains White's 32nd move.
It is important in this position for black to watch his first rank, since the white queen can always find a way to spring loose and checkmate the black king effortlessly.  That theme develops into a significant threat shortly.
The computer prefers for me to take the a-pawn 33...Rxa4, but 34. Qb3! looked too strong for me to counter all the threats.
42...Be5  I now had to calculate the moves precisely.  I could not afford to abandon the king's protection of the bishop, but that is precisely why the coming 43.h6+ is so effective.  And so I had to rescue the bishop first, knowing I would then have to send my King on a merry chase around the board.  Ironically, the following rain of checks against me gives me a chance to hide my king behind the bishop, just long enough to mount what will be the death blow to the white king.
44....Aligning the battering ram now against the white king.  Only giving up the white queen can stop it now.
and since he hasn't done so black can defend the pawn.
A good move by white attacking the white bishop and preparing for Nf5 and the more formidable Nb5 which would be hard to defend.
Fewer knights are easier to play against in such an open game and trying to reduce the defense of white's e pawn.
(-0.32)<n><n>At this point, I was trying to find a good home for my knight and kept thinking about c5, supported by my b and d pawns.  Not a good idea in retrospect...
(-1.61) MISTAKE - With that last move you went from roughly equal to having a worse position. Your best continuation was 16. Nb3<n>Alternative variation: [BEST MOVE (-0.44)] 16. Nb3 Rc8 17. Rc1 f6 18. exf6 Bxf6 19. Nc5 Qb6 20. Re1   $15<n>Alternative variation: [MISTAKE (-1.61)] 16. b4 a5 17. bxa5 Rxa5 18. a4 Qb6 19. Qb3   $19<n><n>I knew this was a mistake shortly after I made it, but there's no going back after this point.
I wanted to keep the strong pawn center and the queen - bishop attack on the h2 square thinking that White may decided to castle king side into my attacking pieces.
At this point I believe that White has actually weakened his king side and created some queenside weakness on the dark squares.This also gives me the bishop pair which I tend to enjoy.
This was a tough decision as I was worried about the knight outpost on C4 however taking the e-pawn would have destroyed my strong pawn center.
Here White castles into my king side attack, however I have to be very careful over how Black works those strong centered knights.  My first step of action is to reduce the strenght of these knights and continue to mobilize my pieces against the castled king.
This was a tough move for me to make.  The alternative was to capture with the bishop which might have resulted in trading off his knight for the bishop and then my pawn recapture.  This would remove both strong knights from the game and give me a strong center.  I decided to go this route as I wanted to maintain the bishop on the king side and even though the knight on c4 is storng it doesn't have enough support to launch an immedate attack.  The biggest drawback to this move is that I have cut off the queen from the bishop.
The primary goal behind this move is to open the ablity to castle queen side.  With the White's king now on h1 I am looking at options of openning the h file.
White is prepairing to trap the bishop.
White has created the net for the bishop so Black moves the bishop to the best square.
My trap is thrown and Black goes up a Queen and a pawn for a bishop and rook.
At this point, I believe that White has some strong opportunities if he attacks along the h file and seeks to bring a rook to Black back rank so I push my attack and better my pawns.
With the king side as locked up as possible I move to advance my queen and try to defend my weak e pawn as best I can.
Another move to strenghten my pawns before making some drastic moves.
The critical move in the game.  Black finds a way to crack the pawn structure and take advantage of the 32.Re2?.  Black goes up another pawn while clearing a strong white defender and creating a huge pawn weakness for White.
At this point it is hard to find good moves for White.  Black's goal is to clean up a few more pawns and then trade off the Queen for a Rook and start pushing pawns when it will be impossible for White to defend.
this isn't a great square for the knight, but it doesn't block the bishop.
I think this is best.   If 12.Bxb7, then 12...Nxe2+ 13.Kh1 Ra7
Black resigned here.    If 43...h3, then 44.Kf2 and Black can't defend his pawns.
this game was a 5m blitz so there was alot less time to think. it was also a test to see if i can remember my lines and not using the analyse function.   i guess a test to see if im actually learning lol
hmm not nf6 so i will decide to not aim for a d4 with a reply like nc3, and play d3  to get f4 in.
alright there is the nf6 but its ok experience serves i do not need to fear the d5 anymore
and so i can get it my f4
here comes the d5 usually id panic and be like damnit i got to start dancing my bishop. but now i stay calm and play properly
so i pin the knight to possibly invite a6 then play Ba4 to invite b5 and weaken the queen side pawn structure incase he wanted to queen side castle or i may also decide to double pawn him if the board looks good for it, also this seems more time efficient than going straight to b3.
i reply with pawn take to undermine his middle and now there is an opening for my DSB plus he cannot recapture this pawn and there is no current threat to my LSB,
retreats centrally to attack the e5 pawn
i found this reply to be really passive. protecting an isolated pawn. who can only be reconnected to a line with a pawn whos now behind 2 minor pieces. thought it was also pretty much putting his DSB to sleep for a few turns as  i had no intention of nxd4 yet id rather keep a high pawn even if he is doubled
and so i decide to attack the queen. and ill get a pawn for that pawn. as i had atleast planned he would take 1 more material with his death
i guess he was pretty cramped or he wanted to start coming down for a checkmate since i castled and the board is open above my king
so im able to grab that pawn immediately. and my bishop can sit there for a few turns near his king i thought this to be wise
and i had seen him starting to get ready to come for my king, since his LSB is behind his knight i only need to do 1 move
this will prevent the pawn from advancing and my opponent cannot checkmate with just queen and rook. so its a good time gain defense
and so i grab the new hanging pawn and gain time. i doubt he will offer queen exchange on f7
wanted to connect my rooks and bring my last piece to life didnt want to rush the attack since i dont get to analyse and i didnt want to make mistakes.
at this stage i thought a while i could see he would dive his bishop to h3 and all i have to do is play Rff2 and i will have enough cover over the g square for all 3 of his pieces. i think his crumbling empire has lost the strenght to deal the finishing blow
so i decide to grab more material and get it wide open in front of his king to prepare a checkmate
and so i decide to attack his last knight to ease the defense around his king
down 7 and still exchanges material my opponent ran out of answers i think. maybe na8 had more appeal applying double pressure to my DSB and i cannot move it
but still with the threat of capturing the pawn and covering the f5 square i had already planned to stack my rooks and i just need to push up on the king
hmm this move froze me a few moments. and i judged that im up 7 so ill let him take the knight with the queen and he will not have the time to replace his queen in front of his rook to mate me.
hmm unanticpated reply. but this one i liked i could now defend my knight and block his bishop
this is where i thought he would give up his queen to try to survive if not i dont know how he thought he would get to play again having 2 rooks queen and DSB around his king with nothing to block their paths
decided to try to dance.
I almost didn't make this final preparatory move to support squares e4 and e5.  Ultimately, all encounters that I could think of needed one more attacker on those squares, so I spent the time to do this.  I'm glad I did.<n><n>White has points for the advanced phalanx, superior development, and the bishop pair (since black has a bad LSB).  Black has an outpost at c4 and that's about it, putting White ahead by 2 (Point Count).
Mostly just being patient.  Adds some support to a possible future king side attack, continues to guard the QN against future attacks from the black queen, and is in a position to attack on the QR file should things develop in that direction.<n>The queen side is highly symmetric at the moment.  Figuring out how to break the tension so that it swings in one's favor (or at least even) is always a challenge.
Felt like I was flirting with disaster here (as confirmed by the computer analysis).  It might've just been my imagination, but Kf1 felt even more dangerous.  My main goal was to not get into a position where I would have to waste time defending mate threats and give up my passed pawn.
Defends the passed pawn and prepares to draw out the black LSB.
Defends against 32. ... Bf5 forking my knight and rook.  Defends the passed pawn in support of Bb7.
In a unrated game you can give your opponent a chance at winning with out effecting your rating or theirs, Game was accepted and white opened with the d4 opening. I opened as black with b5, with the plan to fianchetto my bishop on my Queen side.
Sticking to my plan
My bishop in position
advance pawn, This move opens the e4 square and now my bishop has a  better position
e6 is played and opens up my Queen and my other Bishop. I leave my pawn on b5 hanging, setting a trap to be taken by whites lsb. If taken the Bbxg2 attacking rook. This is important to note that when you take with your B on the home row you leave your Rook's adjacent pawn in-protected.
I relocate my R to the b-file.
B is relocated and to attack blacks Q.
N is moved to block the attack.
Q is moved to the a-file with possible attack to the h1 square if my B is moved  there
Nothing wrong with Petrov's. It can give good chances to both sides.
?! I do not like this move as it prevents his light squared bishop from going anywhere.
At this point I am okay with developing with only a pawn up because his king is in the middle of the board and I can make his pieces passive.
Black is going to have trouble castling now. 13. ... Ne7 14. Rad1
None of black's pieces can move except his bishop!
I can take my time to improve my position as black has no worthwhile moves to make. Although there was nothing wrong with 18. Rxe4 ...
?? Checkmate in 2. See if you can find it.
! 1-0. 20. ... Rxc7 21. Rd8#. Black must take the knight since he is in check. A nice and short game if you ask me but not particularly climactic.
Time to retreat
...but my opponent is wise to this.
I attack the king here...
I push the bishop forward, removing the pawn...
...but my opponent declines to take it...
...allowing me to take his...
...but have to put up some defence...
...and decide to create more space.
Now I contest the open d-file, as the king cannot move into it...
...and get the exchange I was looking for. Now with the rooks gone, things get really interesting...
I decide to take the knight, as the bishop can only cover black squares.
I give the king the runaround...
...and again, splitting him and the bishop.
Since white was kind enough to deploy his knight all the way to the side of the board, I'm willing to keep it there.
And now white's queen is on the edge of the board too, and fairly well bottled up by black's pawns.
I could have taken the pawn at a2, but that would leave my knight with no safe retreat and tie my queen down to guard duty. So I put him in place to be a thorn in white's side til the end of the game.
Time to play with the rook, give him something to do. Like eat pawns...
Now a sneaky plan falls into place. I had to move or protect the bishop (or just trade pawns, but I had an inkling of a sneaky discovered pin.
fianchetto comming which i like to play with white DSB, so i knew i should try to trade it soon
decided to look for trouble with the b knight still stabled
i could see my oponnent was starting to put pressure on his position by cramping it
get rex to the ladies loo
Here again i had to look at it hard...
keeping the pressure up
7. ...... 0-0 - for once I feel confident about putting Henry away on the kingside.  Freddy, strangely enough, does not think about an h4 pawn push which he lurves doing sometimes.
9. 0-0 - Freddy also hides his king on the kingside.
20. Qc4 - sure enough, the Wicked Witch of the West moves to the c column.
21. ...... Qd7 - after Freddy's rook lift which could spell a kingside mating attack, Glenda prepares to move over to the kingside to protect Henry.
22. ..... g5 - the first action of Operation Joblock.  A pawn advances to close up my position.
28. ..... Rg7 - in the chat I said to Freddy that in putting my rook in front of Henry on g7 that rook was also looking at his king.  If Freddy was now to advance his pawns he would risk exposing his own king to an attack.
39. ..... Kf8 - a lot of piece shuffling has been going on over the last few moves, now the two kings get in the mood!
52. ....... Rb7 - the shuffle continues.
54. Rh2 - declines the trade, I think he wants to try and keep the two rooks on if he can because two rooks can do a lotta damage on a rank or a file.
56. ..... Bd8 - again I must attend to the weak backward c7 pawn.
58. ....... Rxg5 - a pawn is a pawn and I decided to take with the rook because I did not want Freddy to get a passer on the f column.
62. Rch2 - ahha, a doubling on the h column, but Henry and my KR have the h7 pawn adequately covered and Fou Lenoir and my QR still have some free squares to move to to avoid a zugzwang.
64. ..... Kf7 - because the enemy dsb cuts communication between the two rooks, Henry can move to f7 to defend f6.  In the ensuing endgame, Henry is gonna be a right pain in the you know where for Freddy, teeheehee!
66. b4 - another pawn sac, this time a temporary one to open up some lines of attack for Freddy's rooks.
72. ...... Rxb5.  In the chat, I said this to Master Freddy. "Hi Freddy, I just hope I haven't taken 3 days to make a blunder - that usually happens against you. I did give the exchange a lot of thought and I am aware that it will open up the a column for your rook, but on the other hand my pawn structure will remain intact after you recapture. If I allowed you to take the rook then that would have left me with an isolani on the a column and you would have had a passed a pawn. Therefore I thought that the rook exchange was the better option. I feel that Henry and Fou Lenoir can hold the fort on the queenside should your rook decide to come down the a column. Hence the second draw offer."
74. ..... Kb7 - Henry moves to b7 to stop a rook incursion.
77. .... Kc8 - a rook trade is on the cards so Henry decides to move back to the kingside to stop his counterpart invading there.
79. Kxg2 - the trade does take place and so Henry races back to the kingside.  The queenside is completely locked so I feel confident of the final outcome here!  Big words against an opponent like the Master Mater.
81. ...... Kf7 - Henry will certainly stop the enemy king in his tracks.
83. ...... Be7  - with this move I said the following to Freddy in the chat - Can you now see a way through the Joblock?! Fou Lenoir can still move about so I do not see you giving me a zugzwang here!<n>easy19: it is not the joblock it just have the wrong bishop and i am out of options jstevens1: So, it looks like a draw after all!<n>easy19: yep it is now make it a 3 fold it would be well deserved<n><n>I did try and do just that, only I forgot to tick the check box, but at the second attempt I did do it and the game was drawn.  This is only my second draw against Master strength opposition.  Do not knock the Joblock my friends, note that Freddy had to sac material to risk losing to try and avoid conceding a Low Draw.  One day an Expert such as Coach Ion may well over-reach himself in this way and pay the full penalty!  For now, I will just enjoy this result and then look to regain my Class A status.  Have a good read - bye for now - Joanne
2........ f6?! (This is the Damiano's Defence) - I call it Dodgy Damiano's!  It's dodgy because it opens up the Fool's Mate Diagonal (h5-e8) and blocks in the king knight.
3. Nxe5 - I decide to play Damiano's Gambit.  It is quite sound because if fe?? then I will play 4. Qh5  which will lead to mate or ruinous loss of material for black.  Just play out the database and you will see!!
8. ...... Nd7 - sandwiched between 2 pawn moves black develops his king bishop and queen knight and I complete my development with 9. Be3.
11. ......... h5 - a kingside pawn storm which goes no further.  For now I go on the defensive and black is lulled into a false sense of security and prepares queenside castling.
17. ........ The black queen is tempted by the hanging pawn on b4, but she is playing right into my hands because she can be easily driven back by 18. Rb1 which is just where I wanted to place my king rook!  More importantly it opens up the b file.
24. ..... Ka7 - if he moves his king to a8 then Ba7 is double check and MATE!!!
25. d5   my opponent threw in the sponge here as he will have to give up his queen and rook to escape the immediate clutches of Old Matey.  I am very pleased with this mating attack as I am normally a very passive player.  I really do need to develop this aspect of chess as I do tend to make heavy weather of converting material or positional advantages.
Presumably so as not to block the long diagonal.
In preparation for an advance of the KBP.
Tucking the King away before the K-side advance.
I assume this was to guard against a potential move of N-N5.
Securing the KP.
Allowing White to open the KB file, and thus a mistake.
The King-hunt begins now.
I have a plan and this is when it came about.  Potential checkmate soon.
Moving on to my favorite, the Queen's Gambit
Slav Defense, my least favorite defense to play against after 2. c4. This is the most popular response for Black next to 2...e6
This is where I had my first think of the game. Black's goal is to capture the knight on f3 and damage White's pawn structure. If I take with the e-pawn, my d-pawn is now isolated. Taking with the g-pawn is an option but it would be harmful if White were to castle Kingside.<n><n>However, this isn't the strongest move in this position
Also possible is 11. Nd2, planning 12. f3 to drive the bishop away but that move is much more passive. This is the most natural way of blocking the check.
I sat on this one for about 8 minutes. I was looking at the possible benefits and consequences of 12. gxf3 Bxd2+ 13. Kxd2. White has a damaged pawn structure and a king in the center but also now has the two Bishops and more open lines for his pieces. In the end, I decided to go the safe route
Moving the Bishop away and keeping pressure on g2
The best move. This allows White to develop the Bishop without having to worry about 14... Bxg2
White slowly puts pressure on the Bishop. It know is pinned to the King and the Queen
? I feel that this move lets Black off a little bit. Sure the Queen will be able to move out of the pin but now 16. Bxc6+ bxc6 would give Black a weaker pawn structure on the Queenside.
Black's Queen escapes from the Rook on c1 and White will eventually have to move the Bishop on b5.
I think this is also a mistake. White relieves all the pressure in the position and allows Black to obtain an equal position (minus the slight pawn disadvantage, which I don't feel matters as much right now)
White does not want to take back on c6, giving the Black Queen control of the file for the time being. This also brings up the possibility of moving the other rook to c1
I know this game is going to reach an endgame so I need to open a space for my king to start getting active
Black also opens up a space for his king but I like f6 better. The king needs to be towards the center!
Another exchange
Black now threatens the pawn on a2 and a possible infiltration on d1.
Relieving the rook of the duties of protecting the pawn on b2
White offers a trade of rooks, which would magnify the pawn advantage. When ahead in material, try to trade pieces!
Defending against a possible pawn push to d5.
Trying to prevent an advance to f5
Trying the rook trade but this also gives White a better rook than Black. This rook prevents possible counterplay on f5 and allows White to push to d5 whenever he pleases.
Hi everyone, and again, welcome to gameknot, Amy!<n><n>During my break-time at work, a colleague of mine called Beverley mentioned that her daughter, Amy was learning how to play chess and had been taking part in some OTB junior tournaments.  I recommended gameknot to Beverley and she told Amy about it.  Amy logged on as snowbun and I challenged her to an unrated game to have some idea about what strength she was at.  So, she had her gameknot baptism with me.  She left a piece en prise very early on but played reasonably well after that.  Unfortunately for her I exchanged down so that she had no counterplay whatsoever and my extra piece made itself felt.  I increased my material advantage until she help-mated on move 37.  Gameknot analysis is on the following link:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15060312&rnd=0.6693379831140849.
1. ..... e6 - Amy decided to try the French Defense.
6. ...... Nc4?? - Amy walks her knight straight into the path of Fou Leblanc who reads the last rites to it.  Not only am I a clear piece up but am ahead in development.  6...... b6 would have prevented the loss of the knight.
9. Nc3 - Amy has managed to catch up a bit in development but still needs to develop her light square bishop.
11. Bg5 - when material up, trade pieces not pawns.  If you are a piece up you certainly do not want to exchange pawns because a king and minor piece cannot checkmate a bare king in the endgame.
15. ...... Bb7 - Amy stops the mate by developing her bishop and putting pressure on my d5 pawn which is virtually an isolani because I cannot move up my c2 pawn which is blocked by my knight and Fou Leblanc.
16. h3 - this move creates some air (luft) for my King, Henry and drives back the black knight on g4.
27. ...... Rc8?? - Kg7 would have avoided the carnage to come.
28. Ne6+ - my rampant steed will collect that black lsb on a6.  Seems incredible does it not?  the knight is a long way from the bishop but the BK must walk into a discovered check wherever he goes, either from my rook on e3 or Fou Leblanc on b3.  Now watch!
29. Nc7+ - there it is!  Discovered checks are vicious things.  Even though the square c7 is attacked by the c8 rook the knight cannot be taken as the BK is in check to Fou Leblanc on b3.  So, dearly beloved brethren, that is how the black light squared bishop falls.
32. Nb4 - I still cannot get a checkmate, so I concentrate on trying to improve the position of my pieces.
35. Ne4 - Amy told me in the chat that she thought I was threatening Nc5 followed by Nd7# after this move.  I thought that Nf6 looked good.  Well done for spotting that one, Amy!  I then sent her the following analysis:- You must now play 35.  Rd8 to prevent Nd7#.  In response to that she played Ra8.  So I sent her this analysis:- 37. Nxd8 Kxe7 38. Nc6+ Kd6 39. Bg2 Kxc5 - that leaves you two pieces down in the endgame.
the swap.. the almighty swap!!
As of this point, I started to almost dislike the game, since my chances are failing.
putting some pressure on the horses.
just to build up the heat. The bishop at c5 is covered by Ne4�Bc5, Re8�Ne2 (covered by Bg4).
My opponent starts off with the King's pawn opening. At this point, I decided to play an unusual, but well-known opening.
Since my opponent wasn't doing anything much to my Knight (such as pinning the Knight to the King), I decided to strike back at his Bishop, an unnecessary idea.
Aftre this, I chose not to chase the bishop any further, but I am setting myself up to win one of his two pieces.
I prepare in advance the old-fashion Kingside mate. Unfortunately, I started to worry about my opponent's attack.
I couldn't decide which piece to take the Bishop with, the Knight or the Queen.
This is another key detail about this game. My opponent created light square weaknesses that 1) he can't cover with his Bishop; 2) it is almost impossible for his Queen to cover these weaknesses in time.
Another useless pin, but I overreact to it.
According to the pawn chain, White should attack Black's Kingside and Black should attack White's Queenside. This means that White is attacking the wrong side of the board.
Instead of directing the Knight to the edge of the board, White should have done 15.Nd2.
I attempt to attack his Knight.
I think I overreacted to this threat.
I have an idea to take the Knight.
White lost the Knight. If 21.Qa3 to guard it, 21...Be7 forces it away. Also, the Knight can try moving away, but it won't work. "A Knight on the rim is grim," as they say.
I definetely tried to get rid of the Queen (or chase it away).
With this, White chose to give up his b-pawn.
I rushed to my Bishop's aid using the King. It's the endgame, right?
Now, I can attack my opponent's light square weaknesses.
and one of my earlier games has also cast aspersions on this move... In this position it seems slightly more sensible than in other Ruy Lopez positions, as Black is probably planning ... c6 followed by ...Bc7
creating space for the other bishop to develop
allowing myself to swap on e3 if the N follows through and then possibly return the favour on c5
? ignoring the threat to my R
looking to exploit my meagre assets with a quick counter-attack while Black's K is still in the middle
?! bizarrely, Black gives up his advantage.  Admittedly 18...Qxe5 19. Re2 wouldn't have been too bright but this seems to give up the advantage to easily.  18...Qxb2 or 18....Qd8 would have held on to Black's advantage, though 19. e6 would then have been interesting.
Either Black takes the pawn and exposes himself to White's Q or he leaves it alone and it forms a thorn in his side.
Black chooses the latter course.
This comes from my early games in the lower rating department. It ends in a hidden mate theme, with a nice Queen sac...
these are the kind of breaks, black is looking for... already, black had the advantage of d5, exd5, exd5, Bb3, and Nc6 or whatever... black is gaining the initiative here; best for white was d4, cxd4, etcetera... now after Ne7 and d5, black is better...
white had to make some tough decisions along the way; black has total control...
there is no point in denying, this is the final flaw after a couple of unfortunate choices... much needed here, was at least h5, Bg4, hxg6, to create some counterplay...
better Qd1, Bg4, Rf1... apart from the fact, Ne2 has no place to go - apart maybe from Nf4 - black now has always Qxe4+...
? This is where black starts to go wrong - I prefer Nf6, attacking the undefended e-pawn. Perhaps he was thinking about attacking down the kingside.
?! Again, I prefer Nf6 or Nc6 or even Bg5 - this odd queen move blocks in the bishop and leaves a chance of a pin on the diagonal.
! I give this move an exclamation since it ties the queen down to defending c7.
And Nxc7! - winning a pawn and queen for the bishop - a lovely tactic: I came across this in 'Chess Tactics for kids' and it is rather good. And a rather good family fork.
And the knight chomps away the queen.
I take the pawn, and the pawn can't take back since it is pinned.
Note if Bxd6 then e5! wins the bishop.
The king retreats - probably the safest move.
So I take the bishop.
This leaves the knight undefended - I could have gobbled it up, but I was more focused on a mate.
I think this move was just to save the knight, but this annoyingly prevents mate, since the king as d8 as a flight square -
An outright blunder - first of all, the pawn could take it, and, though I am not criticising my opponent, this falls for Nc7#. Which I gladly played.
The Marshall Attack!
Hmm? I remember I didn't take the bishop, because I was afraid that Qg5 would just win it back with advantage, but Ne5 seems to be a sufficient rescue.
The rook at a1 is in danger after 21.Qf3 Rg8+ 22.Kf1 Bh2 (23.Re1 Rg1 mate!), so I plan to move my bishop to g2 to prevent this.
The rook can get behind enemy lines with Rg1+, but it cannot do much damage without support.
I need a place to hide my king. I am worried about perpetual checks after opening the position.
I move my knight to fill the hole in my line, control the center of the board, and open the way for castling.
Castle! My king is in his castle. My rook is in danger from your bishop c8 though.
..but I suck, I confused the king and queen, so thought it wouldn't work and advanced my other bishop instead. More firepower aimed at the center of the board, and your other rook.
Pawn clearing the way for my rook to charge in..
This move blocks off the black bishop's activity completely, and leaves me with a very strong central pawn.
With black's pawn on e6 missing, a future P-f5 seems like the best and most obvious plan for white.
This was probably a mistake, since black's king will fall under heavy attack on the kingside.
Advancing on the queenside. Notice that black has virtually no counterplay because of my strong,supported e5 pawn.
I want to play P-g4, but it is first necessary to prevent the knight from moving to h4.
The king is forced to return. Now, the g-file seems promising, but it will take some time to fully exploit. Another idea is P-f6, but the problem is that black's knight returns to g6 and my attack is ruined. So I choose...
Sacrificing the pawn, to keep the momentum and open the f-file for the rook. Retreating with the king will lead to P-f7, which should eventually win for white. So black takes the pawn, but the end is even quicker.
Now, both the bishop and rook are in play!
24. ... Kxe6 leads to 25. Nc5+  (here is where the knight comes in!) Kd6 26. Rf6#. But this move also loses. Notice how the black pieces are passively watching on, while the black king is struggling beneath the white pieces.
Now, white will checkmate the black king with Qxh7# next move. So, black resigned. 1-0<n>An effective game that shows the progression from a positional advantage to a mating sacrifice.
Hi everyone - nice just to write about a win for a change.  I was playing against a guy called Andy who had a similar rating to myself.  Andy played very well but somehow I managed to get a rook onto his second rank and that piggish rook made slop of one of his pawns and eventually more and more material dropped, until I was able to crown my a pawn.  Andy resigned on the grounds of ruinous loss of material but Freddy, who looked at this game said I had a mate in 3 - more on that later.  Anyhow - I face the Sicilian and I play an unusual 3rd move, Bc4 instead of the standard pawn exchange on d4.
11. Be3 - the wood now starts to come off the back row.
13. d4 - a pawn break - will this be to my advantage?  I analyse it and it looked good at the end so I decided to go for it.
19. Ng3 - eyeing up a knight outpost on f5 or h5, preferably f5 because Glenda may want to bag h5 so that she can get close to the enemy king!
20. Rc7 - after black's plausible Bb7 putting pressure on e4 I decide to take the opportunity to invade the 7th rank with my rook.  This is called a "Bone in the throat", hence the title of this game.  With my opponent it really does choke him!
23. Rxa7 - the Bone in the throat then the pin on the d7 knight has finally reaped results - I have won a pawn on a7 and black's b pawn is very weak.  Can I capitalise further?
26. Qh5 - that plethora of exchanges has not helped black very much.  Now his lsb is pinned and he remains a pawn down.  Now Glenda moves to h5 and I try a mating attack.
30. Bxb6 - the mating attack does not materialise but I was quite happy to exchange queens and my knight for his dsb because I was a pawn up.  Now I increase my material advantage and I have two lovely passers on a2 and b2.  I now try and push them up the board - my next move is 31. b4.
31. Ng4 - more ebony is about to drop off.  Black defends his e pawn but I am still able to snap off the h6 pawn with check - as his king is confined to the edge of the board he will not be able to attack my knight after the capture, so I will be able to take on h6 and then move Fou Lenoir out of the black rook's path.
43. a6 - closer and closer to Glendadom does my white pawn move.  However, I feel very cold all of a sudden, see a dark shadow and something stinks - what could that be but Old Matey!  Yes, even with 4 points up in material and with a passer certain to crown I could end up being crowned if I am not careful.  For if the h pawn goes Henry could be vulnerable to a corridor mate along the h file.  His horsie will go to e2 and his bishop to f1 cutting off Henry's escape.
47. Rh8  - but Andy is not going to have Henry, that is King Freddy's priviledge! spectacularly foiled by this check.  The black king can take my rook but will fall to a knight fork from Henry's steed when he moves to f7 giving check.  Nothing can stop Her Glendaness now!
50. a8/Q - A teriffic fanfare greets the arrival of Glenda.  Black now resigns on the grounds of ruinous loss of material, but guess what ........ King Freddy spotted a mate in 3 and got me to check it out.  I did and I may make a puzzle of it so watch this space!!
So this was another in my series of matches with the lovely penelope80
I prepare to support my knight with Ng-e7.
She continues to develop.
I hit the bishop.
As the f8-a3 diagonal is blocked, it seems to make sense to develop my bishop to g7.
I decide to try to interrupt her plan.
Hitting the bishop.
Counter-attacking my rook. I break from Lehner, Oliver (2420) vs. Teske, Henrik (2475) where Bxc3 was played. I thought it seemed a bad idea to give up the wonderful bishop on g7.
Attacking the Bc5, and trying to cover up some of those horrible dark-squared holes on the queen side.
So she has to take the rooks off.
Knight comes in to support it.
Attacking bishop and pawn. She can't save both with Bb1 as then I have Ne2+ winning her rook.
lets pick another piece and keep his king open
putting my bishop save... dont want it exchanged yet. not ready to att the king
thank u! now i can push u further get the other horse
and now the queen to finish the job <n>mate in 2<n>or 1 black king moves to e5 then queen d5 checkmate<n>or 2 his pawn d6-d5 then queen xd5 checkmate no more escapes
I believe that this move is unnecessary and passive now. It can be played later. Probably after c5 from black. The white should start building pawn structure on the king's field.<n>{Bc3 is indeed a bad move, since it allows Qf4  followed by Qg4. Over the board, I estimated the danger of that maneuver lower than that of the pawn breaks against the white center.}<n>16...Qf4  17. Ned2 Qg4 18. Rh4 Qf5 (of course 18... Q:g2 doesn't not work at all) 19. Q:f5 e:f and white get a much better pawns position.
Should be Qe2<n>{Nonsense. There was no reason to give away a tempo.}
Here I am a little bit lost.<n>{This is a typical position for the Caro-Kann. White has a miniscule space advantage but it is hard for either side to find a coherent plan.}
I would prefer pawns position like f3-g4-h5, but it's about a style<n>{The pawn-formation f3-g4-h5 is the usual, positional way to play against the Caro-Kann, aiming to win the endgame through superiorn pawn formation. However, Black just keeps the pieces on the board and the positon closed. 21. f4 aims to increase the space advantage further to achieve a decisive pawn break later.}
{This move is a positional error. It allows white to play Ba5, forcing an exchange of bishops. With his passive Bishop gone, the king-side advance would have significantly better prospects.} <n>I am not sure about is this a positional error. I can not say the black bishop is better than the white one. Actually in my after game analysis i found out that in Timoshenko - Danilov game in 2000 the black made this move and the white did not tried to exchange the bishops.
During the game I wrote here a comment to myself that I have no idea what to play and I decided to play slowly without any pawn movements just wait and see what my opponent will do. But probably here the best move should be preparation for c5 like Kb1 or may be c5 at once<n>{Misses the chance to correct the previous error with Bc7 or Rg8.}
Obviously bad combination<n>{A plain silly move. I am reasonably sure, most of blacks win in the Caro-Kann stem from white players becoming impatient and ruining their position without need. Bxc7 would have been enough for wh�te to gain some play. As a matter of fact, I can't even say what exactly I missed. Somehow, I was under the impression, I would have the time for d5.}
Q:f4 is also good, but I decided to make the board simple<n>{Q:f4 would have been decisive. White needs to retreat the bishop and after that, the black king just strolls to the kingside casually.}
{That's what I calculated as worst-case-scenario. I figured, it should be esy enough to remove the kingside pawns to achieve at least a draw.}
At that part of the game for me the plan for white should be to push the queen's pawns as far as it possible and so my plan was to prevent that. So I continue to attack the a pawn<n>{My engine suggests 32. Nf6 instead, but I find f5 more convincing. Keeping the position closed just increases the potence of the knight and the white queenside pawns are no danger. If I hadn't given away material earlier, this move would produce tactical possibilities for an exchange sacrifice. But with a minor piece up, keeping the positon closed with mutual positional weaknesses is just the way to go.}
I am trying to bring my Knight into the center
{The engine likes that move, but the centralisation of the black pieces is not enough to generate winning chances. I'd prefer to coordinate the black rooks, starting with Ra6, keeping an eye on the weakness e6}
Again here I believe the plan for white should be pushing the queen's pawns. So the rooks must prevent h5 and a3<n>{Pushing the queenside pawns would most likely lose them. Re5 wins a tempo, occupies a good square and prepares play agains the e6/f5 pawns.}
{Too impatient. With the rook on e5, the black weaknesses needed attention first.}
{After this, the game is plain lost. The last moves just prolong the game a bit to lose it in a more favourable time for league calculations.}
NxPb6 looks better.  Bishop and pawn for the knight.
Better to move the king.  Re1# ends the game.
Re1# is the way to go.
need to do something kingside
This internal league game between Gertjan Van der Hoeven and Rob Witt was played at the Dutch Club, Caissa, and was sent to me recently in relation to the opening. Some of the club's players are familiar with and have tested the opening in club matches. This particular one is a feast of tactical devices and is well worth studying. With the exception of the analysis to White's 16th move, the notes are extracted from the game's annotation by Rob Witt.
A natural enough move; but in fact it is incorrect. As Rob Witt points out; also not so hot for Black is 15...Qg4 [trying to simplify with the trade of queens] 16.Bxh7+ Kxh7 17.Bxf6 Qxg3 18.hxg3+ and White is quite happy with the resulting position. <n>Best is 15...Ne4!
This is also a mistake - although the intention is good. I believe White has an excellent move here in the unlikely-looking 16.c4! But why on earth this move - which only seems to open up White's own king position and attract ideas of ...Rac8 for Black? The answer is partly based upon the observation that if Black captures the pawn on c4 then his queen will be cut off from the fourth rank and king-side. The other part of the answer is the tactical proof: Thus, for example, after 16.c4 dxc4? 17.Bxf6 Rxf6 18.Bc2 and Black is suddenly lost. <n>Similarly, 16.c4 rules out 16...Ne4? which now fails for tactical reasons because the bishop on d7 is unprotected after 17.Bxe4 dxe4 18.Rxd7 and there is no time for to take the f3 knight because of mating threats against g7. Meanwhile, 18...Qxc4 is no more than a spite check in a lost position.<n>Finally, 16...Rac8 Ng5 leads to some very interesting possibilities. Preliminary analysis suggests that after 16.c4!? Rf7 may in fact be the best answer - but still leads to a sustained attack by White.
Relying on the fact that the knight is pinned to the queen. But it is another slight error: As Witt points out in his game notes; relatively best here was 17.Bxe4 Qxe4 - although this would leave black quite happy with the position.<n>But in fact Black has an excellent move here which he pointed out after the game: 17...Nb4! After 18.Kb1 Nxd3 19.cxd3 Rxf3! leads to major simplifications when Black should win.
Again - Black needs to watch his queen: If 19...hxg5?? 20.Nf6 and 'goodbye' to the queen.
Blow for blow. Not only does this stop the discovered attacks on Black's queen; but it leaves the c-file half open and even sets up possibilities arising out of ...Ne2+ and ...Nc3+ - splitting the pawn shell in front of the White king. Not bad for a single move.
Not to be outdone - White presses on regardless with his own threats.
This is the alternative to the check on d5
At this point black is two pieces up but White has the initiative. It is very unfortunate that Black is just about to make a terrible blunder. He explains that it was not even an impulsive move; but played after a few minutes thought - a complete 'black-out'. <n>Under normal circumstances, Black would have played the forced 27...Qg6 and after 28.Qxe5+ there are two possible continuations: [A] 28...Bf5 [probably weakest] although after 29.Qxd4 Kh6 matters are still unclear because of White's many pawns.<n>[B] 28...Nf5 [best I think] 29.g4 Qa6!? [Fritz] and who can be sure how this game would have ended.
Black resigns. <n>Nominally speaking, he has sufficient material for the queen. But his luck has entirely deserted him: Having just made a terrible blunder he then also finds that his pieces are too scattered to survive in this position.
Trying to gain control of the middle board
Truthfully, this was a big mistake on my part. He could have easily taken my pawn.
In any case, I move my pawn to gain some semblance of control.
I want to see if I can force him to relinquish control of the middle board. Right now, he basically controls the fifth row.
If he had made this move earlier, he might have forced me to use my pawn on b7 to retaliate... but now I take it with the bishop.
Why not take his piece? Not much else to do around here.
Trying to get my knight out of there...
...but he pins it again, and I must change my strategy.
...and I respond in kind.
This was not the best move to make. While it does directly threaten my queen, it is also the move that gives me control over the rest of the game. Notice how his queen does not move after this, and I go from responding to his moves to making offensive plays.
Now he has to respond to my moves, instead.
He leaves another of his pawns unprotected, so I take it. After I made this move, he resigned. <n>A good way for white to make a comeback of sorts from here on out is to reactivate the queen. If this were me, I'd move the queen back to d3. This both protects the rook and forces black out. Then either you exchange queens (black does Qxd3, and rook takes the black queen) or else black moves the queen somewhere else and white regains control.
black chooses to play his pawn. Why noty his Knight to e7? rRule 1: play your knights first. Rule 2: Be careful about making pawn moves, especially at the bebginning of the game. This pawn move would latyer on in the game put Black King in a dangerous position.
Bishop going back to f1, Black loses tempo. Black should have prepared to castle on that side instead. Bishop needed to take the Knight
Knight to h6!! I think Black knight needed to be on e7.
white needs to keep the pressure on....
A lazy reply to the English.  The subsequent forcing sequence will leave black behind in development.
Kitrich played the seemingly timid 5.d3 as against the bolder 5.d4.  It is clear white will fianchetto his light-squared bishop.
Predictable play from black.  The pin has no practical implications.
With 8...0-0, and blacks lack of the dark-squared bishop, the first implications of white's icy attack may be discerned.
The possibility of an attack along the long diagonal is now apparent.
Kitrich considers this move to be "unappealing" and "quite beside the point".
Seemingly preparing b5, but is black better off with 13...e5, solving the problem of the d7 bishop?
White's class begins to announce itself.  Obvious threats of Qc3, followed by an effort to reduce black's f6 knight.
White's class excels itself.  The implications of Rfc1 are too subtle to be discerned at this point, but the move will prove crucial in the ensuing continuation.
Finally, what can be called "counterplay" emerges from black.  After the white knight is evicted, black can look forward to winning the exchange with Nb3.
Black is winning the exchange, but his materialistic approach is the antithesis of class, and will prove to be his undoing.
White's battery is assembled.  However, he will have to dislodge the f6 knight, and find the g7 square undefended.  Question: does black have anything with Nd4, leading to a discovered attack upon the white queen?
Black's counterplay was calculated by Kitrich to be "anemic and lagging".
The class may begin to make one blush.
Superior to 23. Ba1, where black could return the exchange, and take the polar sting out of white's attack.
This move of black's sets the stage for a continuation devastating in its coldness, as the north wind lays waste the garden.
Question: can black hold the position if 27...Kh8?
Where the pin on f6 proves decisive.
Said Kitrich, "The strategy of the game was straightforward, but I put myself through a few contortions to press home that battery.  The mate was satisfying, but as always, I knew there were times when black could have wriggled out."
well I don't want to be forced to strike back with the g-pawn so I move my pawn to d5 to prevent it from being taken.
well I didn't expect this trade so soon, but my queen is now active and I'll leave it standing here untill I find the need to move it again.<n>It is in no danger of being attacked on the first 3 moves.
hmmm his knight left the back squares leaving the field c6 undefended. I can win a pawn if black moves as I hope.
planning to play Bg5, but not certain if this is such a good idea.
I need to defend c2 but I don't want to move my queen away from the f-line.
after this move black never got a chance to avoid checkmate.
check with both my knight and my bisschop so he has to move his king.
and another check in the sequence leading to checkmate.
black probably thought that I would move my knight to f5 again.
I took his pawn at f7 with check, black has only 1 move remaining: Kd6.<n>after which I planned to move my knight to f5 with checkmate.
After seeing 1...Nc6, I decided to steer the game into a Ruy Lopez.
Lasker would never play 4...Bd6, as he would say it does the "work" of immobilizing the d7 pawn, the c8 bishop, and the a8 rook.  Black's lack of mobility in this game, due primarily to this "stuck" move, cost him the game in the end.
Rather than keeping tension in the center, I decided to gain a central space advantage, since it is one of the infamous 3 S's in the Chinese school of chess opening principles--space, structure, and strategy--as per Liu Wenzhe's marvelous book entitled, "The Chinese School of Chess: The unique approach, training methods, and secrets."
Having control of the center due to the overprotection of d5 and e4, I decided to commence operations on the queenside...
Protecting the f-pawn, but it immobilizes the queen and weakens the kingside pawn structure with holes now at g6, f5, and h5.  Black is therefore weak on the light squares on his kingside, and White need not fear a kingside attack, so he continues queenside operations...
Notice too how many times this knight has moved in the game, and now it is gone, replaced by the bishop which repeats its lazy leitmotif of immobilization and obstruction...
Now that Black's queenside rook and bishop are tied to the defense of White's a-pawn, White knows he can eventually stage a breakthrough on the kingside, primarily due to a much greater advantage in mobility and a larger number of forces which can take part in the battle of that sector...
Fixing the h5 pawn, and preparing eventually to continue on the kingside via f3 and g4.  The pawns on f2, g3, and h4 remind me of a common motif in the King's Indian Attack...
Here, I felt it time to begin breaking open the kingside, since the queenside and center are still under White's control, thereby preventing a successful counterattack...
This move leads to a passed pawn on the kingside rook file in addition to the one already on the queenside rook file.  Also, Black loses a valuable kingside defender (his one active rook) and now has to find some way to defend the kingside front as well as the queenside--with highly immobile, fixed, and obstructed forces.  It turns out to be too many holes to have to plug in the sinking ship.
If 58...Qh4 then 59.Qf2 Qxe4+ 60.Qf3 prevents further efficacious counterplay and safeguards the eventual win.  Black's general has had enough and surrenders.
The point of this game is to give you some lessons in end game. if you want to improve your end game i suggest looking through this game and see how i won as white. I made a many mistakes in the opening and middle game but the end game is a place where i can win with my theories. How ever i am not a pro in end game so i could have missed some moves and if you see a better way for white to play,please comment because i'd love to learn new stuff as well.
Kf2. The point of this move is to centralize the king. In the opening and middle game you want your king to be as protected as possible but in the end game the king is an important active attacker. The best thing to do with the king in the end game is to centralize it I.E. putting it as close to the center as possible. Having a centralized king can be the difference between a winning game and a loosing game. From the center the king can go fastest to any side of the board where action is taken and having the center makes it more difficult for black.
a wrong move. I would suggest for black to compete in the centralization competition with Kc6. Now he basically gives up the center for my king.
Moving further to the center
Well this looks good for white. his king is more centralized than black's king and it is a strong blockader of the passed pawn on d5. Yes,blockading a passed pawn could be considered passive but black will need to defend the passed pawn somehow and since it's isolated,his king will also be passive.
well the point of that move is just to move a piece away from the light squares, you see, now that i have a light squared bishop moving away everything from the light squares is good because now my bishop can't attack the piece, that's why the passed pawn on d5 would be better of on d6 or d4.
g4. In the end game you'd want to get a passed pawn. Passed pawns are extremely dangerous in the end game and this is how white creates a passed pawn. after g4,h4,g5 black can choose to exchange the pawn or just play it to h4, but white will have a passed pawn after that. you see when you create a passed pawn you look on where you have more pawns then black,then exchange and in the end you will have 1 passed pawn.
now no one will advance their pawn to keep them in dark squares. especially black because b3 gives up the square c3.
My opponent isn't that experienced in end game theories so he decides to just attack the pawn but that isn't a good move white will just play g5 and the bishop will have to move back. so what should black instead play? well this game looks kinda lost for black now. white has the center and is about to get a passed pawn so maybe Bf7 would be a little better.
the point of this move is to be a strong blockader on g8
for some this position looks like a draw but in this kind of position you need to ''scan'' the board. look on what your advantages are and use them to win. White's advantage in this position is that he has the center and black's pieces are very passive,king protects pawn on d5,so does the bishop while blockading the passed pawn on g6. How ever the tricky part is how white should proceed. Well in this bishop ending game white should focus on taking advantage that he has a passed pawn and so...
Bb5!! Now white actually has a winning game and there's nothing black can do to stop it. The point of it is to move the bishop to f7  forcing black to take white's bishop and afterwards,when white takes back with pawn the black king will have to rush down to stop the passed pawn and when he does that white can simply take blacks pawns and push his own pawn to b8 which is unstoppable. How ever you shouldn't play g7,getting the pawn out of a light square in this position because then white wouldn't have any more attacking tactics and it would be a draw.
Ke7! in order to stop white from moving his bishop to e8 and f7.
How ever now he gave up the c5 square. now white can just take the b4 pawn,d5 pawn and push his b pawn.
I am not sure what the point of this move was. centralizing the king in this position is a weird thing to aim at. But then again,black has no other moves and now...
Resigns. Of course now if black even capture white's bishop then simply pawn takes bishop followed by f8=Q.
building up the center eh?
still going after the e6 pawn....
Now the B must retreat.
Clever... and effective.
Caught in the crossfire.
i played this move as i was remembering a situation where black draws his queen pawn away from the centre and gets the queen in the middle \unfortunately for me this is played if the second white knight is not developed
this is not a blunder it's a crime :) i simply left my queen unprotected. Anyway it was the beginning of a torment for me so i decided to try and get at least a draw out of this
i was trying to play as aggressive as possible hoping for white to make a mistake as its not usual for white to play defense even when he had a queen and i didn't
trying to push back my bishop
removing the pin on the knight on d4
offering a pawn exchange witch would lead to me having a rook on the 5th rank \which turned out to be extremely helpful\
taking with the rook is better than with the bishop as it seizes the open 5th rank
attacking the black knight but the bishop is unprotected
doubling my rooks on the open e file
offering a knight exchange as it was more than obvious that my double rooks on the e file were not much of a help with the white queen in the near squares
accepting the knight exchange and i got my rook o the h file i was hoping to get my black square bishop on the h2 b9 diagonal anytime later in the game
offering rook exchange and threatening mate if not played carefully by black \and taking the open file\
taking the other open file as i was obviously overpowered in the centre
forking the knight and the pawn if white accepts to trade pawns i was getting my black squared bishop out and i would be able to go and attack this weak h2 pawn
trade not accepted attacking the bishop on e6
advancing the pawn and getting the bishop in the action again :) keeping the king in the corner of the board
saving the bishop and pinning the white knight and later taking it :)
removing the pin from the white knight and also trying to put more pressure on e8 \which could lead to mate if white succeeds in taking his second rook on e1
attacking the white rook but more importantly forking the white rook and the h2 pawn \and leaving an unprotected pawn on b2\
taking a pawn back but more importantly threatening to move the bishop to g2 open a chess from the rook and take the queen
white sees the threat and saves the queen but the white knight on c2 is no longer protected from the queen and my bishop still waits to capture it
I'm not sure if white was simply greedy for my pawn or foresaw the Bc5+ coming but anyway i still was in a good position \relatively good considering the missing queen and pawns\
the fun part begins :) Bd3 threatens white;s queen but though the bishop is not protected if captured this allows me to play bd5 check and if white does not block with the queen i go Ra1 and checkmate and second if not captured i was hoping to play Bh2+ hoping to mate with the 2 bishops
I believe this game shows the importance of holding on to the initiative.<n><n>e4 - my standard opening, usually leading to some variation of the scotch game, which I prefer as it leads to an open game
opens with the Sicilian, one of the most popular black responses
At this point I normally play d4, leading to a position similar to Scotch opening so familiar to me, but I decided to do something more attacking and initiative grabbing, I opted for the more active Bb5, challenging the knight's desire to dominate d4.
Black played Qb6, possibly to keep the pressure on d4, and also on the bishop which had no support.
I could have tried Nc3 supporting the bishop and developing another piece, but opted instead to exchange as I liked the idea of black having to tie up a major piece like a queen to bolster d4. Also, after the exchange, I would have had one knight out as opposed to his having an exposed queen out.
A bit surprised with the queens move, as this makes it blocked behind the c pawn, and losing control of the black diagonals. Also doubled c file pawns is not that bad, as they can exert influence on d5, and help with the eventual pawn break. Perhaps he was hoping to take out e4 for an easy kill.
Continues the attack on e4, and preparing to castle himself
easy enough to defend with the d pawn, strengthening the center and also opening my DSbishop.
Opening the LSB to possibly pin my knight on f3, and also bringing a minor piece to support c5.
stopping the bishop pin, at the expense of weakening the castled king in the future. But I like my knight where it was, and did not like to exchange with bishop as this was going to be a closed game, and as they say, knights are better than bishops in closed games.
Preparing to embed my c3 knight on d5 by taking out the knight on f6 with the bishop (closed game - knights better)
Does not want to exchange with g7, hence the bishop. But this move does not stop my obvious plan.
The knight has found his golden throne.
Black wants the dark squared diagonal, with a possible check on a5, which would make me weaken the pawn structure, or move one of my knights to the defence.
Time to move to safety.
I want the knight there, and also further strengthen the center.
connecting the rooks, I could have chosen e2 as I was preparing to play on the king side, but I thought the queen could have a more active role on the dark diagonals in the meantime until black commits his black bishop to the queen side. This way the queen could go easily to either queen or king side depending on how black moves.
I could see black was trying for play on the queen side, hence decided to move the rook to defend the b-file in preparation of a pawn push along the b file, to cramp the black pieces on the queen side. I should probably have moved b3, with the queen supporting a2, and then move Ra1 to b1. Rf1 to b1 locked in the rook on the a - file
the black bishop move to a5 weakened the e7 square, which would be quite helpful to me during my attack whenever it happened. Black moves his king away fearing my knight would check him, but I had no desire to do that without proper co-ordination from the other forces, which were still in the preparatory stages for the attack. So he wasted his move I think, losing more initiative.
the b pawn move. I could have prepared better with a3 then the b pawn move, but <n>1. the bishop would not dare take the b pawn as I could do the Nc7 forking attack (I was hoping he would).<n>2. If he captures with c5, this would create a nice file for me to play the rooks on, with a b4 pawn that cannot be protected by another pawn soon enough. <n><n>At this point, it seems his pieces are kind of stuck along the edge.
I had to pick one of his bishops- in my opinion the white one, as the black bishop was bad with his pawns on the dark squares, plus the white bishop was a potential defender on the king side. I overlooked BC3, a mistake. If I had seen that, I would have probably done bxa5, then played the rooks on the open file. At this point, it seemed limiting blacks queen further, and gaining space on the queen side, then taking the white bishop would be a good move.
I took him with the e pawn to open up the king side a little more so I could attack with more ease.
Decision time - <n><n>a. Attack immediately and exploit any advantages I had built up for so long, <n><n>or <n><n>b. Be doomed to die a slow "death by exchange".
I knew black would give me one more move to launch the attack, and harass the king to at least go for a draw.
threatening mate on h7, and eyeing f7. Now black has to weaken his defence.
By exchanging his bishop, black is ahead in exchanges, but he has also lost any chances at a queen side attack, allowing me to concentrate on my attack. I am 2 points down, but in return, black has to dance to my tune.
I was hoping for a draw, but by allowing me to bring in a third attacker into the picture, without any new defenders showing up, brightened my chances for a clean win with a few tactical maneuvers.
!? giving up the material advantage for some activity.
Though about Kf5 here though this way the king has some cover.
Was expecting the best move here f5! but Freddy wanted to simplify.
I could have played 3...d5, trying to transpose into the Grunfeld, but White can obtain a slight edge due to the fact that he hasn't moved his d-pawn after 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 (if Nb6, White can play 6.d4 and have a very solid center) 6.dxc3 Qxd1+ 7.Kxd1 and White has the endgame initiative.
If 4.d4, I would have played 4...d5. This move can transpose to either the KID or the Maroczy.
After 4...c5, White plays 5.d4 anyway since 5...cxd4 is the Maroczy bind, something which not many players enjoy as Black. An interesting possibility is after 4...c5 not recapturing but allowing White to gain space with d5.
An unusual move and not a very good place for the Queen.
This move is dual purposed since it intends both Nf4 and f5, both taking advantage of the misplaced Queen on d3.
The typical KID counterplay.
Retreating with tempo. White can't hold the center anymore.
This feels a bit rushed. This is played only after Black loses a tempo with h6 and weakens his King's castle in the process.
White's compensation lies in the d5 square and the potential pin on the a2-g8 diagonal. Black will have to maneuver for quite a bit before he can capture the stranded e6 pawn and White hopes that that will give him enough time to create serious threats.
Because of the Qd3, White is forced to immediately recapture and divert his Knight from the ideal d5 square.
Clearing the way for the Queen to come to e7 and preparing to play Nd4.
Unnecessary. Black was going to move this Knight anyway. Now White has weakened a lot of black squares around his King.
Now the e6 pawn will surely fall.
Going for complications but weakening  the K-side even more. White dreams of supporting the e6 pawn with f5 but that's not going to happen.
Activating the Queen and preventing f5 because of the pin on the 4th rank. Now Black can bring his last Rook into play.
Eliminating a defending piece and a potential intruder on the a2-g8 diagonal.
Black is now a clear pawn and he has nothing to complain about.
If White tries to save the Queen, he blocks his King and gets mated.
The title of this annotation is because this is probably one of my best displays of technique where from a position that doesn't appear to be more than slightly better for white gradually almost imperceptibly turns decisive. Of course this is largely due to taking advantage of blacks mistakes but never the less I made no major error in converting the point.
I've become a fan of this, the Tarrasch variation. White chooses to develop the knight here as opposed to its 'classical' square so that d4 can be thoroughly reinforced by c3 and potentially Ndf3 and Nge2, and of course if black plays ...c5 immediately then the idea is to straddle black with an isolated queens pawn then play against that
This is adopted so that black is not left with an isolated d pawn which gives white a clear target and plan. Of course this move has the disadvantages that white will gain a bit of time attacking the black queen and the black pawn on e6 will mean that black will have to develop the LSB via ...b6 and Ba6/b7
!? A relatively new move that appeared not all that long ago in New in chess with some analysis. The point is that this allows for the DSB to develop freely and neither the black knight or the black LSB will need to make use of d7 so the queen is not blocking anything from this square. Though if I were in blacks position I think I would prefer to place the queen back on her home square since it seems, to me at least that the dark squares will be of more consequence
By chasing the black queen on to b6 I'm making it harder for black to complete development, the LSB in particular will be a couple of moves before it gets to see any action, and if the LSB can't move the a8 rook can't contribute either
It seems pretty apparent that whites play is mainly going to be on the kingside and the bishop was not doing anything on c4
This square is a flexible square for the queen where it ;protects the knight, can still come to c2 and can also form a battery via Bc2 and Qd3 and of course by using my queen instead of my rook I have connected my rooks meaning they can potentially sit on the central open and semi open files respectively
Possibly the the other rook should have been preferred since this would mean my bishop had the option of playing to b1 without disrupting communication of my rooks but I don't think there is too much difference between which rook I used, I also liked to retain the option of placing one of my rooks on the c file
Preparing for a potential battery and also allowing my rook to participate in the struggle for central control
?! Giving up the bishop pair in an open position like this for no apparent compensation doesn't seem like a wise choice. However looking back at the position I notice that whites logical play so far has left white In a position where the pieces are controlling more space and the knight standing proudly on e5 leaves a nice impression, he was also preventing black from doubling rooks, and because of all this it is quite hard to suggest a good plan for black, so I guess it's understandable that black wanted to initiate  some exchanges leaving black with a less cramped slightly more manageable position
Black does not have a DSB anymore, so it is unlikely that he will be able to take advantage of the opened up diagonal to my king, so this move blunts the black battery and gives my king quicker access to the centre when the endgame rolls around. It may also be an alternate route for my queen to get to the kingside at some point
? Black starts creeping his king closer to the centre of the board however the queens are still on the board and as such this is not yet an endgame. This could lose a pawn to 23.Bxf6 followed by Bxh7 however I decide to go down a different path. But then it is hard to suggest an alternative plan for black, clearly black should try to exchange one of whites bishops, but there are no obvious ways to do that further more blacks minor pieces can't seem to find any useful roles since the f3 pawn both blunts blacks bishop and takes away squares from the knight
As said in the previous diagram, I could have won a pawn here however I felt this was a better approach. After 23.Bxf6 gxf6 24.Bxh7 f5 white has given up the bishop pair and turned the remaining bishop into an inactive piece that may even find itself trapped, in short I felt black got far more play for the pawn than was necessary to be allowed
Now that black gets nothing for it I decide to snatch the pawn
Bg6 was my first thought looking to remove the knight which is the glue holding blacks position together however I decided to first throw in a zwishenzug to get the to a slightly less active square
Once again my first thought was to move my bishop so as to start attacking blacks position, however I decided to throw in another zwishenzug. This move gains queenside space and also takes away a few squares from the black queen. I can also follow up with b4 where the queen is basically out of useful squares since g5 would be the only safe square however that allows white to further break down blacks position liquidating into an easily winning endgame
?? This surprised me that black would make this sudden blunder now he must give up the queen in order to avoid mate, the point is that white now gets to move the bishop with tempo

Usually d5 to attempt to establish pawn center followed by this move.
Helps to counter f4 and applies pressure in center especially on e4.
Unleashes the pin and makes way to castle.
Supports d5 and gives the f8 bishop some options.
Develops the bishop while adding support to e5.
Continues queenside attack, prevents black bishop to c5, and allows Bb2 for white which gives white more control over the dark central squares.
An effective move that halts my plans for the queenside for now.
Fianchettoes the bishop and attacks the dark center squares. Also allows rook c1 which can help support pawn c4 afterwards.
Attacks the pawn on b5, knight on c6, and bishop on g4.
Best way to recapture.
Guards the knight so the black queen can move without worrying about my bishop taking on g6 and forcing him to disrupt his castled position to retake and doubling his pawns.
Forcing the queen to retake so I can play rook a1 and have control of the a file and some initiative attacking his queen.
Continuing to attack the black queen.
Attacks the c-pawn and allows my knight to retreat to b3 if need be.
Trying to be disruptive. If exf5, then Rxd5.
Attacks my bishop.
Locks in my bishop and really obstructs his center pawns.
Pins the bishop and gives me an edge.
Whatever black does, I respond with Bc5 winning the bishop on f8 and more or less the game.
Securing the advantage of the Bishop pair
Continuing to undermime White's centre.  Although Black's Queenside is undeveloped, with an extra piece and the centre about equal, Black must be better in this position
Eventually developed and connecting the Rooks
? - White's best defense surely invovled keeping Queen's on the board.  With the bishop pair and an extra pawn (and an extra piece) Black's plan is now fairly straight forward
The Bishop pair already exerting their influence across the board
And now the mate is but a matter of time
Agressive move that threatens to tear the white center apart... But now black will have difficulties to find a safe place for its king.
In the French opening black almost always have problems with his bishop on c8. I would prefere Bd7 and hopefully trade the bad bishop (even if it meant that the king had to take back). If the black bishop would have taken on c5, then b6 followed by Ba6 would be a good development I think.
Trading the good bishop for the knight... good or bad? Creates a fortress for the bishop on c8, but also creates a strong half-open file for the rook (and queen).
Here we see that if the bishop stood on e3, white would gladly offer the strong knight to take the poor bishop.
White can only defend the bishop and the b-pawn with Bc1, but that looked too defensive to me. I think this move is rather poor... offering two pawns for some activety on the queen-side.
Preparing c4 and perhaps a trade with the mighty knight on f5.
Putting the rook on the b-file, good to activate the rook. Is the plan to get the rook to the g-file via the 4th row? Somewere here black needs to activate the bishop on c8, maybe a5 and Ba6?
Going for a trade with the mighty knight on f5 (but this is also a trap since both Nxd4 and Bxe5 ends badly for black).
Could Bc7 be an alternative? The rook is not contributing to the kingside attack and after Nxb8, Bxb8 and then Bb7 there would be two bishops targeting the white king-side...
I would not offer a trade of queens when I am down with material and have some pressure. This trade makes it easier for white. Maybe Ng3, R? and then Ne4 were it finds an even better position than on f5!
Good to develop the king, but not to d7... Maybe Rg3 to make some trouble for white?
brought his Knight out to threaten E5 pawn
I protected it with the Knight
He decided to attack it
but then I brought out the other one to protect  the Knight
I then went A6 to move the Bishop away
I brought my Bishop out so I could castle should I need to whilst pinning the Knight
He then tried to drive the Knight away with A3
He did  H3 to prevent my Bishop going to G4 to pin the knight
He then moved to C4 to limit where my Bishop can move to
which then I went the H3 pawn with the Bishop and I maybe down on material value but now his King will be exposed should he take
He then move his Rook to G1 to make it more active
He then went Qg4 to attack G7 but my Queen is protecting it
he then went H4 and then was going to go H5
But I went there not realising at the time he could take it whilst I couldn't take back with the Rook pinning the G6 Pawn
I move my bishop to cover my E pawn.  Probably could have done d6 instead, but I like this because it keeps my bishop out.  I also didn't want to lose a pawn by going nd4.
Bg5 to attack my knight, possibly interested in a trade, but a more creative way to defend e4 by pinning my Knight.
Move my pawn in order to get something out of my loss.
She castles to defend.
I move my bishop to pin her F pawn in addition to her G pawn which was pinned by virtue of castling.  Now she is susceptible to an attack.
Now I can get my bishop into the mix.
She may not realize that I can mate by bg2# or rg1# depending on her action.
...the finisher.
This was my worst game so far.  White easily developes and keeps his king safe while black concentrates on a futile effort to develop his dark squared bishop ignoring king safety.
The starting position.  Black has one square to move his king d7
Im trying to get my queen into play and overlook that he can easily defend the pawn with g3 or better 0-0!
This was a terrible mistake and a waste of time.  The whole game is centered on my getting my bishop developed.
He could just take my bishop if he wanted to but he has other plans
White gets good development here.  Now he has his bishop and two knights going after my King
another major blunder.  somehow i think i can win one of his knights with h5?  He can easily protect his e4 knight with d3! developing his dark squared bishop.  Instead he moves Ne4xc5 then after i move he can move Bf3 pinning my Queen to my King.
another blunder because I assume NxB then QxN
Now i have to make the wasted rook move to protect my bishop
Small inaccuracy: 13. Nb4 Ne5 14. Qd1 Nxh5 15. Qxh5 Qe8 16. Qxe8+ Rxe8 17. Nd5 Bd8 18. f6 gxf6 19. Nd2 Kf7 20. Ne4 Rhg8 gives a slight advantage.<n><n>Best: 13. Re1 Kg8 14. Nd2 Nxh5 15. Qxh5 Qf8 16. g4 Be8 17. Qh3 h5 18. g5 Bd7 19. Ne4 Qxf5 20. Qg2
At this point it is safe to say black should win.
Moving out the bishop and giving me a nice spot for my bishop on b7.
Well no choice to lose my bishop. My king side is not well developed enought to try a counterattack on this side.
Getting out of the way of the bishop so I can use my knight and my f pawn.
?! Kinda risked with the bishop threatening g8, but I had to provoke something so my bishop and my rook become effective.
Well I'm not sure if it was the right move to do.
Well taking the pawn right away with my knight would have lead to some problems. It's better to be patient.
!! Spend almost 1 minute for this move, but the next ones were done very quickly. I was already planning to take this pawn with the knight but I didn't thought about Nf2#! I don't think there was a defense against this move. <n><n>25.Nf3 lead to Nf2+ 26.Kh2 Qf4+ g3 Ng4+ (Kh3 Rh5+ Kg2 Rh2+ Kf1 Rf2#) Kg2 Bxf3+ Kf1 Bg2+ Kxg2 Qf2+ Kh3 Qh2+ Kxg4 Qh5#<n><n>25.Qf3 lead to Rxf3 26.gxf3 (Nxf3 lead to the first mate) and I have a big advantage and the mate should come quickly.
Now the threats against the Q gain time.
This capture is stronger. Now ...g5 does not work and White is threatening the rook and an attack on the King.
Trying to get in g5 but....
Sam is protecting his bishop, believing I wont want to trade
I trade, realising i can gain material. from Qa5
Sam playing uncharacteristically poorly. A very open board, he develops along the side, instead of moving the rooks to the centre, and makes no move to protect his pawn.
unfortunately, he didnt see the consecutive bishop rook attack....
I go on to win
White decided to mess up my ability to castle on his next move or probably had his knight tempt my queen (which is not going to happen).
Still trying to attain my Queen or Rook, White played this and forgot about 1. his position and 2. my knight.
I forked his Bishop and his Queen, so he hurried to move his Queen and forgot about my knight completely.
! Knight and Bishop sacrificed to attain Black's Queen.
!? Risky, but well worth considering. I tried to stop White's h-pawn and with this move, there is only one way to kill his pawn. If 11. h6, It is a wasted move.
Castled to protect f7-pawn with the rook
With this move, White decide to try to sacrifice a bishop to obtain my rook. The structure of the move is poor.
A premature attack that forces my King to h8.
White exposed my King to his Bishop and still hung on to his h6-pawn which is not a good option for him.
A move that sends the Rook to g8
Unbelievable!!! White ignored 28.h8=Q and decided to do this weak move. Realizing that he'll spot this, I hurried to move my Rook to e8.
I chose to gain the pawn instead of a Rook.
and he did not take it.
Targeting the dark-square bishop.
White has still not taken my defenceless Rook for a bishop.
! A move that taunts White to get my rook.
One step closer to promotion. I am afraid that I'm having to much priority on my Rooks and I am required to sacrified one of them.
Started to chase the Rook around while having fun doing it with my king!
this was my second game against a well rated player, at the time he was 1801. i show an example of a good looking smothered mate. he was evidentlly a bit upset that he fell for an obvious move. this however does hold some merit and has a good look to it so it would be good to analyse.i took the white pieces.<n><n>e4 the move i will almost always open with
my opponent had already played me and lost so i think in playing the caro-kahn he was trying to throw me off gaurd in thinking perhaps i would not know it.
this move primarily is done for me to castle.blacks bishop is poised at the moment so i want to go kingside out of harms way
the idea here is to advance a pawn to position his knight in the center after the exchange
logical. also i was wanting to see what black had in mind
this move is the first in my attacking idea, somtimes you have to make a passive move to attack
many players would think this was illogical but it is ok for white. an attack on the kingside is forming
trying to free some space by using a rook lift but all is too late at this point also cramping his king. note there are no escape squares for the king
this seems a great move black will have a hard time even if he chooses to take the knight. from here there are only a few moves that will avoid the checkmate
this tactic also works if th king moves to e3 or f3
ok, black is now really on the attack. white has to be careful
a mistake from white (taking the rook) lead to a forced mate
This move seems to waste a tempo unnecessarily.
This was played in order to be able to bring the Bd3 without the harassment of Nb4.
Another wasted tempo.
This seems ill-advised to me.  There is no reason for Black to compromise the Kingside pawn structure.
Black seems to be planning a Kingside attack, but is trailing in development and material.
This is probably best.  If Black plays Nxe5, they would have to deal with Qg7.
Black now has an open file against White's King, but no development to exploit it.
White is content to continue to trade, which will tend to magnify the advantage in the endgame.
This gains the tempo needed to fight for the d file.
So Ajay, as you mentioned in one of your comments (now deleted due to comments posted afterward), you noticed on the openings website I sent you to, that the bishop is seldom brought out early in the Sicilian, and when it is, the results are not good for White. Here's why: In this early stage in the opening, you don't know what squares will be best for the bishops, and you know the knights are best on c3 & f3. The best squares for the bishops is determined by the pawn structure and the other pieces (especially pawns). So it is best to move the knights out, and see what develops in the pawns and pieces before moving the bishops. It turns out this was not the best square for the bishop. The consequences are evidenced in 2 ways: 1. I forced you to move the bishop a 2nd time, gaining development for me and losing it for you. 2. More important, after your later Qe2, the bishop had very little space to move to, so I cornered and slayed him (poor guy).
(?) This is the move that blocked off your bishop, inviting an odd but strong 7th move on my part. He (the bishop) needed access to the a6-f1 diagonal. I demonstrated that the b3 and a4 squares were unsafe.
(?) Although this move looks perfectly natural, I consider it to be a question mark move, due to the reasons stated in my next move.<n><n>The note above was previously input, but on reviewing again, I see you had no better choice here, since 7. Bb3 c4 8. Ba4+ Kf8 leads to the same line we played.
(!?) So conventional chess theory would say, "Block the check with the bishop or knight. Don't relinquish the right and privilege of being able to castle." I've never been one to hold to conventional theory. I am an innovator, always seeking out new ideas. In our previous game*, I stated "Every principle has some exceptions". I gave the example of a natural, man made law - to stop at a red light - which most people would violate if given the right circumstance. I made an imaginary scenario of you having an injured loved one in critical condition. There is no ambulance in your town, so you have to drive half an hour to the hospital. You may go through a red light or two. Similarly, chess principles are guidelines only - they should not be adhered to dogmatically. <n><n>Ajay, you may remember, I took several days to make this move, as I suggested to you at the beginning, "Analyze, Analyze, Analyze!". So here are my thoughts that brought about this strange move: <n><n>I. The bishop on b5 is restricted. The only square he can go to which "seems" safe is a4. I say seems because as we see, it is really deadly for the bishop. Moving to d3 is not safe as 8. ... c4 traps the bishop. <n><n>II. If I block the check with a knight or Bishop, then when I harass the bishop you can get him out of trouble by trading.<n><n>III. I can trap the bishop via:<n><n>A. 8. ... a6 followed by 9. ... b5 and 10. c4.<n>B. If 8. a3 a6 9. Ba4 c

Although White gets the 1st move, in this position, he only has 4 development moves, while black has 5 development moves. So Ajay, do you know how to count development moves? If not, send me a note to say you need more info and I will explain. Until then, suffice to say that Black is ahead in development, while white has some compensation due to the Black king's position. I was planning on manually castling via g6, ... Kg7, ... Re8. On one hand. manually castling loses development because instead of 1 move to castle, it takes 4 moves on king-side castling (2 moves for the king, 1 pawn push and the rook move). On the other hand, I was already ahead in development and I was planning on forcing you to lose more development. (See point IV below.) So I felt manually castling was justified. I also had the prospect of winning your bishop (not yet forced). As it turned out I never did manually castle

This move somewhat opens the line up to your king so that if you choose to give up the knight instead of the bishop, I can play Qa5+, winning both pieces, (actually what happened)! You will lose the bishop regardless, so you'd be better off castling. I would not necessarily put a question mark by 10. d3, since capturing with the knight is what really opened you up, (since I can't check you with the knight there).
Removing your knight on f3 enables my knight to go to d4, forking the queen on f3 and the pawn on c2. You can't afford to sacrifice the c2 pawn because the knight would be forking your rooks. Thus your queen has to retreat to the passive d1, leaving the d3 pawn undefended.
I could have taken the d-pawn here but I felt the Knight move was stronger. It attacks the rook and, more importantly, prevents the rook from moving to the opened c file.
It is only to my advantage to trade, as once everything is traded off, then I bring my king and latent h8 rook into the game.
Threatening to take my pawn on f7 by moving his knight to g5...
...So I moved my bishop to c5.
Not going for the swap off.
white attack allows to play white for rock and weak the black left side.
The importance of these attack is middle control.İt looks Black has advantage but it is not.Two pawn of the middle is allow the set up a good game for white and also in future the black bishop also lock down in g7
Decent play.  More common is Bd3, continuing development and preparing for a castle.  If you want to move the queen I might also consider Qd4 or Qf3.  Bd2 is also a strong contender...
No need to hesitate here, go for the castle and prep for completing development.
Puts some separation between the king and rook, allows for a kingside castle as well.  White is in pretty good developmental shape and is close to escaping unscathed from the opening.
Offering a chance to go up a pawn.  If Qxc3, then Nxe4 wins.
Looking to chase away the bishop or make an exchange...
unexpected!  I think top play was Bxf6 instead.  Black now has a few choices in how to respond.  I can either exchange pieces and win a pawn, or just win a pawn and see what happens.
More and more unusual.  When you're down points you should trade pawns, not pieces.  We also don't want to trade bishops for pawns if we can help it. I expected White to flee or perhaps trade.
Looking to get my LSB into the game.
This move was a mistake on my part.  Better to move the rook, perhaps to c5, allow the f pawn to be taken, and then move my bishop to f5 to finalize deployment of my pieces, and protect against the Q/B combo on g6.  I just moved too quickly without fully analyzing my position...
Eventually the pawn now at f5 could present complications for me, but as of right now, it's a protective barrier for my knight and queen to inhabit the f6 square.
I also thought about Qg8 here instead.  I wanted to see if I could create any "play action" by getting my pieces into the middle of the board.
Perhaps with an eye towards defending g2 with the queen?  Uncertain.  I feel like Qd3 was a better move, as it set the queen on a diagonal with the Black king.  As a general tip when positioning power pieces, put them in lines that naturally allow attacks, either direct or discovered, as it creates pressures and possibilities. Your pieces are generally more useful when they can attack than just being used for defense.
This move isn't as useful as just taking the c3 pawn, which is what I wanted to do.  I was curious to get some action against the g2 pawn and see what I can make happen.
This move represented a huge blunder on White's part and I didn't see it.  Qxc3 would have been a huge play for Black!  It would threaten the rook with capture and a follow up of Ng3+!!  The top play for White was Qe3.
Unexpected.  I thought White might play Re7 first.  A thing to remember, the immediate kill isn't always the best option.  Sometimes it's better to build a coalition of strength through more pieces in play, before delivering the final blow.  A key difference between junior and more advanced play is the willingness to let power build so you can deliver a more decisive blow rather than taking the first offering.
When a king is exposed in the middle of the board and you have a Q/R combo, check the possibilities before jumping in.  I should have played Qd2 instead, as it affords me the chance to scarf some pawns and get a better set of attacking options.  Poor play by me!
When you find yourself in these situations you need a game plan on how to secure victory.  White's pawns are all singletons, so there is no support there.  Essentially Black gets their king to the middle of the board, pushes the three pawns on the c and d files up, and then leverages 3 on 1 attacks with the king to promote.  If White moves to block with their King, the Black king can go scarf the h pawn and promote.  It is almost impossible to not win as Black here, but you still have to execute.
I'm not certain if this is the best move or not, but it hardly matters at this point.  c5 prevents White's king from coming into the d4 square and affords me enough flexibility that regardless of his next move, I can start forcing a pawn to promotion.  Either I can attack with the King towards h2 or advance the pawn to d4 and it's all but finished...
The idea behind the bishop move is to exchange the defender of the e4-square and play e4.
White adopts a modest setup, choosing to establish a stable center before undertaking any attack.  Not really in the spirit of the opening, but Black doesnt have any immediate attack either.
Now we are really out of book.  This knight typically goes to d7, however, with White's unambitious play, I decided to put the knight on a more aggressive square.
Having established the central pawn majority, I decided to part with it to play against the Isolanus, if White so chooses.  Maybe not the best strategy, however, I think Black can hold his own.
Attempting to keep the position dynamic and since the position is opening, the loss of tempo in recapturing the pawn will help Black.
Too slow would have been the typical bishop fianchetto of the Torre systems.  Here the dark-squared bishop goes to an active diagonal and fights for the e5-square.
Still behind in development and with an uncastled king, I am now looking down the barrel of a d5-break.
Utilizing a pin to stop the break at the same time keeping the f3-knight tied to the defense of h2.  An active defense is the best solution.
If 13. d5 Ne5 14. Nxe5 Qxe5 15. g3 ed and Black is fine.
Preventing d5 again via 14...Ne5 15. Nxe5 Bxe5 threatening mate and hitting the queen, and after 16. Qg3 Qxc4 Black is down a piece.
The only real problem with the Black position is the light-sqared bishop.  Here I clear a space for the a8-rook, but temporarily block any discovery tactics on the d-file from the d8-rook.  This was the major trade off.  In absence of any active plan, White is going to get a space advantage on the queenside, in addition to his advantage in the center, and I would slowly suffocate.  Here I can at least develop my pieces and get some counterplay on the open files.
Better than ...Bb8, as the pressure against h2 is not as potent as White's queenside and center pressure.  Here I can swing the Bishop to f6 and to g7 after ...g6 if necessary.
The attack commences.
The only move, White threatens to recover the pawn and exchance of one of the Black bishops, which are a substantial advantage in an open position.
White is probably slightly better if the situation isnt just equal.  Black has good play on the d-file, the pawn structure is symmetrical and there is an opposite colored bishop situation.  White has succeded in liquidating his isolated pawn and his only weakness is on a3, which Black can't exploit.  On the other hand, Black has a weakness on b7 and on g6, which is easier for White to exploit as he has the light-squared bishop.
Black overprotects f7 and gets the bishop out of the way of any future tactics from the rook on e1.
The plan is to restrict the light-squared bishop and hopefully trade it off, when Black would have some winning chances due to the bishop vs knight situation with pawns on both sides of the board.
Preparing to get the bishop to a more active diagonal.
After the exchange, the pawn on c5 would kick the knight to a less active square, and White would be clearly better.
Faced with a defensive task, the move that gives your pieces the most activity is most often the best move.  Here the rook can attack from behind, in addition to keeping White pieces tied down as well.
I try to catch up in development, as well as contest e5 so my e-pawn can move there.
White is still ahead in development, but the pawns on d2 and b2 are going to hinder the development of his DSB slightly.
I pin White's knight, completing my minor piece development. The White Queen is also somewhat restricted in that I get to open up White's kingside if the queen quits the defence of the knight.
Adding pressure to the knight on f3.
?! This may be threatening the pawn on b7, but it allows me to mess up White's kingside with Bxf3.
Now I can begin to pressure White's kingside.
?? This allows me to trap the knight with Rac8.
Freddy hoped to teach me a lesson in my favourite Najdorf, so naturally I obliged.
?! Not because its a dubious move in itself but because this is just about the sharpest opening in the whole Sicilian Labyrinth (Polugaevsky's term), so it was hardly wise of me to try it against The Big Bad Wolf!  This is the Polugaevsky Variation of the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defence.  A more sober response would have been 7....Be7
The N is pinned against the Q and doomed, so Black has to counter-attack on the Q-side.
Preparing to support ... Nc6 and .. Bb7
! With the N already virtually in the bag, White can afford to invest this Bishop in the attack, destroying Black's Q-side pawn structure and enabling him to castle quickly.
Black has little choice but to take the B
an alternative was to take the Nd4 and this might have helped prevent White's other N from wreaking havoc with Nb5-c7 but I preferred to take the B with the prospect of capturing the f6 pawn without disrupting my K-side pawns.
avoiding the fork from c7 and preparing to attack the Nb5 with the B, either from a6 or from d7
Tucking the K away to relative safety and defending the pawn on f6
taking the opportunity to develop with tempo but cutting off the Q's attack on b5
! not only attacking the Q and B but adding to the defence of the f6 pawn
Thanks to 15...Na6, the Q no longer needs to defend the Bc5, so maybe that was the motivation!
White finds another way to wreak havoc with his Ns
and that's my right to castle forfeited

now threatening all sorts of mayhem with discovered checks, the N going to either f5, f7, c4 or b7, depending on how Black reacts

and taking knight +2 point for white and also gain still positonal strenght.
1. e4 establishes foothold in the center of the board and opens diagonals for both the kingside bishop and queen.  Strong first move.
1...e5 responds symmetrically, refusing to concede space to white.  While symmetric moves maintain space, white still has the initiative.  Black needs to be careful not to fall into a trap.
Strong 2nd move, developing a minor piece to it's most centralized square and threatening the undefended black e pawn.  Developing a kingside piece also speeds castling.
Petroff's defence, sometimes called the Russian defense, maintains symmetry.  The e pawns are usually cleared leading to an open game where black tries to maintain a central knight on e4.
! (Good move)<n><n>Establishing a center, attacking the bishop and defending the knight.
?! (dubious move).<n><n>This was a pointless and allows black to create a pawn chain with tempo.
The thought was to drive away the knight, but d4, attacking the bishop and defending the d5 knight, is better.
!? (interesting move - may not be the best)<n><n>Trading bishop and knight for white's rook and pawn.  Materially, it's an even trade, but since black is trading away his developed pieces, I feel the trade is better for white (assuming white takes advantage of the situation).  If black can get his other minor pieces developed and take control of the open e file with his rooks, he may get a winning attack considering white's exposed king.
This is early considering black has nothing to support the attack and the knight isn't in danger since it can be pulled back to interpose and defend the king.
Overprotecting the knight (from 13...Ne5), but unneccessary.  It also blocks white's dark bishop.  Better would be c3, blocking the a1-h8 diagonal, supporting d4, and allowing the white squared bishop back into play.
13. Qc2 Nd3 (or Nb4) 14. Rb1 followed by Bb2 after removing the knight would probably have been better.  Not sure why I decided to trade instead.
Clearing the back rank.  Black needs to post a rook on the e file.
I was probably trying to clear the back rank to allow my rook to move to the e or f files, but overlooked ...Bg5
?! (Dubious move)<n><n>Weakens the king, though after ...g6 26. Bb3 Kg7 27. Re7 followed by Ne5, black can't hold onto the pawn.  This pushes the king into the corner though.
Intending to trap the king on the back rank.
I decided it was worth trading a piece away to prevent trouble from the pawns, though white should have a won game in either case.
Trading away rooks to prevent counterplay with plans to push the a pawn.
Black can't stop the pawn from queening since the tempo used to move the bishop is compensated by the protected b7 square. <n><n>An easy way to tell if a king has time to stop a pawn is to draw a box from the pawn with sides equal to the distance to the back rank.  In this case, the pawn gets an extra step due to the initial move, so the box would be drawn from a4 to e4 to e8 to a8.  The black king can't step into the box, so wouldn't be able to capture the pawn if the bishop weren't in the way.
Qf5 or Bf5 may have been slightly better, but I was looking to lure the king toward the h8 corner.
I defended with the bishop rather than blocking with the pawn because I thought that in the case he was to exchange, it would only help me develop but in the case he withdrew he would be forced to move back to either the edge of the board (a5) or possibly d6 losing a tempo.
My thinking here was to destabilise his protection of the dark bishop.  Looking back now I guess I should have worked on development, possibly I could have moved a3.  <n><n>Computer says taking the bishop was better.
He surprised me here, perhaps wanting to avoid the complexity of the swap.<n><n>Computer says he should have moved the bishop to e7.
Taking the gambit at a late stage.  <n><n>This was a mistake according to stockfish.
Here I moved my bishop to a centre-controlling square but as it was unprotected here and the pawn was not a threat I could have taken with the knight instead (computer recommends) which would have led to tripled up pawns.
Now we have a fairly simple game to play. Pieces are equal and bishops are both light-squared. <n><n>Computer gives me +0.19 advantage which is probably due to advanced pawn and one move advantage.
Knight moves to protect itself from e5 pawn and now threatens e5.
Seems sound to me: we're at the 11th move. <n><n>Computer says b6 was better, preparing for the bishop on b7 and recommends I move to Kf2 rather than castling... interesting.
My intention was to put pressure on the c pawn.
The intention here was to shift pressure from the left to the right side. I thought my pawn position was superior from that perspective so thought I'd try and capitalise.<n><n>Stockfish sees this as a mistake, it removed my advantage bringing the game back to zero. In hindsight I can see that black now has free run at putting my pieces on the defense.
Black doesn't capitalise on the loss of tempo and chooses to attack the advanced pawn.  <n><n>Computer sees this as a mistake.
I decide to threaten his rook rather than close the c file with my bishop.<n><n>Computer doesn't like this, it removes my advantage completely to zero.
Black encourages an exchange of rooks.  <n><n>I didn't see this as being so bad but the computer thought it weak for black.  Black should have moved Rad8, which would have exchanged knights anyway. Perhaps the difference here is that I will subsequently take the c pawn with my rook.
I chose to take the c pawn before he moved it forward, leaving the e5 pawn for black.
In hindsight this was inefficient.  I was trying to force a passed pawn.<n><n>Computer analysis shows Ne4 was best.  f5 lost 3 points advantage from +4.
Not sure why black did this. I was expecting him to attack the f5 pawn with Bd3.
Moving to attack the f6 pawn.
Here I was thinking of either forcing an exchange, knight for bishop and then gobbling up the doubled up pawns with my rook, or.. letting black move Bd5 and then moving e4
Defending an eventual attack on the knight and also putting pressure on blacks pawns, forcing him to occupy his rook with defensive tasks.
Buying time, using my pawns to force something to happen.
I think this was a mistake by black.  If he was to move either one of the pawns it ought to have been the defended one right?
Black is forced to exchange rooks or he loses the Bishop.  <n><n>Computer analysis prefers letting the b pawn advance protected<n><n>33. b5 Rd5 34. Ra8+ Kg7 35. Rd8 Be4 36. b6 Rd2+ 37. Kg3 Rb2 38. Nxe4 Rxb6 <n>    + (5.16--)
Now my pawn is on the a-file which will queen on a white square, the same as the black bishop.
Black moves to stop the a pawn advancing and stop the knight from moving to 50% of its possible moves.
I moved the king to allow the pawn to advance with some protection. I was hoping that by overloading the bishop I would be able to move the a-pawn.  Unfortunately my knight is wasted here.<n><n>The computer would have preferred Ne8 forcing the king to protect the pawn Kf7, then I would do Nc7 which puts the knight in a position to protect the pawn as it moves through a6 and eventually a8, allowing for at least a sacrifice of bishop for pawn.
I was planning on chasing the king around until I could get my knight in a better position.  Here I realised that if I didn't protect the pawn with something other than my king black might take it.
At this point I decide to put pressure on the bishop.  The d3 square gives him too much control of the board.
Again thinking that I might do well to put pressure on black from both sides of the board.
Black advanced the pawn to block the h-pawn.<n><n>This was a major error for black according to pc analysis.  Anyone want to elucidate why? Black had a reasonable chance by moving Bb7, which would have stopped me moving the knight away and advancing a6.  At best the e and f pawns would have been lost.  Instead now I can advance to f5 which lets me capture that h6 pawn or lets me exchange knight for bishop, which will lead to me queening - the a-pawn wouldn't outrun the king but would put the king on the a8 square and I'd eventually queen the h pawn.
Black decides to attack the white pawn, <n><n>Ba6 was also a possibility but a pawn will inevitably be queened now anyway.
I thought this was quite clever: if the king takes the knight, I take the bishop, alternately he can move the bishop but all squares available are disadvantageous.  <n><n>Computer analysis doesn't like this a lot because it delays queening but deeper analysis shows it is actually ok.
The idea here was to sufficiently defend the a pawn so that black would need both its pieces to stop promotion.  <n><n>Computer: In no more than 6 moves I'll have promoted a pawn.
Blunder: black lets me fork his bishop and king. <n><n>Computer Mate in 12: 49. h6 f5 50. h7 f4+ 51. Kxf4 Kc4 52. h8=Q Kd3 53. Nb6 Bg2 54. Qd8+ Ke2 55. a8=Q Bxa8 56. Nxa8 Kf2 57. Qd2+ Kg1 58. Kf3 Kf1 59. Qf2#
I missed mate and went for the bishop (sorry I can't see 12 moves ahead just yet!)
Standard Sicilian defense from black. This is apparently one of the most common and statistically successful defenses against e4. The strategy black has with 1..c5 is to inhibit white's ability to maintain a central pawn majority. You can see if white moves 2. d4, he will be at a 2-1 central pawn disadvantage after a quick exchange in the first two moves of the game. In addition, this exchange results in the queen coming out, where she will undoubtedly be harassed while black develops.
This is the MT starting position.<n><n>Typically, white would accept the temporary disadvantage at d4 by playing 2. Nf3 (headed to the "open Sicilian"). In my view, this is a really sexy move, one of my favorite opening chess moves. Nf3 allows white to develop the knight, provides white control of the remaining center squares (pressured only at d4), allows for a potential d4 (or e5) push in the future and is one step closer to castling. In addition, notice the scope of the white LSB and queen, compared to black's. This scope difference creates delays in black development. Quite a return on investment for one move!<n><n>However, if white follows 2. Nf3 d6 with 3. d4, this will again result in the exchange of a flank pawn for a central pawn, albeit with development advantages.<n><n>So, by countering with 2. c3 ("Alapin Sicilian" or "c3 Sicilian") instead, white provides the future d4 pawn a "buddy" to back him up. Let's call him Buddy. I'm sure the d4 pawn feels all warm inside. Buddy allows white to maintain the central pawn status quo. However, with all good things there are drawbacks. The primary white weakness is the limited mobility of the queen side knight, which makes the e4 pawn more vulnerable to immediate attack.<n><n>I may be missing some key elements in description, but this is what I notice.
White continues to stick with the plan. Buddy jumps in and saves the day! Now things are looking pretty good for white. There are two white pawns on the 4th rank and it looks like black has only developed a knight.
So, black challenges the e4 pawn. I think Nf6 might have been better here to capitalize on the fact white cannot readily defend with the queen side knight AND develop a minor piece. D5 is a similar tactic but moves a pawn instead of developing a minor piece, but opens a line up for the black LSB. Not really sure which is better.
5. e5 seemed to me to allow white to expand deeper, but I noticed it also gave the black c6 knight two separate targets meaning I would have to defend d4 rigorously and I'm just not sure up for that in this game.<n><n>In addition, the only way black can exchange is with the queen. I think I may be able to capitalize on this later.
And black obliges.
Here's the advantage to the earlier d5 pawn move, black bishop is free to pin the knight
Soooo, now I harass the lady!
Black uses this opportunity to develop the DSB. I think the the Queen check actually unintentionally assisted in white's development.
Buddy is really a scrappy little guy! Another high return on investment move! The fork is actually a bluff, the black d8 rook pins the pawn. However, I can still harass the queen. This will remove the e3 bishop pin and threaten the a7 pawn all at once!
I debated whether to take a7 with the bishop directly, but didn't see anything other than a quick material gain. However, I can remove the remove the pin on f3 and threaten with my queen, I think that would be tactically better.
White seems in trouble here, another d5 attacker. To take the bishop I need to open the g file and the white queen is looming. The h1 rook's future is grim.<n><n>I spent a longtime here. Thoughts from some notes I took:<n><n>Black is focused on d5. The black queen is posed and salivating. I had planned on castling, but I decide to use the castling move to further my attack. Therefore, white really can't use the h1 rook for traditional purposes given the castle decision. It's unlikely white will be able to connect the rooks as well.
Take... -1. Yuk!<n><n>Black rules the diagonal. Black queen so close makes me nervous. But then when I take a close look, the only thing really in danger is the rook. Maybe he has a purpose.<n><n>Focusing on the queen side attack, I need to dispense the knight to put the queen in place.
My Knight is avenging Buddy! This block defends the white queen and threatens a fork. I also noticed the queen lined up with the king. Would be nice if I could pin it with Rc1  <n><n>Wait! I now notice the quiet, shy rook sitting alone in the a1 corner.
Missed the Queen pin, but now I'm paying attention to the a1 rook. Taking the h1 rook was the game loser for black.

The game begins with an unorthodox [1.c3], a move which can provide support for [d2-d4], but has the drawback of taking the useful c3 square from the b1 knight. The control point for white is d4.
This move looks suspect and does not follow the theory of piece development. I begin to sense my opponent is playing with the idea of a hedgehog and it seems like there will be an over development of pawns before pieces, which I will try to take advantage of by correct piece play.
I decide on an unorthodox, or perhaps modern type of play. The idea is to take immediate advantage of whites position. When [2.h3] was played, it weakened the pawn structure kingside, and it leaves g2 open to some pressure which will be applied by the bishop at b7. The pawn structure may suggest kingside castling for white, and the fianchettoed bishop plays well into this concept. Also the squares e4 and d5 will be further influenced by the bishop.
My opponent develops into a hedgehog looking position. The text move adds more control to d4, but leaves the white squares e4 and d5 uncontested. Going by the adage of piece development, this move does not contribute to development for white. This gives black the chance for rapid piece development and the initiative.
I decide to develop a double fianchetto for the fun of it [?!], and because I am leaning towards a decision to castle kingside - due in part to the a4 pawn which could menace the queenside.
White attempts to trap the bishop, likely with a plan of recapture by the queen [Qd1-e2, Qe2-h2].
It appears that this will work [!]. If [7.hxg4] then [7...e6  8.Qe7 Qh4  !]. Else if [7.hxg4 e6  8. Bh3 Qh4   9.Kf1 Qg3!? ] with uncertain results.
I decided to try another idea on the chance that it works [?!].
The text move is a mistake because it allows the exchange at g4 [?]. Better was [8.g5] keeping the h file closed.
And now the bishop gains its freedom.
And now black has created a hedgehog formation. This move opens lines for queen and f8 bishop. Even though black has not castled, very good attacking possibilities exist, while white has limited counter play.
The text is a forcing move - the king must take a walk and lose castling rights. This will tie down the rook on a1.
The attack begins to pick up pace. The h7-b1 diagonal stands ready for b7 bishop.
Alleviates the pin.
First maneuvering to clear the pawn at g4, while applying a pin at e2. The idea is to position the bishop at f5.
With the idea of bringing the rook into play on the 2nd, against the queen.
Maintaining the pin while clearing the pawn. The next move is ready [16...Bf5 ].
This move is played with the idea of further restricting future play by controlling the e4 and c4 squares. The idea of [...Bf8-h5] and [...Bxe3#] is observed, but first the knight must go.
Black is able to take advantage of the restricted black pieces and open squares, and attempts to push the king into a more restricted placement.
I knew that the knight needed to go before I could continue the attack because it would prevent my plans from succeeding.
Another good move where white realizes that bringing the rook into the play will prevent incursion by the queen at c2 [!].
I take advantage of the pin.
Keeping the queen because I need it for mate.
This game was difficult and had more layers of calculations than I put in the notes, especially when I was attempting to weave a mating net. It was a difficult mate due to my opponents resourceful play. A commendable effort, and I thank him for the game.
at least  I am keeping the game to -6

The beginning of a plan. The idea is not to lose time after e5, Ng5. Luckily, white will exchange NxB, and I would play with the semi opened h column.
Removing the Q from the d column. Weak spot in white field: e3, the "price" for f4. My strong move: Ng4. When it can take e3 afterward. g7 is weak, but I don't care. How would you take in e4?
Forking my f7 and e5 pawns. But forgetting e3.
This is not a sound counterattack. He will play the B, I will block with the pawn, he will retire the B, and I have no Q attacking e3. I could be able to save both of my pawns, though.
Bxe4, f5, but it doesn't favour black. I need tempoes to double R on h.
Seizing an opportunity: to sac some pawn to have a Q in d, uncontested!
Mikhail Tal was perhaps the best attacking player of all time. The eighth World Champion was a calculating monster who loved to sacrifice pieces during attacking combinations. The game that follows was played during the 23rd USSR Championship (about four years before he won the title). Living up to his reputation as "the attacker's attacker", Tal forces Simagin to move his king 20 times out of 44 total moves! Enjoy:)
Developing as well and preparing to castle kingside.
?! While deliberately weakening his kingside, Tal sees the importance of the e5 square.
Applying pressure on d4, and restricting white's dark squared bishop.
Tal tests the waters.
?! In an attempt to kick out the knight, black creates a new weakness.
!! You must understand that chess was king (pardon the pun) in the former Soviet Union. This game was played before a big crowd of people. When Tal played 12. Nxf7, the place erupted. It got so loud in the hall that the arbiter threatened to kick out all of the spectators! Can you imagine being held "in contempt of court" at a chess match?
Since white owns the f file, he attempts to open it up.
?! It's tough to come up with anything better here. However, black is now officially in trouble.
Black has to take the pawn to save the knight. But the real surprise comes next. Can you spot it without looking ahead?
!! WHAT??????????????????????????????? Tal is at -3 on material and he sacs a rook? A known lover of vodka, Tal may have seemed to his opponent to be totally drunk. Was this a total blunder? or a tactic so deep that only the Magician could see?
! Attacking the bishop AND b7! Sorry black, you can't save them both!
Black's king is attempting to stay in the middle of the board to avoid losing any more material. The problem is, that is JUST what Tal wants.
Trying to find a hole to hide in and catch a breather. Black's king is now due for his 3000 mile oil change.
Tal opts to take the knight. His pressure on black has momentarily stalled.
Now black tries to get back in the game.
!? WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tal INVITES Simagin to attack him! He MUST be drunk! (In reality, Tal's post mortem explained his desire to get his king to g6).
!! Tal sees that his king won't make it to g6 after black has doubled up his rooks, so he just SACS ANOTHER ROOK!!!!!!!!!!! All kidding aside - he's drunk. Got to be..............................
Black now threatens to gobble pawns, but it is too late.
And black resigned as he can't stop the a pawn from promoting. When it comes to sacrifices, no one could match Tal! Both rook sacrifices in this game were genius (especially the first one on move 15). Because of inspiring play like this, Tal went on to win the World Championship from Botvinnik four years later (he turned right around and lost it to Botvinnik a year after that). While his reign at the top may have been short, Tal continued to be considered an upper echelon GM some 30 years after he lost the title. And I wasn't kidding around with drinking jokes - Tal was a chain smoking booze lover (who allegedly got hooked on morphine as well). The toll that his vices took on his body was severe. I guess that his addictions were the great equalizer with the rest of us. He was only a man - but his chess was truly magic. I hope you have enjoyed:) - Thomas
I originally said, "The real point of Bb5 is the pin, right?"  I meant that the pin undermines the pawn's defence at e5.  OK, if 3... a6, does black end up losing the e pawn as in 4.Bxc6+ bxc6 5.Nxe5?
An attack on the pawn continues.
In some ways this is a thinking move.  Castling was not strictly required, but it prevents surprising situations and is generally useful.  I could foresee the lines:<n>[A] 5.d5! Nb8 6.Bxd7+ Qxd7.<n>[B] 5.dxe5? Nxe5 and white can choose how he wants to cede the bishop-pair or choose to retreat.<n>[C] 5.O-O exd4 6.Nxd4 and if 6... Nxd4 7.Bxd7+
Preferring not to exchange.  (And aware of the strength of the square as a knight outpost.)
A real blunder because I was caught looking, but without this move the game would not have been as interesting.  Ion, I believe caught looking originates from baseball where a player strikes out on the last strike without swinging.  Here I mean that I did not examine the effect of b4.  My thoughts were that his entire queen-side pawn-structure would be easy to undermine.  I did contemplate- it's a better word than analyse here-- a5.  I thought a5 would be stronger after b4, and if not for the bishop, it might have been true.  Over-preparation can be costly.
Not really sure what I was thinking.  I mean I wanted to remove the defender of his c pawn, but it was too much to hope that he would abandon its defence.
Reinforce the vulnerability I noticed and continue to prepare an assault on c5.
Why did I shy away from Qc5+ or Qc2+?  At the time I was desperately wishing for a light-square bishop, but as the previous analysis showed I should have proceeded because Black must shed material in an awful way.  I mistakenly thought that the Black king could escape to g8 or g7, so I delayed attempting to formulate an unnecessary escape control plan.<n><n>Chessmaster's TheKing engine believes this an error when Qc2+ is a won game, but a "won game" can be an unbelievable uphill battle.  Having examined Qc5+, I cannot imagine how Qc2+ is an improvement.  I also doubt Chessmaster.  Sure it destroys me when I try to play it, but that is based on pure calculation speed.  When analyzing this game, there is a point later where its analysis is deeply flawed in a way that no decent human player would not recognize as being faulty.
I partly expected Rdb1 pinning the bishop in an attempt to win the a pawn, but this move does have its own logic.
I can deliver two threats!  I had wanted to play this move, or one like it for a move or two, but I needed a situation in which the threat was subtle.  Here, he cannot respond to both.
I would say that this game highlights very well that Chessmaster can be wrong.  Well, truthfully its suggestion probably is better (and Ion's certainly is), but the move did not cost the game.  Earlier it thought that 28.Bxa7 was one too many pawns gobbled by the greedy bishop, but now the exchange of rook for bishop occurs anyway.  Humans err too, but we immediately could see earlier that there was no reason to abandon the h pawn.
52.Qe7 fails because it exposes the white king to more checks.
black is developing his tools very slowly. white has a great space to play in the center as well as in the king and queen side.
it seems that black is waiting for white to make his move. white, on the other hand, is gaining advantage in the center.
not one peace was taken from the board and it is obvious that black is defending and white is attacking.
time to break the ice!
now the knight on d7 cant move and the other one has to move back to g8.
the black king is wick. there many options to sacrifice a tool on g5 and afterwards f7 will fall too.
a must. sadly.
building a future threat on the queen...
a quick sum: white has a great space to act with a knught on d6 and e,d,c rows open and semi-open. black lmost cant move, with a bad bishop on b7 and a poor king...
i think that black thought that i'm gonna change the knight for the bishop. even if i gained a pawn for it (on c6) it is not good. the knight is much stronger where it is.
want to play h5...
a must!
(WH) At the time this was my favorite move order. I did not like 5... B-K2 after 6 P-KN3 and wanted to retain the option of a King's side fianchetto. Since this game I have been forced to realize the strength after 6 P-KN3 P-KN3 7 B-N2 B-N2 of 8 N-R3! when White is well-prepared for P-B4. The Old Benoni needs a re-think.
(WH) White plans to hold up ...P-B4. Usual is 9 P-QR3 N-K1 10 P-QN4 P-QN3 11 R-N1 P-N3 12 B-R6 N-N2 13 Q-Q2, though I expect I would have played 9 or 10 ...K-R1 here to keep White guessing.
(WH) Good psychology! Usually Black plays 10... P-KN3 11 B-R6 N-N2 followed by ... N-B3, ...K-R1 and ...N-N1 to chase away the bishop. Playing ...K-R1 first looks eccentric but can hardly be worse.
(WH) Probably premature. In such positions it is usually best to maintain the tension until White is ready to exploit the opening of the QN file.
(WH) It no longer seemed necessary to play ... N-N1 so I decided to move all my pieces nearer his King to see what would happen.
(WH) It must be better to play 18 P-B3 B-Q2 199 N-N6 followed by NxB, though Black is still a little better.
(WH) I thought it was all over now: Black's attack must mate. I expected 26 Q-N6 QxQ 27 RxQ N-B5 with a clear advantage to Black.
(WH) There are many ways to win now. I thought I might as well strengthen my position before closing in for the kill -- it saves the energy of working out complications.
great 1882 elo's accept to play with poor 1346 ... it's an honor for me, i will do my best to not be boring
so i canot recover my pawn for the moment, i will anoid the knight c3 protection and develop my DSB
ho, i dont like this dangeours queen, after a few exchanges, it can make an irreversible threat. I have to be carefull and correctly calculate. First i exchange bishop with knight to anoid pressure on center
then secure the king and preparing treath with rook on e colon, white is missing castle
dangerous but i have a plan : for the moment i cant use the f knight to take back d5, but after exd5, i can move the queen in e8 + and then after i take back the white bishop...but i will have a better opportunity ...
It is thematic for White to play b5 with the threat of b4 and so it is necessary to protect the e4 pawn with this Bishop move
8. ... Be7 broke the pin and so Black gives up the bishop for the knight.  A favourable exchange for Black in this position as the Black knight was excerting pressure on the e4 square.  Furthermore, Black's bishop on f6 is looking into its own pawn chain
I'm not sure how this exchange helps Blacks position.  The bishop was doing very little.
Preparing to re-position the a3 knight to a better square
Developing a piece and strengthening the d5 square
Seemingly going after the a3 pawn - surely there is something better for Black
Using a lull in the game to create a luft for the King
Although at first glance it looks like White will win the d6 pawn, the drawback of this move is that it allows Black to generate his own counter-play
Black must generate counter-play against the White King so as to stall the advance of the Black pawns
Not a particularly good move but then the position is such it's difficult to see the best plan for Black
The remainder of the game is Black playing for on only to blunder and lose his Queen for a Rook
This seems a good move, lessening the potential impact of White's threatened Ne6 and attempting to undermine the N on g5.
This might seem greedy, but its main motivation was supporting the N on g5 and the second benefit is enabling development of d-pawn and dsb.  Meanwhile the N on g5 still has plenty of options.
?! surprisingly helping White to mobilise his dsb.  This seems an unnecessary waste of tempo compared with 12...Bg7 or 12....Rd8
Finally the N moves to its favourite square - but only when pushed.  Now there's a threat to win the c7 pawn or to deliver check from d4 and start a king hunt... but there is a down side...
The Bishop falls off :-(
It was too early to pursue the king yet: more important to develop the KR and get the King behind some pawns.
Avoiding the swap, White attacks the Black Queen and prepares either Nd5 or Nd7 (i the right circumstances)
In view of the succeeding moves, perhaps this was a waste of time.  20. Bxc7 may have been more accurate.  I never took the opportunity to win the exchange seriously since I needed the N more than Black needed his useless Rook.
Black forks the Bc7 and the Nd4 while simultaneously revealing his Bishop's defence of b4
!  a nice exchange sac that reasserts the mate threat.
Black has to retake with the Q to continue to defend b4, thus sacrificing the Ne6.
White tries to open up a file for his Rook
Black skewers White's Knights.  If White takes the Rook, Black can either retake immediately or pin the N on d4.
This appears just to drive Black's king to safety
White has nothing else more constructive, but the more wood leaves the board the better it gets for Black, who still has a Queen.
and Black resigned because of 32....Kxc7 33. Ne6+, winning the Queen.
The beginning of a interesting idea to put pressure on g2 by Bc8-b7, which aims to create an advantage based on the lack of development for white and with the idea that white expects to castle short. However, white can play Bf1-e2, then Ng1-f3, where after ...Bxf3, then Bxf3 ...Nc6 to protect the rook - blocks in the c pawn which is usually pushed to c5.
White over reacts to the bishop, better is to develop in preparation for castling.
Develops and controls e5 while protecting the rook from attack.
Black complicates the position some.
White threatens to gain the bishop pair advantage after Nxa5, but overlooks the weakness at g2.
Black creates another threat while opening up the center. A good plan since the white king is still in the center.
Maintaining the bishop at the expense of the pawn structure - a necessary choice.
Disrupts the coordination of the rooks for a cheap shot at the queen.
The text move (?!) could lose R P to B N, with slight favor to black.
Threatens to take the pawn.
Maybe (27...Nc6) to bring another piece into the attack would be better.
With the idea of bringing the knight into the attack to take the bishop.
White can not lose the rook because the knight will stop the a pawn, and the rook is needed to block the g pawn.
The knight can not participate in attacking the rook because of the a pawn.
Black makes a bold decision to chase the rook by using the king. Nice.
White forfeits on time, but the pawn promotion can not be stopped and black would get a queen and win. White does not have time to eliminate the knight and promote pawns. A nice game with interesting play.
This is an annotation of my favourite opening, the "Max Lange Attack". It's out of fashion nowadays, because there are several simple moves against it that put White in a crappy position. With some practice, even those situations are playable and can lead to victory. This is an example that proves my point.
Up until this point all is going according to the book. Obviously this is also the point where moves like 5....d6 or even 5....h6 can mess up your bright idea.
To continue the infamous Max Lange Attack, black is supposed to play 5....Bd5 to defend his pawn, keep his material advantage and to give pressure on f2. This would continue: 5....Bd5, 6. e5 - d5 7. exf6 - dxc4
Having failed in my beloved Max Lange Attack I decide to sacrifice my Knight to draw out Black's King after taking the pawn... see ahead.
The obvious move with several options for black to respond
(In retrospect) another beautiful sacrifice to win time to get the a1 Castle out and to get rid of the blocking d4 pawn.
Here goes the next sacrifice to keep getting rid of pieces blocking the centre. Although the idea was to win Black's Queen by checking the King with a Castle, the possibility of a checkmate slowy creeps in.
Black still has little choice in the matter is forced to keep running around with his King.
By letting Black take the Bishop, the final sacrifice, it's a free run by simply forcing the King all the way to the a-line moving the Queen and Castle step by step.
Dunst Opening and Pinning the knight to Queen
allows the short castle and attacks h7.
Develops the knight and attacks e5 and d4
Black moves king to safety
Black uses a lever move d4 to attack white pawn chain and creating isolated pawn at f4. Slighty better is Ng3
Computer analysis calls Bxf4 a serious miscue by black and better is Nxd4 whichs leads to Qe1 and Nxf3  which forks King and Queen and easily resolved by Rxf3. I was playing for attack on h2.
Pins black Bishop at f4
Frees bishop from pin and isolates pawn at g2
Allows black a forcd mate oportunity and better is Rxf4
Leads to forced move Kf1 and mate on h1.
1. e4 often leads to open games, characterized by pawn exchanges in the center and freedom of movement for the pieces.  Notice that two lines have been opened already, one for the bishop on f1 and one for the queen.
The Sicilian defense.  Only one line is opened (for the queen) and black may fall behind in development.  The main idea is to trade a wing pawn (black's c-pawn) for a center pawn (white's d-pawn).  The reasoning is that the extra center pawn will allow black to eventually control the center.
The fianchetto (wing development) of the bishop caught many classic players off guard.  At first glance it doesn't seem to have any centralizing effect.  However, the bishop is going to move to g7, where it will strike at the center squares on d4 and e5.  It is fairly difficult to challenge this bishop, and the fianchetto has proven a tough nut to crack.  This variation of the Sicilian is called the Accelerated Dragon.
At first glance White seems to have an advantage both in development and space.  Generally, such an advantage would prompt you to initiate an attack.  It is too early to do so now, and the challenge wll be to preserve this advantage while completing the rest of white's development.
Establishing the Maroczy bind, named after the great Hungarian master of old.  White is trying to prevent black from ever playing d7-d5.  White will maintain an advantage in space, but the extra pawn move allows black to start catching up in development.
Developing towards the center and protecting the e-pawn.  Now, 7. Nxc6 and 8. e5 is threatened.
Black spends a tempo (one unit of time) to defend against that threat.
An important refinement over 7. ...Bg7.  Black wants to force white's queen onto the d4 square where it will later be harrassed by black's bishop on g7.
White usually plays the bishop to e3 or g5 in order to have the d2 square available for the queen.
Now, Black threatens 10. ...Ng4 with a double attack (on white's queen and on the bishop on e3.)  White does not want to exchange the dark square bishop for the knight.  That would leave the bishop on g7 as the best minor piece on the board.
Typically, black tries for counter play on the queenside.  The bishop develops towards the center and attacks white's c-pawn.
Black wants to clear the back rank and connect his rooks.  One of the interesting things about the geometry of the chessboard, is that moving the queen to the edge, also activates it in the center.  Do you see how from a5, the queen attacks the key central squares d5 and e5, as well as the less crucial but still important squares c5 and f5?
White has maintained his advantage in space, but is now lagging a bit in development.  Black must try to take advantage of this soon or risk drifting into passivity.
Which rook belongs on the c-file?  Black is hoping to open more lines on the queenside, so leaves the rook on a8 where it is for now, and activates the other rook.
Securing the c-pawn, but it also represents an additional weakening of the dark squares in whites center and queenside.  White is counting on the bishop on d4 to compensate.
Black would love to be able to play b7-b5 at some point, and a6 increases his chances of doing so.
A move with multiple purposes.  It provides additional suppoprt to the knight on c3, discourages b7-b5 and assists f4-f5.  The f4-f5 push is the usual plan in these types of positions.
Probably not best.  Black is still thinking about b7-b5.  15. ...Ne8 was more prudent, and 15. ...b7-b5 more thematic.  In the latter line black sacrifices a pawn for piece activity, hoping to win it back under more favorable circumstances.
Redeploying the bishop to a more active post with tempo.
This was came as a surprise and was a big relief.  18. fxe5 keeps the pressure on and even 18. Bxe5 was to be preferred.  When you have an edge in space, generally speaking, you should avoid exchanges.  When you are cramped seek them out.
Black is very happy to get the queens off of the board.
After the exchanges any spatially advantage for white is much less important.  White's advantage in the endgame now shifts to a 3 on 2 pawn majority on the queenside.  Both sides will want to create a passed pawn, but only white's will be an outside passed pawn, which means the pawn will be on the other side of the board from the kings, and therefore more difficult to stop.
Pawns cannot move backwards.  21. ...e6 would restrict the bishop's mobility.
I think 22. Rfe1 is an improvement.  The threat is to simply capture on g4 and then on e7.  This would force e7-e6, which would be a concession on black's part.
When feasible always try to control the long diagonal (in this case the h1-a8 diagonal.)
It would be better to expand on the queenside with 25. a3 and then b3-b4.  You want to play on the side where you have the advantage.  White might as well waste no time trying to create an outside passed pawn.
Staying on the long diagonal and freeing up the e4 square for the knight.
Continuing with the exchange of rooks.
Black is happy to oblige.  The only danger was ceding control of the d-file to white and that is no longer an issue.
If I had to do it over again, I'd probably throw in 28. ...h6 first.
33. g5  is another reasonable try.  White is on the right path at last trying to create an outside passed pawn.
Either 33. ...h6 or 33. ...g5 was better.  Black is allowing white to hold his 4 pawns back with white's three.  An elementary mistake.
It might be better to keep the bishop on the board with 35. Be2.
With just one move, white has not only thrown away the win, but also the game.  Now, black is probably winning.  However, 37. ...h6 was STILL better!
38. g5 was the last chance.
This is all I considered at the time, but 41. g5 is winning for white!  If 41. ...Kxa4 42. Kc3!  Black has no moves!  42. ...Ka3 43. c5 creates the passed pawn and the win.  Unreal!
Nf6 would have been a little more aggressive. After ...Bb4 I could've put pressure on the middle. But instead I decide to keep this calm game as such.
Stopping a Knight or Bishop move to g5.
This move opens up my white-squared bishop and is great timing since my black-squared bishop is already in front.
I decided against the trade here as I felt my bishop's presence and pressure from the queen-side was worth preserving.
An even exchange, and I like where my bishop ended up.
Losing tempo to protect the b5 pawn.
I understand the reasoning to go all the way to f3. More open lines for the queen and leaving a spot for Be2. But I still think Qe2 would have been better. Protecting the bishop at d2 as well as the f2 pawn and keeping closer to the king. White is in defense mode now and needs to overprotect in order to gain a tempo for any kind of counter attack.
My first thought was Qc5 forcing his rook to b3 and then ...Be6 forcing his rook to abandon the knight at c3 losing a minor piece. I then thought I could trap the rook by first doing Be6. After I moved I realized I was better off following my first plan as it gauranteed a minor piece. White is still in big trouble here though.
A better move here would have been to retreat the knight to d1. White is desparate and trying to counter attack somehow.
White felt trapped here so tried to trade off some pieces. A better move would be Nb1 to protect the rook at a3 and the c3 square.
Winning the exchange.
This was not a good move after losing the exchange. I owned the d5 square.
Time for another attack. This move will win me the pawn at c2.
Once you are up in pieces, eliminate the opposing pawns. They are the only pieces that can win the game for white at this point, if one can manage to clear the end of the board.
Trying to cut off access to my knight.
This trade was not in white's best interests. It may save a pawn but two rooks bearing down on the king all alone is not a good situation.
The 'Anti-Sicilian', avoiding the open lines, has proven difficult for me to handle with black pieces in many games.
A thematic early d5 break, exploiting the absence and inability of white's QN to occupy c3.
Signaling a transposition into an e5-chain structure, more typical of the French defense or Caro-Kann openings. The more popular 4 ed, drawing out the black Q early, is trickier for me to handle.
Relieved of the burden of having to solve the problem of premature Q development which 4 ed would have caused, the black LSB is able to achieve a thematic e5-chain strategy: activating/exchanging off the 'bad' hemmed in LSB.
Reaching an e5-chain tabiya.
The plan for black is to increase Q-side dark square pressure while aiming for simplification into an endgame which favors his passed protected d pawn.
Keeping the heat on the dark squares, aiming to seize the h8-a1 long diagonal.
An only move, if black wants to achieve the strategic goal of simplifying into a clear and simple endgame where the extra knight is decisive.
The concepts of 1) opposition and 2) controlling the passed pawn's 'critical' squares with the K are the ideas which guide black to victory in the final sequence
e4 e5, very popular opening among "beginners". This often leads to an open game.   In open games it's important to have the bishop pair (so if you have the possiblity to exchange a knight for a bishop, you should consider it) because the bishop can control a complete diagonal when the center is open.
The Scotch game. White has 2 options: defending the knight with Be3 (not c3, because 5. ... Qh4 will give you problems) or running away. If you chose to run make sure don't lose a tempo or you'll delay your devellopment. Nb3 is good because black is forced to move his bishop again = no tempo lost. Nf3 is less good.
pinning the knight and threating Nd5.
No way, I'll exchange my bishop for that knight and getting his dark squared bishop and queen pointing at f2.
a5? Ofcourse I expected g5, but I realised that he still had a change to play g5 after Nd5.
Beginners mistake.  Not seeing the check by capturing the defender of the attacker, and winning a piece with tempo
c3 to create a spot (d4) where my knight can go
Better was Rxe6, changing a rook for a knight and bishop.
By the way I was black
if he goes Nxh8 i would take the rook and soon get checkmate.From now it's unstoppable.
If he blocks it with the queen he loses it however,if he blocks it with the bishop black goes
White has the king tucked away safely black has tried to take control of the centre
Black stands better, and now must exploit the material advantage
Black aims to control the e file
I look to develop my light-squared bishop.
Takes control of the square where I want to move my bishop to.
Maybe Bc4 was better.  This leads to a bishop exchange which screws my pawn structure.  Bc4 would lead to dxc4.
I am keeping my bishop on the board temporarily.  The idea here is to start an attack on his queenside.
Black wins this exchange: a knight and a bishop for a knight and two pawns.
Removes the pin on the knight.
And now we see the kings start to become open to attack.
I decide I would have a better chance of promoting this pawn if I advance it and do not take this pawn.
Better is Kf3, and after 48...Bc7 49. Kg4 Kxg6 I have a chance to draw or even win on a blunder by black.
?  That is going to cost a pawn, bishop, AND knight.  Slaughter of all the king's men.
Pd6 I think leads to a knight or bishop.  Though yeah, looks like you got Nc3.  Probably better.
deters e5, if now 5 d4, cxd, 6 nxd, a3
the point, and an attempt to complicate the position
Combination as planned--what is white to do? If the N is taken, cxb wins more material, and the N threatens the bishop defending the N on g5. White wisely decides to set a trap...
Suddenly white has some threats. Here black's best plan is to play d6, freeing the king and threatening Bf4 , but black decides to take the N.
now the stinger...if black moves to d8, bb6 is checkmate!! Black is forced to return the piece...
Set up Bd3 to attack h7, in absence of a knight on f6...
The GREEK GIFT is offered - classic sacrifice which, if accepted leads to exposed king if not mate.
Knight moves in. Unfortunately, 11.Ne7 allows this piece a very strong square.
With this move black leaves an opportunity to to exact an annoying pin on g5 as the KB is now blocked from retreating back to e7...However I needed to prepare my troops....
In prep for the d4 push....
An interesting move, forcing me to react which is not where I wanna be, I wanna be the the 1 forcing the issue....
As I am planning to castle Kingside I don't mind doubling up some pawns in order to create a file for a rook to work on later, this has worked for me often in the past, the open file can prove of more value than the doubled pawns hinder...
This move was pointless since I can't follow with an immediate b4 so this was the first mistake of the game I feel...
Making the best of those doubled pawns and opening a route up for my queen to enter the fray if need be....
Now my pieces are free to roam...
Stopping that annoying pin which would have been nice as I doubt my opponent would have been happy to open up the kings defenses with the follow up g5, so time would have had to have been spent unpinning the Queen...
coming to his Kings aide preempting the up coming strike...
This is a nice outpost and will take a few moves to shift......
I had the option of exchange here.....
Defending the b2 pawn...
This was dangerous in hindsight but i wanted to free up the defence of e2 without the worry of a + so I took the chance..
I wanted to switch this Knight to d5...
Now this knight gets to occupy the still warm f5 outpost threatening the future of the Rook on g8...
Realizing his rook was in peril my opponent thought it better to lose a piece rather than the exchange, I'm not sure this was the best move...
So I oblige and take whats on offer...
I've whittled the kings defences down and my position is strong, now i need to figure out how to deal the killing blow...
I spent a while trying to figure out which knight to secrete here, Nfe7 would have had the added bonus of covering the pawn on e4 with my queen but would relinquish  the grip I held on the g7 and would allow the rook to escape so....
I should have just taken the rook here but I wanted the knight covered from the gaze of the black queen and any trick it may have been exposed to had it been left en prise....
Had i taken the rook this capture may not have been given the chance to happen...
Had to protect the pawn and the rook isn't going anywhere, safety first!
I decided to take the offer as I felt I would be able to take out blacks extra pawns with the extra rook and knight I would have after the exchange..
Had to take it this time round...
keeping hold of that pawn, I may be a piece and exchange up but should my opponent muster the huge pawn advantage I may not be able to halt the advance, At least not before giving up my extra piece...
Not sure this was best, I would try to be taking advantage of the space for my pawns to move forward had I been black, this just serves to close the gap a little......
From 3-2 passed pawns and the more pieces that are exchanged off the more it suits me now...
A wasted move as the rook will be lost should it jump to the aide of the king after Rh7+....Those pawns were the only hope of a black win and he needs to concentrate on gettin em up the board...
Maybe going to the 8th rank would have been wiser, now the king is stuck in the center of the board with little cover and fewer allies...
Hammering the final nail in the coffin.....
And there we have it, A nice little OTB win for my club....Thx for reading and pls feel free to comment....
A cautious approach to the Sicilan
Not wanting to trade.  Both (6. dxe5 Qxd1+ (?!) 7. Kxd1 ... I go down a pawn but White cannot castle) and (6. dxe5 Qxe5+ 7. Be2 Be7 where White has minimal central influence) seemed unappealing to White I guess.
My Queen is not to be easily threatened and I take the opportunity to develop.
Pins and needles everywhere! It is wise the King(s) seek shelter before the pending melee.
Snap! The tension was too much to bear.
I thought the trade was (very slightly) beneficial because I isolated another of White's pawns and for the moment, the struggle for the light squares seemed deadlocked.
Trading Knights will allow me to develop my Bishop's potential.
My opponent prefers that neither of us has a good Bishop. Here he threatens a forked check on e7 to remove my Bishop.
A half-hearted attack on the b7-pawn.
Preferable to Bc6 which allows the forked check on e7 and isolates the b-pawn onto the c-file.
A near impregnable fortress is built here. White is surely annoyed at the awkward placement of his Bishop and c4-pawn. A fianchetto will be necessary at some point. At this moment I planned on an f5-break to trap the White Knight, fully control e4, creating a possible outpost there and delay White's Bishop from getting to the h3-c8 diagonal.
Not the strongest of forks but it will get the job done.
A little pressure on the runaway pawn.
I am currently teaching myself the "Stone Wall Attack" and all of the variations. This is just one of the many games I am using to practice this opening. My opponent doesn't follow what I felt he would do and you'll see that I abandon the Stone Wall pretty early.<n><n>However I lose some momentum and material early and feel that I should have lost this game do to some poor decisions on my part. My opponent doesn't take advantage of his two Bishops vs. my two Knight late and makes what a feel was a fatal error with a trade. <n><n>My opponent also either lost focus or completely undervalued pawns later and allowed me to crawl back into this game and ultimately win.<n><n>I give myself credit for hanging in and getting the Win but some bad decisions should have sunk me pretty early on.<n><n>Here we go.<n><n>D4 - Typical opening for The Stone Wall. I'm expecting Nc6 or d5.
g6- Uh oh, I Know I've seen this somewhere before... I'm perplexed as this doesn't open up the middle for black and w/ my pawns on Black if he fienchetto's his biship or even brings it to the H file he is blocked. I am bummed however as the pawn on G6 will effect my intended attack w/ the Stone Wall.<n><n>This should have been my first clue to drop the stone wall and adjust my opening.
However, as I am extremely new w/ this opening I know vary little variations and sadly continued to plunge on forward w/ Bd3. A better move might have been to Fienchetto my own bishop to g2 and take control of the long light squared diagonal that is unobstructed.
e4 - At this point I realize that my stone wall will not work and attempt to adjust my strategy a bit. My aim was to kick the knight off of f6 and to further hem in the Bishop on g7. However I should have kept him home for a few more moves and developed my two knights first.
d6 - Black finally comes to the party... This prevents me from being able to kick the knight off of F6. Just the beginning of my pains.
Nd7 - Develops and protects in move. Black has easily gained in momentum and I am disjointed to say the least. No support, protection or clear attacking lanes. My starting idea of using the Stone Wall has quickly fallen into Ciaos. While Black is a little bottled up and I am more open, I feel that I should lose this game, based on this position alone.
Nf3- Hey, I wake up and decide to bring in some protection.
b6- Not sure What Black is doing here also. Neither of us has attacked yet, so maybe he is leaving himself some options to castle Queen side. I felt that him getting his King to safety or opening up the middle was the better option here as it would have allowed him to take advantage of my poor support and positioning.
Rb8 - I won the ability to move the rook and prevent Queen side castling... Which is not even a remote possibility here. I'm giving away momentum in this game.
f6- Not sure, but White just couldn't pull the trigger on snatching the pawn. Maybe Black wanted to kick the Bishop off of the G5 Square.
Ngxf6- Black didn't want to trade bishops and didn't seem to want to open the D file. Possilby feared the Queen exchange and having to recapture w/ the King, which would totally prevent future Castling.
Bc6- Again going in w/ guns blazing w/ no backup. My thought process was to keep black hemmed in a little longer. Again, I am giving away momentum as Castling here would have been the better move.
0-0 - Black totally negated my Knight Pin to his king. Black is tidy and well defended. However he is sorely behind in development.
Qd2- I'm wanting to take out the black bishop patrolling the long diagonal on dark squares.
There it is. Black is now, not afraid of the Queen trade once his King is tucked safely away.
Nxd2.... What the @!#$# was I thinking????? Bd2 was the correct move here. I not only allowed black to open the middle, trade Queens, but game him a Bishop as a free parting gift. I'm so nice.
Nc5- Now Unless I castle to the Queen side, I have to move the Knight so that I can Castle next. No need to compound insult to injury here.
e5 - Up to this point black has played a very careful and solid game. I still am not sure why this move was made. I'm thinking he was baiting me into allowing him to pin my knight to my king. Fortunately I realized this before it was too late.
0-0 FINALLY!!! I get to safety! So I think. Now, I have bead on 3 of Blacks Pawns, I should get one on the next move.
Nce4- Curiously Black doesn't take his free pawn on c2, plus he temporarily blocks himself from it. Nor does he protect any of his threatened pawns. Its at this point that Black starts to slip in his advantage. Slowly but surely. Black undervalued the pawns in general. His and mine.
Nxe5 - So I take my "free" pawn. Plus I threaten the f7 square and limit the king. However my main goal is the split on the d7 square, but the Bf5 is a thorn in my side.
Nxc7- Stacking my Knight and Bishop was a huge mistake and costs me a Bishop.
I don't want to lose a piece for nothing so I attempet to get black to trade.
Kxd5- Had Black move his king, he could have gotten one of the bishop or knight for free w/ the trade.
Nxd5- Now I get out of my poor decision to stack the Knight and Bishop. However I am Bishopless, so the end game should be interesting.
Nxf2-Black uses a battering Ram to break through my defenses.
Ne7+ The Rook isn't going anywhere so I decide to go on the offensive a bit. Blacks King can't push and Attack Ne7 because of the Knight on e5. so his only two options are h8 or g7.
kxf2 - I don't want to mess around any further wit that Rook. Need to nab him now before it is to late.
Now comes the fun part. My two Knights vs. Blacks two Bishops. While we are equal numerically, black has the advantage if his plays i correct, as his bishops can control almost any square w/ this open board. Black should win imo.
Ng4- So I apply some pressure, hoping black makes a mistake w/ my knights. W/ Blacks light colored bishop hemmed in a bit by being on the 1st rank and behind my pawn, it allows me to have a little more freedom to move.
Nc6 - Still applying the pressure. Don't allow Black to mount any kind of attack, keep him focused on defending rather than advancing.
Ne5- putting the knight in the middle of the board, hoping for a mistake from my opponent (who clearly isn't all that comfortable playing against knights in the end game) I'm also applying some pressure on g6 pawn.
Bd6- At first glance this is a very powerful move as it pins my two pieces together. The flaw is that if Black takes, he will be trading a Bishop for a Knight. In this type of game he can't afford to trade either of his bishops as I can just move all of my other pieces onto the opposite color. I will happily take that trade if offered.
Kh6 - Now he starts to advance the king. However he is blocked from going any further because of the knight.
Kf4- The king out front to usher home any passed pawns if possible, and to keep Black from gaining any kind of control.
g3- W/ Blacks only bishop on light squares, I needed to get the final 3 pawns onto dark ones.
Bf1 - To little to late.
I can't trade my last knight at this point. First that would allow the Black king to move further into my territory and would severely hurt my chances of passing a pawn on either side. I must evade, but I'll pressure at the same time.
Again, to little to late.
Black now has very little he can do that doesn't allow me to have some kind of a foot hold. Everyone of my pieces are on dark squares and out of harms way.
Black attacks squares that I couldn't move into if I wanted to.
I again apply pressure onto g5 and e5. looking to advance there next turn.
Again, keeping Blacks white Bishop from being a factor and hemming in the black king.
Nd4 - I need to make my way over to the other side. This way I split the attention black can give to either side.
Ke6 - Now Black sees the delima and is attempting to thwart it.
Nb8, Nxa6 - A simple smash and grab. And With my pawn on B5 I even have my get away car available.
Kc6- Black has totally focused on the knight and is given up on preventing the White King from blocking his him from returning.
So I cozy on up to his nice little pawns.
Nc5- Jump in the get away car and make my escape.
Kd5- Black sets his eyes on evening the score.
a4 prevents a problem for Black. If he takes, he loses the pawn and allows a passed pawn that he will have sacrifice his bishop for to stop. If he doesn't then it passes anyway and Black is down a pawn.
nice trade and Black is sliding down the slippery slope as we speak.
Now Black is feeling the pressure. If the Bishop leaves his post to track down the wayward pawn, Black losses his last two remaining pieces.
Black sees a free pawn and rushes in to snatch him up.
Black finally relizes his doom and gives up the ghost!<n><n>Like I said earlier, I should have lost this game and probably would have had Blacked valued his pawns and bishops a little more. Good Game Black.
If you want to see the computer analysis with the game: go to this link http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14258262&fb=1&rnd=0.36723336512684035
?! I actually think 10...Ke8 is more safer than the move played. The best move in the last two projects 10...Kc6 is not playable due to the pawn,A reason why White has betterr counterplay for the sacrifice
Another alternative is 11...Kb6. Both prevent the royal fork on e6 by the knight
the king to b6. The king is now trapped on the queenside. Both sides must be very careful in this position.
opening the g1-a7 diagonal to the White DSB.
!? Computer recommends taking the pawn on b4 but I do not think it is safe. The diagonal is opened again as well as the b-file. <n><n>The computer line goes 14...cxb4 15.Be3+ Kc6 16. Nd2 Nd7<n><n>an alternative to 16. Nd2 would be 16.a3!? I think this movee keeps in spirit of the opening. if 16...bxa3 17. Nxa3 followed by 18. Rb1 would be very uncomfortable for the Black player
?! but surely 15...Kc6 is better. The pawn would then restrict some of the open lines to the King and the King arrives on c6 as stated was better earlier
? A mistake in reply, 18. Nc4+! gives White the advantage. 18...Ka6 19. Ne5! forces Black to give up the Queen with 19...Qxe6 20. Bxe6 Nxe6. Material is even but White has an development advantage and Black has an exposed king
? This is the reason the sac works. <n>but better is<n>21. Nxc2 exd3 (for some reason the comp does not want to take the pawn even though I think it is best.) 22.Bf1 b6 23. Nb4+ Kb7 24.Nxd3 is a pawn up for White.<n><n>but all hope is not lost for Black. His king is safe and White's pieces are all of the sudden all behind the 4th rank.<n><n>24...e6 is the best way to stay in. Now Black has possible threats like ...Qe4 and Bb4+<n>In a way the roles are reversed.
attacking the rook and creating more space for the King by closing the b-file
alas,the fight continures
? unthinkable! Black gives the rook back. My play was not very convincing in this game. At this point I thought I lost the win
? little did I think that I could win the Bishop! 35...Qb3+! If 36. Kg4 Qd1+ and if King moves to second rank. 36. K?2 36...Qc2+ 37. King moves to the third rank Qd3+
Giving checks White's King is on the run now.<n><n>Now we have another situation. Two rooks for a queen and a pawn. Black has two passers on the Queen side but White can create a passer in the center. So now it comes down to who can mate first or who can get their pawn to the Queening square. Most likely the latter.
It is better to move 39.Ke3 Now the King will be stuck on the g and h files
Now the rook is pinned and Black regains the advantage due to the mistake on move 39. But can he keep it?
?! Black can seal the deal by 43...h5! using the same motive on move 40. 44.Kxh5 Qh3+ 45. Kg6 Qxe6+ 46.Kh5 Bxg5 wins handily for Black
1...c5. The Sicilian. I am not secure in the Sicilian, but I decided to play along with what I knew and throw some curves.
Protecting and developing.
Now Black has three pawns and a minor in the center versus my one pawn and two minors. Black is cramped and underdeveloped. White can castle and continue developing. Perhaps get the Dark Squared Bishop to a3, where it can peek into Black's base.
Attacking the vulnerable e4 pawn. Nbd2 solves this problem, and develops. It can be argued that it would be a bad move, since it blocks in the Dark Bishop, and that may very well be why I played Ng5, but if White wants to put the Bishop on a3, then Nbd2 is best.
7....d5! This move undoubles Black's pawns, opens the center, attacks the Bishop and the e4-pawn, and opens the a3-f8 diagonal for Black's Dark Bishop.
Hitting/pinning the e5-pawn and putting indirect pressure on the King.
Booting the Knight to preferable f3, where he can add pressure to the center.
Pinning and developing. Black can now castle. White needs to force Black's hand to keep his King in the middle.
Now White has a ironfisted grip on the center, with a Rook in the center, and the Knight ready to move to e4. But White isn't dead quite yet. Not until he overlooks Rxh5.
17....O-O. Nope. Too little, too late. The Queen and d3-pawn can be forked, and Black has castled into a trap.
The King is feeling the heat now.
Three pieces --Rook, Queen, and Dark Bishop -- bear down on Black's King.
Mate in one, if Black doesn't watch it.
34.gxh7+ is better that Rxh7. Now the King must move to h8, or White will Promote.
34....Kh8 is the only viable option. It will now be stuck there until the Rook can come to aid.
35.Re1!! is the final nail in the coffin. Black cannot play the desired 35....Re7, because 36.Rxe7. If 35....Rxe1, then 36.Kxe1, and White can calmly eat all of Black's remaining pawns, then promote. <n><n>My opponent resigned here. Thank you for reading. Please leave any and all critical comments, since this is a training annotation.
White went to trade the knight with the black bishop.
This move of the queen, stop white to do so. Cause white doesn't want to lose one of the bishops.
So white tried to establish a defense for the bishop.
Moved the queen to avoid to be captured. (If white went for Nxg7+, then bishop would have been able to capture the queen)
White opts for the Main line advanced variation. The pluses of this move is that White gains a huge pawn center that carves significant space in blacks territory. If white is allowed  to solidify his centre then he is guaranteed better endgame chances. In the end though 3. e5 is considered inferior as it is not hard for black to equalize by undermining e5 with  ...c5 and ...f6
?? definately not a good move because knights belong in the center. The main line continues 3. ...Bf5! highlighting the advantage that the caro-kann has over the French
?? again a bad move that shuts in his light bishop. Still ...e6 is solid enough and creates the potently for a nice outpost for his knight on f5. Now Black's only way to develop the light bishop is ...b6 and ...Bb7
Since black has failed to develop his pieces white can play energetically with his pawns. The main idea is to play f4-f5 or g2-g4 if black plays Nf5.
Not 6. BxN exf5 when black can continue with ...Be6 with a strong defensive position. 6. Nf3 defends d4 and threatening g2-g4 kicking the black knight out of f5
?? moving the knight to the side of the board is rarely a good move. The b8 knight always goes to d7 in the caro-kann. The idea behind Nbd7 is that it supports a ...c5 which is black's main form of counterplay in the caro-kann.
supporting d4 and denying black the g4 sqaure. If 7. G4 black can counter with Ng4 checking the bishop
?? a time waster as black has nothing to fear from the immedaite Ng5. Therefore, because white has a solid centre black needs to weaken it with 7. ...c5 with better defensive position
gaining space and time as well as driving away an attack of d4.
I am not too worried about black taking on d4 because 10. ...cxd4 11. cxd4 keeps my center intact and clears c3 for my other knight.
Black really is trying here but what can he do? The answer is to continue to attack d4 with 10. ...Nc6!?
checking the bishop and blasting open the f-file.
Threatening 16. Nxf7 With a massive attack on the king
Black intends to meet Nxf7 with Ne8 defending the weak f6 square.
pinning the bishop
Putting the question to the bishop!
Changing queens make it easier for me to win!
It´s hopeless for black now!
Transposing to B34, accelearted fianchetto, exchange variaten.
?! This move confused me, it allows me to do the next move and gain a greater influence on the center
securing the center and preparing castling
The knight on the has a nice and cosy home on f5, although  e4 would probably be a bit nicer
Getting the queen at a more active spot, provoking the knight to come back and white to lose tempi
Now black has build up quite some pressure on the Queen's side while it's King's side is simply protected by the pawnstructure and the minor pieces. Right now I don't see a lot white could do to attack
Since white has barricaded itself on the Queen's side, time to switch to the King's side. Possible attacks could be Be5, Nh4 or even a march of the pawns
Now this is the situation in which I saw the opportunity to greaten the control over the map. White has right now a good grip of the first 3 ranks and parts of the fourth rank, but the last move allows me to diminish White's influence to a quarter of the board.
Time to drive the King and all of White's pieces to a single location.<n>GameKnot's Analysis however says this move, followed by Kd3 and Qg3 + allows white to return to the game. White could now apply huge pressure on the Kingsside
And the pawns start marching.The Bishop has 4 Squares, the Queen has 3, the Rook on e1 has 2 and the other rook has 3. The knight is left with only one field. White is barely able to move.<n><n>This is again marked as inaccuracy. Which I dont really get yet :D
White is desperate to keep the queen away, only limiting his defensive options. (Again marked as inaccuracy because the queens seems to be a more flexible defender)
Since he took with the King, there are many options, but I found Bh6+ to be the most effective. He can sacrifice his Knight or return to c2, traping him again<n><n>Actually this allows a Mate in 11:<n>31. Kxd2 Rxc3 32. Re7 Rxd3+ 33. Ke2 Rg3 34. Qh1 d3+ 35. Kd1 Qg4+ 36. Kd2 Bh6+ 37. Kc3 Qc8+ 38. Rc7 Qxc7+ 39. Qc6 Qxc6+ 40. Kb2 Bg7+ 41. Ka3 Qa6#
Nc3 and then Bb4 would be a nimzo-indian round-about, but this game doesn't take that direction. Being a transposed d-pawn opening though, it is a good idea to get the c pawn to c4 and the knight out behind it asap.
this looks like too many pawn moves with no development.  If Nc3 was in place, then the pawn could have gone to d4 right off...
another pawn move, presumably preparing d5, but it wasn't needed (and now blocks the knight.
total forgoing of development to get space. The problem is that if the pieces aren't out there the opponents pieces can invade behind the pawn wall.
here comes the d5 'break move' but it doesn't really break anything. Both sides are dangerously underdeveloped and and black at least can castle in 2 moves...
scrambling to prepare for castling. Prevents e5 which WOULD be a break move for black (albeit a dangerous one).
Why not the other knight....develop a piece and then exchanging knights would have doubled black's pawns. The only thing saving White so fare is that black isn't developing either. White may have planned to kick the knight with f3, but there are now dangerous threats with Qh5.
black opens a file, but it will take a while to use it.
Immediate checkmate threat, plus threatens bishop sacrifice on c5 with pressure on the unprotected a-rook.
Black takes his time in castling in order to get a better bishop.
now black castles (finally) but white can connect his rooks more quickly.
this stops the threat, but the c5 pawn is weak. If the knight has to go into service to defend c5, the king will be woefully blocked in....
good move - double threat on e4 and the queen can defend f2 if she has to... Black's queen would like to go to g5 and threaten Bh3, but the double attack on e4 prevents this.
white grabs the free pawn and double protects the weak c5. However this may prove to be a poisoned pawn as it was keeping the black bishop forever blocked in.
knight/queen combinations are deadly...white has to keep the knight out of the kingside. h3 would do it.
the problem here is that black gets the open file...two of them. The queen can get out of the way and switch in a rook on f8.
Re7 may have tied black up more and threatened using the good d pawn.
now black has a skewer on the rook and queen.....
Qb1 would have been better....Qx on b1, RxQ, N takes a free knight on d2 or an exchange on e5 and NxN on e4....white at least has some counter-play with Q to b6 or b7 and using the advanced d-pawn.....instead a horrible windmill ensues....<n>actually looking at this again, the windmill would have happened with Qb1 anyway....!
if white played K the other way to f1 it would be an immediate checkmate.
beautiful windmill.....this game goes to show the power of queen/knight combinations. One of the benefits of having 2 bishops is the ability to exchange one of them at a propicous juncture in order to get rid of a nasty knight if need-be. Could white have kept the 2-bishop advantage instead of exchanging white bishops at move 19? It seemed reasonable at the time, as white valued the black bishop due to black being weak on black squares.....but maybe 19.Be2 was the better move.<n>White played a good game,no real obvious errors until the end when (as it usually does) tactics took over. Probably 25.Re5 was the loosing mistake.
i take the middle and play as if i was white pieces
knight before bishop
defend and open diagonal knight move to e7
i thought about bishop b4 check  but decided to get my knight to c6 then move my bishop
but its not going thier now have to defend center
i put this pawn here to put my bishop on b4 so i can castle
attack he wants to trade
theirs no open files and i can defend with bishop to e7
get bishop out to open back rank and pin knight
munch knight stopping king to castle
can't go bishop c5 queen take rook. i did not know why i did not take the bishop missed it
not preaching to me now
attack if axb qxb  and take bishop
retreat and attack
4.Nf3 is also playable, but gives black a chance to play the sharp Blumenfeld Gambit, 4...b5!?  I prefer the white side of the Benoni to the white side of the Blumenfeld.
Keeping the black LSB away from g4. In the modern Benoni, black usually has trouble developing his LSB due to white's grip on the central light squares. One common plan for black is to exchange it early for white's N after white plays Nf3, via ...Bg4->Bxf3. With the text move, this option is no longer available, and there's hope of black's LSB getting in the way of coordinating his other pieces.
A thematic move for black, attempting to expand on the Q-side.
Probably best, aiming to restrain black's Q-side play.
Putting immediate pressure on the center. More common is 8... Bg7.  Either way, black needs to find counterplay before white's center pawns can become dangerous.
? Probably an attempt to prevent Bf4, and also creating options for the fianchetto bishop. In some continuations, ...f5 is useful, too. But IMO the N is misplaced here, and cedes too much central control. 12... Ne5 is probably best.
I also considered 14.Be2, but decided to eliminate black's most active piece. With this N gone, black's pieces look uncoordinated, while White's are well placed to commence operations in the center, taking advantage of the central pawn majority.  If the black N is allowed to remain on e5, black will play for an eventual ...c4 and ...Nd3, possibly redeploying the other N to c5 along the way, which is a typical plan for black in this opening.
White can now launch an attack, gaining tempo on both the black N and Q.
?! Solving the LSB problem, but giving up control of e6 which encourages white's reply.  Black's best is probably 18... Ne8, preventing 19.e5. Black's counterplay has to come on the Q-side, so after 18... Ne8 black should play for ...Rc8 and ...c4, or the previously-mentioned ...Rb8 and ...b5.
! the bone in black's throat, and the real point behind Nb5. The B controls e7, and the N will be able to control e8 from either c7 or d6. That makes the pawn on e6 fatal for black.
Black resigns, as there is no way to stop the a-pawn.
The fiachetto is probably the best structure against the London attack. This doesn't mean I won't play my favorite plan against it. The first thing to do is to block the action of a future black bishop... on f5! The black squared bishop will aim to a solid pawn wall (c3), and it is not dangerous itself.
This move is necessary so, in case of Af5, g4. Of course, the side-effect is to provide a square for the bsb in case of an early Nh5.
I decide to sacrify the pawn wall against the bsb by providing a block against the wsb with d5.
Tempting him to try to exploit the pin over the f3 knight.
My plan should have been h4, here, trying to attack soon his king. This moves allows him to open my future castling on the queenside.
So I prevented it. The idea is to castle queenside (or Kd2, also possible) and get my rooks on his king. But it is not a straight-forward plan.
I was almost forced to attack a bit too soon.
In a hurry to preserve the attack.
I didn't see here the threat Qf4... now, I tried a lot of ways to preserve my attack, but they doesn't work. Qg8+, Ke7, h7 would be a good try, but Qf4+ and then QxRh2 destroys me.
The advance of the d pawn doesn't lead me to recover the pawn. Again, I have to lose one tempo defending c3, and this gives him the time to go Rh8, and my pawn is lost. I calculated if in this case the d pawn could have brought me something, but it was not so... so I resigned.
Interesting .... Normal is 6...e6.  Hendrik explained that this has the advantage of preventing White from answering 6...e6 with 7.a4, which is not a move I've contemplated before.  As played, we trasnpose to the normal line anyway.
Possibly a wasted move as the B soon has to move again.  This move does prepare the possibility of Q-side castling and appears to reduce the exposure on the a7-g1 diagonal, but in some variations the B itself becomes a liability as it is unprotected.  The Nd4 can become pinned against it.
The pawn evades the attack and, in turn, attacks Black's N.  The main alternative would have been 11. Qf3 but this ties the Q to the e-pawn's defence and pins the pawn against the Q, reducing its scope for involvement in attack.
Hendrik's dilemma was whether to play this swap or just to retreat the N immediately, thereby attacking the e-pawn.  We looked at that option afterwards but came to no firm conclusion.
I also considered 13. Qh5 but after 13. ...g6 the Q would have had to move again and the e-pawn would have been lost.
This natural move threatens to win the e-pawn.
As noted earlier, the B now has to move again to defend the e-pawn, which has become a bit of a liability and is the focal point of the game at this stage.
So Black takes the opportunity to exploit the vacated diagonal.
The Q avoids the threatened discovered attack and bolsters the defence of the e-pawn.
As the attack on e5 is getting nowhere, Black changes focus, threatening to swap for White's long-term asset, the WSB, and also opening up the d-file for his rook.
Back pops the B to pin the N against Black's Q.  The e-pawn is no longer the focus, which has shifted to the Q-side, where Black is poised to counter-attack
Black relieves the pin and renews the attack on the e-pawn
I was rather proud of this move, exploiting the half-open f-file and attacking the Nc5.  If Black takes the e-pawn with his N, White retakes and has a dangerous attack on f7, so, if Black recaptures on f5, White penetrates deep into Black's position on f7, with plentiful attacking options..
Black completes his mission to remove the WSB, also giving White doubled pawns, a long-term liability.
I also contemplated cxb3 so that I wouldn't have to defend the c2 pawn, which was already vulnerable to a revealed attack by Black's Q, pinning my N to c3. However, I decided that it was more important to follow the old adage of capturing towards the centre, allowing my c-pawn to contest control of the d3 square.  The move I should have considered in more detail than I did was 19. Bb6!?, skewering Q and R.  Would Black then have taken on a1 or moved the Q?
Black's move implicitly acknowledges the error on move 15, avoiding the skewer and defending f7.
Now White occupies the open d-file, which Black must be chary of contesting because of the aforementioned skewer.
So instead he attacks the vulnerable c-pawn, while also revealing the power of the Bb7.  It would have been dangerous to take on e5 as White would have been able to pin the N with 21. Bf4 and pile up pressure with 22. Rfe1.
A wasted move that allows Black to set up his own mating threat (still remote but it ties White's pieces up).
White has effectively just given Black a free move to apply pressure to White's king.
Black increases the pressure on the c-file.  He could have contested the d-file but presumably did not want to swap rooks or have to retreat his B to d8 to recapture.
Despite extensive post-game analysis, we couldn't refute this surprising thrust.  Unfortunately I can't remember all the variations but 26 ...Qc5 was the most challenging.  We decided in the end that Black had found the best response but some of the variations I've looked at since perhaps suggest otherwise.
Seeing that my pawns were worse and that my attack had failed to give me a conclusive attack, I offered the draw.  For Black to avoid the perpetual, he would have to give up material, so he accepted: the only way to avoid repetition would have been to play 34....Kg7, when 35. Nxg5+ wins back a pawn but Black still has counter-chances.
The Flohr variation, widely recognized as to most solid approach for white... Spasski - Fischer 1972, game 13, continued with 4. ... g6?! 5. Bc4? (correct is Ng5!) Nb6 6. Bb3 Bg7, and white has nothing... Fischer won, unjustly... In game 19, Fischer continued with 4. ... Bg4 5. Be2 c6? (correct is e6) 6. Ng5? (too early, correct is c4) Bxe2 6. Qxe2, dxe5, 7. dxe5 (this is supposed to be Nxe5) e6 8. 0-0 Nd7 and drawed... White must learn from this...
It is too early for black, to whip up an attack against c2, via Nc6/Bf5 and Nb4...<n><n>This is the whole idea, behind blacks approach in Alekhine...<n><n>After Nc6, Bb5. After straightaway Bf5, Bd3, or Bb5+, c6, Bd3...<n><n>Nb4 can still be met with a3, after Nc6/Bf5...<n><n>White opens possibilities for Ng5, so it has to be pinned...
Highly inaccurate. This spoils all chances for Nc6, the only successfull parade in case of c4, Nb4!...<n><n>Black had to play 5. ... e6 (release Bf8, in case of exd6, and prepare dxe5, plus 0-0) 6. c4 (forced, if white wants to hold the initiative; after 6. 0-0 Nc6 7. c4 Nde7 black can break up all tensions), Nb6/e7... Nb8 becomes a burdon from now on...
Also possible is 6. 0-0 dxe5 (e6, c4, Nc7, Qb3), 7. Nxe5... White prefers to postpone castling, and gains tempo in development, using clear threats...
Again, black loses tempo. After 8. ... Bxe2, 9. Qxe2 e6 (N8d7, c5!, Nxe5, dxe5, Nd5, e6!) 10. 0-0 N8d7 11. Ndf3 is surely not in blacks best interrest...<n><n>After 9. ... Qxd4?! 10. Ndf3 Qc5 (Qd6, Ng5!) 11. a3! f6 (to avoid Ng5) 12. b4 Qd6, 13. c5!<n><n>I would say pawn d4 is pretty poisonous...
The crown on the little combination, for white...<n><n>Black has sincere development problems:<n><n>9. ... N8d7 seems logical, but is - still - met with 10. Qb3! After 10. ... Nxe5 11. dxe5, the threat c5 becomes nasty.<n><n>10. Nxd7 Qxd7, looks promising but it is not part of whites plan...<n><n>9. ... f6 is met with 10. c5 fxe5 11. cxb6 Qxb6 12. Nxe5 Qb4+, 13. Kf1! (remember this) e6 14. a3!...
At least, black has Bb4+...<n><n>That is what he thinks...<n><n>Black will have to wait a long time now, to be able to develop Nb8, thanks to 5. ... c6...
Black has to do something, in order to be able to castle at some point, but not too early... <n><n>After 10. ... f6, 11. Nef7, white is right...<n><n>After 10. ... Bg6, 11. Bh5!, the problem only grows bigger...<n><n>Now, after 11. Bd2? Qxg5! 12. Bxb4 Qxg2 13. Bf3 Qh3, shortly followed by f6...<n><n>White has only one option...
King's Knight back at f6... Probably the most solid continuation...<n><n>After straightaway 15. h5, at least there is Be4...<n><n>After 14. ... Nd7, 15. h5 Nxe5 16. dxe5 h6 17. hxg6 hxg5 18. Qc2!, black is in trouble for sure...
After 16. ... Qe4, for sure 17. h5 Nbd7 18. Nxd7 Nxd7 19. hxg6 fxg6 20. g5...
A rigourous way to lose material: King Alekhine's Knight travels to d5 for the third time; trying to avoid Be3, this time.<n><n>The natural reaction would be 18. ... Nbd7, to avoid just Qxa8. Follows 19. Nxd7 Nxd7 20. Be3 (b4, Qc3!, leads to complications) Qe7 21. Rd1! (stronger than directly Ne5) Rad8 22. Ne5 Be4 (finally!) 23. Rh3! winning Nd7... There is no grace for Nb8...
Again, Ng5 saves the day... After Nxe5, g6! white loses his edge... We have to keep pushing; we are - technically - still in the opening stage of the game! Both sides are still not fully developed, and allready at war... The following is - again - forced... Bc2/Bg6 (to maintain control over h7) is met with Nxe6, Rf7, Nxg7/hxg7... After 25. ... Bd5 (else Nxe6), 26. hxg7 Rf6 (else Rxh7) 27. Bd3 seals the fate of h7...
Still, also white is playing a forced continuation, from 19. Qxa8 and onwards, trying to prove his point.<n><n>All other moves lead to g6 now, or - worse - to gxh6, and eventually to Nb8-d7-f6. <n><n>We have no choice, than to present black with another forcing; Rf8 has to remain on the f-file to keep the pressure on pawn f2, else Rxh7 and blacks King is a sitting duck.<n><n>After 26. ...

Bd3 (prevents e5-e4 for the time being, thanks to Ng5) Bd4/Nd7 (at last) 28. Bxh7+ Kxg7 29. Bc2, ... 30. a4...
For some reason, black still believes in keeping f2 under pressure, and buckles.<n><n>27. ... Kf6 (else Rxe7) breaks up the pressure on f2, so 28. Bd3, followed by Ne4+... 27. ... Kg6 28. Rxe7 Rxf2+ 29. Ke1 e4 (Rf8, Bd3+, e4) 30. Nxe4 Bxe4? 31. Rxe6+... See above for further variations...
All book until now. This strange move is being encountered more often for some reason, perhaps to attack on f4. It allows white to double the c pawns as well, but that is not the best, since the c6 knight should remain a target. The best move for white is the most active move.
Nice little idea to break open the center immediately and start an attack. By move nine, I have offered up a pawn to the opponent twice already. If you see a sacrifice for a gain in activity, you should always just play it, after calculating the basic variations. Since gaining activity is the main goal of chess, you will be doing the right thing. Usually, the opponent cannot use a pawn actively until the endgame. Most players are afraid to sacrifice activity unless it leads to a direct attack against the opponent's king. They are under the delusion that the opponent can simply neutralize their activity and trade to an endgame, where their material is decisive. Certainly that CAN happen, and the activity is a temporary advantage. Yet it is a much greater advantage than a pawn, and can easily lead to a quick win as well as gaining other permanent advantages. There are countless obstacles a player needs to pass before consolidating a pawn advantage. Also, it is much harder to find good moves when you have less activity, because that implies a defence. The attacker just makes threats, while the defender needs to check the opponent's tactics and think much harder.
By the way, when I played 9.f5, I did not know whether or not the sacrifice is objectively best. However, I knew that it was the right decision to increase my activity. If a sacrifice increases your activity, you should calculate the main lines, then play it. Deep intuition and other grandmaster like skills are not needed to play a sacrifice.
White is now gaining a lot of activity in the position, and the removal of the f pawn has freed the rook and the dark squared bishop. The position is very open, so we should do piece play in the center.
The first step to make a successful attack is to 1.Gain Piece Activity, more than your opponent. If your opponent has the better activity, he will easily counter your weaker forces and repulse your attack. But your more active pieces will overwhelm the defense easily if they are more active than them. Gaining activity is simple: Develop your pieces on the squares where they are most advanced and can also go to other forward squares. Also, do not capture the opponent's pieces unless you can get a tactical advantage, since that will increase your opponent's activity while decreasing yours. By the way, notice I am not talking about doubled pawns, open files, and space etc. The chess books offer these ideas to think about a position, but it is too much. All these ideas are smaller aspects of activity. Doubled pawns, if really weak, will always reduce the activity of your pieces or allow the opponent's pieces to become active by attacking the weakness. Open files, if occupied naturally give you activity. Just thinking about activity in general is much more useful for most class players to avoid getting too confused.
We will now attack on the kingside, since we have a solid grip on the center.
Mistake, creating the weaknesses around the kingside. As you can see, the dark squared bishop's activity is increased, and the queen can suddenly go to the dark squares. The light squared bishop seems to be deactivated, but that is not true. The bishop is still hitting at the kingside, and preventing the h and f pawns from moving forward, since it would be more effective if they did.
Seems so natural and strong, preparing ...Bf8. However, here is another rule: When you have activity advantage, you must be on the lookout every turn for combinations and tactical shots. Activity creates these tactics. ...f6 was stronger, even though it weakens the kingside.
The best move in the position, although it takes Shredder only a few seconds to see it. Taking with either the h or f pawn causes black to lose horribly. The second stage is 2.Turn your activity into an attack by gathering your pieces to the area and make threats. Moves Bd3 and Qd2 served that purpose. 3.The decisive combination is when you break the opponent's position and undergo a tactical operation, right now.
The best countershot. Now my opponent expected 18.Rf3 or Bd3, but not the move I played.
Very strong move against the king, destroying it's cover completely and opening it to the mercy of the ideally placed attacking pieces that white has. You may ask: Why did he play this? Why did he not just consolidate his pawn advantage? Well, I knew that black would be under serious pressure here, and that he would make further mistakes after this Tal Like sacrifice. In open positions, attacking is much easier than defending, since the numerous attacking possibilities each need to be counted and prevented, while the attacker simply makes threats and find tactics. Even though not objectively correct, this move is really not risking much. Many masters would not find the best moves in the variations, which computer says only draws for them at best.
The best move again, and easy to find.
Black is now losing decisive material in all lines, so he gave up. As a summary on the attack, we need 3 steps usually. <n>1.Gain Superior Activity-Put your pieces forward as much as you can, and restrict the opponent's activity.<n>2.Convert-Use your superior activity to create threats. The concentration of pieces on an area is the best way to do this.<n>3.Decisive Blow-Once you have a concentration of pieces and create all sorts of threats, sooner or later you are bound to have a decisive combination to blast the opponent to pieces. You should always be on the lookout for tactics, but think about possible combinations on every turn once step 1 is achieved. Sometimes it is not always so easy to just follow the 3 steps- there are more, and this is the general way to do it. Your opponent will also try to gain activity and attack you. At some point, you will have contact, and the more active side will prevail. That is why activity is the #1 thing in chess.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Pawns are the soul of chess!  They are certainly not to be taken lightly.  They are potential queens.  If you are able to keep a one pawn advantage all the way through it can therefore be decisive.  It certainly was in this game!  For the want of three rating points I would have clocked up only my third near-Expert Victory.  All the same, it was a big win because William absolutely Blitzed me (pun intended!) in my first game as white against him.  In the second, I got away with a Houdini-Style draw.  In this game, however, the position looked even until I somehow managed to win a pawn in the middlegame.  God only knows how I managed to hold on to this precious one point advantage but I did.  Pieces were exchanged and I ended up in a Q & P ending with an outside passer.  Even in such an advantageous position, Glenda just could not stop defending, right to the end.  However, she was nursing my a pawn through to becoming Glenda2.  William could not stop this promotion and resigned on the grounds of Ruinous Loss of Material.  So, how did this all happen?  Well, let us start with the Reti Opening, which is 1. Nf3.
7. ...... d5 - after both kings have been tucked away, a strike from Yours Truly in the centre.
12.  ....... Nc5 - for one moment it looks as though I am hanging my knight.  But look further, that d4 pawn is pinned!  I will leave you, the Inquest Jury to spot the unit that that pawn is pinned to.
16. ...... Qxd4 - wheew!  What a plethora of exchanges!  Incredibly, under my board the material count registers plus one to me!  Also, just look where Glenda is!  That is not her usual location in the middlegame against Class A oppo. and above.  She is usually defending something on the first or second rank.  Can Glenda stay aggressive and keep me on that Yellow Brick Road to Expertdom?  Or will The Wicked Witch of the West stand in my way? We shall see.
18. ..... Rab8 - Glenda has been driven back and I am now having to defend my b pawn.  I need to hang on, grimly!
27. ..... Nxa4 - now, here is that outside passer I am talking about.  The Witch is now en prise.  That vital precious pawn on a5 cannot be taken free of charge by the Witch because Glenda is defending it!
30. Qe6 - The Witch tries to get as close to Henry as possible.  However, her only means of support is that lsb on f3.  Thankfully, I will ensure that a line-up of those pieces along the a2-g8 diagonal is not an issue for me.
34. cxd5 - we are now in a Q & P ending after my knight and William's lsb have been traded off.  I am tempted to take that nice juicy pawn on d5, but I eschew it.  Do you the Inquest Jury see why?
38. ..... a2 - the final push and William waves the white flag.  There is absolutely no way he can stop Glenda2 from appearing on the board.  He can trade his queen for the pawn but that still leaves Glenda on the board.  Either way, William will be a queen to the bad and Old Matey isn't too far away.  Thankfully my games level is gradually reducing and I am able to spend more time analysing my games and getting into a "Freeze Funk" less and less and I am having more time to make my moves.  Anyhow, I hope you all have had a lovely weekend!  Bye for now - Joanne
4. Bg5 is a rare line.  Usually the bishop comes out later.  The main line is 4. cxb, a6 when white can choose to take a second pawn or push to b6.  The push is best in my opinion with white gaining the center and finding dynamic play with kingside attacks offsetting black's queenside hold.  In fact, there are many games where black doesn't find an active plan and resorts to defense.
8. Nb1 holds a better future for the knight allowing Nd2 and support of the e4 advance.
Instead, 16. a3, bxa 17. Rxa, RxR 18. bxR, Qa8 19. Qb3, Qa5, ect. or 16. Nd2, Qc7 17. f4 and g4 with a normal kingside expansion.  The first line is better due to the white infiltration in the black camp on the queenside, while the second will cause an all or nothing situation for white.  The semi-open a-file coupled with the bishop on f6 become a big deal in this game and I think white needed to open lines for his own major pieces with 16. a3.
16... Qc7 is better than Bxa1.  Firstly, the bishop is a way more powerful piece than the simple defender.  Secondly, with the bishop gone the black king feels a bit airy.  Sacs on g6 become a real threat.  For example:  16... Bxa1  17. Rxa1, and now f5 should be played, although, g4 followed by Nh4 may give black headaches.  If 17... Re8, then 18. Bxg6 with white having both drawing and winning chances.  Taking on a1 gives white the initiative.  Who wants to give up a positional grip to be attacked!  After black provides protection for his king with the queen on f8 or g7, then Bxa1 makes sense.
24... Bxf3!!  This move makes it possible for black to blockade the powerful queen and bishop and remove a potential attacker while preparing pressure against the weak f2 square.
26... Qf8! is a good move.  She wasn't doing much on the back rank and trippling on the a-file is useless.  On g7 the queen can defend and reinforce the positional grip for black.
28. g3 held very little promise.  The push f4 takes a ton of preparation and black can neutralize whites efforts by trading pieces on the back rank.  Maybe a better plan was to sit tight with 28. Rf3.  28. Bh5 with hopes of blockading on the white squares leads to 28... Bf4 and the "pigs" are let out of there pen to play on the second rank with Rd2 and Raa2.
With the bishop on d4, white's king feels a breeze beginning to blow on f2.
Trading rooks leads to an easily won endgame.  No further comments needed.
Still no move to prepare e5 (which will follow right away!). Prepares fianchetto for the blacksquared bishop. Perhaps my opponent was planning on Bb2 to build up pressure on the diagonal.
A not well prepared and early e5. The move that is often kind of a decision in the game...<n>Leaves the d4 pawn weak (in addition to g2)
Since I had to go somewhere and due to the lacking Sc3 my knight gets a cosy home at d5. Perhaps xe5 would have been the better decision. Also the Bishop is locking on d4 and a1
After the exchange I'm a pawn up my Bishop is attacking the rook!
Letting the Queen join the attack.
Another move with the bishop... just one white minor piece has moved!  (although the blacksquared bishop shows his influence already:))
Building up preassure. Not sure if it is the best move for black.
Seems natural, but:?? Fritz notes: Qf3! This attacks the knight(!) and strenghens the preassure on F7. And the worst thing about it: Me as Black would have no idea what to do about the knight... <n>12 ... Nc6 does not help.. Ne2 would be the next step... So it really starts to get tricky
When ahead in material you always prefer to trad off as long as it does not lead to an extrem lack of development... So I thought on seizing the only open file.
White raises his kingsafty, but the absence weakens the d2 Square, so I had to take aim on it. Now there is no hope left for the poor knight...
Exchanging pieces is going on in my favor, time to look at new weaknesses:<n>c2 is potentially weak, but it can be secured via Bd3, f2 seems to be a good target too.
Allowing me to exchange further.
Qd1 as a threat to my king?
Grabbing the pawn and exchanging. The game is finished and there is nothing left I have to fear. However my opponent wanted me to enjoy the hunt to the last moment and to collect my trophy. :)
I don't agree with this move. The sequence it inaugurates ends badly for black. I would chose Qe7.. with the plan of Bg3 to pin white's knight and then rd8 to exploit the opening in the pawn line.
White is up a point, but is winning the opening decisively. Black's knight cannot move out anywhere safely, the bishop on f8 is trapped as well. It will be very hard from here on out for black to castle. Black makes the best choice possible on this situation to try and regain momentum.
Bg4 links the queen and the rock, which would free up black to take the e5 pawn and even out material. This will work, but it allows white to develop faster.
I don't agree with this bishop aggression. Bg4 is better because the bishop is defended by the rook, black doesn't have to keep moving it. It also allows white to move Bf4 b/c the rook isn't threatened.
I don't agree with this move.. there is nowhere the knight can productively go from e7. Black moves it because he needs to castle, but I think moving the g6 then black's Bh6 is a better choice.
This move is a waste. The rook will end up on the d column once black initiates the queen trade.
the exchange is on.
I could have taken with the bishop to menace the c7 pawn... but I've learned from experience that is very bad if BxNf4, gx3 because it disrupts the king's defenses.
A mistake. Forcing Re1 is good for white, the rook has to move out eventually and re1 protects the e4 pawn.
Baiting the back rank checkmate. I would chose a more aggressive move, Ng6 comes to mind. It would also free up the bishop and finally allow black to castle.
This prevents the castling for an additional move and allows white to retake control of the center.
Black's knight is anchored to e7 in order to defend the c6 pawn. He has to defend it with either the rook or the bishop. He chooses the bishop I think was a mistake b/c the bishop is unsupported.
In the event of a rook trade, I didn't want the bishop to be in a position to wreck havoc on my pawns. It also baits a trap... the only safe move for the bishop is Bh6. Bb5 leads to disaster.
Black has to respond to the imminent lose of his bishop or his rook.
supports the bishop so the knight can move around again.
Ne7 is a disaster... where can the knight move from here? what kind of attack can it support? Also it prevents the rook from being able to defend the against rd8#.. which is coming. From here.. Nc5 presents black with a terrible choice.. lose the rook or be checkmated.
There are several key points in this game. 1. d4 is difficult to meet in the Ruy Lopez. 2. Don't overmove periphery pieces when you need to develop your castling position. 3. Force a piece to move where it natural wants to go is not pressure. 4. Don't isolate the rook from the back rank unless the king is well defended. <n><n>As always, I'd like to thank black for the game.
I wanted to take out his white-squared bishop.
This was to offer a pawn and rook for theyank's rook an good positioning for my Queen.  He didn't go for it.
This is to open the e file.
Not sure why theyank did not block my rook on e8 with his bishop on e3 or his knight on e2?  Either one of these moves could have helped him castle in the future.
The idea was to protect my bishop when it takes white's knight on d4 so if white chooses to kill my bishop with the c pawn, I would take that pawn with my rook and place him into check for a second time.  (He doesn't exactly play accordingly)
This starts a series of checks to protect my Queen and knight.  This ultimately leads to capturing theyank's Queen.
The Petroff was viewed as passive and almost lost for Black. The only grandmaster of the time that had faith in it was Chigorin.
With this move Black postpones surrendering the center because of the counter-attack on e4, if White decided to exchange on c6 and try to win the e5 pawn.
White has over-defended e4 and now is threatening to capture on e5. The pawn structure that results from this is favorable to White because he has extra space and better control of the center. Black's source of counterplay is attacking the e-pawn. But his cramped position doesn't promise much and in modern times this defense has all but subsided from practice.
Black seizes the opportunity to exchange two minor pieces in hope that his cramped position will be less felt and his coordination won't suffer from lack of maneuvering space.
Black has completed development and given the opportunity will now start to create pressure on e4. His position is passive but there are no weakness on the surface and White will have to play very purposefully in order to prove his advantage.
Not forced but Black isn't the strongest of players. If Capablanca were Black here, I'm sure he would have seen the central strike 11...d5!. But now we are in for a treat since we are about to see one of the most beautiful examples of piece coordination ever played on a chessboard.
White has a very good position even if he has wasted a few tempos. The Knight is ready to go to f5, the Bishop has two excellent attack targets, d6 and g7, the Queen will come to g3 to attack both of the aforementioned spots and the d-file will be used as well to create maximum pressure on Black's position.
Black tries to use the position of White's pieces on the long diagonal to develop his Bishop with tempo on f6, supporting g7 and the Knight that is bound for e5.
White wastes no time in placing his pieces on the best squares. This Knight is an absolute killer on f5, hitting both g7 and d6, besides being ready for other feats of bravery.
Black carries on with his plan of rearranging his pieces.
An ideal place for the Queen. Black's forces will soon be overstretched with defensive tasks.
Skewering the d6 pawn and preventing d5.
The thunder-strike. White wastes no more time and presents Black with immediate problems to solve. Notice the battery that Capablanca has created on the h2-b8 diagonal.
The Rook had to be taken, it was threatening Rxf6.
The principle of two weakness. Things look very grim for Black. After 18...Bxe5 19. Qxe5, Black is under a nasty pin and one move away from mate.
Forced. Now Black thought he had time to take on e5.
Black has to return the Queen or else he gets mated. A knock-out punch from the Knight who was waiting for the perfect time to deliver a killer blow.<n><n>I hope you enjoyed this game as much as I did.
checking the bishop to have more in controlling the middle
canceling the tension in the middle
blunder from me????????????????? I didn't calculate that the bishop would take the other knight in c3
this is the badness in Black's position for the move 17......Rd8
I want to make a note for nobita2c if he ever reads this; especially after my game with muginz I was planning to offer a draw once this had played itself out.  It worked to a really interesting position so I'm sorry we couldn't finish it.
This move caught me by surprise.  I'm still unclear what the immediate objective was and I would recommend further development next time before moving in but Black is clearly not set up to remove the threat.  Even the fact that Black's Queen's knight can be picked off if it moves out may make this worthwhile.
Black's slow development leaves him open to pawn pressure which will be the theme of the game.  The black bishop especially exerts no power in the game until far too late.
Rather than recapturing with the pawn and leaving the g column open.
An interesting choice to play the King forward.
My opponent chooses ...e6 before ...c6 in order to take back ...exd5 if I exchange.  However if he plans to play e6 and c6 this order gives him less flexibility with his c8 bishop.
This move indicates my aggresive intent, more common is e3 which can be exciting but this move leads to much more interesting complications in my eyes.  The pin on f6 is the most important part of my position.
The only move to not hang the knight, trying to counterattack with 7... b4 lets me intensify the pin on f6 with 8.Ne4.
The pin is the key to my whole position and it's the reason I gave up the pawn on c4, if I exchange my bishop then I lose all my pressure, and thus I retreat and keep the pin alive.
Black tries to break the pin and save his knight.
What's the most important part of my position?  It's the pin on the f6 knight.  I have to keep it alive and I'm willing to give up my f3 knight to keep the pin and eventually win his knight on f6.
9... Nd5!?  While 9... hxg5 is the most common move in this position, this move is reasonable if black is willing to sacrifice.  Black tries to get rid of the pin by getting the knight out of there when he has the chance, however this puts the queen in the line of fire.
I, white, take up the challenge, 10.Nf3 defending the bishop is probably fine for white, black is active and has pressure after 10... Qa5 but is covered with weaknesses.  This move makes the black king look a lot weaker as he's lost his f and g pawns.  Oh yeah, and I also pick up the exchange.
Normally having a knight on h8 or a8 means it will soon be taken, however with my opponents' problematic kingside the knight will soon escape.
This move is the most active, and I think it's probably best as black must play actively.  He's down material and must create as much pressure as possible, either the lack of an f and g pawn gives him weaknesses OR he can use them as open files, also his advanced pawns will be weak OR they can be used to attack with.  In this game he tries to activate, but doesn't get enough.  Maybe black doesn't have enough for the rook?
I cover knight before trying to exploit his problems.
Black ignores the threats for the sake of finishing development and creating pressure.
Ke7 or Kf8 loses his his queen to Ng6 !  However, either way my knight is coming out and it's going to enter the attack.
this seems risky... and it seemed risky when I was playing it.  He has an open g file against my king, and active queen and bishop on b7 ready to open up on my king.  However if my king stays in the middle his bishop on b4 will retain a very powerful pin that ties down two of my pieces, my knight and rook.
He has to trade off his bishop as I threaten 17.Nxd5 which would cause ...exd5 or ...cxd5, either one shuts down his bishops diagonal.
I cover g2 and try to counter his pressure on the h8-a1 diagonal.
He attempts the natural break which opens up his b7 bishop.
I grab the square that his b4 bishop used to protect.  I also hit his important attacking bishop and his pawn on b5 (with check).
He moves his bishop out of the way while also defending the pawn on b5.
I hit his queen and try to cut down pressure on the g file.  However this also weakens my light squares to tactics (though I don't think they work-they're still dangerous), if anyone has another suggestion I'd love to hear it.
Of course the g pawn is pinned so his queen isn't actually attacked yet, but it soon will be.  Black feels that the knight is best going to b6 and then d5 or a4.  Ideally his knight would come to the kingside, but that's slow.  He had an intriguing option in 20... Ne3?!! 21.fxe3 (21.Qe2 is fine for white, but this is more exciting) 21... Rxg3  22.Kh1 (21.Kf2 is awful 21...Rxf3 simply wins and 21.hxg3 leads to a draw after 21... Qxg3  22.Kh1 Qh3 check and there is an unavoidable repetition) 22...Rh3 (he can't trade bishops yet and this keeps up threats) 23.Qe2 and I can't imagine he has enough.  The whole idea is that there's a lot of possible tactics here, and while I think 20.g3 was reasonable it leaves my position with holes.
I get my bishop out of the way, and now the queen is hit.
Where else?  If 21... Qg5 22.Ne4! and after the queen moves I play 23.Nxc5 and it hits e6 with a great square for my knight.
A move too late.  This threatens h6 and Qf7! trading off to a winning endgame.
This defends Qf7 but 23... Naxc3 is more difficult to face 24.Qf7 Qxf7 25.Nxf7 Ne2  26.Kh1 Nxc1 27.Rxc1 where black has an exchange for a pawn and if it's winnable it's tough.  Luckily my opponent went for this line.
He grabs the file and stops my plan.
He covers the threat... and now I infiltrate.
Black almost has a pretty mate- if he didn't have a pawn on e6 then 28... Rxh2 !! 30.Kxh2 Qh7  31.Bh3 Qxh3# would've made me the loser of this exciting game, as it is he resigned, there's no good defense to my theats.  This was a fun game for me, he tossed out a move I don't know the theory to in a highly complicated opening, and I didn't get slaughtered!  If anyone has any comments or ideas, PM me.
an unnecessary pawn move that wastes time and also creates tactical opportunites for Black's dark-square bishop
The rook exchange benefits black, who is ahead in development.
forks the bishop and e4-pawn
The bishop moves to a better diagonal.
supports the e5 pawn, but opens up the a2-g8 diagonal for White's bishop
The a-file is of no use to anyone. All the action is on the kingside, where both kings are located.
An early mistake by me, as I now have to waste a tempo by protecting f2, and so losing the b2 pawn.
IA bit greedy.  Instead of taking another pawn, black should castle and get his king safe...
I can play Nxe6 followed by Q-h6 check (and picking up the black bishop on c5) but I saw something more adventurous...
The point of my rook sacrifice.  Black's King is now out in the open, and if Kd8, Nf7  picks up the rook and black is way out of position
Keeping the initiative by forcing the black rook on h8 to move.
I had the option here of playing Qf5  and then Bc4, winning the rook back.  Instead I wanted to bring my knights into play
Black has to protect his bishop on c5 and block the check.  Kc6 instead allows Qd5  and then capturing that bishop.
Keeping the pressure on
This is a mistake, but in fairness to black there's not much he can do.
I don't have much material on the Bird, but what I do have likes 1. ... Nf6 and 1. ...d5 for black's first move, so I play them both. Nothing I have suggests 2. d4 as a standard move for white in any line of Bird's Opening. Back to winging it., I'm beginning to suspect that some players on GameKnot deliberately try to break away from traditional lines early, much earlier than I remember from OTB tournament play, and I suspect that the GK DB plays a part in this decision.
The black knight finds a hole in white's wall and invites the white bishop to an exchange.
These moves are all in the GK database, and it's forming a pretty picture in the center of the board.
Now, white needs to play Nd2f3 to complete the pretty picture.
Dangit, white lbew it, now we need to exchange some material. I considered 10. ... Bxe5, for if white recaptures on e5, then 11. ... Nxg4 wins a pawn. But white could easily refute that plan with 11. gxf5.
Inviting white to open files on the queenside.
I am not sure if 23. f6? was well founded. It looked to me like a sacrifice, and I was expecting 23. ... Bxf6, 24. Rxf6 gxf6 to follow. I toyed with it for a while and concluded that white couldn't force a win with that sacrifice, so I accepted the pawn. Then white tried something I hadn't expected.
With the pawn at g7 pinned, it no longer protects the bishop on f6. It might have been better to move the king, say with 24. ... Kf8. If I had looked far enough ahead, I would have.
White played the expected move, and black responded as planned. I felt the black king was just safe enough where he was. I was wrong.
26. Rxf7! I think deserves a ! for the danger it presents to black.
The cowardly king runs for his life. If he can just get behind his queen, all may be well.
White could have tried 29. Qg8 which looks to be his strongest option with the threat of 30. Re6+ Kd8 31. Qxf8 Kc7 32. Qxa8 Qxe6 33. Bxa5 leaves black up by bishop and 2 pawns. Black doesn't seem to have any way to save the bishop. 29. ... Qe7? would be met by 30. Re6. Black's best move might be 29. ... Rb3b1 to prevent white from playing 32. Qxa8, in which case white has nearly equalized, being down by the exchange for a pawn, but with a passed pawn on the h-file. Instead, the move as played, 29. Qh5? lets black off the hook.
I analyzed white's remaining attack and decided he had nothing to be afraid of, so now seems like a good time to get that b-pawn, which now puts the white bishop on d2 and the white pawn on a3 en prise.
Time to counterattack. White has no choice but to trade queens now. Any king move allows black to checkmate: 35. Ke1??? Qxd2+ 36. Kf1 Rb1#.
If white's rook on f6 didn't protect his queen, then 35. ... Rxd2 would win the queen. In the game, I almost played this automatically (overlooking the white rook). Close call. As it is, black is satisfied with the queen trade, ending up in a queenless endgame ahead by a rook and pawn.
And now it's smooth sailing. This would have been a much closer game if white had justified the sacrifice of 26. Rxf7! with 33. Qg8! and equalized (or close to it).
Promotion from here is not even necessary. Black could just as easily press for a king+rook checkmate, though he may want to take a little side trip to the h-file to get rid of whit's only threat first. But this approach looks simple enough too.
Black needs an approach for his king, and going around would take too long. At this point my opponent didn't return to the game for a couple days, and I got caught up in my other games so I entered a dozen or so likely continuations as conditional moves. A few days later, while I was asleep, this game finished itself.
Luring the white king to the a-file where he can't stop the e-pawn from promotion.
So far this is turning into exactly the sort of game Al likes best - closed, featuring incremental positional maneuvering with a slow, deliberate build-up to the final attack. Fischer remarked about this style (speaking specifically of the late German GM Wolfgang Unzicker, as I recall, although he could have as easily mentioned Tigran Petrosian and, later, Anatoly Karpov) that if this patient constricting style doesn't produce a win then it almost always has the not necessarily unhappy consequence of producing a draw.
Black begins to lose patience with all the stodgy maneuvering, expressed by opening this self-inflicted but not completely unjustifiable wound in front of his King. Oddly, I played this more as a defensive resource (albeit aggressive defense), to give g6 to my QB and, obviously, preparing g7 for my KB.
White calmly continues to improve his spatial advantage.
Opening communication between the Rooks and preparing a likely exit for the Black King to the center or Queenside.
Now the game is beginning to look more like the sort I enjoy playing - open, with attacking lines and tactical nuances around every corner. Here I passed on taking the e-pawn in order to gain greater pressure against White's King. After 23. ...Qe3  24. Qd2 lets the steam out.
Black is obviously playing not to lose at this point, with the vulnerability of White's King giving him reason to hope for a draw.
A decisive mistake! 61. ...Qg7 may have been marginally better. Certainly the Black Queen must stay on squares that either check or guard the pawn at h6.
!!! Absolutely no credit for any other move!! White's only legal move is to take the Black Queen - and it doesn't matter whether he captures with Queen or King, creating a stalemate. And so Black snatches the proverbial kiss from his sister from the jaws of sure defeat. ...Pretty cute.
Again I have a hard opponent, but he plays predictable - Slav and Sicilian. I decided to swim into his waters preparing surprises.
7. Bd2 ?!<n>It was interesting here what will play my opponent. He follows the theory. But was it his best move ? Black's position looks strong.
I decided to exchange the knights here restricting black's bishop by his own pawns.
ready to attack or counter-attack
16. ... Nf6 !!<n>Some reinforcement. But that one move rescued the game and secured the victory !
and black crowned a victory in the center
black would appretiate bishops exchange
26. ... f5 !! <n>again surprise and the blak are safeguarded
for sure. now the way of the black bishop is not obstructed and a nice combination is to follow
The bishop can be brought into action now
White creates an escape square for his bishop
White has a lot of pressure, I think he will try to sac the bishop at some point
Black plans to take thee pawn and stop black's attack
But I rather developed my bishop, and try to get some kind of Danish gambit, Collijn defence, if he takes my b pawn, then I take wit my bishop. (Its not really Danish gambit, Collijn defence, because black didn't start with 1.....e5)
I want that bishop to stay alive.
And now is time to open up f file. If he plays 14.... dxe5, then in a couple of exchanges my Queen and rook will be on the f file threatening mate on f7.
His knight has nowhere to go accept back on g8 or d5 for some more exchanges.
If he wants to protect his rook and Queen, he must bring his Queen back to the 8th rank. If he wants to stay alive, he must sacrifice his rook. Are there any other possibilities?
And checkmate. Thanks for watching and commenting. Have a nice day.
I didn't want to block any of my bishops with my queen to defend f7, but 6. Bxe6 fxe6 seems like it weakens my kingside a bit.
I decide to threaten the bishop, because Bxc6 opens up the b-file for my rook.
I line up for a bishop sacrifice on h3, but the knight of g5 must move first to ensure success.
I apply the pressure onto the g5 knight so I can strike at h3.
Chasing the king.
I decide to take the pawn.
Asking for an exchange.
I'm trying to bring my knight closer to the action.
Forcing the exchange.
I decide to take anyway.
Checkmate! Feel free to comment and give lots of constructive criticism, for this was my 100th game and I wish for the next 100 to be better than the first!
!?!? Totally unknown variation in the Dragon. White usually sacs a pawn after 14.h5 Nxh5 15.g4 Nf6 and White has the solid options 16.Kb1, 16.Nb3 and 16.Nde2, or the aggresive options 16.Bh6 and 16.e5, however my coach has a materialistic mindset and did not want to sac the pawn.
To prevent the exchange of dark-squared bishops.
?! The sac of the pawn was good, but this move is not that accurate. Perhaps 17.Rxh5 Bxd4 18.Nxd4 e5 was better.
!?!? The first sacrifice. 18...e5 19.Nb3 Qc7 was much safer, but I wanted to spice things up and realised this idea was still a plausible way to complicate matters.
?! Accepting the sacrifice is probably better, but my coach decided to be cautious.
?! 23...Qc8 was neccessary to remove the pin of the e7-pawn, which then 24.Qd5 Qxf5 25.Qxf5 gxf5 26. Bf6+ is still better for White, but Black can still hope to hang on.
Black can manage the exchange.
This is the worst way for white to retake. Now both sides are almost cramped. The obvious Bb4+ is ok, but I wanted to try another idea.
I thought about Ke7, but I didn't want to fear some white queen incursion in the future. In doing so, I loosen the pressure and allow him to castle, too.
My plan was to press on the queenside, but it was a bad plan.
White had to go h4, but then h6, and if Qh5, Nf4 forks Q and B...
...he must lose the exchange. The queen has no squares! (Qg5, h6). And it has a lot of squares to go, but... none can save it!
Can you believe it? Not even now, changing the diag color!
And, be aware... THE BISHOP IS OUT OF SQUARES TOO! That's most incredible. If Bb7, Qb3 wins the knight... If Ra1 to threat mate, h6 and it's ok. If Ng5, so that if Qb3, Ra1, QxB defends a8. White is lost.
Defending the e-pawn. Now I must decide whether to play Bc4 or Bb5.
Kicking the bishop.
This defends the e-pawn, but prevents the move of the d-pawn, postponing the effective development of the LSB (the a-pawn and the c6-pawn are preventing Bb7 from being an effective development).
Black castles.
?? This allows me to win a piece with the fork.
Black chooses to lose his knight. Moving his bishop was a good choice, because it allows the d-pawn to move.
I'm not too sure what this was meant to accomplish.
Kicking the bishop.
? I can win a pawn from this, and black has messed up his kingside.
?? This allows me to win a piece by skewering the queen to the bishop.
Now that the queen has moved, I can capture the bishop.
Getting the rook into the fight with tempo.
Away from the action.
Black has constrained his queen further, because my defended rook is in the way.
I take the chance to gobble a pawn.
a way to bock the treat, not the wisest, but a way.
A way to protect the pawn to get any further. If e5 moves e6, its stuck. Two reason's that move is not the best:<n>1. moving to be6 would've stopped it, no choice, frozen.<n>2. Obviosly, the player doesn't know En Passant.
There you go, En Passant! En Passant in English means "in passing" Here is the rules for En Passant: <n>1.The enemy Pawn must be on its second row. <n>2.The option is triggered as soon as the enemy Pawn advances two squares. <n>3.The option is lost if not used immediately. <n>So, now you've got it, use this move to confuse your opponent. If he calls you a cheater, bring him here.
this brave scout seems to loose contact with his own forces. (this move makes the diagonal for my fianchettoed bishop even juicier)
oh my, the infantry ddidnt get enough support and with blacks cavalry in sight, white's officer in command leaves the poor men on prey
... but  black's cavalry gets routed and completely annihilated in melee
now here: due to the uncoordinated movement of white, blavck's officers succeeded in routing allready half of white's forces. none of blacks pawn yet was in combat they're all rested and fresh... and they just put on bajonettes and will march the enemy off the field! watch!
further simplification. i know that i could have played it more straight but i was so stunned by this pawns i just wanted to let them have fun. (thats the least we can do for our pawns. give them a reason to enjoy theirselves every once in a while. too often they get sacrificed, left alone treated as if they were not worth a dime)
ok, my opponent resinged here, and i want to apologize that i showed no respect by toying around. although its not often you get such strong story telling situations on the board. and its clearly not every day that you have your 8 pawns and just march the opponent over and dont have to fear a thing. ofcourse id loved to play it down to the 1st rank but chess is a 2player game, if its not for any reason, its about to be over. like here ^^
Now white has the bishop pair.
!<n>Not c4 which surrenders d4 to Black. And neither knight can capture due to the threat from g2 and the resulting pin from g5.
Black has few options in view of the previously mentioned threat. If Qa4 then b3! and the Queen must retreat or be trapped again after Qxa2? Ra1 Qb2 Qd2!
Lasker comes out of the opening and middle game with a decided advantage. The bishop pair and key space control give black a hard position.
Tempting for Black but the better policy would be to mark time.
That hole he created with 1...e5 2...d6 I chose to try exploit
Too many times when that move is played against me, I would block with my bishop, and stop attacking, so I forced myself to ignore that, and play Qxf3, if black chose Bxf3
That was the move I wanted him to play...it allows me to give the impression im recapturing instead of losing my Queen to Nxd4 Bxd1, but developing my Queen in order to explore the diagonal the White Bishop is on
As expected, threatening the Queen to move, which was fine by me, thats not where i wanted it to end up
That i did not expect...was expecting either Nc6 (providing he didnt see Bc1's threat) or even better, Bh5, which was the move i had accounted for. 7...Bh5 8. g4 (taking the pawn would result in checkmate or 7...Bh5 8. g4 Bg6 9. Nh4, leaving his only option as Bf7, again checkmate....kinda annoyed at myself after going thru the lines that I missed Qd7, but anyway...this move was played and I began to re-avaluate
I realised after some deliberation that Nd4, Nxd6 was a possibility for mate if he decided to take with the Queen, over his pawn structure, but knew it was unlikely, because he had only just played Qd7 for a reason
Thought id test it anyway, and probably in doing so, my biggest mistake of the game...here he offers his bishop on h5, when i glanced at it, I had the mindset of (if I capture that, I lose my horse, which I wanted to use for this move, so I left it. Not realising it checks the Black King and I can move straight back to d5 and still keep the threat is probably one of the things that keeps my rating low....just a result of not looking thoroughly before moving. I saw it before he moved Bf7, and yeah grr haha.
After weighing up my options, I could not see a plasuible mate from my situation without taking that Bishop, my Knight was not in a position to attack, and the f6 pawn stops my Black Bishop from being able to help, so a little forced i felt, this move, Qxf7+
After this I did stand a Knight up, so the outcome wasnt that bad, but mate was alot further away now, than the hige threat it stood as before, and I was now hoping he made a mistake or two so as not to draw the game out, or I could be regretting move 7 later on...
Here i had seen the Rooks placement, and I knew there was a fork on d6, but it was going to take planning, and a bit of luck with his moves to pull it off...
Here i had a feeling he hadnt seen the fork yet, and I thought if I capture b5, and then Re4, although that is a fork, it may be more obvious, so I decided to defend the pawn as if i was not thinking about a fork
I thought for sure after 16. Nb5 he would see the fork, but I was wrong, and finally this second plan comes to light
That leaves me 6 points up in material, and I have a 3rd plan (this is really the first game where after my first plan fails, I materialised another one or two, I'm really really happy (with the expcetion of move 7) of how I played this game. Whats important to me, is that after my gameplan failed, due to a mistake of mine, I was able to make the best of it, and pull back before attacking again. The 3rd plan will come to light on move 21 or 22, but I told my opponent I wanted to annotate this game, so he may be reading this hehe...
In my opinion, the game was already over, but Black put up a good fight
Also a good time to make the capture. Not much Black can do, but at least he isn't resigning. I find it difficult to develop my endgame, more than any part of my game, because so many resign when in a losing position. Im focusing on 'winning a won game' in the next month or so...
Perhaps Black can make something out of White's poor pawn structure with his Knight and King? Give his pawns a chance? Through analysis, I knew they wouldnt get anywhere decent enough in time
Allowed the exchange, obviously, the pawn was about to reach f8, it was no matter now..
Here White resigned, and fairly so, 5 moves away from mate as far as I could see, and Black wasnt in the game for most of the Match...<n><n>Thanks guys !
it is better to not play this move so early in the game. White should focus on continuing to develop his pieces.
The idea of advantage of fact that black has played the light coloured bishop.
The only way to defend because the presence of the Knight on e5 makes b6 suicidal
creating a outpost on d5 for my knights and releasing the tension in the centre.
driving back the queen and strengthening my hold on d5.
placing the rook on the semi-open c-file.
removes a defender of e5 and preparing the advance of ...c5 with the aim of undermining the e5 Knight.
attacking d5 and pinning the weak pawn to the queen.
defending d4 but d4 is not under immedaite threat so playing Bf3 to give the bishop more influence over the board is better. Plus Bf3 prevents b5. Something that Ozzz is not seeing.
white is seeking to exchange bishops but I am not going to trade my nice bishop for his bad one.
This leads to a quicker end. This allows black to open up the a-file to be used by the rook. When defending a position is best to play moves that keep the position closed.
straight into the attack and the control of the centre
i defend. now imagine if both our queens and kings were the other way around- white would have had a checkmate:)
why not the swap off
i attempt to take the lead
but i can now take the lead by two on the GRANDMASTER
pull it to protection- my i'm in an ugly position
attck on the pawn
i think must pull my knights back to prevent a queen!
my king needs to help
i probably still lose if i get tht rook for free
rok and king mate eh?
White is determined to avoid having his QN pinned, but doesn't want to waste a move by playing a3.
The more aggressive 6...g5 has yielded good results.
Now that Black has committed his bishop to e7, the time is right to develop this knight.
An important move in most variations of the Queen's Indian, but Black needs to be sure that White can't play 8.d5. Here Black can simply play 8...Nxd5.
A strange move. If White wanted to exchange bishop for knight, he should have done it on move 6.<n><n>Wang Yue (2739)-Ivanchuk,V (2779), Nice FRA 2009, continued 8.Be2 0-0 9.0-0 Nc6 10.Bg3 cxd4 11.Nxd4 d6 12.Bf3 Qd7 with a draw in 69 moves.<n><n>Gelfand,B (2733)-Leko,P (2749), Monte Carlo MNC 2007, continued 8.Bd3 cxd4 9.exd4 0-0 10.0-0 Nc6 11.Rc1 d5 12.cxd5 Nxd5 with a draw in 72 moves.
This only increases the power of the Black bishop on f6. A developing move such as Re1 is better.
The knight doesn't look too secure here. 12...Ne7 - tempting White to play 13.d6 -  is probably better.
Bc4 would be the Dunst-Hector Gambit. With this move white maintains material equality and has a developed piece in the center. The knight controls g5 and c5 while it influences f6 and d6. There is a sacrifice potential at f6 which offers nothing at the moment. The knight is unprotected.
Bd3 ? White defends the piece with the bishop, which is not the best choice. The decision may have been made to keep the knight centralized for control and because using the d pawn would end with a trade of queens and white losing castle rights. A better move would be Ne4-g3 to counter attack the bishop and regaining tempo. The bishop is protected.
Black enables protection of the bishop while opening a line for the king bishop. The position favors black slightly because of the pin on the knight and because if the bishops are traded the pawn structure is disrupted, and because white loses the king bishop which tends to be the more favorable bishop.
Black selects a good move which recaptures the piece while offering protection to the pawn structure in the event of Bd3xf5. The only drawback to this move is the weak c7 and b7 squares, but white does not have the means to take advantage of this yet.
Black has a gain in development and stands a little better.
Qb5&#43 ? White begins an attack on the king too soon. Better was Nf3 followed by 0-0.
Black offers a poison pawn to white.
Black pursues an attack.
Better was Qb7-a6 to protect the knight with the king.
Black takes a free piece and applies a check which drives the king to the corner - the most limiting square on the board. A fun but unecessary move. Qe5xh2# is decisive.
Win 0-1. The most predominant aspect that can be observed in this game is that it is better to develop pieces, castle, then begin an attack on the center or side where is makes most sense. Timing makes the difference for an attack, as does having enough pieces developed so they can assist. The queen is not able to achieve mate alone - other pieces are needed.
...as predicted, after d5, this is a solid spot for the knitgt. Here, black sholud have played Nh5, and I have to go something like Qd2 and discourage f6.
Assuminig I can hold on Nh5, I make my outcome this way.
The normal procedure leads me to bite granite... I can take advantage from this and control Nh5.
Ok, he gets there. I didn't want to exchange my beloved dsb for a knight with no future.
So my bishop is lost, and the center control, too. I plan to castle, sadly, kinside now.
Black grabs this important advance. I have to be very careful after the positional blunder.
? He can take the queen away from the column, since if I exchange pawns, I get the center, but also Rc8, followed by b5, and I lose a piece at least.
I am self-blocking my own queen's action, but I'll take care of this later. But my two centered doubled pawns are a barrier for black's action. Without f8 (because of the bishop), black cannot go f5 - this is the point! And the nasty knight has almost no game, there, but to block my bishop's useless retirement (g5, f4) and self block black's pieces!
A crucial loss of tempo. Ba4 can be a threat in the sense that it helps his pawns approach my king, but just that: Ba4, b3, Bb6, c4! and black has to lose tempos in order to rebuild his attack (Bc6, and it's my turn to attack: f4, etc.)
This move can be intended for attack or defence. Both are too far for this to be useful. Again, better for black is removing the queen from the d column, and try to attack as quicly as possible.
I'm not so sure, but it just looked magnificent. :-) Black cannot play b3 now. He can break in, but he lost valuable tempos without an attack plan. The old lesson: attacks has to be as quick and mortal as possible, It is very rare for an "under 2000" to be able to judge when he can "slowly prepare" the attack... without becoming a victim of an attack himself. So, don't wait.
I confess I was tempted to go f6, and then manage to take the queen to g7#. But, being realistic, it just takes too much time!!
Preparing to castle.
Now pins the knight to my king. The knight on f6 is double pined.
Brings his king to safety.
Going to try and relieve some pressure in my position.
I'm not sure what his purpose was in this move. If he needed a knight there why not Nbc3?
Happy to trade up.
Attacking his bishop with my bishop and queen.
Wanting to trade queens or protecting his b pawn. I think he wants to trade.
A royal fork! He can't capture my knight with 22. gxf3 because the g pawn is pined to the king.
Trying to open the f file.
I know this is trading down and could have avoided the trade with Kd7 but I felt that his knight would give me trouble down the road. I decided to trade my rook to simplify the position.
Probably not my best move but I wanted that pawn. The pawn was a sitting duck if he would have moved it.
Here it's mate in one if he doesn't play it right.
He sees the mate in one.
Taking the f pawn and forking the king and rook. I couldn't have taken the rook with 31. ... Qxf3. He would have been able to move out of the way.
Driving the king to the corner.
Keeping the king in a tiny square.
Checkmate. Black wins. This was a good game for me. It allowed me to see some mistakes I've made. mpinck seems to be a better player that this game shows. If you would take out the opening of just trying to trap a checkmate for easy win and put in some development I think he would have won.
For a couple of years now I feel(no statistic/scientific observation or calculation regarding chose of openings) I have been kind of lacking aggressive play and have been too worried and concerned about doing the theoretically basic right moves. With 1300 games played here at GK I should have more than enough experience by now... but are still in lack of theoretical knowledge due to low interest in theory(books etc), which I believe certainly will improve my play. <n><n>I have recently decided to start playing more aggressive and intuitive and try to mix it with my experience and so hopefully that will help me improve my rating. Anyway I think it will be funnier to play(started to be a bit bored with my play) :-)
French defense opening, which has a reputation for solidity and resilience, though it can result in a somewhat cramped game for Black in the early stages. Black often gains counterattacking possibilities on the queen-side while White tends to concentrate on the kingside(wikipedia.com).
I had my doubts about this one, but on the other hand I have a liking for a half-open f-file because I feel I possibly quickly get my rook into play after castling.
Why? Now I'm getting the feeling I'm too cautious again and not part of my idea of starting to play chess more aggressively and I'm quite sure I lost a tempo by doing that move. I think Nf3 would have been better...
Black still has not made a castle, but for white there is no time to wait and see whether black castle to the king- or queen-side. Funny to notice that at least the predictions of a French opening is coming true - White attacking king-side and black the queen-side
And now it starts, Who's the fastest one
Black's line up appear much stronger to me. Black has a lot of possibilities now. c4 will directly attack my white sq. bishop and block from effective defence of my king. Qb6 will put heavy pressure on d4 and help in controlling b-line for a possible attack on the king. I chose not to care and continue my attack
b4 pressure is a bit lighter now, but really just moved to the a3 square. White on the other hand are about to get a strong kingside attack and black is still blocking a queenside castling by not moving the queen out of the last row
White is now opening the black kingside and black seems a bit paralyzed and has apparently stopped attacking white. black h-pawn is lost if not black find a quick way to occupy white with something else. I was now expecting 18...c4, would I then pulled back my white sq. bishop or continued my attack, e.g. 19. fxe6 cxd3 20. exd7
the idea here was to exchange a knight for a bishop and then the f-pawn is lost
As far as I can see the black queen is lost whether black did take the time to fetch a knight or not
Now there is danger of black managing to promote the pawn in the e-file; Re1 Rxe1; fxe1=Q , so white need more pieces pointing at the e1 square
Looking to attack at once.
Obviously 5... KxB??? loses at once to 6 N-N5 ch!!! forking the royals.
Now the King becomes a target.
Seizing the half-open file with tempo.
Looking to bring a new piece intro the attack, and gains another tempo.
Tightening the noose.
The idea behind the Pirc and/or Modern defense is to allow white to establish a pawn center, and then try to undermine it.
We are already out of mainstream theory.  Black has already conceeded too much space to white.  Notice that the pawns on e6 and d6 interfere with the development of both bishops.
It is useful to advance the f-pawn prior to developing the knight to f3.  The f-pawn will support further spatial conquest.
This weakens the h5-e8 diagonal, and robs the g-knight of the f6 square,  which is its most natural post.
White wishes to complete at least his kingside development before undertaking any further advance into enemy territory.
On c4 the bishop would run into d6-d5 and have to move again.  On d3, it is poised to attack the weakened light squares in black's kingside.  A move such as f7-f6, is a serious weakening.
Now, it is almost comical.  The move allows the bishop to be developed, but it bottles up the queen again.  Is black hoping to get all of his pawns on the 6th?  I've seen this curious play before, where players forget about their pieces and move only pawns.  It isn't to be recommended.
Now, white has safely removed the king from the center and will try to open lines of attack and penetrate black's position.
A break from convention!  The pawn advances two squares.  If the idea is to eliminate the d3 bishop, then the immediate 6. ...Ba6 would suffice.
Perhaps a move such as 7. ...Qc7 in order to be able to answer 8. Qh4  with 8. ...Qf7.
White is trying to open lines against the black king.
Black goes into a defensive shell.  The problem is that black lacks space.  This means that white will be able to make threats that black will eventually be unable to respond to.  The important thing is to trust in the space advantage and not do anything rash.  You don't have to hurry in positions like this.
The pawns on d6, f6 and g5 really limit the bishop on f8.  Its counterpart on c1 is free to roam.  This is a big advantage for white.  Notice also that only the black h-pawn is on a white square.  White's pieces are free to settle on white squares in black's terrotory without having to worry about pawns driving them away.
White wants to complete his development, because the structural flaws in black's game are not going away anytime soon.
The white squares on the queenside are equally weak, so black will find no shelter there.
The knight belongs on e5.
The bishop is heading for d4.
This loses material and is positionally flawed as well.  The knight on c5 was a better piece than the bishop on d3.
This allows black to play b2-b4 and eventually c4-c5. 21. ...f5 was to be prefered.
Black offers the queen trade, but why open the h-file for black?  It would just help him untangle his kingside pieces.
The reduction in material has not eased black's defensive task.  The c-pawn is going to cruise to its queening square.
The pawn marches on.
Controlling the queening square.
1-0 It will cost black a rook to stop the pawn now.  Notice how the black rook and bishop are on their original squares.   Minimize your pawn moves until all the pieces are developed.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Alex gave me a much harder time this time round in the Traxler.  I somehow managed to get my pawn back and then he embarked on an attack with a rook sacrifice.  Sadly for him the sac proved to be unsound and I went on to win the game comfortably after that.  Anyhow - we start the action on move 6 where Alex chose 6. Bc4.
18. ...... Qe7 - Glenda sidestepps the pin on the d6 pawn.  I now use a pin on the a column to my advantage.
21. ...... Rfb8 - defending the b7 pawn and lining my rook up against the Witch.
24. Ra2 - I just put Fou Leblanc on a2.  However, just before I hit the submit button I noticed Qd7+.  I therefore ensured that I would win the rook on my terms by screening out the Witch with c6.  The Witch is also attacked and must move less she get stabbed by a humble pawn.
26. ...... Qe6 - after all that, because Alex sacrificed a piece before the B for R transaction I am a whole rook up.  But now I must take care, there are still two major white pieces on the board.
28. ....... Rd4 - I am planning some dirty work at the crossroads for Alex, preparing to double on the d column and put Alex's back rank under the hammer.
30. ...... Qxc4 - I thought about Rxc4 but decided that Qxc4 was more aggressive.  Alex cannot take my rook with his knight because it is pinned to his undefended queen.
39. f4 - trying to trick me into exf4?? dropping my rook - I am having none of it and play e4, now, not only am I a clear R and P up I have two lovely passers.
44. h5?? - Alex is lost anyway but this makes things so much easier to wrap up the game more quickly.  Glenda's re-appearance on the board is imminent after Ra1 as the WR is pinned to his king.  If RxR then PxR = Q.  Alex waves the white flag.  Commiserations and Good Effort Alex - Joanne
This opening is called the Grunfeld which is popular with people who want<n>  to counter attack with the Black pieces. It is Bobby Fischer's and Garry Kasparov's they use it as a dynamic and popular weapon!<n><n> 3.d6 however is the King's Indian Defence ( KID)
The lines with 4. Bf4 can usually be dangerous for Black, mostly because of the slight move order nuances oblige different types of reaction to movesof which look very similar. But however, there is no real theoretical danger for Black and a well-prepared player will have very good chances in this line.
5. c5 6. dxc5 Qa5  7. cxd5 Nxd5  8. Qxd5 Bxc3   9. Bd2!  ( note that if White played 4.e3 instead of 4.Nf3 then he would not be able to play 9.Bd2 because the e3 pawn would have been in the way) 9. Be6 ( if 9.Bxd2  10.Qxd2 Qxc5 11.Rc1 Qf5 12. Nd4 Qd7 13. Qh6 which is good for White because Black has some serious coordination problems and weak dark sqaures on the King side.    10. Qxb7 Bxd2  11. Nxd2 0-0 12. b4!  Qa4<n>13. e3! worked very well in the Van- Wely Kamsky, Groningen in 1995.
7. e3 is much less threatning of course because and Black can secure a good game by playing 7. Be6! 8. Ng5!? is the only danger move ( 8.Nd2 c5!<n>9. dxc5 Nbd7 and Ne5 c5! are definately O.K for Black) After 8. Bd5 9. e4 h6<n>10. exd5 hxg5 11. Bxg5 Nxd5 12. Bxc4 Nb6 13. Bb3 Nc6 White should then rely on using the bishop matching pair and also the h pawn and support the d4 pawn because it is weak.
Recapturing the pawn, developing a piece and also preparing to 0-0.
Bishop retreats.
This move completely neutrilizes White's opening system. Black srikes at the centre right away and also highlights the weekness of the f4 sqaure and also stops white playing f4.  10.. e6 however keeps all the tension in the position
11. d5 is very anti-positional because. It restricts White's bishops and also <n>  gives Black a forever outpost on f4.
11. Qh4!? is worth a try especaily at club level. After 12.e6 fxe6 13.Bxe6  Kh8. Black has some dark square compensation and White has to be very careful. Black's plans are Nc6-e5, Be5 and Nf4 and White's King will have a problem.
12. Qb3!? is another possibility but I am not sure about it.
Now have a look at this position before you continue. Black has many possibilities for creativity, Black's opening play is a definate success. White has the advantage of the 2 Bishops but on the other hand he has bad pawn structure. White has some ways to build the pressure up here. It is also easy for White to screw up here because without his 2 bishops there is nothing at all good about his position. Blacks target now is to try and swap one of White's Bishops off.
After 13. 0-0 Nd7 intending Nf8- e6 and pawn to c6. 13. Nc6 is much more chunky though.
!   Keeps control of the game. If White was allowed to play f4,e5 and then Ng3 Black would be in a LOT of trouble.
This move blocks the d8 Rook from supporting the Bishop on d4. An exchange is in action here. 16. Be5 is also possible 17. Bxb7 Rab8 18. Bd5 Rxb2 19. Bxa7 Nf4 and it is anyone's game!!
Threatning the Bishop.
Bang!! the Rook is always strong on the 7th rank especaily when doubled because they act as battering rams and the King will be restricted can't get out easily.
Keeping the pressure and supporting the Rook on d2.
White is now threatning to win a Rook because the Black Rook is being attacked twice and only being defended once.
Not  a happy choice for Black because he will no longer have a Rook on the 7th Rank. But it was forced.
Black gets his King ready for action because it is the endgame stage.
Black has a slight advantage though he should consider getting the Knight to e6 where it would be stronger.
White stops himself from trying TOO hard to win just in time and they agreed a draw. The Rook endgame is equal. Still either side can try to win. But there is a really serious risk of losing the game.<n><n>GOOD GAME!! I thought anyway. Shows you what the Grunfeld is all about.<n> Soon I might annotate another game with the Grunfeld.  I hoped you guys enjoyed the game and expect to see another game soon!
To avoid knight pin with white bishop d5
looking to trap bishop & gain space
black safly castles
exchange taken to blacks relief
with nasty pin on pawn & king white offers exchange on bishops & hope to open file for rook
fails to distract black at worst would free up D file or block light bishop if pawn passed
black spies something else
black looking for 2nd queen if not just aims to give white a real defenseive headache
at this point black looking to exchange queen for both rooks
finally black decides to exchange both queen & rook for 2 rooks
This game was not pretty equal. I was  at least 200 points rating lower than my opponent and he won the first easily.<n>I was surprised he agreed for a rematch, because i was not strong enough.<n>(but there was a reason behind!)<n>Let's go with d4, my favorite 1st move.
It closes the road back for my bishop, but it puts pressure, threaten the Queen if e7-e6, may force opponent to move h&g pawns.
If b3, c3 is pretty threatened; if Rb1 i cannot play O-O-O later (i want to keep the possibility at the moment). So i decide not to develop and defend with the Q.
Maybe another mistake, but i dont want Bb4 because my K is in the middle and my other N cannot be easily on e2 to defend.
I think i have to play O-O. I dont think Bd3 would be better, if e5, and Nd7 moving, B can threaten my N moving on g4.
I want to forbid e4, would be powerful pressure. I wanted to play dXe5 but I was afraid of a 2 N attack opening Bc8 attacks, and allowing d4. Im so bad positioned here that i want to take off the board pieces.
I think f2pawn is my best defense and dont want the N to put pressure on it. I also want to keep my e5 pawn alive few moves; and still want to take out material.
1st happy surprise: If O-O, i thought i had no way to attack. Blacks must think the RR will help fgh pawns to come. But Whites can wake up because RQN are on the right side of the board and can try something.
Let's try to be faster than Blacks in the attack.
Many reasons for that move: let c2 pawn come in the game, attack the Q with tempo, to move then on c5... and Blacks cannot move to attack, because of threatened Q.
e5 pawn finally out. But it allows another won tempo with Nd3 frightening again the Q.
planning to destroy Black K's pawns-wall.
My 2nd happy surprise of the game: i can take out the B and my K is in a pretty safe place. Another piece out that wont attack anymore.
Time to make the 2nd rook come in the game.
1 move i like because i think it was hard to find (maybe a best one exists, but i dont know it at the day of annotation). Of course, c pawn cannot move (K behind), and now i can double RQ on c line, i can take d pawn and we would have 5 each.
trying to defend
K doesnt want to be a target and try to go to hide behind f pawn.
Q on e5 to forbid Rd4 to move.
The pressure on d5... and Q behind.
I played fast to threat the K behind the R, but it meant nothing because the K can hide, and my Q will have to move again.
Cannot attack K, so the Whites decide to be the master of the centre of the board.
Q helps again the d pawn and the Rd4
Blacks try to come back in the game
Blacks play too fast and dont think enough: without Qs on board, the Whites are too strong with d pawn.
Without Q, Blacks rooks cannot attack and come back to defend.
the K will come in the game to eat greedy the f g h pawns.
If the black king goes to a3, white king wins on fgh lines; if the black K keeps defending, a3 becomes a Queen.<n>Many people, nearly everyone, would resign now (or before), but the game will go on till the end.<n>The reason: Blacks' player wanted to become a 1800 rating player; he did not want to think, he just wanted to play fast vs lower opponents and win quick victories.<n>The lesson: if a higher player does not respect you, use the mistakes because he will make 1... or many.<n>Why i annotated the game: to show it to any internet player, because i am proud to beat that kind of stronger player that do not respect the lower opponent.<n>The jokes: he asked a draw, then put a postponment for many days, and we played it 2-3minutes/move, then it was 45hours/move.<n><n>I hope you do not think that game was boring. Bye all!
(Finally, he had to lose all the games he did not want to go on: and now he's again lower than 1800  ;) ---> rating on gameknot may be a joke!)
And of course, why would you not take the pawn?
Development, and forces White to defend the pawn.
And here we begin the Najdorf variation. The Dragon Variation is more of a defensive line, responding with 5... g6, planning to fianchetto his DSB and to O-O right away. The Najdorf is a lot more aggressive, planning to berate White's knight via e5, but plays a6 in order to stop any of White's pieces from hitting b5...
My reply is the English Attack. This is my favorite response to the Sicilian (particularly Najdorf), because I find it preserves White's ability to counter any aggressive moves from Black, while still being able to advance on ground of his own. It also stops Black from moving the Queen to b6 (Qb6? Nb3!), so White's dark bishop becomes particularly powerful in these lines.
This move frees Black's dark bishop, and allows ...d5 to be a possible move.
And this prevents an annoying Ng4! after Black plays e5.
Black decides to start a pawn storm on my knights.
Opening theory normally scolds us for putting knights up against a wall, but this is a good square for the knight, allowing White to contest much of the queenside, and Black must defend carefully.
This freezes the Na4 in place, and threatens Qxa2. White cannot play Nc3, and the b4 pawn is further defended from a3 and c3. Now it's White's turn to defend carefully.
More development for Black, opting to dominate the light squares via d5.
If the Black Queen has to retreat, it cannot defend b4, allowing me to win the exchange. Meanwhile, Black cannot exchange right now either (bxa3?? Qxa5!!).
I'm fine, thanks. This forces Ng8, because Nh5 lets White play g4, and the knight falls to the pawns.
For starters, the pawn wasn't dropped on e5. Black cannot capture this knight without paying dearly for it. A certain attack is made possible if Black does not give up his pawn on d4 right now...
And the door slams shut on the Black Queen's fate.
A desperate exchange to avoid losing more material in the short term.
I don't like this move, if only because I think Black can do better, like with Nfd7. It forces my bishop to retreat, and I wouldn't be able to play Qxb4 because Black would just play Bxb4. So while I have to be VERY careful about ignoring the pawn nearing promotion right next to my King on a1, I kinda felt, rightfully so, that the threat of a1=Q would not activate before I could advance counterthreats of my own.
Starting with the fact that both e5 and e6 have no defenders, and lie in front of the Black King.
Black wanted to shoo the rook away, but I don't care about my rooks this game.
Much more important to me is that his king is out in the open for my Queen to harass him with. The fewer defenders he has, the better I'll do with that scale of advantage.
As for this, I see why Black is reluctant to capture with the King, but staying there allows for...
The only square where I can't force Mate in the next 10 or so moves.
And his King falls. This was a fun and quick game, and I'll be sure to offer him his rematch once my games quiet down a little bit. It's good to be back, GameKnot! Thanks for reading this annotation! :)
must.
The hyper-accelerated dragon.  In the accelerated dragon black plays 2. ...Nc6.
Black will try and control the dark squares along the h8-a1 diagonal, especially d4 and e5.
Developing towrds the center and with an eye on d4 and e5.
Establishing the so-called Maroczy Bind.  Black often wants to play d7-d5 in the dragon lines, and the move 5. c4 is intended to discourage that possibility once and for all.  This used to be all the rage against the accelerated dragon, but theory maintains that black is OK.
Black wishes to complete his kingside development prior to issuing any challenges to white's position.  Black will seek counterplay along the dark squares and on the queenside.
With d5 out of the picture for the foreseeable picture, black opens the c8-h3 diagonal and prevents e4-e5.
It is often difficult to activate this bishop.  Notice that while the e and c-pawns have a cramping effect on black's position, they also limit the e2 bishop's mobility.
This capture trades one knight, which has moved twice, for one that has also moved twice.  In terms of the element of time, the trade would be neutral, except that it also brings the queen to a square that will come under attack.  The queen will be forced to move again, costing white a tempo.
One of several plausible continuations.  White develops the bishop first and then plays the queen behind it on either d2 or e3.
A typical queen and bishop battery along the c1-h6 diagonal.  A typical way of attacking the fianchetto is to try and exchange bishops leaving the (in this case) dark squares weak.
White wants to tie white down to the defense of the c-pawn.
A normal move.  White removes the rook from the long square diagonal and positions it on the c-file, where it can help defend the c-pawn, and where it will be come active, if the c-file is ever opened.  Typically, white's other rook goes to d1.
Notice how the queen can still influence the center even when developed to the side of the board.  From a5 she can help control e5, for example.  She is also clearing the way for the f-rook to transfer to the queenside.
Although the pawns on e4 and c4 seem secure now, this further weakens the h8-a1 diagonal.  As with many moves in chess, you have to give up something in order to get something.
Black is going to try and open lines on the queenside.  A well timed b7-b5 will usually free his position.
Black doesn't mind the ending, because the "Bind" isn't as significant as it is during the middlegame.
Black had to react to white's threatened knight fork on b6.  Notice that black's e-pawn isn't really hanging, because 16. Bxe7 would be answered by 16. ...Bh6  skewering the rook on c1.
Driving the bishop away.  17. Bh4 loses to 17. ...Bh6  so white retreats to e3.  Normally you wouldn't want to block your g7 bishop with a pawn on f6, but black is intending to continue on with f6-f5, reopening the diagonal.
White captures on f5 in order to open the g-file for his rooks.
I preferred this to the alternatives at the time, but it does lead to a further reduction in material.  Black stands no worse, but has little prospect of creating winning chances.
Following the captures, black has lost his "dragon" bishop, but his remaining bishop is better than white's.  This is not enough to make a difference in the game, however.
A very nice way to secure the draw.  It increases the bishop's mobility and prevents black from establishing a superior pawn structure.
Black grabs the centre. I know, from experience against Hugo as much as from knowing the principles, that, if Black grabs the centre now and opens up all his development lines, he will be able to develop extremely quickly, by developing a piece with check, White has to defend, Black develops again and gains a tempo, and so on. After this sequence, Black has a well-developed, powerful position, while White has a weak position after floundering around defending his king. Black can then expect to win with a quick attack.
Bad move. In previous annotations in which the Hummuschluggg has been played (ask jstevens!!) White has followed up with 3.e3 4.g3, or 3.g3 4.e3. Both these moves do not develop, and therefore increase Black's chances of winning with quick development followed by an early attack. However, I can see the logic behind these moves: these close all the attack lines pointing towards White's king, allowing White to continue and develop in relative quiet for the next few moves, without any irritating checks. White's move here looks good initially, striking at the centre to try to deal with Black's control, however, it completely opens up the c5-f2 diagonal attack line, allowing me to attack down it.
Black's developing-with-tempo sequence plan comes to fruition. Black now controls a lot of central space, has a lead in development, and has a very strong position to attack from. White is now completely lost - although some people will argue he was lost from 2.Kf2??. If 4.Ke1, 4...dxe4! 5.fxe4 Qh4+!! 6.Ke2 Qf2+ 7.Kd3 and White's exposed king will lose him the game soon enough. 4.Ke2 keeps the king in relative safety, however, White's position is too slow to develop, as the bishop and queen are blocked by the misplaced king on e1, and Black will be able to develop and attack, completely unhindered. And, finally, if 4.Kg3 - we'll soon see what happens. Nobody spoil the surprise! :-)
Apart from anything else, this would have appealed to Hugo's rather over-imaginative sense of adventure. The heroic king, swashbucking across the board, leading his inspired army to victory: I can see the storybook potential of that. Hugo definitely would have liked that. However, Black has a reply that probably does not appeal to Hugo's sense of adventure at all:
I'm not much of an e5 player, but I chose to play it because I was hoping for a real Morphy King's Gambit game.
I debated between the S�rensen Defense immediately (d5), but I decided to see my opponents reaction to Qe7.
An attempt to solve the e4 pawn, but instead later it allows me access for a decent post in his territory.
Preventing the imminent castle at least for the moment
Support to the knight; frees the queen
More support to the knight and also an indirect attack to the queen.
I figured I had decent position and I was welcome to the trade; however, my opponent fell for the trap....
gobbling the a7 pawn and...
Support to the bishop and also attacking the b2 pawn
Here I looked into the position a little bit deeper and decided this was still in my best interest even after
I was rather surprised at this move, I assumed he'd take the queen, but instead he tried to launch an attack at my weak base.
There was no immediate checkmates and I figured he could chase me around and I could end to safety at g6 if needed
There's the Qb2...i get an extra pawn and let the trade occur
He too decides it's too hard to continue.
A move which can cause black problems despite white being unable to play Nc3 to attack the queen
This pin risks whie losing his e5 pawn, if he had originally played d4 this would not be an issue
Black willingly weakens his own pawn formation, better would have been to give up the pawn to weaken white's initiative
Better would be Nd3, threatening a queen trade-off to weaken black's attack as well as winning the c pawn
A needless attack causing white to fall even further behind. A trade-off of queens would help white equalize, after Qxe7, Nxe7, Rxc5 and white has managed to win back his pawn, with equality
Again white had the chance to trade-off the queens and win the pawn via Qe5  Kc8 Qxc5 Qxc5 Nxc5 and white should be able to draw without trouble
White played fairly well here, with a few mistakes, his biggest was the loss of his e5 pawn, would lead to an advantage for black throughout the game.
Time control was two hours each, though I started half an hour down on the clock due to flooding here.   Interestingly, when I arrived, my board (5) was already being played on!   So was 6 - I (as captain) had sent the team through while en route, but the early players missed this and played to the team as it had been the day before!   In the meantime, one game had been postponed and board order had changed.   I couldn't play on 7 due to ratings gaps, so a quick rejig saw board 6 - ten moves in - re-designated as board 7, while their board 7 was bumped up to 6 to play me with colours reversed.   The fun of being a captain!
The Sicilian.   I've put the game into Fritz as I've posted it here, so its thoughts are noted as we go.   But of course Fritz can't really take the time to explain its rationale, particularly in positional positions - which is where I'm hoping the gameknot community can come in!
This also helps me, giving me the c3 square for my knight.   More common is to leave the tension and try force white's knight to a3 or d2 instead.
So for the next while, the d-pawn is free to advance.   But for the next few moves, I try to set up the standard IQP threats - a bishop to c4, a knight to e5, rooks into the centre, the queen to d3.   It seems a bit early yet for an attack given I'm hardly developed.
Seems logical.   I need to keep a future Na5 in mind if it means taking my LSB off the a2-g8 diagonal.   For now, it's not a threat though.
A good square for the rook.   e7 can be a focal point for tactics later if I can get in Ne5 and Nxf7.   But that's a long way away; for now, I think this is just the best square for the rook.
Now I wanted to keep my bishop on the current diagonal, so this was played against Na5.   But maybe this is over cautious?   Fritz gives it as a very slight inaccuracy, giving 11. Bf4 as about 0.2 better.
Fritz prefers Rc1 or the d5 break here, but not by much.   I hadn't yet considered d5, as after 13. ... ed 14. NxP NxN 15. BxN, I didn't see what I had.   But Fritz says black has nothing better then than 15. ... Be6, allowing 16. BxN PxB, when black has some pawn weaknesses.   I would have thought the d5 push should achieve more than this though?
The bishop can hop between a2 and b1 as needs be.
Stopping the knight coming into c4, and taking advantage of e5 now being available.   But again Fritz calls for 16. d5 - yet as it plays through the analysis, it becomes less enamoured with the move.   So is it time for the move yet?   There don't seem to be any material-winning tactics as yet.
The knight is immune from capture (17. ... NxN?? 18. PxN and black can't save the knight on f6 and prevent mate on h7), and I'm aiming to force a weakness on the kingside.
There we go.    It's something at least.   Maybe at a future stage, a h4-h5 push could help crack black open some more.   Obviously the knight on f6 would need to be addressed.  I had a vague idea of a plan along the lines of h4, Re3, Rh3, h5 and saccing the exchange to open the king.   I don't know how effective that would have been though.   And it doesn't fit in with my next move.
I've played reasonably well so far (says Fritz), but this throws away all my advantage.   I wanted to bring the bishop back to the same diagonal as the king, as the g6 move seemed to have blunted its scope too much on b1.   But I've missed 18. ... b4 19. ab NxB and my LSB is taken off the board.   So instead, Fritz wants to bring more pieces towards the king - Bh6 or Qf3.   Though I'm starting to get a little bit frustrated at the lack of decisive action; maybe I just need more patience!
My opponent misses his chance, and I have a big advantage now.   This move is a shame - it seems that black has thrown away the game.   So I'm trying to go back over my previous moves to see where I could have improved.   If the play was ok (as Fritz thinks it roughly is, 18. Bb2 aside), what were my routes to victory?
The f6 knight now must get kicked to an awkward square - and it also needs to protect the d7 bishop.
I was a bit surprised at this move - it came quickly, and I hadn't really analysed PxN fully; it had to be good - but Fritz gives it as the best, though it drops a pawn.
Looking to avoid giving black the open f-file after I swap bishops
23. ... QxQ isn't an option in light of the zwischenzug 24. BxP+, and I'm two pawns up.   So I get to keep the queens on, which has to help me.
And I hit the weak pawn.   I was unsure between this and 24. Qb3; I figured on this one as it was closer the king.   Fritz slightly prefers 24. Qb3, I guess to help cover a future intrusion on c2.
Forced to cover the pawn (and save the queen, of course).
Redeploying with tempo
Resignation.   The queen must fall to avoid mate.   After putting the game through Fritz, it seems I played better than I thought (18. Ba2 aside) - but it didn't seem to me like many of the standard IQP plans really came into play.   Happy to hear suggestions from others on how to improve my play!   The IQP is common in the c3 Sicilian and other lines I play (like the Panov-Botvinnik against the Caro-Kann) - I could always do with improvement!
g3 is an interesting second move here, conceding the middle of the board and giving the g1 Knight only one option of Nh3, but at least it wasn't g4, which would lead to ... Qh4#.
Continuing to develop pieces and establish control of the middle of the board.
First aggressive move forcing the Bishop to retreat to d6 or e7.
I decide not to take the a5 pawn and instead attack the overprotected f3 pawn to weaken his right side.
I would rather he attack my pawn on e4 so I can move my Knight on f6 into a better position, preferrably to g5.
He attacks the e4 pawn and then moves his Bishop, and my Knight is now in position to move to the g5 square protected by my Queen and attack his isolated Knight on h3.
Forgetting the pin I mistakenly move to attack the pawn.
Again, a pin onto the Rook, this time with a Bishop pinned.  I probably should have traded Bishops even though it would allow him to attack my Queen with his Knight, and force him to scatter his position too much.
A trade is obviously not a good idea in this situation, and Qa6 leaves my Queen too confined, Qd3 moves my Queen back on to a move open field.
With his Bishop finally off of the longest white diagonal, I decide to attack his h1 Rook.  He moves his Bishop back to e4 and we swap.
Since he now has control of the middle I need to to try and consolidate my position.  Eventually I plan to move the Knight to take out either the c3 or e3 pawn to greatly weaken his extended pawn line.
I cannot move my Queen into a proper position to counter Nb3 as an attack on the d6 square, so I have to retreat it.
His mistake of Nc4 allows for the pawn fork of his Queen and Knight, and gives me a more open position where I only need to worry about linear movement.
With my King on f8 pinned behind my two pawns and Knight, I need to allow for an escape to h7 to prevent a simple backline checkmate.
He defends with Qc4 to pin my Knight to my Queen, which would make a fork of Ne3 a bad idea costing me a Queen and Knight to his Queen.  However, Qd3 would've been a much better move, as now his King is very vulnerable to Qxe3 and so forth.  Eventually, it's this move that really ends up costing him.  While I would've responded to Qd3 with ... Bg5 putting further pressure on the e3 pawn, he could still be in a position to defend the crucial e3 pawn with one of his rooks.
He saves both his Queen and Rook by attacking my King forcing it to h7, but then makes the mistake of trying to save his rook by pinning my Knight to my Queen.  This mistake will eventually cost him his Queen and one Rook to my Bishop and my Knight when I place his King into check with three consecutive moves.  A better move would have been Rc1 to defend against Qc2+ even though it trades his Rook on f1 for my Knight.  Rf2 would also defend the c2 square, but allow for me to play ... Qxb1+ taking his Rook without trading my Knight, as well as continue attacking his King.
The first check forces his King to move to a3.
This second check forces him to block the check with either his Queen or his Rook.  If he blocks with his Queen, I can take it off with bxc6 and then if he takes my Knight with his Rook on e1, I can use cxd4+ to put his King in check again with my Bishop and force mate in a few different varations, but nonetheless force Rb4 dxe3 taking his Rook on e3 and leaving the other one pinned to his King, continuing on in something like mate in 5 as follows:<n><n>41. g4 Qxc3+ <n>42. Ka2 Bxb4 (this move takes off his second rook)<n>43. g5 Ba3<n>44. g6+ fxg6 or g6+ Kxg6<n>45. Kb1 Qb2#
And the third check.  This forces cxb4 and results in Qxc8.
So after Rxe3 the exchange is complete, he will be down to just the Rook and pawns versus my Queen and pawns.
Now I start to begin setting up forks with my Queen, trying to capture his Rook.
By playing Rc3 instead of something like Kb5, he allows me to take off his h2 pawn and still be able to get back to protect my pawn on b6.
A good move here as he protects his g4 pawn and Rook at the same time after the move of ... Qd4.  However, I might not have taken off the g4 pawn in exchange for my pawn at b6 since his pawn isn't really a threat, and I would rather keep three pawns on the board instead of just two.
Not a very good move here.  I can go Qd5+ and take his pawn with no consequence.
If he responds here with anything other than Kb4, he loses his Rook.  He has four other moves to make.<n><n>1. Rc5 would result in Qxc5+<n>2. Ka4 would result in Qxc4+<n>3. Kxb6 would result in Qxc4<n>4. Ka6 would result in Qxc4<n><n>Note that Kb4, being the only move that protects his Rook, also prevents him from taking my pawn on b6 when I play ... Qxg5.  I could also have played this move one turn earlier, although his pawn would not have been on g5.
I could've gone Qc5+ here and forced a trade that would've eliminated his rook.  However, his King was close enough that I couldn't just automatically move my pawn on g7 all the way down for a Queen.  Therefore, there was no reason to trade my Queen just to eliminate his last power piece.
Since his King was close enough to catch either pawn before they reached the end line I decided to just start moving my f column pawn and then protect it with my Queen or eventually move the g column pawn if necessary.
The key is to offer both sides plenty of positional troubles and goals to solve, while keeping tactics alive and well. That means there should be contact and tension between the forces, and the position needs some real imbalance to it positionally. If you turn it to a tactical melee, it is not really about safety check, but about calculation and tactical skills.
By the way, my opponent's USCF rating is close to 1800. Although this game was rather one sided, I had to make it that way.
Generally, it is a mistake to play this kind of way, allowing my center to grow more powerful. However, white has a tactical idea in mind.
Now white pretty much has to take the d5 knight, because otherwise his idea is ruined.
Now white has a real problem to solve- his king. Also, the bishops are in contact with the white army, and could attack the weaknesses. White really has no tactic chances vs black. OK, black did have to sacrifice a pawn to do it, but so what? White cannot promote that extra pawn. The desciption fits the typical club player, who in this case is stronger than average. He likes material and highly values it, so subconsciously rejected ...Nd5 as being good for white, since he wins a pawn. He is willing to go through these troubles since he has the pawn. In my opinion, he is fighting a losing battle.
Attack the pawn. Now white played the move he had planned on the move before, without making the safety check- Not a good idea, since I had foreseen this move, and knew it had to be bad.
(??) Now black is losing immediately. Is the white player weak? Some strong players may say so, but he is in the strong level if he were to play on the site, probably well in the 1900/2000 range if he takes his time, but it depends on how much time he uses, of course. The point is that white had to concentrate so hard on his positonal troubles, and failed to safety check the black ideas. This happens naturally to most club players. That is the reason for them to make these tactical blunders without being in a tactical position.
Now black is winning, and the rest of the game shows the technical plan, in which black consolidates material(not much of this, since black is still far more active) and then starts a decisive attack, winning more material.
Now black has a nice little combination to force the win through.
I wish to play the Catalan, so the Knight does not belong on c3 in most lines.
Winning the tempo for Black, though it doesn't really matter in this position.
Eying the e5 for my knights.  Always looking for good outposts for my knights.
? A weak move which simply creates dark square weaknesses.  I assume that Black was scared of my d3 bishop, but that is no way to approach chess.  Prophylaxis is good, but this way too much.  I always strive to play active moves and reach for the initiative rather than react to my opponents moves.
Developing the rook to the semi-open file.
?? Another weak move that creates a weakness.  Normally in these positions, White must use the "minority attack" a4,b4-b5, to attack the c6 pawn and make a weakness.  Black just saved me several tempi and accomplished my goal for me!
The bishop escapes, yet at the cost of a tempo, allowing my pieces to come alive.
Another weakness.  My coach used to say that every pawn move is like giving away a hundred dollar bill.  It is fine giving a hundred dollar bill if you are buying something very valuable.  But, if you are just throwing them away that is no good at all (unless you are Bill Gates I guess) !  So, be careful when you make pawns moves.  They can be very good, but they always create a weakness.  Pawns can never return, or guard the space left behind.  The key is to strive to take the space left behind.
I decided to analyze one of my loses, especially, because my opponent found a beautiful way to end the game.
And now we are definitely out of the book. As shown later in the game, the rook does not belong here. But I was worried that White plays Bh6 at some point and I wanted to be able to play Bf8 for defence, and possibly Ne8 if necessary. However, especially with opposite side castling, concrete lines are more important than vague ideas.
This pawn push serves multiple objectives. It frees the b7-square for the bishop, and advances a pawn towards the enemy king. Later, b4 might force White to move the knight, which leaves e4 unprotected.
The bishop will go to f3, where it opposes the b7-bishop. White does not have to worry about 12. b4, because he can exchange on f6, eliminating the knight that attacks the e4-pawn.
Following my plan. I add pressure on e4 and develop the bishop.
This might seem like a random move, but it has an idea behind it. I was calculating what happens after White plays 14. e5. Then White can play Bxb7 in many lines attacking the rook and basically forcing the recapture with the queen. I did not like the queen on b7. Now the rook can capture the bishop. But the other side of the coin is that the rooks are not easily connected, which leaves the d8-rook a little vulnerable, and the b5-square is an obvious square for a knight fork, if White can make it work tactically.
Here comes the b4-push. I wanted to dislodge the knight from c3 where it protects the e4-square.
I simply capture the pawn, not sensing the danger. 15...bxc3 16. exf6 did not appear good, because I could not take back on f6, because the queen on g3 allows White to take back with Bxf6.
Ok, White takes with the bishop and not with the pawn. After 17. exf6 I had planned 17...Qxg3 simplifying into an endgame, where Black has better pawn structure.
This is the blow that ends the game. I just stared at the board for a while, and slowly I began to see that I was completely lost. White did not take back the piece, but offers an other one. But 18...axb5 19. exf6 threatening both the queen and a checkmate on g7 wins, because 19...Qxg3 is followed by 20. Rxd8#. A counter-threat like 17...Qb6 is just not enough: 18. exf6 g6 19. Rxd8+ Qxd8 20. Nxa7 and White can probably even save the knight, because the knight on b8 is only protected by the queen. I did not like losing a rook, so I decided to give White a chance to go wrong.
Non serve 4.e5 per d6xe5, 5.dxe5, DxD, 6.RxD, e il cavallo salta tranquillamente. Rimane la perdita dell'arrocco in cambio di un buon pedone in e5.
White chooses to extend.
Black is becoming more tangled up, white needs to build the pressure.
!? Although this damages my pawn structure, it gains a tempo, forces white into an awkward spot as his knight must move to e5 or e1, and gives me time to halt white's pawn advancement pressure.
I was toying with the idea of Nxe3, but the bishop barred it from being a successful plan.
Now there is only one pawn for me to deal with. At worst, my knight can be exchanged for it.
! The rook was hanging. If white retakes, 26. ... Rxa1#
Regaining the material, and establishing a strong base of operations in the middle of the board.
Obviously I'm no Steinitz, but 10.Bd2 seems a little safer as the dark squared bishop can now be made to retreat if black plays h6.
White once again attempts to maintain his tempo.
! Logical and strong! Black cannot castle now or his knight falls.
! Setting up a beautiful sacrifice that will follow once black retreats his king to protect his queen. Can you see it?
In utter frustration, Bardeleben just stared at the board and let his time expire. A beautiful attack by Steinitz, where his opponent was literally doomed no matter what he played after move 22. I hope you have enjoyed it:) - Thomas
I suppose to prevent the b4 move.
Decide its time to get rid of the knight.
I predict an attack in the centre from the queen pawn.
Bishop move did seem slightly pointless as i think it would have been more useful on the square it was on. I may have played the queen pawn instead if i were him but i havent checked the outcome thoroughly.
i decide to grab more of the centre. Nxd5 may have weakened my attack slightly.
i try to get rid of the bishop to allow my rook the file expecting that he will take it
i try to trick him to take the pawn not expecting he will take it.
Surprisingly he takes !! not sure if its a trap but i decide to take the bishop. Bare in mind that the pawn was the first piece to be taken.
Decides to push the pawn to attack bishop and cause problems in my defense
I move the king here to stop pawn advancement ( not that he could) and to also allow the knight to attack the pawn
I expect he wants to free up the file for his rooks.
50 seconds on my clock versus 1 minute and 50 seconds
Bishop swap?
i defend the pawn to allow my knight freedom to roam around. Free range knights are better after all apparently.
probably not the best but i knew if he did kf1 i would do nxd4 and alls good
i continue to take the pawn with an 8 point lead but under 10 seconds left
But its checkmate. With 6 seconds remaining i manage to pull off a win. <n>Thanks for reading
Not with the dsb. Bb5+, c3, Ba5, heading to c7... is just too slow.
now I have a tempo on b2, soon.
It's ok. But black is starting to lead the game. White can play b4 later, but Nb1... has no square for some move on!
Developing, in order to castle Qside... if white lets me.
The reason was: after this move, black still has g4 as a threat. After gxf, my Q is kind of cut off the attack, and g2 seems defendable. Moreover: white will be worried by my Q, and will lose the c5 pawn.
It looks not bad for black: white failed to open my K's position, and I am very near to open his.
Now, I swear my opponent thought I was about to sac the Nc5, but no. g4 is almost a goner, I don't have to lose a N for it.
Still, not the best: Bxg4, and if white takes the N, BxNf3 would be very strong, as gxB, Rg1+, Ng3, and then I just have to push the h pawn. In a quick view, of course. We were both with short time.
Only move to stop me. Now, g4 is a mistake, since after Nh5, I'll have to sac the exchange to continue... probably winning, but risky!
Better is to double R. Bg4 (not Ng4 or QxN) was probably best.
I plan Nh2 at some point. Again I sensed g4 was too "simple" to be good, but probably I was wrong.
? If not for the Ne2, I'll play Nxg3, no doubt.
Defending g5 and opening the way for my Q.
If black pushes the f pawn, white must then decide whether to sacrifice the knight or the bishop.  Though Nc7! (discovered check with the bishop) would give white the a rook, it would cost the bishop.  Hm, actually, white's black bishop move is starting to look better and better.
Instead of taking the bishop, what about white's b pawn?  Sure, white's black bishop could then pick off the rook, but then white's a rook falls to the black bishop.  Unless white moves the rook (Rb1), in which case black must respond with Bg7.  KxB follows BxB.  If white opts for the rook trade black makes out a pawn ahead.
White's knight had to go somewhere.  NxB puts baby in the corner while burying black's a rook almost as deep as it currently is.  (Two moves are required to get the bishop out of the way, as opposed to one move to slide the rook back).
Better to protect that pawn with the rook, maybe.  The queen is too easy to push around.
White is up four points.  Every trade works to white's further advantage.  I'm not sure why this was preferred to NxB, though it does prep BxPg6, a sweet move picking off the remaining black rook.
Black trades a rook for a rook and pawn.  He'll need better swaps than that to make up those three points.  And without rooks.
...and doubled pawns.  Here Bc3 lets black advance the d pawn a bit, though white still has a knight to trade.  Actually, scratch that.  The bishop obviously must go down for the d pawn.
Trades still work to white's advantage even though the score is tied.  White has more pieces.  That black bishop was sort of worthless, though, not sure it was worth a knight.
?  Not even going to make a gesture?
:)  Black is forced to move Pg5 to prevent sudden death.  PxP!, KxP, RxP (just because it is there)...
This generally transposes to the Bronstein-Larsen variation where White already has a pawn on d4...White gains little by avoiding the advance of the pawn.
This is probably a little unsound, but the open lines give Black good practical chances.
The Queen usually goes here and by deploying it early Black keeps flexibility over the placement of his minor pieces. The idea is also to deny the White bishop the f4 square, as g3 makes less sense with the other bishop already on c4
Black defers the decision on where to put his e-pawn...while e6 is normal the aggressive e5 can sometimes be an option.
The only move! White cannot allow Black to get organised with Nf6.
I'm looking to post my knight on f5.  If 11 Nxd4 exd4, white would probably move 12. Ne2 or 12. Nd5.  If 12. Nd5, I would follow with 12 . . . Nxd4 13. Bxe4 fxe4.  Now white must move his Knight on f3.  If 14. Nd2, I would move 14 . . . Re1 with the idea of e3.  White's knight on d5 seems to not make much sense anymore.  With a simple pawn move up to c6, White will retreat.  White's best move would have been 12. Ne2, however; black still has excellent position at this point.
It may have been good for white if he had made an in between move of 11 Re1, although 11. Bg5 is useful later on to white, and it is a good position for white to have.
This is one reason why I moved my knight to d4.  I didn't want to have to retake with my pawn on g6.
This is an excellent move by white.  I can't capture white's knight with my knight due to the pin.  After 15 . . . Nxd5 16. Bxd8 Rxd8 17. cxd5 Rxd5.  If I decide to protect my f6 knight due to the double threat, white wins a pawn with 14. Nxc7.  Since I am going to be down one point, I need to make the best of my situation.  Generally speaking, when you are down a point, more pieces are better.  In addition, I have lost several games because of one pawn.  Being down 1 point due to a rook traded with a knight and a pawn can sometimes be better.
Even though I am down 1 point, I have good position.  From here, it may be best for white's bishop to retreat to d2, or to h4 - which would leave 18. Bh4 g5 19. Bg3 e4
White chose Bd2, and I chose to free up my black bishop; although my Nf5 looks exposed.  I could have moved my king to h7, but thought this would give me better position.  I plan on moving my Nf5 anyway.
I want to move my Nd5 to f4, but now is not the right time.
I want to capture white's bishop, and I also want to advance my queenside pawns.
After b3, I will capture Be3 as planned.  From my point of view, b3 is a wasted move.  For although it does force my Knight to move, I was going to attack anyway.  And at a later time, white could have moved b4.  However, white does not know I want to capture his bishop.  Usually when you are down points, you don't want to trade.
I am hoping for 26. Nd4 so I can trade my bishop for his knight and place my knight on the key f4 square.
Luckily, the trade occurs and I move my knight to it's destination.
I will now advance my pawn to e3, but I am wary about the exchange of pawns on c6 and d5.  I absolutely do not want white's rooks in my territory.  That would be devestating.  Instead, I intend on keeping white's focus on my e-pawn.
I must move my rook to this position.  Anything else could spell out disaster.
This move does not bother me, and it allows my king to begin the long trek to white's queenside.  This will allow more maneuverability by my rook
I was hoping white would make this move and pin my rook.  I will end up forking white's rook and king.
From this position, I can almost smell victory.  I have plenty of pawns for support, and will be up 1 pawn after the exchange.
I can reach my pawn in time.  From here, I need to focus on my endgame strategy.
If I only had my h pawn, and no other pawns were on the board, this would be a stalemate.  However, the extra pawns give me the advantage I need.
White's queen now has to chase my h pawn.  This gives me enough tempo to capture white's pawns and promote a queen.
The Bishop's Game. Not the most popular anymore, but theoretically equal, and with some good chances for White if Black is unprepared.
Transposing to the Vienna Game.
3...Bc5 or 3...Nc6 are more standard here. The text move leads to exciting, probably-equal play, falling somewhere between those calmer lines and the wild Frankenstein-Dracula variation (3...Nxe5!? 4.Qh5+ Nd6 5.Bb3 Nc6 6.Nb5 g6 7.Qf3 f5 8.Qd5 Qe7 9.Nxc7+ Kd8 10.Nxa8 b6).
4.f4 is the book move here, not that we're at all off the GK database yet. The main intent of the Vienna Game, though, is generally for White to transpose into a favorable line of the King's Gambit. There's no danger of Black winning the e-pawn for free, because 4.f4 Bxc3 is met with 5.dxc3 Nxe4 6.Bxf7+ Kxf7 8.Qd5+ and White wins the Knight back with a strong position.
?! Now we're off the GK database; this move just begs Black to inflict some doubled pawns on the White queenside.
Black accepts the offer.
?! White proposes a nasty kingside attack, but forfeits the ability to drive a Black Bishop away from g4.
It's hard to say what the right thing to do here is. The text allows Black to further mangle White's pawn structure, but there's no way to drive off the Bishop, either. Maybe Qe2-e3??
!? Black unpins his Queen, threatens f2, and begins an attempt to restrict White from playing d3-d4. She's now far from being able to defend the kingside, though, so Black will need active counterplay to avoid being run over.
Black adds a defender for g7 momentarily, but this Knight is destined for f4, in an attempt to shut the WQ out of the attack or force a trade to lessen the pressure.
! This sacrifice shuts down White's attack entirely, for if 16.Bxf8 Rxf8, White has exchanged a powerful, aggressive piece for an entirely passive one of his opponent's. 15...Nf4! also shuts the WQ out of the attack, and thanks to the doubled pawns it is completely untouchable without at least an even exchange--which is to say, a favorable exchange for Black.
Leaving the Rook on the queenside to create problems for White, and relocating the Knight to a more useful spot where it can reach g6 or e6.
White continues to press, but he doesn't really have any way to proceed.
Trying to remove the e5 pawn defending the Black Knight.
If 20.dxe4 dxe4 and there's no way for White to get rid of the pawn defending Black's bothersome Knight.
Preparing to double Rooks on the g-file and thunder down on the BK.
?! White seems prepared to take the Knight by force, giving back his material advantage if he has to--he simply has no way to make headway against the BK without his Queen in the picture. Look at that pretty white cage she's trapped in.
With the obvious threat of ...Qxa3+ and suddenly Black will have an attack that White can neither ignore, nor properly defend.
The only way for White to shore up a3 and c3.
Black threatens to win at least a pawn with ...cxd4, as White cannot retake; his c-pawn is pinned to his undefended Queen. Additionally, the weak c3 pawn itself is coming under fire.
I think 23.Qe3 might have been stronger here, to prevent Black's onrushing queenside incursion, but now White's battery is prepared, and he invites Black to play ...Nxh5?, defending g7 and winning a pawn--anything to get that Knight off of f4, because if that happens, White's forces spring back to life in an instant.
! This pawn is worth much more than the h-pawn (especially since 23...Nxh5? is met by 24.Qg5! g6 25.Rh1 with a winning attack (thanks to tiger_lilov for the continuation)). Black is also looking to force a trade of Queens, and with the WQ gone and no more reason to block that diagonal, Black's heroic Knight will have one final blow to deal to the White forces--24.Rxg7?? dxc3+! 25.Qxc3 Qxc3+ 26.Kxc3 Ne2+!
The only way to avoid Black forcing the Queens off the board.
?? I debated rating this only a mistake, but I really think this is the blunder that costs White the game. After this exchange he will be behind in material and have a vastly inferior pawn structure. 25.Qe3 would have been a far better choice, threatening to get behind the Black lines to deadly effect with Qa7.
Now it's down to a Rook-and-Pawn endgame--White has an advantage in superior King placement, but his pawns are tremendously vulnerable, and Black has the initiative.
Black invites White to further cripple himself by undoubling the Black e-pawns and isolating the already-weak White f-pawns. This move also forestalls c3-c4.
Defending the d-pawn with style.
?? White overlooks that the Rook can capture without any detriment to Black's position. He was already lost, but this clinches it, as now Black will have passed pawns on both sides of the board.
Black prevents the WK from coming near the d-pawn.
If now 39...Rxe4 40.Rd5 and the passed pawns are traded off--still a winning endgame for Black, but he has a simpler resource...
This forces White to exchange Rooks in order to stop Black from promoting. Once there are only Kings left, Black will have an easy time queening on one flank or the other.
Black leaves the WK tied down at the edge of the board while he mobilizes his own.
Desperation sets in. Even if Black foolishly plays 47...gxh6, White still loses the race to promote: 48.f5 a3 49.f6 a2 50.a7 a1=Q+ and Black cleans up the game in short order.
0-1. It's over for White; he loses either the d- or f-pawn next turn (with 48.Kc3 or 48.f5 respectively), and Black's queenside pawns will tie up the White King with perfect immunity (if the King takes the rear pawn, he cannot catch the other one) while the BK escorts the g-pawn to the queening square. Thanks very much to sieni01 for the excellent game, and I hope you all enjoyed seeing it. Comments on the analysis or the game itself are much appreciated; if you leave a rating please also comment letting me know what you liked or what I could do better. Thanks for reading!
Hi everyone!  This game was played in a themed MT with reference to Brigadecommander's (Janet's)  Stonewall Project which has thrown up some very interesting results.  For your's truly it was another milestone.  I actually defeated a former Expert who is a Runner in our Walking the Walk and Learning to Run group who resigned on the grounds of UNAVIOIDABLE MATE! Glen lost a lot of rating points partly due to form and timeout issues.  At the start of this game his rating was 1908 so I had to be content with only my third near-Expert Victory and retain my current username rather than an Expert Victory and the username "The Black Queen".  So, how did all this happen?  Well, read on .......
5. c3 - maintaining the Stonewall.
7. Ngf3 - looks as though there will be a mutual knight entrenchment on the squares e4 and e5!
13. Qh5 - suddenly Glenda decides to fly on her broomstick to the square h5 and put King Glenn in Old Matey's shadow.  Aggressive move no.1.
14. Nb3 - this seemingly non-aggressive move allows Fou Lenoir to get in on the action.  I have the square g5 in mind for him.
15. Qh6 - Glenda occupies this berth for the rest of the game.  If only I can get another unit in there.  King Glenn is now shivering!
17. Rab1 - to release my knight to come back to the kingside.
19. b4 - I now move my pawn to a square where it can be defended by another pawn.  Glenn is starting to get tied up a bit on both sides of the board.
28. .... Ra5 - Glenn continues to be bottled up on the queenside - although I will still have to keep my eye on his QR and the Witch.
29. g4?! - Nxe6 followed by Nxe6 30. Bxf5 was recommended by Gameknot Analysis.  However, this move was to prepare to blast open the files leading to King Glen and stick a rook on either the f or g column as appropriate.
31. Bxf5 - here comes the bishop sac.  If Fou Leblanc is taken then my rook will come to g1 (conditional move set) and threaten a nasty discovered check (Nxh7+) with mate to follow in short order.
32. Rg1 - here Glenn waves the white flag.  He is now a pawn down and Bxg6 is threatened next move followed by what was said in my previous note.  Gameknot Analysis indicated #in 8 from here.  I am really chuffed that a mating attack of mine against a former Expert has been so successful and I hope there will be more of these to come!  For now, read and enjoy - Kind regards - Joanne
And Black goes for the Philidor's Defense. I'm not a real fan of this opening for Black. I think it's a tad passive, and allows White to just charge right into the center with attacking power. I can't remember any time where this opening gave me pause- is there a value in e5-d6 this soon at all?
He plays this, apparently the so-called Berger variation. I don't like this line at all. Yes, this stops White from putting either knight or the Bishop on b5, but this is passive for Black's developing and it's not like Black can't hold a grip on c6 in case I were to try and go in that way. If Black's king were in danger, I think the alternative ...Be7 would help get the King in a position to hide away sooner.
This bishop has nowhere good to go now, on the other hand, so I push it here to further prevent Bg4 from Black and I ready myself to castle.
Once again, opting to passively protect the two strongest squares for the bishops to be on, but I think this is mostly a waste of time for Black. Black only has 1 back rank piece and no stake in the center, against my near perfect control of the center and three developed back pieces! White is clearly better here.
Putting my king away and allowing several possibilities for White's next best moves, ranging anywhere from f4, Re1, Bc4... the list continues.
Once again, I think he's worrying about the wrong bishop. Why not Be7?
This was more of a waiting move. It maintains control over d4, and opens the door for the Queen to join the bishop on a possible h6 attack if the Black King castles short. Black must consider carefully.
I miscalculated the strength of his next move, or even the strength of my bishop compared to his here. Frankly, looking back, I wish I tried f4 here or something.
He moves the knight back. Not sure if I like the repetition of moves out of Black... the other knight on b8 was already protecting the Bd7 with the Queen. Heck, would even Ng5 be better?
I know that I can't move the bishop to h3, and retreating seems like ripping a page out of the book I'm preaching against. So, I try to make the most out of a miscalculation, hoping to tempt Black into playing g6 and weakening the kingside even further.
Black finally plays this, aiming to castle, not seeming to mind the thought of my bishop on f5 yet.
So I play this, having a plan to keep my control of f5 in case he decides to start an exchange.
He finally hides the king away to safety.
There was an idea behind this, but once again, I think I miscalculated the situation. The idea here was to pin the pawn on h6 down and the g7 pawn would remain frozen in place as a result. It increases focus on the center and I would have superior pressure against his King in the end of the exchanges. Of course, this didn't quite go according to plan, but I can't say it was a complete failure either- my ideas wouldn't have worked if this pawn was still on h2. What was my best move here?
Anyway, Black starts pointing his spears toward my center pieces, and I need to start considering how I want the exchange combinations carefully. Frankly, Black probably had the right idea here.
I begin by threatening more pieces than Black. It's tough to say if this is inaccurate or not.
I exchange this knight first to cause more of an instability on his queenside, and an attack on his Queen to boot. Black can't counterthreat, so this knight has to be addressed right now.
...while I did eventually see this bishop landing here as a possible outcome, this was way back when I had the other bishop and two knights barking down b5. So no, I didn't exactly see this coming once the exchanges started, and immediately I was cursing not looking closer after the fact.
I know that I can't save the pawn on h4 now, but it doesn't seem like a lost cause either. I tried to force this rook onto the square where it would be the safest from harms way for the next 2-3 turns. (I picked wrong.)
The bishop eats the dropped pawn, but now I have an idea to begin a trap in mind.
Starting here. I want to force the bishop away and I give my King a flight square.
Black then puts the bishop here. The threat should be obvious, but I was just too confused at why Black hadn't played Bg5 instead, and I was also too focused on my plan to notice what he was doing.
But it's okay, because I'm also sure that I have just barely enough resources in place to launch one final all out attack, even if I just dropped another rook...
Black eagerly eats the rook. I am now down a full Rook and two pawns at this point.
And I guess to Black's shock, I didn't revenge capture the Bishop either. There would have been no point- if I was wrong about the power of my remaining pieces, I was sure I was going to lose anyway, Bishop or not. But all my remaining pieces remain extremely powerful against his uncoordinated ones. After all, it's the Philidor's Defense we're talking here, so CHARGE!!!!!
I'm not sure if Black saw more defensive value out of his own bishop, or saw more risks in taking mine. I'm not sure what was Black's best move here.
But I did know I was very happy in pinning that pawn. Now the Bh6 lives whether Black wants it to or not, and I have a very dangerous attack in mind.
An attack that Black completely overlooks, and resumes trying to gain even more material.
If it's material Black wants, I'm offering it. (Frankly, I was quite worried about Black playing g6, I wasn't too sure of my options after that.) But now, the Black King is forced to move, and neither square looks that great for him.
Instead, Black makes his final, fatal blunder. Giving the bishop via Bh4 was the only saving move.
MATE! I have never seen myself in a steadily worsening material disadvantage (the move before this I was at MINUS EIGHT!) to land myself into a checkmate. I was very thrilled to have pulled this off, even against a lower ranked opponent, as I was sure I made so many mistakes this match. Was there ways for both sides to have played this better? Thanks for reading the annotation!
Here is my last game, and only loss, in my own mini-tournament - especially painful as I was 5 points up at the time of the clever checkmate!
Claiming space, as usual in the French Defence, by advancing the e-pawn, but this time it is with tempo as my knight move.
Now that I am up by a piece, I am happy to keep the game quiet, hence my castling on the same side as White.
NOW I finally went ahead with ...c5. I was trying to open up the position and hoping to free at least one knight.
Not a particularly good place for my rook, but then, it's better than a8 or b8.
My opponent's knights - which are in the middle of the action, unlike mine - are leaping into the attack. Perhaps, contrary to normal rules, my king would actually have been SAFER on the queenside!
Another knight hovering around my kingside.
The queens are exchanged off, and I, unbelievavly, already regarded the game as won. Like a beginner, I made the mistake of only counting the material on the whole board, not in certain areas of the board.
Freeing my g-pawn to kill the knight.
It was only then, at an overall 5 POINTS AHEAD, that I realised how much trouble I really was in. I couldn't flee with the king: 25.Bxh7+ stopped me in my tracks. Staying where I was, I had 25.Ng6+ to deal with. Advancing the pawn? Also 25.Ng6+, or maybe 25.Rxh6+. But the move I played was doubtless the worst of my options...
e6 rather than e5 in case the opposing player gets a bit materialistic...
Now we see white, playing materialisticly, attempting to save the pawn on c5. This move, however, leaves the rook open to attacks along the a1-h8 diagonal. A queen on f6 would be a strong move here. This is why e6 was played last move.
Trying to provoke either c3 or a3
The Knight has no other move than to retreat to its starting square
Blacks plan the attack the rook
Lining up a discovery on the king
Black now forks the rook and Knight
Re1?? Hangs the rook!!
Attacking the bishop on c3
g4?? Hangs the bishop
Black wants to get the remaining bishop off of its current diagonal to activate its own white squared bishop
Forces the king away from the defence of the Knight
Can't really call this a sacrifice as hxg4 is met with an immediate mate by the queen
At this point in the tournament, knowing nothing about this opening, (though having read the annotations from the first annotation project), I felt rather out of my depth. It seems to me though that if I can restrict whites development, and swap a few minor pieces off, I may have a chance. Trouble is, all my pieces are too restricted at the moment, so 9...e4 to provide more options for the queen and bishop. (Now it seems accepted that ...Bg7 is the best move.)
Getting the bishop out with tempo surely can't be bad? He can't effectively block the check so must waste a move with the king.
Clearing space on the back row. I can't protect either of the e-pawns so there's no point in trying.
One of them had to fall soon!
Moving to avoid the discovered check. Maybe not necessary yet as the e4 knight can't move anywhere too frightening, but I'm going to have to move the king anyway in order to escape via c7 or a7.
Obviously white needs to bring more material into the attack, and quickly!
I'm not too worried about Na4+ as the bishop is adequately covered, and simple exchanges suit me fine! I do need to get my king away though, and preferably all the way to b8. (He eventually makes it on move 30, by which time the castle has fallen anyway!
Hoping to chase the knight away, or swap it off.
He goes for the bishop instead. OK by me, hopefully my rooks can get involved more easily now.
This exchange I'm happy with, I'd like to make sure I keep the other rook for the endgame though. Trouble is, I failed to notice the imminent loss of my knight.
And the knight falls, though I do get 2 of those irritating pawns for it.
I failed to spot Bb2 here. Luckily so did he! Had he played it, I'd have had to play ...Qxb4, then if Bxh8 ...Qxc5 leaving me in a slightly worse position than the actual game, but with one less pawn to deal with.
Had to take with the queen to avoid that skewer.
Grab the open file. If he contests it, I'll swap rooks, grab the e-pawn, and then aim to keep my pawns to the white squares.
To me, a draw is looking likely, and I was thinking of swapping the rook and bishop for the pawn and queen,
still on the cards, but he would have the extra pawn, and his pawn structure is better. Besides, I tend to mess up rook+multiple pawn endings :)
And then I saw a potential threat involving a double attack on his g pawn.
...Ka8 wmay be better as the bishop can't reach it but I wanted to keep to the a pawn.
Had my king gone to a8 it wouldn't have been necessary to defend against Rc7. I'm feeling rather restricted now, but still can't see how white can convert this to a win.
Presumably in order to double on the c-file
suddenly the action swings towards the other side, and more importantly, away from my king!
I'm happy to swap my isolated pawn for his f-pawn, along with a rook exchange.
Swapping rooks immediately was an option, but I wanted his pawn to advance so when I took it my queen would be defending against ...Rf7+.
So material is even, but I have no potential targets to attack. White can win by swapping either piece for my queen. White's bishop is going nowhere at the moment, and his rook can't attack on its own. If I'm to get a draw, it'll likely have to be by perpetual check although if white is to win, he'll probably have to promote a pawn to do it, therefore, if I can prevent white promoting, I get the draw.
Now I can prevent whites pawns moving any further. If white plays 43. c5+ I'll have to play ...Ka4 as ...Qxc5; 44. bxc5 ...Kxa5 loses due to 45. a4! (meaning my own pawn prevents my king reaching his passer on c5.
Now, can the queen deliver perpetual check? I think so, because white can't block with the g-pawn, if the rook blocks the rank then I attack on the diagonal (as I'm already on a white square), and if he goes to g5, the rook can't block anyway. If I can persuade him behind the pawns then even better! Let's see what happens...
And there it is. Now, with hindsight, I feel a bit lucky to escape with a draw. If whites king had stayed closer to the pawns, then the pawns could have been used to block checks whilst advancing. A lone queen will beat a king and 2 pawns that far away from promoting, but with the rook as well? Can the queen force the king far enough away from the pawns with a rook interfering. That's why I sacced my pawns instead - to encourage him to do it for me! Should I have concentrated more on protecting my own pawns? Thoughts welcomed :)
The atmosphere in the DMZ tightens.
Black is preparing to stack rooks and hit the weak pawn at d3; White figures on defending with the B.
Out of thin air a R-Q alignment on d6-e7 shows up and is a prime target for the Bishop!  and there is free P at e5.... Should White take or make some preparations before striking?
Strike now, .....and hold on!
White gets the R for a N and P ...   and can go for a series of trades.
The Q exchange...
Even though White is ahead Rook to Bishop, White is unsure about stopping the connected two Pawns on the queen-side and the always nasty "Two Bishops".
Giving White the opportunity to take away the "Two Bishops" and get further pieces off the board.
There is the B for B.  Now to tighten up the middle.
The Black King is getting "confined to quarters".
Trying to take another P, but can't get Black to cooperate.
Surprising to White is that the Black Bishop appears to be trapped and can't get out of this corner.
White closes quarters on the 'trapped' Bishop, which should lead to further losses for White.  At this point Black resigns noting no reason to 'drag this out'.
This move (1) does not control center squares and allows Black to take the center with pawns and (2) develops the knight to a position that does not control KR4/h4.  The weakness of not developing to KB3/f3 will be seen.
My opponent allows me to play P-K4 as Black.  Unless White wishes to challenge the square KB4/f4, White's knight will be limited in scope.
An early Queen move that will allow Black to chase it around.  White can not challenge P-KB4/f4 right away because of 3...BxN 4 PxB Q-R4ch forcing the King to move.   White would need to make plans to Q-side castle first.
An early knight move that has no forces backing it up.  It will be easy to chase it off and gain time developing my own forces.
Basic development, but also preparing to limit moves for the WQ.
Time for White to retreat the Q to Q1/d1, followed by B-K2/e2.
Taking time to secure the back rank before embarking on attacks. Q-KN3/g6 or K3/e6 would be ambitious and not needed.
Avoiding BxN, which would trade a good bishop for a Knight on the side of the board.  The WN has no scope unless several moves are used to reposition it.
Preparing to open the KB-file for rook usage.
P-Q3, B-Q2, and then O-O-O would keep White solid.  The WK is now firmly set in the center of the board, which will allow for later attack.
The first consequence of the centered King.  <n>Notice how this Queen move could not be played if White developed his KN to the stronger square KB3/f3.
A neat tactic to win a pawn, owing to the undefended WB.
Black continues to use simple tactics to remove White's pawn protection. If 21 PxN QxBPch 22 K-Q2 QR-Q1ch 23 K any QxN   regaining the Knight and capturing yet another pawn.
RxR was needed to prevent mate, and to prevent the knight being pinned against the rook after R-KB1/f8.
The Caro-Kann is one of my favorite defenses. Black has all the advantages of the french and none of it's weaknesses. The only two weaknesses of the Caro-Kann are that black usually is a little worse in the endgame and white has an enduring space advantage. But in this game I choose to play a risky varation of the Caro-Kann; the Little know Bronstein-Larsen defense.
Here White chooses to exchange on f6 immediately Black has three main options <n>1. 6. ...Ndxf6 with an interesting game.<n>2.  play exf6 which leads to the Kornchoi defense<n>3. As I play gxf6 of the bronstien-Larsen Caro-Kann varation.
This is in my opinion an inferior move for black and is not for beginner players. I play it from time to time to spice things up. If black can survive the first wave of attacks by white he can usually get good counter play along the g file. This is known as the Bronstein-Larsen formation.<n> <n>Black's strategy is simple 1. Place the H rook on the g file where it will eye the weak g2 pawn. 2. Develop the bishops to the King side. 3. Prepare for a f6-f5-f4 pawn break. 3. Castle Queen side. Amass huge pressure on the g file by playing Qg5, or Qh5. Of course that is if he can do all that before white deals a quick blow! However, as seen in this game Black has major weakness , but it is not easy for white to exploit it with accurate play. Thus, after black endure the initial attack he can usually mount a sufficient attack along the G file, or white's weak d5 pawn.<n> <n>Black can also play exf6 moving into the Kornchoi variation. In that setup black has strong defensive and attacking chances. see this game for an<n><n>example: http://gameknot.com/chess.pl?bd=5122032
This move aims at the heart of Black's weakness. White can also try the quiet 7. c3, or Nf3. As strange as it may seem I do not think this is Whties best reply . I played a similar game against a player rated above 2000 which I managed to easily draw.
The advantage of Black's gxf6 plan is that it creates an open g file from which to launch an attack. As well, Black has an extra pawn in the centre to mount a timely push in the centre if white gets carried away.
Gaining tempo on the bishop on route to d5
I could actually do way with this move. I played it with the idea of queen side plans in the future. But thinking about it now it creates more weaknesses that out weigh it strengths.
White could capture on d5 but would give up the bishop pair. Usually it is not wise to exchange pieces so early especially bishop pairs. You never know if you are going to miss them!
making room on f6 for the bishop or knight as well as breaking communication between White's bishop and queen on d5. This effectively splits board in half.
and black's point is proven.
The bishop on g7 has two purposes. 1. to defend f6  2. To attack White's weak d5 pawn
this is a waiting move. It also allows the bishop to be developed to b7 or a6 if need be.
removes the pin and forces White to clarify the position
Bf4 was clearly stronger. The text move allows Black to equalize.
The exchange of queens would be in favor of black. <n><n>18. Qxf6 Bxf6 and Black's king side comes alive.
avoids the exchange.
Threatening Qxb6 and putting pressure on e6
This forces White to create a weakness in front of his king. It also does not give time for White to carry out his plans for e6 or b6. For the next few moves I employ a defensive strategy of Distraction. Meaning I stir up enough trouble that does not allow white to carry out his plans.
defends b6. It also means that my king is stuck in the centre, but for now it is the safest place for him to be.
I think Nf4 is better. It adds to the pressure on e6.
a risky move that seems to give white pause. The threat is to smash a hole in the king's pawn defense. Black is playing without fear and vigor.
White seeks to add to the defense of g3.
After I played this move I regretted it. I should have tried 22. ...h5. But my worry was that h5 is premature and I wanted to wait and see if White would become impatient and attack e6 prematurely. After which my mobilized king side pawn storm would have some teeth.  Still if others want to take this position where I feared to tread be my guest. I think h5 is playable. A possible continuation may be:<n><n>22. ...h5!? 23. Nf4(White's most active defense) Bf8(maneuvering to d6) 24. Rf3 Bd6 and white holds but black has a slight tactical edge.
here I was really starting to worry about the increasing pressure on e6. Someone who wants to play this Bronstein-Larsen variation of the Caro-Kann must have nerves of steel. Yet, in this game white still has not exploited Black's weakness!
Dodges any funny business on e6. And waits to see if white will get impatient. All my pieces are coiled and ready to explode.
White could have played Nf4 which I think is more in keeping of the spirit of his play. This allows black to gain tempo of the queen.
Again the exchange favors black because it blunts White's attack on e6. After the exchange White's attack fizzles to nothing.
Another inaccuracy. Better is Qb3. Which retains pressure on e6. It is clear that Itking really does not have a concrete plan. So it is a prefect opportunity for me to seize control of the game.
The critical move that signals that white has let his advantage slip away. Black's bishop pair dominate the board and the d5 pawn comes under heavy attack. Ironically if White had choosen to play c3 at the beginning the position would be level.
White feels obligated to create a further weakness in his king's pawn defense. I would be very reluctant to make such moves. I think Kg1 is better.
I was seeking to defend e6 and b6 at the same time. But after I noticed a strong reply by white 29. d5!.
White has been very careless with his pawns in front of his King. He creates a massive weakness on g3 which is only defended by the Knight! I suppose he was preventing h5, But he can not prevent f4!<n><n>29. D5 was a must!
This regains the pawn with a huge positional advantage. The bishop can not be taken because of 30. ...Cxd4 which removes the only defender of g3.
The breakthrough! At long last this is the point of Black's 6th move. The major motif of Black's game is to aim for this pawn push. If he is allowed to to play it it usually is lights out for white. Black's king pawns become a one man wrecking crew.
The position is rip for a mating attack. All of my pieces are concentrated in the king's position. White however, only has the knight to aid in the defence of the king.
attempting to defend g3.
White tries to put up a resistance but the end is never in doubt.
The Sicilian Rossolimo variation, the best thing about this variation from white’s point of view is that it tend not to be as forcing as some other Sicilian lines, so white can decide upon piece placement and long term positional plans.
from black's point of view the pressure over d4 is reduces by Bb5, as white can even exchange the bishop for the knight,  so we have a few possible choices here:<n>a) 3...g6 so black can fiancheto the bishop and regain some pressure over d4<n>b) 3...e6 with the idea Nge7, if possible before the exchange of white's bishop, then Bb5 would lack it's point<n>c) 3...d6 preparation of Bd7, after exchange Bxc6 Bxc6, black would exert pressure over e4<n>d) 3...a6 in my opinion a bad choice, as it loses one tempo so white can exchange and black could have developed a piece or opened some lines with a pawn advance, in this case just lost that oportunity<n>e) 3...Qc7, also losing tempos with the queen not my first choice also<n>f) 3...Nf6, is at the same time a solid choice but also a very fighting one, Richard Palliser, in His book "The Bb5 Sicilian" called this 3...Nf6 the fashionable line, due to several recent successful games with it, so this will be my choice for this game...
and now a bit of unusual play dxc6 instead of bxc6 (we all hear to capture towards the centre), but dxc6 allow an immediate release of the light squares bishop, plus with the alternative recapture bxc6 and the knight on f6 white can threaten it to gain some edge as was seen in Vescovi-Milos, São Paulo, 2002, black king would be vulnerable and white would get a great advantage
the queen controls the key square e5, Qc7 can also be done before 4.Bxc6, but then the capture would also be dxc6! as I said the purpose of Qc7 is to control e5...
now this was a surprise, although limited in scope, white wanted to exchange both his bishops, as there was no pin behind Bg5
forces decision... although questionable, I have some doubts about this move... as if it wasn't for this move 7.Bxf6 gxf6 would have allowed Bh6, I also had some doubts about 7...gxf6 were would I castle after it?
with 6...h6 there is no point in gxf6, gxf6 would have weakened black king's wing for nothing, so now I need to castle and place my rooks on the semi open columns
now both castle options are open, and the bishops are centralized
prevents Bg4... but there wasn't that option in my mind... I have the bishop pair and I'll stick to it, and playing Bg4 without at least the slight possibility of Bxf3 has no point...
here it is the first rook on a semi open column
no I'll grab the initiative an try to create some tension in the centre, my doubled pawns worth close to nothing will now be put to some gain, if exf5 would have allowed me a more open game for my bishops
now a new idea arises, from the need to relocate the bishop, lets try the main diagonal, and profit some from whites weakened dark squares on the queen's wing
white has the same idea, to use the open dark square holes on his camp, but he is one tempo down
opened the diagonal for the bishop and controls f4
now some tactics against the a1 rook can have place
?? moving the queen in to the line of fire, is not a good idea, Nd6 is no longer possible, plus it loses a precious tempo in defence, several ideas to exploit here:<n>a) 18...g4, to remove the defender Nf3, but 19.Nfd2 would call for 19...b5 20.axb5 cxb5, to remove yet other defender...<n>b) 18...b4, better than the previous, as Ncd2 is a possibility removing an escape square for the f3 knight<n>c) 18...Bxc4, I dislike the possibility if bxc4 opening a column for white's rooks<n>d) 18...Bd5, is the best, because it attacks Nf3 at the same time opens the column for an attack by the rook on e5
a temporary sacrifice to open the diagonal and recapture the queen a piece up, 19...Rxd6?? loses the rook and the queen and give white a pawn in the 7th<n><n>This was a nice little game, I was a bit surprised by 6.Bg5, and end up with a bit cramped position, with a bishop pair but seeing white manoeuvring his knights, finally the possibility to open some lines put white in trouble and forced a blunder, and thus my win.
I calculated here that I could lose the bishop for developing the queen.
I don't want to give him tempo, but I finally will have to.
Deadly. But black can try something... Bd8.
Cashing the wrong rook! In fact, it is very dangerous to leave this central black dominance.
It's incredible black hasn't found a way to mate me.
Shielded the king, there is no plan for black.
That all being said this game merits a save cause it was almost a perfect game (1 innacuracy and 1 mistake and my mistake was  because there was a stronger move to play).<n><n>White doesn't allow for my favorite Gambit here and I prefer the scandanavian defense with d5.
This I stole from my recent internet viewings. I quite like letting white do the exchange and not letting his queen out. And if he wants to open my h file all the better. Nimso games where I get a queen side castle tend to go well for me.
And with c3 and his queen not out I can strike at the middle right away. Usually f6 would have to come at a safer time if lsb's were off the board and whites queen had roaming ability.
And so white gives the open file but I guess h3 is to hinder rook exit somewhat. Although what I like about the opening of the h file is not to take the rook out necessarily but the threats this open file can give if white castles king side.
In games where white has that nice pawn chain connected with c3 and black having played nc6 , blacks dsb has to be patient and might only be able to come in play when whites dsb comes in direct play.
Discomfort the dsb and gain space for Knight also this was to invite dxf6 to undouble my pawns. But white doesn't want a nice Outpost for his Knight on d5.
Here a little Knight dancing. I have to exchange a piece is my thought to gain maneuvering room.
And so now I can close the middle and look to lock up queen side and then castle.
I played this to trick my opponent into not queen side castling hehe but also to get him to move the pawns into a lock up if he wants to queen side castle.
Once he replied this I enjoyed it. It allows me to move my Knight out of my pawns way and I was eyeing the out post on c4 through na7 -> nc8 -> nb6 -> nc4 after the pawn lock up.
After he strikes at f6 comes the opurtunity to undouble pawns and it is very Important to Not give whites queen access to the g6 square when not castled as black.
Whites commiting all in to a kingside attack at this point
My Knight looks to be far from the frey, have to activate bishop before castling
I was hesitating here to let him exchange and have my dsb on g5. But he would be badly defended and attacked by a rook once pawn exchange on f6. So it's better if black exchanges here.
I can finally castle but the scary part is coming.
But don't panic and get to your plan the threats of nc4 is so strong combined with just my queen.
But it's already time to diffuse the situation
And exchange to keep the pawn on the h file. Still a scary pawn!
Queens to the front!
Use the pin to scare king
And white protects the hanging pawn but now if my queen gets to the 2nd row it can be lights out!
Aiming for second row if white overlooks the Knight threats it's gg
My opponent blunders here he did overlook the queen to the 2nd row and this is just a dropped knight

Threatening to take the b6 pawn or the d pawn with Nxf6 exf6 Qxd6
This is silly, and loses all of the attacking pressure. 21. g4 would be much more sensible, and the threat of g5 is big:<n><n>21. g4 e5 22. fxe5 dxe5 23.Qxe5 wins a pawn and the threat of Bxf7 is big (discovered attack on the queen with the rook, and if the queen goes down the f6 knight is unprotected).
I am hoping that the extra pawn may cause enough pressure for black to slip up, but the game now looks drawn to me.
Hmm... can black really storm in and take out my kingside pawns before I can promote on the queenside?
This must be a blunder. Ke4 allowing 35. axb5 axb5 seems to hold out for longer, but Black may still need to hold the Queenside to prevent promotion...
If 37... Kxb4 then 38.Kb6 wins as black cannot prevent white from getting to the black pawns. If black goes towards g3, c2 can Queen when the white king reaches d6.
Standard, and strong.
Blocking the advance of the pawn and preparing to castle.
Black is looking for space and a kingside attack.
13...Ne7 was probably better, to clear g8 for a Rook.
Finally letting the LSB out--necessary if White ever wants to castle, since his queenside would look pretty weak after trying to shore up a2 against the Black LSB.
In anticipation of Bd3: Black doesn't have many options for defending the f-pawn, but if he can open a line for his dark-squared Bishop, he could free e7 for his Knight.
I'm not too sure how I feel about this move. On the one hand, White is anticipating the coming endgame by keeping his King centralized. It also is the least disruptive to White's current plans. On the other hand, it's not the endgame *yet* by any means, so Black might be able to make some tactical opportunities against the exposed, centralized King. In the game, I was expecting 18.Bd2.
Black is headed for b6, to line up on the WK.
White defends his d-pawn and offers a trade--which Black must not take, as it would reduce quickly to a winning endgame for White. So Black's next move is forced--there's only one way to avoid the trade without giving away the LSB.
?! Black sacrifices a second pawn to open roads to the WK.
? Best was 26.Bxg6, where White is up a clean piece. By this time, though, time pressure is really starting to play a role.
Can this attack actually succeed? The WK is exposed, but Black has few attackers.
? This is a subtle mistake, but I think 27.Kf2 was actually much safer, even though the followup for Black (...Nh4) looks a bit dangerous. The text, though, lets Black wage a more powerful attack than it appears at first.
! Once again taking advantage of the pin on the d-pawn. Additionally, this move *looks* like it sacrifices the valiant Knight, but in reality the noble steed is as safe as can be: 30.Kxf4?? Qg5+ 31.Kf3 Rf8+ 32.Bf5 Rfxf5#. So retreat is the only option.
Now Black is a clear Knight to the good, and still has the initiative and a strong attack...
I'm seeking a perpetual here, as I think I'm about to get cooked.
If my opponent wanted to get me "out of the book" he has certainly managed it! This is the Reti/Spielmann Variation, very rare in comparison the the main line 2.d4, and I had never seen it before in my life. Not a good start.
Black's position is unfortunately very cramped, with both bishops completely blocked in. In particular, Black's light'squared bishop is stuck behind Black's c- and e- pawns, as well as his d2-knight - at least Black's dark-squared bishop has an easy exit after Ng6. However, I was hoping to target the pawn on e5, which was not currently protected by any other pawns: if this pawn falls, Black can expand his cramped postion.
Aiming to fianchetto Black's dark-squared bishop and start building up pressure on the e5-pawn.
White throws a spanner in the works, shoring up his e-pawn with another pawn. I could almost see my position recoiling before my eyes from the constricting advance of the d-pawn.
And White allows Black to undermine his pawn formation without a struggle, leaving the e5-pawn weak again! Excellent! I could see a glimmer of daylight.
Now the knight is pinned. Black can play 11...Nd7 to place incredible pressure on the e5-pawn...
...or put more pressure on the pinned knight on d2 - a strategy with a lower probability of success, but one which will reap greater rewards if it does succeed - namely, the d2-knight.
Black is trying to stretch White's defences and overwork his pieces. Notice that attention has completely shifted from the e5-pawn to the d2-knight!
Complicating the position, adding more attack lines...all part of the effort to over-stretch White's defences. As White's king is defending the d2-knight, the king is as bound to the knight as the knight is bound to the king! And if the king is stuck in the centre, Black has an advantage.
I judged that it was time to begin exchanging on d2.
Black starts attacking White's queenside pawns, in an attempt to gain material.
It appears to me that White's exposed kingside can offer White's king no more protection than the centre can: at best this was a waste of a move.
Suddenly attention shifts. Now the pressure starts piling up against - you've guessed it - the e5-pawn. The e5-pawn is under multiple attacks for the second time in the game.
An aggressive pawn move: perhaps White is going in for an attack on Black's kingside.
Ouch, the pressure there really is crippling. A judicious attack from the side, say with ...f6, should make the e5-pawn fall in the near future...I hoped... . But, even should this fail, White's rooks are tied down nicely, which may allow me to attack in some other areas...
If the queen was on e8, and the rooks on e7 and e6, Black's battery could win White's rook. As it is Black must content himself with recapturing the pawn. After having played f6 I realised that I would lose queen for rook thanks to the irritating f6-pawn unless I took it with my queen.
This is my second game against jstevens1, one of the higher-rated players in this tournament, and if I'd been told at the start of the tournament that I'd take a single half point from one of the top two players here, I'd have been very happy ;) Over the past couple of years, I have followed many of jstevens1's annotations, and progress through the ranks, so was delighted to have the opportunity to play against her in this tournament. Having lost as black I was out (but not hopeful) for revenge! Proceed forthwith to move 9 where the real action starts...
The first 7 moves lead to the starting position, and up to here is as good as forced.
So far black is responding as expected, so as before I cover c2, not concerned about ...Nd3+; as 15. Ke2 Nxc1; 16. Rxc1+ with tempo and a rook on a nice file.
Making way for the rook, and asking about the intentions of that knight.
This can't be wrong, and I can't see anything better. Whilst e6 knight, and g4 bishop, are cutting off Henry's escape route and tying Glenda and Fou LeNoir to the far corner, along with 2 enemy rooks, it's time to point some firepower at the monarch.
Henry moves along in front of his pawns, as escape via d7 is impossible without dropping the bishop outright, or white can choose to go further and then exchange knight for rook.
Nc4+ seems logical - though unlikely, there is a chance of ...Ka6; Nc5#. and if not then ...Kb5 or ...Kc6 and I play Na3+, Henry probably goes back to where he is now, and I've lost nothing.
I can't find a way to progress with the d5 knight defending c7 and b4.
At this point, jstevens offered a draw. Over the last couple of moves I had spent hours looking into all sorts of possibilities. e4 is a nice spot for my knight but any threats could be eliminated with Bxe4. Be2 looks lovely, but that bishop is tied to protection of the e6 knight. I considered simply castling, but decided it would take too long to get that new rook into any meaningful position. I even considered a4 to either restrict Henry further, or induce him to capture, thus bringing him closer, and opening another line for the rook. In the end, considering the strength of my opponent, I decided to grab the offered draw! Thanks for the game Joanne.
Titled "An Inane Conception" ("The French Connection" "The Immortal Game" and "The Iger Sanction" were all taken) my annotations may also be taken as refective of the title.<n><n>Best by test RJF
c4! Clearing c2, Now WT can play Ne1,Nc2,Ne3 adding pressure to f5!
Finally! There is an Admission. He gives up and I have Won the battle for f5. As per Nimzo or Steino, I forget, but anyway ... "establish a strong point and overprotect it". I hope they are proud :) Now I've only to clean up, and its over...
Not surprising, when all my analysis was based on having a WT rook on the 7th!
I know, I know. If I had had this knight here, protecting f5, earlier I would not be having these troubles. But I thought it important to be sure this was better than Nh6 for covering the key square, f5. I did consider Nh6 at many points. Yet , Obviously I've chosen e7 wrongly, and now my game deteriorates.
Check And here I resigned, when it becomes apparent that the BL King will not ever reach f5 now.  Usually I allow a combinative win to play thru to conclusion.<n>I must've passed out on the keyboard
Black makes a decent reply, and threatens to crash down in the center. I for one am glad his bishop isn't going down that diagonal. Not yet, anyways!
I play c4, indicating that I hope to play in the fashion of the Maroczy bind, trying to tie up the center, but black is positioned so that this should not occur. I've found that in these kinds of positions, black often underestimates the strength of kingside attacks, which will be my goal here. This much I do know: black can thwart this in one of two ways; a break involving ...f5 or ...d5. Which will he choose?
He chooses to develop, preparing to first castle before committing.
Here white chooses Rb8, after moving the white bishop off of the c1-h6 diagonal. ...Bd4 was also playable.
And here I make an inaccuracy. Better was Qc2. This eventually costs me a tempo, and could (should?) have cost the game. Perhaps Nc3 was the best move in this position but perhaps not.
Other than moving one of the rooks, f3 was possible. Fritz considered Na4 too, but I did not; it's generally not good to position knights out of the action of course, because with careful play, an opponent can capitalize on the tempos it would take to bring that knight back into the board. And I did not feel like calculating a zillion or so moves to see if Na4 would be okay or not.
This was one of the crucial positions of the game. As tempting as it might be for some to think taking on c3 would be good for black, a closer look reveals it may not be. My opponent saw this, but unfortunately did not see the best move here. Ba6 seemed kind of awkward to me, and to Fritz. Fritz much preferred Be6 or g5; Qe7 is also playable.
And I made a blunder here, but my opponent did not see the combination that would have won him a pawn. Can you spot it? Stop and look for it. Not too hard to spot but this was blitz after all. Anyways, Qc2 was the correct move for white. Also playable was Nd1. Rfc1 was one of Fritz's other choices, but my desire was to play f4 at some point soon, so I did not even look at that. This was also why I missed the possible loss of the pawn. To win a pawn, black responds simply 15...Bxc3 Qxc3 Nxe4 Bxe4 Qxh4 Rfe1 (due to the bishop xray) Qxf2 Bxc6 and things are looking difficult for white.
Lucky for me, black did not wish to part with his bishop pair, and did not even consider looking further. Nxe4 was also possible.
So I choose the best response here, and the opportunity for black to win a pawn evaporates.
With the knight gone, now I move f4, effectively wasting another tempo. But, the pressure on my king is more palatable with that knight gone, so... bleh. At least I'm trying to make my plan work.
Better was ...exf4, after which black is better. But with this move, white has an opportunity to have a lasting advantage. I take it...
Possibly the wrong rook to move by black in this position. The last few moves were all good moves, as we maneuver. I can force the black queen to move, but eschew that for the moment; I am going to obfuscate. That is, I will create a plan on the queenside that black will counter, then pursue my real plan on the kingside, and hope black cannot react quickly enough. Yeah, that's right. I thought this stuff up all right, but I could not see far enough ahead in the time I had to think to know if things would work out or not. As it turns out, it does, but not by much.
And now it is my turn to miss a combination, beginning with exd5! after that, we could have ...c5 Qe3 Qc7 Bf2 Rd6 b5 Nb4 and black is really cramped, or perhaps ...cxd5 c5 and black will lose a piece. Other continuations all seem even better for white! But instead of any of that, we get...
c5. Way to go, idiot me. ;) White is still standing very well now, but I'm really wanting to assault the king, and black is threatening to bust open the middle. Not much I can do about it now, after my last move.
And black responds of course correctly... well according to Fritz. But I think taking here would have been better, opening up the middle; black needs counterplay...
Any of the queen moves are rather similar. I choose this move to stop the pawns from advancing while I reposition for my kingside push, cleverly disguised (if I must say so myself, lol) as defending the queenside.
And has black stymied the queenside? Sure looks like it. Undeterred, I continue...
And here, I am about to show my real intentions. I had to think, and realized that I would not easily get to the kingside if I allowed c3 to become occupied, so had to make this ungainly rook move...
Better for black was doubling his rooks up on the a file.
Now after this move, black became suspicious, realizing that my moves were really doing nothing over on the queenside. What was I really up to? It's easy to spot, so he tries to prevent it, although Qf8 was a much better way to try...
I figured I had time to give my King an out.
Qf8 was much better than this blunder. Black has sealed off his queen from pressuring the queenside, and failed to protect the h6 pawn, thinking instead to rid himself of the white bishop, but doing so is much much too slow for this position.
So slow, in fact, that I decide to hide my king altogether before proceeding. In actuality, I'm just lucky he did not move Qf8 here. How can my opponent fail to see the imminent danger, in retrospect, is hard to understand.
Alas, 45...Nc3 was black's last try to defend, with a plus 7.5 score for white. Mate in four, two ways to get there. I choose the easiest.
THIS time I gave thought to the mate; ...Ke8 Qh8+ and with the knight coming to f6, it's all over. Black resigned here. So, some simple misdirection, all along planning to sacrifice on h6 if I could. I had a lot of help of course by my opponent in this blitz game. Unless I'm mistaken, most proper Sicilian black moves try to get white castled on the queenside, since black hopes to attack down that side. With my King untroubled over on the kingside, black's remaining pieces are very much unprepared to help defend his own king, directly or indirectly.
The kings indian is a very flexible openning system. GMs often use it to steer way from varations that they do not wish to play.
fianchettoing this bishop is not my style. I prefer to develop it to Nc3 or c4. I am  a very positional player, I naturally play moves that optimize the potential of my pieces.
In the style of Petrosain I opt to release the tension in the centre immedaitely.
In a resent game I had a opponent try Nxc3. I achieved a huge central pawn phalanx's and when on to win easily.<n><n>http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl?gm=10358
Aiming to get rid of the pawn.
getting rid of my nice fianchetto bishop was not an easy decision but I have seen that this isolates C pawn(which black will have to contently defend) and makes advancing my queen pawns easier in the endgame. This move may have suprised Mercutio abit.
We are now entering the second phase of my overall game plan. Which is to create a pawn majority on the queen-side. I do this at the expense of creating a permanate weakness on the light squares.
This clears the lines for black fianchettoed bishop  and creates a light square weakness around the king. This pawn becomes a monster.
This is an error. I was looking to forces black to give up the diagonal but I failed to see blacks next move.
Excellent move that in my haste I totally missed. This move completely busts open my king and leaves it exposed. This also creates a weakness for black to exploit. This pawn has had an amazing career
ensuring that I have the bishop in the endgame. I can not allow black to have the bishop pair.
I give black back the bishop to ensure that it is me who has the bishop in the endgame.
At this point, white enjoys a slight advantage in space, material and two connected pawns. White is winning but it will be difficult to convert the past pawns for the win.
Black seeks to go straight into the endgame and try his luck there. However, the exchange of queens makes my connected queen side pawns very dangerous. Better in my opinion is Qc8. However, given the fact that Mercutio sees that he is almost 400 points stronger than me he takes his chances in the end game. But one of the strongest parts of my game is the endgame. Also in my favor is that I have a clear plan for victory.
Because white has the strong bishop and two connected past pawns black does not stand a chance. All he can hope for is a draw.
In the end game it is critical to centralize your king as soon as you can.
Black is completely tied down to defence white can slowly convert his advantage at his leisure
preparing for b4 and denying the use of the c file for black.
Mercutio's king is going to a walk around the queenside but there is nothing he can do. The pawns are very secure.
I will create another past pawn and black can not defend against them both.
black can not allow the white king to walk on to the 5th rank.
In order to win this game I must play to force the off the board black's rooks.
chipping at black's defensive capablities. By removing the h pawn black is completely reduced to passive play.
Yay! I finally break into the fifth rank. Now my king can eventually support my pawns to the end.

To my surprise again, Bxf3 was played! black gives up his lsb. If I were black I would keep the lsb, instead of playing bxf3 I would play g6 and prepare for Bg7, because pawns on c5 and d6 is blocking the dsb. Bg7 allows the dsb to work on a better diagonal.
be7 unpins, also black is now ready to castle king side.
Qd2, preparing queen side castle, safety first, so i can then launch the attack on black king.
I almost fall off my chair after I saw this move!! "this must be a mistake!"   I said to myself
Bxh6 was played, sacrifice the bishop and hoping for black to open up the g file.
Ne5, attacks the bishop, I can't allow this exchange, because I'm already down a piece.
So Bh5 was played, now I'm a bit worried, because black now have the initiative, I must find a way to continue the attack.
black played Kh8 unpins, I thought it is a mistake at the beginning, because f4 forks the knight and bishop.
Rhg1, I had to carry on with my own attack, time is "pressure"!!
g4, supports the lsb, but also going for g5, cut off the communication between the bishop and the black queen
Bf6, rerouting the bishop and now it is aiming at my queen side.
Nd5 forks the queen and the bishop, the knight is also gonna join the attack.
Qd8, its tempting to capture the dsb, because both black knight and bishop are attacking b2 pawn, but I didn't capture the bishop, and this turned out to be the correct choice.
g5 sacrificing b2 pawn and adding more pressure to the black king side.
Ra7 gives more protection to the knight
Rg3, so I can bring the rook to h3 to help the attack, also my rook is now guarding the 3rd rank.
f5, supports the bishop, also my rook is now free to move :D
Be5 attacks the rook.
I was going to play Rh3 anyway.
Rg1, I got no time to waste, I was quite low on time, so I must focus on the attack.
...and again, even if one was taken in exchange.
It doesn't seem a good move to me because it has little effect and exposes the queen
To prevent knight, bishop or queen to come on e4
No, I won't counterattack but the black queen is away and I'm well in advance as for developpement.
Now, the plan is to take control of d6 and d7
It has nothing to do with my main plan but it's not bad to force the opponents pieces to drawback. furthermore, the dark saquared bishop will no longer control c2
I want the bishop to stay on this diagonal and to be able to come on the b1h7 as well because I'm beginning to think to another plan : directly attacking the king. My pieces are not badly placed for it.
Black has to develop
That doesn't bother me a lot. As I'm about to attack the kingside, the rook on the center will facilitate it. Anyway, I won't try to prevent black to play d5
First move of my attack, I need 3 tempi to get dangerous for white. I hope my opponent won't find any quicker attack.
One more pawn in late but now I'm sure to have time enough to aim my attack. Of course, the black queen on b6 prevents the best move I have (26. Qh6)
logical and efficient
aiming the attack at the h file.
Mistake. It doesn't solve black's problem and the attack on the c knight is too slow. Vlack sould have plaid Rh8. With his material advance, my opponent seems to underestimate the danger.
black is doomed. I begin to see some mating sequences and I think there is nothing black can do to avoid the mate in a couple of moves.
! Time to set the knight in action (and sacrified the poor guy) - mate menace 1 one
Two possibilities : wether to trade a rook against the black lady or to carry on attacking the king for he his now on the ompen file.
This game remained fairly even throughout the match, despite both of us having chances to take the initiative. In the end it came down to endgame tactics, and I came out top.
Up to this point both sides have developed solidly, so it's difficult to say that anyone side stands better, perhaps black because white has one pinned piece but it's still no real advantage
Played to remove the well placed bishop, correct response is 7...Bxf3 8. Qxf3 Nd4 9. Qd1, putting the knight on a good square, and removing the knight on f3, which is a good defender of the king
Now the mistake is apparent, although difficult to see... If white now continues 9. Bxf7  Kxf7? 10. Nxe5  Kf8 11. Nxg4, then white emerges 2 pawns ahead, and black has a very exposed king
Missing the opportunity, although not a terrible move, it develops another piece to a good position, and semi-pins the knight to the undefended pawn (semi because I can give check to avert the pin)
This move is made with 2 purposes, to defend the pawn on c5, and to release the queen into the kingside, with the potencial to make a devastating check along the g-file if the position allows it.
A clever move, again with 2 objectives, making the g-file less available, and releasing the queen so she can defend the king if needed
This move aims to trade off material, either with a queen exchange after 13...Qg6 , or trading bishops, as in the game. With such an open king, and the black queen and bishop lurking this is a good plan.
I played for this exchange as in the position I felt I had the better attacking options, so wanted to keep queens on the board. The exchange has also opened up the white king further.
I feel that 15...Qxb2 would be a mistake, as after something like; 16. Rab1 Qxc2 17. Rxb7 Qd2 (attacking the rook) 18. Reb1, then white looks to have the better position
This position looks very aggressive for black, although white has plenty of counterplay, however I couldn't see a knock out blow, so this move Ne5 aims to remove the bishop, and so doubles the pawns on the c and e-files, which should give me an advantage in the endgame
Having decided to play for the endgame I accept this queen exchange, as I can capture the bishop after white takes my queen
In this position white looks better, as his king is more advanced, and he has 1 active rook, however I remain confident in my endgame abilities, and it shouldn't be too hard to at least force a draw. In rook endgames like this rook activity is essential, even being a pawn down can be made up for by well placed rooks
This pawn is over extended without backup, I want to mobilise my rooks, but must first get my king out of the way. This pawn gives me a target, and is a distraction to white, as he has to try and defend it
This seems good as it brings his other rook to a good square on an open file, however he needed to play something like Rg5 (attacking the c5 pawn), as my king is headed to the e6 square anyway
Now the position is very much in my favour, white looks certain to lose the pawn, and with little compensation in position (his king is back on the 1st rank)
Realising the danger on the kingside and so mobilising the king to cover
Oh dear I was calculating the variations after f5  Kh5 g4 Kxh6 g3 etc, and completely lost sight of the board
And my opponent decided to call it a day before it became too bloody. Even after a variation like 37. Kf6 Kxc4 38. Ke5 Kxc3 its easy to see my c-pawn will promote and win the game
Hi everyone!<n><n>My Class C opponent, Manhattan (Janis) gave me a right run for my money in this game.  He seemed to have much the better of things in the middlegame and I fell into a combo which dropped me the exchange.  However, I did manage to salvage two pawns for the exchange and after a queen trade, I found myself with a decisive central pawn push which reduced my opponent's rook to extreme passivity.  One pawn did manage to reach Glendadom.  Although the WK could remove Glenda from the board, he would have to lose his rook in the first place, leaving me a piece and a pawn (a passer at that) to the good.  My opponent waved the white flag.  Gameknot Analysis is provided here:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15749719&rnd=0.12065503177682513
5. ..... Be7 - and now I pave the way for castling kingside.
10. ..... Bf8 - Due to the line up of white's dsb and the Wicked Witch of the West on h6 it has become a typical jstevens1 position - passivitis is setting in fast, aaargh!
12. ...... Be6 - might as well continue to get my queenside developed.
14. dxc4 - bishop trade.  I am really glad to have got rid of white's lsb.  That pin on f7 was becoming very annoying.
16. cxd5 - a knight trade which gives my opponent a fairly big edge - I am still very cramped for style here.  I try to get out of the cramp by moving my knight to f6 and immediately put the pawn on e4 under the hammer.
25. ..... Rc2 - In trying to get out of the passivitis trap, I will soon get my rook ....... trapped.
27. Bc5 - an interference along the c column is created by the white dsb.  I completely overlooked that and either my knight or my rook will fall.  I then realised that it would be best to dump the rook for that white dsb and get two pawns for the exchange.
28. .... Nxc5 - I am relieved to see the material count at the bottom of the board reading zero.  However, is the two pawns for the exchange gonna be enough?!  Only time will tell.
33. .... dxc5 - this knight trade has opened up the c column to the WR.  On the plus side my c4 pawn is a passer.  On the minus side, white's d5 pawn is also a passer.  Now which one is the strongest?
34. Qe4 - nice to see my opponent resorting to defending his pawn with his queen.  That is usually my perogative!
34. ..... Bd6 - and just for once, Glenda delegates this task to her ecclesiastical friend, Fou Lenoir.  He defends both the e and c pawns in one go.  He may be overloaded but as he is a lower value piece than the WR it does not matter here.
36. .... Qb6+ - I thought long and hard over this move.  I decided to eschew the pawn trade as I did not want the Wicked Witch and the WR to pile up on the f column and scare the bejezus out of Henry.
43. .... c2 - white must now give up his rook.
44. ..... cxd1/Q+ - just the sight of Glenda is enough to make some of my opponents topple their king, Janis is no exception.  See that passer on b4 - that pawn will eventually reach Glendadom because if white had played on I would have put that pawn on b4 and then I would have brought Henry out into the open to hassle his kingside pawns.  The WK cannot be everywhere, so I chalk up yet another handy win.  There is one more victory I will soon be annotating.  Anyhow - I hope you will all have a nice evening and enjoy your weekend - bye for now - Joanne
So here is a game against hughlews where i play rather bad at the beginning but manage to mate my opponent at the with an overwhelming attack. Enjoy.
decided to develop my knight while at the same time defending against a mate, but also my knight is pinned now.
Here i started to feel a bit uncomfortable with the pressure on my king side.
Heading to c7.
Since my knight was unpinned, i was able to take whites knight.
A nice square for the knight for now. It defends many good squares.
I probably could have played bxd5, not sure though if there was a mating net if 19qxd5  qxb2+
This was where i started suspect my capability to win this game, but after a while of thinking i came to a conclusion that whites attack is not dangerous
And here i finished the game with a conditional move, as i was told by Archduke piccolo on my last annotation, where i was annoyed that everyone always resigns. Hope you enjoyed.
Here I have an opportunity for a fork; if I move my Knight to F3, you are in check and I have the freedom to take your Rook....
And I miss it again because of tunnel vision...
Well played on your part... After the game got going, I didn't have much to say.  You over came that early Rook capture on my part and played strong at the end to systematically take down my Queen and two Rooks... Good game!  (:
A typical torre position, staid and safe. The best part of the torre is that it can result in some impressive fireworks for the unobservant.
My book on the torre discourages the pawn push as it removes the tension and black loses dynamic play.
White concluded that it was better to trade the three pawns for a piece with a strong attack on the black King.
White is applying more pressure and now has free reign along the third rank with his rook.
The lynchpin has now fallen, black's best try is kf8 which only postpones the inevitable. He instead chooses a faster route to enlightenment.
Completing the exchange.
Now I have to retreat to interpose against the check.
Here I have to retreat. There are no available squares to advance to.
I opt for the exchange.
Finally, I tuck my King safely away [and incidentally unpin my Knight.]
Now his B must move. I was expecting 18 B-R6, forcing my Rook to move, but he chooses a straight retreat.
Mmhh... I started to think that my opponent was a either newbie or wants to make a fool out of me.
Not common to accept on c5, it opens that flank for black to attack and also releases the Bbishop freely
Attacks the bishop and creates a point of positioning his own WB very actively. But white still is hampered by his poor development.
Sort of forced. You can feel some preassure now on the BK castling, and I started to feel uneasy here. But still, black seems to be positioning his pieces nicely.
Maybe not needed now, but I didn´t like the perspective to lose that diagonal in case more pressure comes to my BB in b6.
Now the mentioned c4 seems to be interesting. Even prepared with Rc1. Black has his chances on the queen´s flank, since it has an open "c" column, but white doesn´t seem to be that bad: no clear threats on the King´s side, yet.
Finishing development. Middle game now projects a confrontation on the queen flank, but I also  kept in mind that blacks bishops are aiming for the WB future castling.
So with that mentioned idea of trying something on the king´s side, I made the mistake to open too soon (didn´t see I was losing a pawn here, I must say). e5 was an interesting move after Re8 is played. But the moment I did the move I begun to think of possibilities to attack the center, since WK is still in his initial position.
Better taking with the N instead of the powerful bishop it seems...  White has not let me get away with this, so it is not that naive as the opening reflects.
But now look. If WB retires to c3 or back to b2, black can try to block the bishops with d4 (countered by e4, thus blocking B in d3) and then try to exploit the situation moving the rook to e6 and B in b6 to d7. Too many moves, I know, but an interesting plan anyways.
So white decided to exchange it for the N, that could support the attack on the castling, although at the same time, removes a piece that would interfere with a potential rook activity on 6 line.  Bg3 seemed to be a conservative but good idea.
Now the picture seems to be more than good for black, even with one pawn down. Check the potential sacrifice on h3 thanks to that initial pawn movement there. It will hurt white a lot.
BQ doesn´t seem to be more active in a different square, so no need to remove it to allow the rook play on the 6th line, as planned before. True that Rook will not be as safe as in the 6th, but white cannot cover both g5 and h5 with N and B. BB sacrifice on h3 is pending but much more clear and menacing now.
A logical defensive movement. The idea seems to be bringing N to h2 and then position the B in e2.
Now, this is a grave but unclear mistake. I had thought of this while playing, and that´s why I did Rh5. But I didn´t see a more interesting defense for white: a direct 16.Nh2. Queen threats R in h5 and at the same time N can position in a place that will not interrupt B in e2 (if decided to go there). Black doesn´t have time to prepare Bc7 and Queen on mate position this way. Still black has a promising attack in case of 16.Nh2, but, after a light analysis, not that clear. Maybe 16...Rg5 can counteract Nh2, but nothing straight comes from that to me.
18.Qf4 seems to be a must here.
With the idea of ...Qg6 if not taken.
Facilitating the threat. I case of gxh3 I´d say Rxh3 solves the game, threatening both Qg6+ and Rxf3 and mate in h2.
A nice ending for a nice game. What started to seem like a boring game, ended up with an interesting position, and since I consider my rival did not do so bad in the middle game, when you have developmental problems at home, you don´t have too many options to come back. An instructive game to show the importance to finish your development properly (unless you have a good reason to do "odd" movements.
Here we are the great King's Gambit Accepted: Bishops Gambit. I know what some people might say, and yes that Queen can go to h4 and ruin my castle. However, I believe there is some compensation for playing 3. Bc4 instead of 3. Nf6.<n><n>A. The KGA Modern defense can not be played generally.<n>B. The King is perfectly fine on f1 unlike most people might tell you.<n>C. You don't really lose a tempo because Black has to move the queen back at some point in fear of getting trapped on the kingside, and becoming a tempo punching bag.<n>D. It isn't really played much, so it has the fun of not being over analyzed like 3. Nf3 was.<n>E. It's fun to laugh at the "you always have to castle" notion. <n>f. It'll make you smile, so it is worth your while.
King's Gambit: Accepted, Bishop's Gambit, Bogoljubow Defense<n><n>Probably one of the best ways to defend. Basically black is supporting d5 to claim some of the center, and kind of transpose to a modern defense.
Pinning my knight to my king.
A strange move to protect the pawn from being taken by the knight because of the pin on c3, and circumvents d5 because of en passant. However, it allows the knight to strongly go to e4.
The famous move of the KGA: BG. I guess it's a little more nice when the knight can't go to f3.
Some people might see Ng3+ wins the rook for a knight and messes up my kingside pawn structure. This puts the queen in a corner and out of play, and surprisingly isn't worth the trouble. d5 is a nice play fighting for the center still.
I think his king covered it's face with it's hands at this point.
That kings angry. I just killed his wife right in front of him. I think it shows courage to the pawns showing he is strong or something and not some slow fat worthless guy who probably shouldn't even get protection.
Setting up my h1 rook to get out. Ne2 is probably better.
I protected it by having everything attack it. Cool huh? King's pinned by my e1 rook. I probably should of mentioned this earlier.
Ok. c4 is probably better. Nxe5 also better, but I was drawn to this move and couldn't help it. Winning isn't everything, and I thought this combo was cooler.
Well, I thought it was a cool little sequence. And to be honest, if I was a super crazy awesome computer. this might be a draw, but I'm a lowly human and can only do so much. The rest of this is pointless semantics of me trying to hold on.
To make it more difficult for Black to play ...d6-d5
Black still wants to advance his d-pawn, but in the meantime he takes control of the b5-square in case it might be necessary to take on d5 with his c-pawn.
The French Defence. I did'nt like that Knight on d2, eventually white gets his d2 Knight to f3 and his g1 Knight to g3 via e2. In my previous games in that position white has had a good attack hence my next move, trying to stop that.
Panic struck in here. Whats whites plan? f5 was instinctive to stop f5 by white, whites pieces are aiming at the kingside, so I made another bad move to try and stop any attack.
This move saves the game for me I think, White has to be aware of the Bishop coming to c6 with check.
This feels like a weird move. But it puts the white bishop, way over on g5, en prise, and it pins the white knight on c3, too.
White castled, leaving his bishop en prise for black to take at his leisure. I think I may have overlooked the free bishop here - who expects such a thing, when it's been four or five days since I last saw this board? Instead, black attacks the other white bishop and the white knight on d4, effectively forking three pieces.
Practically forcing white to exchange, favorable to black with his material lead. But the move exposes a discovered attack against the knight on g5.
Take the bishop, or take the knight? Not sure which was preferable here, but both players forgot about g5 once this game, maybe it could happen again?
And 19. Qxe6?? gets two question marks, and black is quick to demonstrate why. Always have a way out. White's queen forgets this rule and sells herself cheap, for the price of a bishop+pawn (20. Rxd6? looks like a way to gain an extra pawn out of the queen's death, but after 20. ... Bxe6 21. Rxe6 Kf7, the rook has nowhere to run and must give up the exchange). So white has to settle for just the pawns already captured on e6, trading queen+knight for bishop+two pawns. Instead, white resigns. Almost 13 weeks to play a 19 move game. I've only been with GameKnot for 6 months, and I'm still not used to playing at this pace.
The real play starts from here.  This isn't Black's only option here, but it is a very popular one.  Its motivation is to play ...e5 without having to worry about a White piece landing on b5.
[?!]  A very strange choice of move, that (as far as I know) has almost never seen the light of day in top flight chess.  The bishop is just too unhandily placed here, and will have to move again fairly shortly.  Any of the following moves are much more popular: 6.Be3; 6.Bg5; 6.Be2; 6.Bc4; 6.f4; 6.f3; 6.g3 and 6.h3.  The last of these, Weaver Adams's 'attack' was played by Bobby Fischer in 1962 against none other than Miguel Najdorf himself.  Fischer won.  Why was 6.Bd2 played here?  I suspect White wanted to avoid known lines.
The thematic thrust.  True, this leaves serious weaknesses at d5 and d6, but Black figures on active counterplay to distract White from exploiting them.
Black's development 'plays itself' - she stays with the straightforward.  Also possible (it seems to me) was 9...b5.
Not until now does White make his aggressive intentions known.  This move is not intended to exchange on e5 nor yet f4, but to push on to f5, as the spearhead of a King side attack.
In effect White has ceded a tempo, but it probably hasn't cost him so very much.  This move opens the line of the Queen, and prevents ...Qb6ch  (if Black is contemplating such a move).
Getting the Q at once off the d-file to make way for a rook.  Why not develop the Queen's Knight here?  At the moment ...Nbd7 is not playable owing to the nasty response, f4-f5.  But Black has reason to believe that the knight will be required on that square to recapture on f6, after White brings his dark-square bishop to g5.  I am inclined to think, though, that ...Nc6, now or very shortly, would have been a playable option.
Heading for b7, and keeping the d7-square open for the knight.
I infer from this move that White has no real interest in operations along the d-file, which used to be such a feature of positional treatments against the Najdorf.  After exchanges on d5, Black's weaknesses there will be masked, and practically unassailable.  That indicates White has other plans.
Ordinarily one might prefer to play 14.Qxd5 to keep the file open for operations against d5 and d6.  But that tends to accelerate Black's development: 14.Qxd5?! Bb7  15.Qd3 ... (to protect e4 and c2) 15...Nd7, with ...Rfc8 to come.  So the pawn recapture has taken the preference.
Probably simplest: get out from under.  Also possible were 17...Bd7 (18.Bxa6 Qb8 or 18.Bb5 Qb7 19.Bxd7 Nxd7); and 17...Qb7 18.Na5 ... followed by 19...Nc6.  I can't say either of those options look very attractive for Black.
Keeps his much more important d-pawn.  When faced with losses in the centre and on the flank, and unable to defend both, to preserve the centre is usually to be preferred, as here.
Making it more difficult to advance the White g-pawn.  Sometimes a voluntary weakening like this is better than having one forced upon you, but in general it is to be avoided until you have no choice.  Black did have an alternative, here: 20...Qa3 with the idea of committing the WQ to protecting the e3-bishop, or, if the latter moved, exchanging Queens.  If then 21.Bb3, a4; or 21.Nb1 Qb4.  But if, say, 21.Rfe1, then Black would probably have to play 21...h6 after all.
[?!] The GKE (Gameknot engine) calls this an inaccuracy, suggesting instead 21...Qa3, with the idea 22.g5 hxg5  23.hxg5 Ng4!  Probably Black was hoping for 22.g5 Ng4.
[!?] Prepares to entrench g7 and h6.  Had Black to fear 23.h6 yet?  Say 22...a4 (to prevent Bb3) 23.h6!? g6!  24.fxg6 fxg4 25.Bg5 ... It is hard to see anything decisive for White here.  Black is under pressure, but for the moment at least appears to be holding her own.
Clearing the g-file for one rook - if not both.
[?!] Preparing Ne4.  But the Knight move could have been played at once, according to the GKE: 24.Ne4 Nxe4  25.Qxe4 Bf6  26.Rf2 Qa3  27.Rf3 Rab8 (say) 28.h6 gxh6  29.Bxh6, winning the exchange (Bishop attacks Rook, having 'discovered' the f3-Rook's attack against the Queen on a3).  What White has in mind are discovered attacks should ever the f6-square fall vacant (f5-f6ch).
Black pretty much owns the Q-side, but has she enough going on there to counter-balance White's K-side operations?    The GKE assessed the game marginally in Black's favour: -0.51.  Black has the better structure, and the White a-pawn is living on sufferance, but White has the more active pieces.
[?!]  Giving up the exchange!  Was Black's game under such pressure, or was she contemplating a counter-stroke?  No good was 26...Nxd5?? 27.Ng5ch Bxg5 28.f6ch Kg8  29.Bxg5, so that can be laid to rest.  How about 26...Qxa2 instead?  Let's see: 27.Bg5 Qa4 (threatening ...Nxe4)  28.Bxf6 gxf6!  29.Qg4 Rg8  30.Ng5ch! fxg5  31.f6ch! ... (even with such scanty material to hand, the position is a real maelstrom)  31...Kh6  32.hxg5ch Rxg5 33.Qxa4 Bxa4  34.fxe7 Rxh5ch 35.Kg2.  The GKE calls this even, but I rather think Black might have an edge in this position.  What a melee, though!
I can only surmise that Black wished to draw the teeth from the bishop on the dangerous  b1-h7 diagonal.
Aiming for 31.Rg1 and mate on g8.
Active defence: White isn't allowed tine to develop his attack down the g-file, and, in view of the 'X-ray' attack against the h4-pawn, White must exchange queens...
The middle game melee is over, and now we enter an endgame in which Black has an extra pawn for the exchange (i.e. P and B for R).  The 'bishop pair' helps Black, as do her slightly more solid pawns in the centre.  All White's pawns are isolated and weak. At this point, I would not have given much for White's winning chances, but he's not prepared to flag it away yet!
Locking the Black King in his corner.  But this requires the rook to maintain the prison indefinitely.  The White bishop and King have to take up the slack.
Clever.  White brings his King into action, and Black can not reciprocate.  That the rook's action down the g-file is temporarily masked is of no help to Black, as after ...Kg7, Kf3ch forces the King back to h7.
Nothing to stop her counter-attacking, though.  To save the f-pawn, White would have to release the Black King from jail after all (35.Rf1 Kg7).
White prefers to give up a pawn.  To my mind, though, the evening up of material must leave White's winning prospects problematical at best, and Black can start rethinking her chances as well.
Threatening 37...Bc4 attacking d- and a-pawns.  But the real motive is to commit the rook to preventing that happening, whereat the Black King might yet effect an escape.
The problem of weak pawns: too many to defend, even for the bishop pair.
An alternative was 41....Bg5ch 42.Kxe4 Bxd2.  Does this win a piece and the game?  No: 43.Rc2 f5ch!  44.Kd4 Kf6  45.Rxd2 Bxh5 with an unclear position.
This is starting to look good for White.  The GKE evaluations have been trending more in his favour, too, in recent moves.  What further obstacles can Black throw into his path?  Well, the threat here is ...Bxd5ch, so...
... and submit to the skewer in reply.
Offering to exchange pawns (51.Rxa4 Bxd5ch), after which Black can rest assured of the draw at least, and even explore winning chances.
[!] Well played White!  It emerges that Black has to shed a bishop to stop this pawn's promotion.
[!] Fine defence.  White has to be careful where the King goes, or Black picks up the d-pawn for nothing.  So 52.Ke2 Bc4ch 53.K moves Bxd6 is ruled out.  Nor may White<n> play to a dark square on the f- and g-files on account of a bishop check, winning something.  But one move remains, therefore...
Pinning the bishop against the King, with no defence available.  Black makes the best she can of the situation.
And this is the obstacle thrown in White's path: a pawn that is about to promote and must be watched.
A fascinating situation!  White has rook for three pawns all of which are isolated and reliant on Black pieces, the bishop in particular, for protection.  The bishops stand on opposite coloured squares, which is very often a help to the weaker side.    The Black bishop might be classed as a 'Bad Bishop' as all the pawns stand on its colour complex.  But here is where a 'Bad Bishop' comes into its own.  Anchored securely in the centre by the f-pawn, it offers protection to the other two pawns, and there is nothing White can effect against them.  White has the 'wrong coloured' Bishop!  So White has to try and induce a weakening by creating mating threats or (if it is possible) setting up a zugzwang that will induce one of the Black pawns to advance to an unprotected (i.e. dark) square.
Hurrying to the most advanced protected square...
Black would like to bring the king somewhere in mid-board, after which White can whistle for the win.  But the confined position of the Black King is what gives White reason to hope a win can be found.
Unable to find a win, White offered a draw, gleefully accepted by Black.  After 64...Kg6  65.Rh8 Black is almost, but not quite, movebound.  None of the pawns could safely move, and the King would have had no moves at all.  That leaves the bishop.  Bishop moves to f5 or g4 simply lost the bishop; and any move to d5, c4 or b3 lost the h-pawn to a skewer.  But Black had one remaining move 65...Bd7!! that would have saved the game.   For a further discussion of this ending check out this thread: http://gameknot.com/club-fm.pl?club=1006&th=21045&pg=-1#last
here, in the Gruenfeld, black begins to fight for center control with plans to control d4
white accepts the invitation and marches forward.  the black pawn is now pinned, though normally white is not keen to give up the Q, even while preventing black from castling.
trying to contain white and start pressure on d4, an attempt to stay with the spirit of the defense.
black has to protect himself, though ...dxc4, ...d4, or ...e6 may have been better.
an awful tactical blunder, especially when white entices the black B to leave the Q hanging, open to the fork
white is happy to take the rook
adding pressure to f7 via mate threat
the black pieces get tied up here.  ...e6 may have been adequate
the black N can't move with the threat so
the B is hanging.  ...Bh6 keeps a foothold.  the black rook needs to get into the game
this actually decreases the rook's effect on the game
trying to create a flight square.
bishop

Time to bully black's queen.
Black was to lose either the queen or the bishop.
Black is unwilling to oblige.  White and black are matched pawn for pawn, knight for knight, and rook for rook, though white's pieces enjoy a slight positional advantage.  And, of course, there is the remaining white bishop, somewhat trapped by the black queen.
Now black has power to bear on e1.  White can't threaten mate with his queen on b3.  She needs to be somewhere she can fly down to the 8th rank to administer the coup de grace.
....myself and the buddy are playing some recent games and this is one of those where if you rush or don't pay attention, you get screwed. This game was played relatively quickly and the number of mistakes on both side is silly...but amusing....
...well this is where i thought i was going to cause structural damage to Black with the following move.....
...i am figuring activity with the minor pieces will make him work for the win...his king is stuck and that white bishop is useless so i am material up in effect. All pieces are in game and if i get Rhe1 then its not comfy for black after f4 and f5...
..a pin to prepare f4/5 and Rhe1
using the pin to gain time..will take the exchange shortly...
...h5 or Rg6  to follow...
This seems to be blacks best counter to the Grand Prix according to the db... though the next move seems to favor white.
Defensive black tries to hold onto his advantage.
Qe8 the best option Black has a possible Kc6 or Kb6 but since black is going to move there in the next move might as well do this first.
h5?! because of Qg6.  My plan was to play Rh6 and exchange Rook for knight.
This move forces the king to come to either b5 or b4 both lead to the same so might as well get a pawn.
Bd2+ may have the same result with less lose of material.  17. Bd2+ Kb6 18. Nc3+ though now the king can come to b6 it still must come to c6 after Rb1+ for Ka6 Nc5#
forces the king to c6
Not much else I can do... but now I have a problem after Nxf7 I can't play Rf6 for it loses a rook after 21. Nxe4+ Kd5 22. Ra5+ now the king is forced back and white goes onto an easy win.  My Rook on h6 can no longer anchor there as well because Nf7 threatens it.  So I resign knowing I'm going to be down a piece + position.
I was aiming for a Four Knight opening, and found myself facing a complete unknown alternative (to me, I mean). It is an interesting gambit that I clearly did not take advantage of. Seems like a King´s gambit, but with black pieces, and that is supposed to be a delay black will recover with a lot of effort.
A horrible mistake! Now 4...fxe4, 5.Nxe4, d5 creates difficulties for white. Maybe even losing a piece, not sure if it can be compensated with attack (possibly, including Nxe5, but not clear) There are (must) better ways to continue with the attack
Defending f5 and also activating Bc8. A potential long castling is on the horizon as well, in case white decides to go for the short one. An still the threat on e4 is maintained, but maybe black is considering (with good wits) to develop instead of going for a gross material gain.
enclosing white B in c1 and also hampering the possibilitie of a safe short castling. So I aimed for a long one, but there was a clear threat now: ...Bg4 and then Nd4 in case BQ moves to e2.
h3 looked like an interesting defence as well. I really felt troubled with the static position WQ and WB had there in the center, therefore, 6.d4 could have been a good move too, but I didn´t consider it during the game.
Feeling trapped I thought about releasing some pressure there, and foresaw the incoming combination after 8...fxg3.
Seems like at least a lose in quality was about to happen (in case of 0-0 or similar), but for those familiar with this type of positions, you may have already seen what is coming next.
Yep, Bf7+ would have lead to mate by 15.Qe6++, but black has already lost the game anyways, and did not think much about it. After a few more moves, black surrendered.<n>  The game illustrates how useful are those thematic positions learned throughout our games or study and how dangerous and king in the center is when not defended properly.<n>I still feel bad for my poor opening scheme, but it did pay off the suffering after W 10th movement.
Hi everyone, I am now black against Bob - ding, ding, it is Round 6!  Can I end this winless run against Bob?  Well, read on and find out!  Here I decide to go ........ Dutch.
8. .......... e6 - both sides have now castled and I play e6 to keep my options open as to which of my pawns to advance at a later date.  Next move I play my pawn up to b7 and by move 12 the decks have been cleared between Glenda and my rooks.
13. ........ e5 - it is the e pawn I choose to advance - this opens things up a little.
18. ....... Nf8 - to prevent a knight fork on e6.  A plethora of exchanges is about to take place.
29. .......... Qd6 - after a further plethora of exchanges I move Glenda to d6 to maintain protection of c6 - this move also prepares a move such as Qb4 where I may swap my c pawn for white's b pawn, splitting up the white pawns in the process.
32. Kf2?? - I think this is the losing move as white had to block the check to avoid dropping his c pawn as well as his b pawn.  Whatever the jury decides here, white drops a pawn.
36. Kxg6 - after winning a pawn I force a queen swap to try and win the bishop ending a pawn up.
47. .......... Be6 - after this move Bob waves the white flag.  This technique is reminiscent of the technique I used against a 1753 player in one of Jo's Successful Endgames annotated a few months ago.  Frere Leblanc controls the a2-g8 diagonal.  Whether white trades bishops or moves the bishop away, there is no stopping Glenda from making a reappearance two moves down the line and cleaning up the last two white pawns and turning her attention to the white king.  Hope you have had a good read!  Bye for now.  Joanne
Thanks Baumannjoe for the time-share.______I had annotated in live, playing the game.<n>No db, no engine and without moving pieces (to train the visualization).<n>I had written the candidates moves and the lines i had seen (or believe to see).______So all can be totally wrong :-)________Any comments are welcome.
The usual outpost but with Nf3-e5 and Nd2 to keep an eye on Ne4.______Because of the move order of this thematic mt, things are differents.
The turn of the game.______12.Ne1 looks ok but restrict the attack and take the square for a Qe1-h4. i don't look more because Ng5 looks very interesting______12.Ng5 f6_13.Qxh5 fxg5_14.Nxg6 hxg6_15.Bxg6 Re8_<n>16.Qh7_and i suppose g7 will be taken by the white queen (but i can't visualize well in my mind)<n>______or______13...h6_14.Bxg6 and it looks like the line above______<n>If take with the knight :______12...f6_13.Nxg6 hxg6_14.Bxg6 But it can't visualize more______<n>12...Nf6 and it is hard to see a line after this move. An idea can be 13.Rf3-h3 and then throw the knight or the rook on h7 to remove Nf6. Qh5 will be then possible.
15.Ne7+ Bxe7<n>16.Qxh7+ seems a dead-end______15.Ne5 Rh6 (or g6 or h6)_16.Qxg5 Qxg5_17.fxg5 Bxh2+ not cool_<n>.....i look again and Fxh2 is not possible because of Ne5. Difficult once again to visualize in the mind the lines.
20.fxe6 Bh5_21.Qf5 g6_22.Qf7+ (and a bishop or a knight on f7 perhaps, but one again it am not able to visualize 2 moves and a half)
According to " how analysis " it is important to have one move we like in the game. It is this one for me, mostly because it show that spending hours doingtactics exercices will give a cool feed-back....sometimes.
This is a game that I (bishop18) played when I was 14. What's interesting about it is that it looked as if I was getting attacked and in deep trouble for most of the game, but then I suddenly whipped up an attack out of nowhere to checkmate black.
Attempting to take over the center.
Attacking my knight, with the hope of kicking it off f3 and putting it somewhere useless.
Now, my knight is on a better square, protecting my central pawn. My c1 bishop is free to develop again, and so are my other pieces.
A discovered attack on the g2 pawn, as well as an attack on f2.
Attempting to weaken my king's safety.
Black's bishop now can fianchetto itself, or go the other way. It is very mobile now, and has a lot of attacking potential.
Now that I have the initiative again, I tried to make this counterattack. However, it wasn't as successful as I hoped. The bishop was well protected.
A good counterattacking move. The d4 pawn is attacked twice now, and defended only once. The e7 bishop is protected too, so black's king can castle (no longer needed as a defender)
Prevents the black knight or bishop from moving to b4.
A better move would have been Rfe8, and then move the a-rook to d8, attacking my central pawn.
Finally I concluded that the d-pawn was too big of a defensive burden and I decided to get rid of it. Because of the pawn, I was in an entirely defensive position as a result of my efforts to protect it.
If I blocked with the queen, the b2 pawn would be unprotected, and would fall.
Giving my bishop an escape square.
My bishop was awful and useless on h2, so I plan to move onto a better square (c3) via h2-d6-b4-c3.
I was very unhappy at this point. I was heavily attacked, with black's queen and rook in good position to both win material and hunt my king.  After spending a long time thinking, I decided to play this move, checking black's king. I might manage to checkmate (which I did) and even if I didn't, I would get a draw by perpetual check.
It's mate in 2; can you see it?
And finally, I save myself from a losing position.  I was shocked; I was losing for most of the game and most of the time I doubted I would draw, let alone win. <n><n>This game is an example of not giving up, attacking ruthlessly, and defending intelligently.
This is another practice game, in which I play the dubious Latvian Gambit and take some risks to open up an attack against a disorganized White position. The theme of this game is piece coordination and planning--Black has a very clear plan throughout the game, whereas White does not, and the differences in the solidity of their resulting midgame positions are substantial as a result. Enjoy!
?! The Latvian. As soon as Black makes this move, he knows his general game plan: (A) break up the White center, then (B) create activity in the center and on the kingside. This move in particular also shows that Black is willing to sacrifice material for that activity.
For all the reasons I don't think White should decline the Gambit in such a passive way like this, see my Latvian Gambit series. 3.Nxe5, 3.Bc4, 3.exf5 or 3.d4 are all stronger for White, but this move crops up quite often, especially if White doesn't know the opening well. The problem is that it is simply too passive, and lets Black get virtually everything he wants--space and time. We know Black's game plan--what is White's? This move suggests he wants to play a more positional game, keeping some tension in the center rather than tearing into a kingside attack.
This is essentially a waiting move, with the benefit of holding onto e5 without blocking in the DSB by playing ...d6. If possible, Black wants to play d7-d5 at once, in keeping with his plan to create space and play energetically in the center.
This move seems to prepare White to play d3-d4, but why? 3.d4 was absolutely playable (last turn), and this move denies White the natural spot for his Queen's Knight, after already committing to the d2-d3 move. Already White's moves feel like they lack cohesion.
I don't like this move very much--Black can easily play 5...h6, and either drive the Bishop back to e3 with a gain of tempo, exchange White's good Bishop for a Knight, or win a piece for two pawns if 6.Bh4? White's e4 pawn was threatened, but a better way to deal with it would have been 5.exf5.
This is probably a mistake, as it loses a pawn to 8.exd5 Ne7 9.Nc4! Nxd5 10.Nxe5 and allows White to improve his LSB's outlook by enabling d3-d4 soon, but Black needs to get his own LSB into play, and remember, he is willing to sacrifice material for activity. The text breaks up White's center, which is one of Black's goals.
White attempts to hold on to d5, though this move weakens d4 permanently and now there's little hope of freeing White's LSB anytime soon. As I mentioned above, 9.Nc4 was probably stronger.
White needs to develop, not push pawns--this move seems intended to prevent ...Nb4 with a threat on d3, but it needlessly weakens b3 and more importantly does not contribute at all to White's development. A queenside pawn storm is not really feasible without pieces to support it. Black has been working steadily towards his goal: control the center and develop his pieces to active locations, while White's plans are unclear.
White seems unlikely to castle queenside with his pawns so disorderly and no pieces to support them, so Black is thinking ahead to tactics against a kingside castle. As a result, d6 seems like a prime spot for this Bishop, rather than c5, since h2 will remain weak when White castles, but f2 will be well-defended.
Black, with most of his development complete and his pieces occupying comfortable posts in and around the center, is clearly preparing to make his push through the center and kingside. White's pieces, on the other hand, have little in common except that they seem awfully cramped, and don't threaten much of anything. In other words, Black's pieces are coordinated and active, while White's are disorderly and passive. Black's midgame plans are clear--what are White's goals?
This is a good thought, threatening to push to c5 with check. White has a queenside majority, so seeking to activate it is a good line of thinking. The only problem with this particular move is that it blocks the b-pawn from advancing, and it somewhat marginalizes the WQ. A better post might have been c2.
Black wants to avoid any interruptions along the a2-g8 diagonal once his attack begins. Note that 14.c5+ was not a critical threat, as 14...Be6 allows Black to save his DSB, but ...Be6 is not consistent with his kingside attack--Black wants that Bishop on b7 instead.
There was no reason to move the Queen here--she's no more active on b3 than she was on a4. All the while, Black's forces carefully set up in coordinated, strong positions from which to assault the White kingside. It also gives Black the opportunity to force White to respond to his next move...
Black begins his attack. Both Bishops aim at the White King, whereas White is in no position to make threats.
White sees Black's impending attack, and begins to play inaccurately. Probably 18.Bf3, encouraging trades and activating White's bad Bishop, would be more effective here, but bringing the Knight to bear is certainly reasonable. White re-defends the vulnerable h2 pawn and blocks the LSB's diagonal.
?? Sure, this Knight will be driven away soon, but make Black actually do it--White had a free tempo to use here, and would have benefited from 19.Rfe1, freeing the King from his prison in the castle. Additionally, this move presents Black with a simple tactic to win material for nothing...
? ...Unfortunately, I missed that tactic in my rush to blast open the White castle. Best was 19...Qe5! where White must play 20.g3 to avoid mate on h2, allowing the BQ to scoop up White's Bishop for free.
?? The thought behind this move is sound--White wants to bring his Queen back to the action. However, a preemptive 20.g3 would be better, as this move gives Black enough time to really load on the pressure.
There is actually a combination here that I missed at the time, which results in a more clearly won game for Black: 20...Bxh2+! 21.Kxh2 Qh4+ 22.Kg1 Bxg2! 23.Kxg2 Qh3+ 24.Kg1 Rg8, and now Black is threatening ...g3! and White must give up tremendous material to avoid mate on h2.
?? This is the final mistake. As White had just pulled this Knight back, I assumed he intended to block this threat with 21.f4 first, as the followup is significantly less strong for Black after 21...gxf3 e.p. 22.Nxf3, with Black's g-pawn no longer a threat to the Knight and the WK with some more space to run. But now, White is finished.
0-1. White cannot avoid devastating material loss after 23.Bxf3 Bxf3, where the WQ must give her life for the Bishop (if she leaves the d1-h5 diagonal, she no longer threatens to capture Black's Bishop and therefore nothing can prevent 24...Qh3 followed by 25...Qg2#). White's lack of clear midgame goals resulted in his forces being hopelessly disorganized, without even any real interference from Black. This is why it's so very important to have clearly thought-out goals from the very start of the game--know where you're going and what your plans are, and know how each move you make contributes to that plan. Thanks to chicoboy for the game, and thanks for reading!
Till now it seems almost a manual about the opening, the way I play it. <n>More often, my white-squared bishop is taken before the knight goes to e7, so the h7 pawn goes in g6. <n>Note that if I retake the bishop with the e7 knight, an inmediate d4-d5 is possible. I cannot say if it is really mortal, but I prefer not to find out in a live game. The opening of the h comumn for black proves decisive in the future, despite its innocent aspect right now.
I must admit I didn't see this "trick" after the B - N exchange. But I decided to make the best of it.
And here, the position "smells" like if I have something. But nothing can be done yet. <n>Now, I think it should have been better to get out the knight via d5-f4 thinking on a sacrifice in h3.
I love risk. I think he didn't expect this one. If g3, Rxa3  seems to start something, even with the diagonal self blocked. Now, he didn't risk, but why?<n>g3, Rxa3 <n>Kg2, and then? Rxg3 ? <n>f2xg3, Bxg3<n>If wnite tries to retain material with Re4, he probably succeed, so I think this was a blunder of mine.
He wants to go on with the attack, but this is not a good move. Now the knight menaces g3  and a sacrifice starts to glitter.
Unfortunately, this is necessary to protect e5 but also to give my king an escape square in f7.
I like my ability to stay calm under strong attakcs.
THE mistake he did. Thanks. Otherwise, the game is still to play.
The best. KxB leads to e4 , then NxBf3...
Again, I choosed a good moment to stay calm. In my previous moves, I had to calculate all the danger coming from the white queen and knight. It was fun.
I could have pushed my bishop to h2 before, but, as always, "time" is precious. I must act before he can react, I have very few moves left.
Why not Ng4? Anyway, I can imagine white thoughts: black has a discovered king, I have four pieces pointing at it... how can I be in danger? Just some move to take away this fly, and I'll will go for a win. But...<n><n>This move was a mistake. With the next one I go further on with my attack, and the queen gets away from the danger zone, while the king is fully in it.
He believes that with this one is saved, since I have to change queens. Nope! Because my pawn makes the trap.
and then d5...
I'm trying to attack somehow as the pawns in the centre were missing...
I'm a rook down unfortunately...But i have to attack..
I'm moving with my queen to his king..
I decided to take his knight and then take his rook...otherwise it would be  27. Qg6 .....
His bishop was running around...
So at the end my attitude for a quick checkmate was proved though he would have saved it..
This is unusual - in my experience, white normally follows up with 3.c4 and attempts to squash black's position. As a move I don't like it for white, and the only game in the database that started like this was won by black.
I wanted to prevent the knight from having anywhere it could take up an outpost - not that I thought this likely, but it couldn't hurt, and in any case I needed to release my bishops. Finally, this unleashes the possibility of ...Qa5 and ...d4.
No need to win the knight immediately.
Aiming to dislodge the rook...
Whoops! There goes my extra peice! I decided to try and make the most of a bad job. My next move was aiming to exchange on c3, then swap queens, in order to leave me with an extra pawn and far superior development.
I'm playing it like a KID with the key difference of nc3 instead of c4. That means white's bishop has more flexibility, so I'm waiting to see whether it goes to e2, d3, c4 or b5 to decide on my set up...I could go c6, Bg4 nd7 etc or 0-0 c5 and play it like a benoni.
I considered b4 to mix it up. Nxb4 then nxe4 and black is better, so Bxb5+ c6 Be2 and black can get developed in peace with some open files. Probably not enough compensation though, so I'm playing safe with 0-0. Nxe4 didn't look good at all due to Bxf7+ kxf7 nxe4. Now if white goes for e5 before castling I should be safe enough and be able to threaten his uncastled king in some lines.
Going for the bishop pair. If Bf4 e5 works out ok, and Bg5 h6 is ok too I think. With the bishop pair I'll be looking to open up the game and exhange a knight.
Not wanting to lose the bishop pair, but I want to threaten Bxf3 qxf3 Bxd4 or Bxf3 gxf3 nc6, which creates some tangible weaknesses for white, or maybe after gxf3 c5 opening up the centre
Opens up channels for the queen, and stops e5 due to e5 d5. This makes things more difficult for the knight on b8, but I'm going to have to expand on the queenside, so maybe it'll be ok.
I decided to give up the bishop pair for a few reasons: There aren't many good squares for the light-squared bishop...Be6 Bxe6 fxe6 e5 looks awful for me. Bd7 blocks the knight and doesn't have a clear future, and Bc8 would waste time and encourage f4 or g4 with an attack for white. Also, afterBxf3 I can gain development time with b5. If Qxf3 then I have ideas with qb6 attacking d4. I think gxf3 should be considered for white, opening the g file and looking to play f4, f5.
Gaining space for development with tempo. I'm looking to attack the queenside before he can get things going on the kingside.
Bd3 appears to be a mistake. It leaves d4 hanging and I don't think white can protect it tactically because things like Bxb5 lose to the intermediate move Bxc3, winning a piece. It may have been an oversight by white. I was expecting Bb3 keeping the bishop in the attacking and defensive position, after which I would have played a5 either before or after qb6 attacking d4.
Getting the bishop back to safety. I prefer this to e5, which cuts the bishop off from the kingside and potentially leaving a hole on the dark squares there. Qb6 was an option instead, threatening f2, but I don't want to open up the game before I get my knight out. I have ideas of playing b4 then if na4 qa5, forcing b3, leaving the dark squares completely vulnerable.
g4 was overly ambitious I think. White needs several moves to loosen up the kingside and b4, qa5 is a real threat. White might have looked at nxb5 cxb5 e5, opening an attack on the rook while black is undeveloped. I don't think it would work though, as after nd7 exd6 rxd6 black can unpin and should be fine.
Nb1 was probably better, to meet qa5 with Bc4. Now the dark squares need desperate protection.
Keeping it simple. If instead qe5 h4 qa1+ doesn't get anywhere, and I can't see any result from the Bh6+ check. Now there are lots of threats, including nb6 where nxb6 axb6 looks unstoppable and there'll still be an attack after kb1 nxa4 bxa4 qxa4. Very hard to defend now for white.
If nxb6 axb6 opens the a-file with strong attack. If the knight doesn't move, then nxa4 bxa4 qxa4 is coming. I'm threatening qe5 in a lot of lines.
Now any knight move is met by qa1++. kc1 leads to severe loss of material. It looks like c3 is the only move. After c3 bxc3 nd3 c2+ it looks like I have a strong attack. Kxc2 loses to qb2++ and kc1 qa1+ kd2 cxd1=q is winning.
white gave up a piece to stop the attack. Best plan must be to open files and increase pressure. Qc5 was also possible...but may as well bring the other pieces in.
Thought it best to play the check, as I noticed that if Kd3 Qc3 is mate, and if kd2 Bh6 Kd3 Bc1 looks very good. If Kd1 immediately then Bh6 looks winning too.
The thematic e5 thrust.
I don't see why my dad insists on playing this move as white because it allows black to stop c5 for quite some time. Thus, allowing me to attack as will be seen.
This move stops cxd6 cxd6 Qc7, and prepares Rg7 to begin the attack.
Frees up the light square bishop. Also give the possibility of some activity for the dark square bishop Bb6. Black would have an interesting mating idea. Bb6 Rg6 Qxh2+ Kxh2 Rh6#.
Here I kept thinking Rc8 was really good for white so I tried to stop it. Turns out that white doesn't gain much from it Rc8 Rxc8 Rxc8 Qd7 and now the black rook must retreat.
Wins the h4 pawn by force. The best move here would be black to play Kg7 and bite the bullet.
Having lost the right to castle and a pawn, White must now develop quickly or lose the game.
White must attack the pawn chain, and threatens Bzf7.
White blocks that, and begins a plan to harass the Black Queen.
Now Black has to be careful.
? This move subjects Black to a withering attack.
Black faces a similar attack after Qe8.
Bh5! Drives the Q away and tightens the net around the B king.
Qf6 would lose the Q to Nd5+.
Nd5+ Going for the Kill. If instead e5? , Black had ...Nxe5 in response
Nf7! Black was hoping to get some freedom for the piece but White wants to take with the N on e5.
Nearly forced if Black wants to retain hope of surviving in the complications.
Having manuevered the Q to support the N, this check is fatal.
Black never gets the chance to mate on e2.
Attack the center
I will attack on the kingside.
!! Brilliant place for my bishop :)
Necessary to free the Nf3 from the duty of guarding h4 from a BQ's incursion.
Sac the N for the h column. Not a gimme, but...
I already have the check, but it is not enough to crush black, so I look for other ways.
I have to accept black's counterattack, and try to go faster.
much better was b2, Rb1, Bxa2, but again, it gives me the needed tempo.
A risky plan, based on this: White's attack would be unstoppable if f5 falls. In order to provoke it, I need to get Be3 out of there. I just must be sure I won't be fried in the process. On the other side, I have to connect the Rooks or Qb1+ will crush me. In the following moves, my King will run as a rat, leaving a R en prise as a Trojan Gift...
If Qd6+, B or pawn f4.
Black is playing to control up the center, this is the first move that does two things it gives the DSB a way out to attack and also the same for the Queen. Some players will play this opening to attack white and possibly get a quick check mate.
Black continues to play up the center, ignoring the Queen. Black has a plan of attack! White is making this easier for black to attack Queen side.
Black develops the knight on the King side. One more piece out and Black could Castle king side. Getting your King in a safe place is important to avoid checks.
This was a move I was waiting for. + by the LSB.
Black responds with a killer move  c6! White is still under developed and really can't just come in like this and expect a quick checkmate now.
white develop a knight to the rim. Nc3 or Nf3 would be normally how to develop. The reason  for not moving to the rim or edge of the board is that the N reduces the spaces it covers with it's L-shape move pattern.
black retreats the DSB.
white sends out the pawn to attack the knight.
DSB to attack the rook!
Black castles kingside
bishop to attack the knight in front of the king
Black queen moves to f1 for the mate!    I made this annotation for John aka thefez. A very nice mate!  This was  done after a unrated game we played. It is important to not only play your attack, but to try to see the threats against you. If any one would like to make comments for this game, you are welcome to give your advice. It is welcomed.
can try 15. Rc1 Nbd7
A good Idea, wins a pawn but black can overcome from this attack
Under the old classical rules I learnt as a youn boy 40 years ago a Knight on the edge of the board was frowned upon.With modern more concrete analysed chess many old rules of thumb have been over thrown.The position is semi closed so tempi isnt a factor so the White Knights Duo plan of N-h3-f4-d3 and N-d2-f3 to try and lock down e5 is playable.
Contesting the key square e5
Sending more troops to contest e5.
On reflection I now prefer 12.b3 looking for a white plus rather than the text trying to play super solid against the master.
Black has equalised and is threatening to take over the iniative.
Looking to trade off the better of the Black Bishops.
Tradeing off hopeing to prove that the white Bishop is the superior minor piece to Blacks Knight.
Sent with the Master's draw offer.I decided to take a bird in the hand rather than play on.Though against a lower rated player I would have played on.Objectively speaking I think the final position is dynamically equal .......opinions?
White deviates from standard play here. I think there is nothing wrong with placing the queen on c2 but it is quiet and leaves the initiative to black.
Improving the queen, she can now support queenside expansion, or she can slip to f7 to pressure the f-file. It also prevents potential pins with the rook by a knight on e6 or with the knight on f6 if the e-pawn is pushed.
Probably had to get that move in anyhow
White wants to initiate action, probably planning an advance to e4 with ...fxe4, Nxe4 Nxe4, Bxe4 with now the bishop and the queen in line on the b1-h7 diagonal with the knight ready to be sacrified on g6
Delays black's intentions because he has to cover the c4 pawn before advancing to e4
Here, if White doesn't prevent Nb4, his queen has to leave the second rank, and this is bad because his exchanges on e4 will let the black light squared bishop go to h3 attacking the rook, and if the rook moves the queen takes on f2 (note that the e2 and the f5 pawns are out)
Black's counter attack; preparing e5. ...Nd7 here would have reduced options and let black defend d4. 14. h3 is not really a threat as we will see because the knight has an excellent sacrifying option
already full compensation for the knight plus an excellent position for the bishop
Retains the bishop, but allows black a deadly continuation white shouldn't be able to recover from..
Now white has little reason to keep on playing except to wait for an error from black
The Ruy Lopez
I played d6 here to free up my knight from the defense of the e-pawn. The idea is that in one moment I can play b5 then Na5 and win the LSB as seen in the game
Eying the f3 knight. This Bishop proved to be very valuable, hence the name "The Quiet Sniper"
At the time, I was thinking there was potential for Rh6, then Bxg2 Ideas. The attack turned out to be so much more...
Trying to centralize his knight, and block off my bishop, but this just gave me an excuse to improve my Queens position.
The threat here is f5 Ng3 and then h4, winning the knight. The knight cannot move from there because then Qxg2#
Kicking the knight, and preparing for an assault of white's kingside.
! Exploiting the pin along the g-file. The attack has turned into so much more than I calculated.
Bring my Queen into enemy territory and drive his king into the center. Kh1 cannot be played due to Qg2#
BAM! White Resigns.The Quiet Sniper strikes! The LSB who sat on the edge of the board watching carefully comes in to win white's Queen just like that. I was pretty proud of this game since I had been trying to attempt to play more aggressively lately and it worked out here. I hope you enjoyed the game!
In this game I was happy with my patient build up of an attack in a closed position. However I was looking for to an interesting ending when my opponent blundered. Enjoy.
Referring to the db for some theory.
!? Expected d4 threatening e5 forcing the exchange
Now black will look to close the position and use his knights. Note how all the pawns are still on the board after 12 moves. very rare in a Caro
Allowing the bishop to move and makes the center stronger however the Bishop can only go to d3 which is a defense role (For the time being) and that removes the defender of the d-pawn. However the Bishop really needs to move as it has no prospects on g2 where it is blocked by black's center and cuts of the half-open g file
Looking to penetrate f5
Shutting up shop unless exf6 e.p. is played. Which must be the move otherwise he has no proscpects as black can build up his kingside play with. Nf7, Rdg1
Stopping g5 but I can prepare it
Now black has the ability to push to g5 but also has the h-file
Kicks the knight but I don't mind because I want to get my rook to g4
relieves pressure on the knight
reapplys pressure on the knight
A standard opening. Me as black. This was a must win game for me to stay in the tournement so I put in a huge amount of thinking time
I pin the knight to the rook, thinking at the time for a tripled pawn.
I open up the white squared bishop and further protect my e pawn from the anticipated exchange on c3
white breaks the pin and i initiate the exchange
At this pont i think I have the upper hand. My main thoughts at this point were to smash my way through the h3 pawn. I intended it to happen very soon but I did not want to make a single mistake so spent a few moves removing all my weakness.
I do not attack. I see a potentially horrible attack on my e5 pawn from the knight and bishop. I also see the white knight moving to g4 after i move bxh3. This would attack my bishop and open then queens path to move onto the kings side. h6 prevents this.
This was to free up my knight from defending the queen. White could take e5, I would retake with my pawn and leave myself vunerable to a queen exchange. I am still vunerable here but i can move my horse around now.
I am aiming to key the knight onto f4. If white moves his g pawn out to kick me off it leaves his h pawn very vunerable. My main thought was that he has to move his queen, now giving me a bishop and a knight attack on the h pawn. (Why it was so important for me to free my knight of defensive duty).
I move my queen on to attack the h pawn. I felt really confident at this point, a 3 piece attack on a weak point, a well placed knight and a strong pawn wall. White with a doubled pawn and no light squared bish
I can see no other alternative for white, takng the knight would result in both defensive pawns down and a bishop attack on the queen. with black queen ready to go g4.
I did this to prepare for move 24 d5. I wanted to free the d pawn from defensive duty. Overall, my e5 pawn, while maintaining a solid centre and good defence for the knight was a high cost piece for me to maintain.
White exchanges to his detriment, he starts to lose material now.
Big smile on my face, but kicked myself when i noticed I had this earlier, i was to focused on moving up my d pawn.
Want to push up the d pawn now.
I pin the bishop. White can do nothing to save it, and it if he takes my rook he exchanges a rook for a knight and a bishop.
Nf3 is probably better.  There are not many openings in the database with this move, and the few there are black tends to do quite well.
In this exchange black ends up a pawn, with the white king again placed in check.
Black would probably be better off taking the pawn, cxPb4.  If white plays cxPb4 in response, black answers with BxPb4+.  Or QxPb4+.  Black ends up a pawn in that exchange.  Here, black drops a pawn.
Pe3 is undefended.  I would expect black to play NxPe3.
One move that might be fun for white is Nb5.  Should black be foolish enough to respond with QxNb5, white answers with Ba4, pinning the black queen against the king.  If black makes some other move (besides the king), white can play Nc7+, forking the a8 rook.
if u take this pawn, forget the center ! and then becarefull whith the tower a1...
free the bishop
now we are ... <n>the white seems to have a good strong and dominant position, <n>let's break it !
in order to try a sacrifice of the bishop if h2-h3<n>risky sacrifice but funy !
it dont take the bait, and prepre an attack at the center
he's going to take the pawn in d6, but it doesnt matter
queen has to eat
i was expecting he took whit bishop g3, <n>in order to threaten h2
but not, this is interesting, <n>i dont have the choice,<n> i have to eat the bishop in d3 if I do not whant to fall
now let's take some risk ! ...<n>preparing the tower in d2 ...
now let's take some risk ! ...<n>preparing the tower in d2 ...
so i propose exchange<n>if he take it, i will have my tower in b2, whitch could be interesting
the plan was to put the tower a8 in d8 <n>in order to descend it in a1, of course, <n>because now the danger for whit is that the king could be mat easily in his corner,
great <n>exactly what i was expecting, eat the knight<n>the tower whit has to eat <n>because if the pawn take it my bishop in g7 will be very dangerous ...
this is the dangers : if a1xa2, then b2-b1 and mat<n>taking this stupid pawn in e6 was the mistake...
i am trying to give life to this utterly boring game!!
blunder!! rook to b1 or knight to d1 would be better. but this moves are defensive i guess my opponent doesn't like being bullied around!!
i crack up the pressure !!
This was a Bird's opening, similar to other one in which I played black, I diverge from my opponent in the other game by avoiding to exchange my light squares bishop, and avoiding also damage to my pawn structure, then followed a good plan to fianchetto the dark squares bishop, and exploit black's constricted position. Black's queen was soon trapped and black had to give up a piece to avoid losing his queen, due to heavily scattered pawn structure, a couple of advanced black pawns, and more active rooks consolidation was hard to achieve, but some poor move choices by black allowed the position to became slowly easier for white, until black finally lost all possible counterplay
Bird's opening, Lasker variation, this was the second game with a Bird's opening I play at the same time, now with white pieces, probably my opponents tried to confuse me, although it was my opponent in the other game that chose to play the Bird's against me...
This pin is the most sharp and probably the better reply to Bg4
Black shows he cares about the possible damage to his pawn structure after the exchange Bxc6, up until now we were following Larsen, Bent - van Geet, Dirk, Amsterdam, 1964 (1-0), the game continues with 5 0–0 a6 6 Be2 (6 Bxc6+?! Qxc6 7 h3 Bxf3 8 Rxf3 e6 gives White nothing from the opening) 6...Nf6 7 d4 Ne4 8 c4 e6 9 Nc3 Rd8 10 c5 Qd7 11 Nxe4 dxe4 12 Ne5 Bxe2 13 Qxe2 Qd5 14 Bd2 f6 15 Nxc6 Qxc6 16 b4! Larsen spots the best chance to make progress by advancing the pawns on the queenside giving him the edge.
to protect the king and add another defender to the f3 knight
with queen on d6 (or d7) I don't want to give up my bishop pair for nothing, so a retreat is the best option white has here
this is a thematic idea for this bird's variation to fianchetto my queen side bishop to get a stronger hold of key square e5, unlike the other game I can follow this plan as black could not capture on f3 forcing gxf3 disrupting my pawn structure, also my c2 pawn is protected and black's queen is not a threat on d6
black left the h pawn "en prise", the capture of this pawn can give me a precious advantage
black is a bit cramped and my last piece is developed with an attack to d5
sow I'll try to set a trap to black's queen, profiting from black's cramped position
... finally I capture the pawn and in the process complete the trap on black's queen
blocks the attack, but loses the knight to d4
now with a material advantage (piece and a pawn), the strategy has changed, and I'll focus my attack on the castled king
avoiding the Bg7, and placing the rook behind the c pawns, the idea is to play c4 to open some lines
Now I decided to try and lead black in to a series of exchanges according the the following variation:<n>20...exf3 21. dxc6 bxc6  - here black can also play 21...Qxd1, leading to a zwischenzug move cxb7+ before capturing back the queen to further open the king's position...<n><n>22. Qxd7+ - to attract the rook to d7 <n><n>22...Rxd7 23. Nxa7+ - to coerce the king to b7 <n><n>23...Kb7 24. Nb5 - sacrificing the knight to vacate c6 <n><n>24...cxb5 25. c6+ - and the final objective to fork king and rook on the 7th rank <n><n>25...Kc8 26. cxd7+ Kxd7 27. Rfd1+
here black can also play 21...Qxd1, leading to a zwischenzug move cxb7+ before capturing back the queen to further open the king's position...
to attract the rook to d7
to coerce the king to b7
sacrificing the knight to vacate c6
I was hoping for cxb5 to get to play c6+ with a fork on king and rook, missed this move... although I known it was possible for black to ignore the knight sacrifice!
Now after seeing black seizing the initiative I need to defend h3
to get the knight to f5
opens the f column, with tempo, so my rook can support Nf5
forking the bishop and rook as referred before, now I aim to simplify the position and exchange as many pieces as possible so black doesn't have any counterplay
Improving my bishop placement with tempo, now Bd4 is a possibility to block the d column and protect both my e3 and c5 pawns freeing my c1 rook to other functions
threatens Rxg2, and avoids the skewer Rh1+ after: g4 hxg4
without the rook on c1 I can make this capture not fearing the skewer Rh1+
only move, now if Rh1 Kg3 Rdg1+ (Rhg1+) Rg2 and I've achieved consolidation and can start pushing my pawns, or even play Bd4 first to secure my e and c pawns also
4. ..... Nxa6 - there are several ways to capture this pawn, either with the b7 pawn or with the knight.  My opponent chooses the knight.
5. .... bxa6 - this B for N trade splits up black's queenside pawns and may facilitate material restoration later on.
6. b3 - this move prepares a fianchetto on the queenside and a possible move to c4 to try and break up black's strong pawn centre.
10. 0-0 - with my opponent castled kingside, you wouldn't think I was castling into it, would you?
11. Nd2 - my development is nearly complete but black has a big spatial edge.  What an impressive wall of black pawns on the 5th rank!
16. Rg1 - it seemed such a good idea at the time - line up rook on same file as enemy queen.  Black showed me that this is not always the case!
17. Nf1 - this knight comes down and protects Henry against mate threats on the h column.  It also protects my vulnerable e3 pawn which is now defended by our poor put upon Glenda!
18. f4 - an attempt to block off the line of attack of black's dsb.
The terrible pressure in the Kingside...
The attack that brought the downfall...
The attack that can lead to a mate after few moves...
Naturally, Black wants to exchange pieces to blunt my attack.
I remove the guard on Black's Knight. if 17... PxN 18 QxN will leave me up a piece for a pawn.
I take advantage of the opportunity to preserve the Knight.
Looking to gain an Exchange...
Now I pin the Rook.
The Black Rook is an "overburdened piece."
Not the main line, but an understandable choice. That being said, the dark squares of Black's position are usually very weak and in the e6 Sicilians a common theme for White is to take advantage of that. I can't say that this move accomplishes this. He doesn't have to be afraid of Nxd4 either since it was protected by his queen. Nc3 would have been played had we followed the main lines.
Slightly confusing my opponent. This particular opening is called the Taimanov variation of the Sicilian defense and sadly not a lot of Sicilian players play it as they tend to favor either d6 variations of the Sicilian or play the Khan Sicilian. The Taimanov and the Khan share very similar ideas, but the queen on c7 can sometimes become a weakness rather then an asset after Nb5. It's pointless to play this now as after 6. Nb5 Qb8 7. Nc3 a6 8. Nd4 black is fine and it can even be said to be a better position. The queen on c7 controls the b8-h2 diagonal and indirectly glares at the c-pawn on c2. Often the queen comes in handy for a minority attack on the queenside or we use both the a8-h1 diagonal and the b8-h2 diagonal to exert enormous pressure on his castled king. Of course if you've never played against the Taimanov then this is tricky to understand without losing too much time.
One of many ideas in the Taimanov is to first play a6 to restrict White's bishop and cover the b5 square. Afterwards you usually end up playing b5 and playing Bb7 which is surprisingly hard to deal with.
My opponent plays this after a long think. It's not a bad move, but it doesn't help all that much either. Granted after the main line Qd2 there are some theoretical lines with Bb4, but if you know the theory by head then you realise that White can come out fine. That being said Bb4 which I was planning in the near future isn't an option anymore.
One of the main ideas behind the Taimanov, more or less killing a lot of his options for his knights and his bishop.
Bd3 is far too passive and it can't go anywhere but e2. It can get new life in the middlegame, but for now doesn't really do much for him aside from enabling him to castle.
A mistake in my opinion. The forcing sequence isn't that difficult to spot, but there's quite a bit to calculate. Black can win a pawn with 9. Nxb4 10. axb4 Qxc3+ which is fairly obvious and there's little that White can do about it. That being said it isn't as simple as it appears since after 9. Nxb4 White has the fascinating response of Nxb5! doing the exact same thing. It took me a long time to calculate whether or not Nxb5 works, but found that after 9. b4 Nxb4 10. Nxb5 axb5 11. Nxb5 you have the cheeky Nxc2+. Taking it with the queen means that 12. Qxc2 Qxc2 follows with a very easy game for Black. Therefore the only option for White is to move the king. If 12. Kf1 then you meet that with 12. Nxe3+ 13. fxe3 and without the dark squares bishop you can play Qb6, escaping the Nb5 threat. If the king goes to d2 then you have 12. Qa5+. 13. Kxc2 Rc2+ and with the pawn on e4 also falling in the future with Bxe4 it seems grim. Checkmate seems inevitable. It seems rather easy when you have an analysis board next to you, but calculating everything OTB was surprisingly difficult. After running everything through my head a few more times I decided to go on with my plan, although I felt like something wasn't entirely right.
Bringing the king to safety as the queenside isn't too safe anymore. White's plan for here is rather obvious, and I start to think on ways to counter it. White would like to play Rfd1 and target my d7-pawn. Sadly that's not possible yet as I have 2 defenders on it ( queen and king ). That being said, White has definite ideas of Nxb5 after Rfd1, winning him back the pawn at the very least and even cramping my position.
I realise that I not only need to get another piece in to support an eventual d7-d5 push, but also one that can watch over the d7 square. The knight is the perfect fit.
This move took him a long time to make, but it's logical enough. White wants to get his rook on the open-file and move his knight away. He moves to f3 with the idea of maybe pushing e5 in in the future or occupying this square with his knight.
I wanted to win the e-pawn and quickly secure my win. You can draw an endgame with 1 pawn down, but with 2? The plan is easy. Play Nxe4, win the pawn, trade all my pieces off and go into an easy endgame. I'm not too scared of e5 either since I can always just play Nfd5 getting a really strong knight in the center.
Perfectly timed. Black wants to consolidate the position so White needs to find a way to not only move Black's queen, but also in such a way that it doesn't defend d7 anymore if possible.
I decide to go to a5 rather then for example c6 ( which didn't feel that well ) or c8 where my rook won't be able to reach d7 anymore. I opt for a5 as I start growing suspicious of a future Nxb5  which feels rather strong. Nxb5 axb5 Bxb5 and Black's position can't possibly get more cramped. Qa5 stops Nxb5 ideas because of axb5, and now both queens are looking directly at each other and it's in Black's best interest to remove White's queen as it's a powerful attacker in this position. All that being said, I can't help but feel like this is a mistake, but find it hard to suggest an alternative.
Adding more pressure on the d7 square.
An attempt to close the position once and for all. as White was about to get a checkmate in 1.
Pressuring a knight that defends the d5-pawn and also possibly creating doubled pawns. That being said I'm fine with doubled pawns. Black's position will never allow the rook and bishop to get into play so an additional open file can potentially give them activity again. I think ( haven't looked into it yet, but I have a feeling ) that White could have played Nxb5 here instead. 15. Nxb5 Qxd2 16. Nc7+ Kd7 17. Rxd2. White will line up both his rooks and the knight on c7 is troublesome. Additionally the White bishop will enter the attack as soon as I move my rook with Bxa6. This position seems very scary.
Making an end to the Nxb5 ideas, confusing my opponent ( I use that phrase a lot ). I'm pretty sure he didn't notice Nxb5 and it might not have been an issue anymore now that the bishop is on g5, but it still seemed like Nxb5 would be possible in the future so I opted for this. Now I can respond with axb5 to Nxb5 without having the fear of losing my queen.
After a long think he opts to trade. Apparently he has confidence in his ability to force something here. A lot of trading ensues. We both have about 10-15ish minutes left on the clock.
I can't take with my bishop because of Qd7 checkmate. Taking with the pawns is asking for trouble too after Bxc4, threatening my bishop who holds the position together and making my pawnstructure Swiss cheese.
And my bishop is rock solid, never moving ever again at the cost of a pawn. Another option was 20. cxb5 Bxb5 21. Bxb5 Qxb5, but that gets scary after Rb1, making me have to move the queen, but it still needs to guard the d7 square.
Threatening the pawn to promote. After a relatively long think, I realise that this pawn will probably never ever promote, because I have both bishops that can guard over both a7 and a8 and as such I was only slightly worried at this point.
Looking over the a7 square if I was interested to move my queen and threatening Bxf2+.
I wanted to get my king out of there as soon as possible and had a clear plan. Play Kh8, play Rg8, take on f3, etc. It might have been better to just play Rg8, accomplishing the same thing but not putting my king in danger, although computers seem to agree with my castling idea.
My opponent realises I have new exploitable weaknesses and is preparing all sorts of plans since my king has very little room to escape. I can play Bxf3 here, doubling the pawns but if he plays Kh1 then he could put a rook on g1 and probably checkmate me.
Closing off his plans to play Bxh7+, but weakening the dark squared in the process. His knight will get newfound activity in the future.
He uses up 5 of his 6 minutes here to come up with a plan. and it's pretty straightforward.
Threatening a checkmate in 2 after 27. Qh6 28. Qxh7+. Black has to immediately stop the threats.
I begin by giving a check and winning a pawn. Since my opponent hadn't played the draw by repetition I was sure that we were going to play this out, thus I opt to play this move first before making my defending move.
Making it pretty impossible for him not to trade. There are also ideas of Qxd3 if he allows it so he's better of trading.
With the ideas of maybe promoting the pawn, but he can't ever push his pawn to a7 because of my bishop though.
Offering a trade to try and speed this up.
And a draw is finally proposed by my opponent as he couldn't find a winning plan anymore. Being exhausted by this fast paced half an hour and not seeing a winning plan I accept. My opponent seemed frustrated as he muttered to himself that he thought he had a forced checkmate with saccing the knight on h7. At this point I don't really care anymore, being satisfied with my draw. I'm pretty sure there were a lot of inaccuracies in this game, but given the many threats White had I think this result is fair. With this I'm currently 1.5/4 which isn't bad considering 90% of all players competing are higher rated then myself, but there's still 5 matches to play. My next opponent is another 1800 elo player ( the 3th one so far ) and seems to play the old benoni. It'll be interesting to tackle the beast that the benoni is.
The bishop threaten on f7 is one of my favourites
On that pole the pawn is very strong. Actually Black has not useful move already. If Ne5 then d4
Now White must exchange 2 pcs for rook and pawn, which favors Black
Black wants to be able to support the advanced Knight and slow the pawn advance
Tries to exchange off the strong rook, but black can control the d-file
Prepares to pressure b4
the rook is reduced to guarding the pawn and now d4  is available after the pawn exchange
Rd2?? White misses the threat. If instead 37h5, g5 38 Kh3 white can hold on
3....Nc6 Develops, keeping tabs on e5 and d4.
4.Nh3? White should have probably played 4.Ne2, then fianchettoed his Light Squared Bishop, since it has little future in the French center.
6....g6. This allows me to get my Dark Squared Bishop to a more useful location than his dying future on the a3-f8 diagonal.
7....Bh6. This pins the Knight to the Bishop on c1.
8....Bxg5?? This miscalculation allows Black to win a minor piece.
9....O-O. I cannot move the Knight, because of the pin, and I had to castle to avoid losing even more material.
11.Qh3. This prepares for 12.Qh6, then mate is unavoidable.
13.Be2. Probably preparing for a sac on h5 to rip away my defense.
13....Na5?? This is a huge blunder! I don't know what I was thinking. 13....Ne2 is obviously the correct move here. From e2, the Knight can move to f5, where it controls the h4, h6, g3, g7, e3, e7, and d6 squares. If White trades on e7, that removes a vital attacker from White's attack.
15...Qf8. Now that I have two defenders in the corner, I will try to hang on with everything I have.
16....Qh6. Kicking the Bishop.
18.Nb5. Plans to take on c7, it appears.
20....Kg8. Defending and releasing the pin.
21....Nb7. I try to trade Knights. I think that this is better than 21...Bb7. Once the Knight takes, the Bishop retakes, then I can move the d-pawn and my Bishop will stare down g2.
2. ... Bb7 is the main line. Instead, black abandons the main line to play toward the Owen's Defense. If white plays 3. Nc3 we reach the Owen's Defense (more common from a side line of the French Defense with 1. e4 e6, 2. d4 b6, 3 Nc3). Owen's Defense is considered by most to be fairly inferior, allowing white to establish and hold a superior center while black falls behind in development. According to Wiki, it's greatest use is surprising opponents who aren't prepared for it, which may be great in a tournament hall, but not so great in online or correspondence chess where books and other references are allowed. However, white deviates with a different line, preparing to castle kingside earlier than would be possible after 3. Nc3.
15. ...c5? was black's own subtle gambit, I think. One cannot help but note that black's knight on h5 has no safe moves. Note that the pawn is en prise at g4, but black cannot play 16. ... Nxb4??? which allows 17. Qh7#.
Black trades, but his knight on h5 is still doomed, unless he wants to sac his other knight.
19. ... Nh5? was another gambit. That knight would have been safer on e8. And the pawn on h6 would have been safer if it had at least one defender that isn't pinned to the black king.
20. ... Kh7? defends the pawn and staves off immediate checkmate, but I think a better try for black was 20. ... Nf6, 21. Bxh6 Ne8. That also staves off checkmate but doesn't lose a knight. Better still would have been 19. ... Ne8 leaving black two more moves to find some safety for the king and his pawns.
It's decision time for black here. White is up a lot of material, having two bishops in exchange for only two pawns. Black should be cautious of any material exchanges. On the other hand, with a 4-2 kingside pawn advantage, especially with white's broken pawn structure, black could do a lot of damage without all the big pieces. But white has a hidden attack here, so black's best option is to draw the queen back to safety. Not so much safety for the queen, but for the black king.
Instead black jumps to the attack, threatening the undefended pawn at c4. A mistake. White sacrifices a rook to open up the black king's rambling castle. Best course here for black is to just take the rook, though that's very costly: 25. ... fxe6 26. Rxd6 Rf7 27. Bxf7 Qc1+ 28. Qf1 Qxf1+ 29. Kxf1 a5 30. Bxe6 leaves white ahead by two bishops and a pawn.
After 27. ... Kg8, white entered the conditional moves to the various checkmates, starting with 28. Rdxd6. Incidentally, I think there were checkmates starting with 28. Rg6 too, but they seemed to be easier for black to stall (not prevent).
! As soon as I saw this position, I thought if his Queen wasn't going to be trapped after 17. Nxa7 Bxc4 18. Nc6, but when I got the position on my chessboard I realized Black can play 18... Qd7!!, because the pawn on e6 is pinned, and White would lose too much material for his Queen.<n>Finally I decided to move his Knight on a worse position.
Other moves are possible and possibly better. But the whole point for me is to "demostrate" that the principle of not to get out the queen so early is not always true... if you know what to do with it.
This check is done mostly because I want to retreat the queen in c7, after c6. Still, white has to think which defence is better. I think Ne2 is slightly better, since it support a near-to-come Bf4, but any move is good, here.
This implies an early queen's exchange. I can retreat the queen, but it will be "hanging around", chased by white's minor pieces, all the game. And the "logic" Nc6 fails to QxQ, NxQ, Nb5, that threats Nc7+. The fork can be avoided only by Na6, that gives an unconfortable square (and game) for black.
This profilactic move is half-forced. The other way is e4 and after Nb5, Bd3, NxB, cxN. This can be playable, but I don't like to play without the bishop in a most likely endgame. Still, I have to find the right way to develop my pieces here, and it is still dubious black can make it to an equal position.
d4 only helps me, because of Bf5, threatening c2. White tried (in countless previous games) either Bd1 or Bd3. The latter allows BxB and cxB. Incredibly enough, the doubled central pawns are not easy to attack, and I am not satisfied with the resulting game. Probably better is Bg6, where BxB, hxB provides me with a semi open column that whorts something - not much, to be true.
Anyway, just to bring out the piece so Nd2 doesn't jail the bishop. But e5 can be an option, trying to keep white's dsb out of the f4 outpost.
! First time (normal is h4, to which h5 leads to g5 and, even if I have to resolve the developement of the kingside minor pieces, tends to be pretty stable. Here, e6 is ok, but I kind of "panicked".
...because of this strong outpost. Now, Bf7 - losing castling rights in an open position seemed dangerous to me, so I tried to untangle the position another way... but sweating cold.
Why not f5 at once? Of course, he wants to keep the tension, but this move just helps me:
I can castle queenside, here. The motiv is after Bxa7, b6 closes the bishop in, and I can win it in a couple of moves... but this motiv, common in "my" Scandinavian, is not completely sure. What can white do in the meanwhile?
Trying to fight.
From here, the knight can go to e6 for free.
Defending f5. It is not wise for me to open the game, so...
If Ne6, I have to play the "sad" Rd-g8. But it appears to hold. The Bxa6 motiv is still "on".
...but, in the hurry to settle my position by castling, I overlooked this. I cannot take because of Nf7, forking my rooks.
My intention never was to take it with the knight. I only wanted to reach a kind of controlled position.
Kb3, with the idea of Rd-a7 was an option, since the bishop check is shielded by Nc7. But it meant the fall of my g pawns, and the free ride of the h one.
Last try. The rook can go to g4, defending it.
Here, not Nb6 because after Bd8 I have to defend with the rook (Ra6), and the pawn in g will be taken.
My rook move was a blunder, since now white has time to stop the pawn with a rook. Still, Nf4 would have been a win for black. But he played, with few seconds left...
End of checks and the game, one I deserved to lose but... it was funny to walk over the edge all the time just to see the king walk all over the board... to win. A last note: when you play RTC (real time chess), don't trust ratings such as "500" or so... they are normally not "true".
Be2 was better as it keeps queens on board and with two bishops in open position white has more than enough compensation for the pawn.
Notable mistake. I thought that with pawn on f6 I can advance the central pawns. Clearly it is not so simple. Nf6 was better as it develops the knight and if white takes the knight he loses bishop pair.
Serious blunder. e5 was correct. Now the d7 pawn is not protected, and f6 is pinned.
Ke8 was better. It is not too late to acknowledge your fault yet.
Nd8 is better. Now white can win with a simple tactic. I thought that white will trade pieces on e5 and play Nf7 to win an exchange.
This move looks just stupid even without computer and calculations. White trades his very active knight for not developed yet bishop. Bishop completely blocked by it;s own pawns. Bishop that blocks development of the rook on h8. While not the most significant mistake in terms of score change this Nxf6? move is probably the one which players of every level can learn from.
Black is slightly underdeveloped and white has bishop pair, but connected passed pawns on the center can become extremely dangerous.
Adequate response. Black finished the development and threatens to push the pawns.
Ng4 looks dangerous but it is not the best move. Computer suggests 30. .. e6! or 30. ... d5! preparing to push the pawns. Now white can regroup his pieces.
Another blunder. Knight must return to e5. Now white can play Rc8 with major problems for black.
Yet another tactical mistake. I thought that after Ke1 I can play Nb2 and after it Nd3+ is crushing. What I missed is Bc7+ and black loses his knight. Now black must work hard to get a draw.
That's a serious mistake. White was afraid of 48. Bxg3 Rd8 threatening Rd1#. Deeper analysis shows that black will have draw at most.<n>While at first this move looks like something that removes black rook from the game it also paralyzes white pawn on a7 and bishop on b8. Now the position is reduced to two knights vs rook and we know that two knights are slightly better even in endgame.<n>While probably still a draw with perfect play now white is the want who must work to make a draw.
Not the fastest way to win. Rd8 was mate in 9 but now black just promotes the pawn.
Desperation. Now it is mate in 8.
Mate in 3. For example: 57. ... ef+ 58 Kh1 Kg3 59. a4 e1=R#<n><n>This game demonstrates the importance of blunders in games between club-level players.<n><n>While some bad moves show lack of tactical sight other mistakes are more positional and show that players do not understand the spirit of the position. Such positional WTF? moves are 13. ... f6, 15. ... Kf7 by black and 22. Nf8 and 35. h4+ by white. Such moves are something to learn from even if your tactical sight and ability to calculate variation is close to absolute zero.
The Q now becomes a target.
Semi-slav. This was the moment I started thinking.. 'OK, now the computer is going to murder me'.
Pretty surprising. Had to think now where to put my knight after dxe5 4...d4. I was initially planning for 5. Nb1, but I just felt that this was back sliding.
What else? I had seen that I will lose this pawn anyway so it was a case of thinking 'where is the best place for the knight after Qh5+ an Qxe5?'
I decided at this moment that if Qh5 i could go Nd2 and block the check. Then after Qxe5 I would play Ndf3 and fork queen and pawn.
When playing the computer I always try to force the issue.
Stepping away from my tempo gaining Nf3.
Defends some light squares in the middle of the board.
On this move I spent a long time. I thought about Nf5, Bxf5 and Qxf5 threatening Qc8+ but didn't think it led anywhere. I thought about 0-0-0 and chickened out. I think my decision in the position just came back to the strategy of forcing moves against the computer. I noticed c5 weakened the h1-a8 diagonal and I had hazy, distant plans of g3 and Bg2 and Bf4. At the time this seemed very active, it centralised my queen and gave me options on the kingside.
Check! And now as I looked at this on the board I thought 'well great, now he gets a free developing move!' And this, I realised, was probably why Ne4 was premature and weak. I tried to look for positives and thought, 'OK, my queen is strong and he is weakened on his kingside now. I can play e3 and develop both bishops in one fell swoop'. Still I kind of fancied my chances in this position.
One free move for black. I did know about this before I played Ne4. But I thought that a loss of tempo for a strong initiative (my next move) and greater development (black is lagging) was an OK trade for this stage of the game.
I think Rd1 was my other move here but I just wanted to get my bishop to d3 and warn (the computer) against castling kingside. I was also sick of seeing black pawns on d4 and c5. I think that this move was forced in a non-literal sense (follow my reasoning..?!) due to my recent loss of tempo.
I must admit I didn't expect the computer to take here. Opening the d file for my rook, allowing pressure against c5. I did hope for this when I played e3 and now I felt that I can get a dominating position quite quickly. However, as often in chess you think 'Yes, this position is just great, he has no moves to play against me to challenge my immediate plans,' and out comes lightening from a clear blue sky!
OUCH. At first I thought 'Wow, nice light squares...what a stupid computer. Why would anyone do this?' and then I started considering where to put my queen. Maybe black will castle queenside. Hmm not so clear what I should do anymore. Oh no, black has a fast f4, 0-0 and Bf5. Erm... 'Time to resign?'
Of course I considered Qd5 but my strategy when playing the computer is to keep my queen on for as long as possible. (Another flaw related to chess-closed-mindedness?) If f4 next I was considering either Bd2-c3 or Bc1, b3 and Bb2. But of course f4 means black can go 0-0 and Bf5 very easily indeed, so I was quite concerned about f4. I thought better for black now. Shouldn't have chickened out of 0-0-0...
But thankfully this gives me some time and some targets. The d-file is offered to me now free of charge. The pawn on h7 also looks pretty weak. Now f5 was looking a slightly odd advancement to me. I really wanted to play Bd3 and 0-0!
This annoyed me for a long while. I don't want to play b3, because my queen will be forever tied down to defending a2. I thought about all kinds of ways to sacrifice this pawn but in the end my calculation skills are just not that good. So eventually I thought 'why not just a3, it defends itself and stops the imminent black threat of Nc6-b4'. I like multi-purpose moves.
I also had half an idea of Ne5 and f4, but black could play f4 himself (itself). This move calms things down in the centre anyway.
Whenever I see the computer check me and the squares on the screen light up red I immediately panic. Red means danger. What have I missed!? Then I swallowed hard and opened one eye. I was confused. 'Huh? I have a perfect excuse now to execute my goal of a bishop re-route to c3.'
Black must be re-routing the queen to a more active position on c7 where it would control some central squares. Thankfully still no f4 threat.
I hate this move. First of all I considered 0-0 which would have been grand, why did I not just castle? But now once again I have given the computer a free developing move with the consequence  that I lost lots of time on my 20th move. I surprised myself with the amount of disgust I felt when reflecting on this decision after the computers next move.. because after all, this was my masterplan... was it not?
I really did not want to play b3 and weaken my queenside even further (I saw b3 Qxa3 Ra1). But b3 Rad8 is asking for a bad position. I really did not want to play Ne5, but I thought that his was my most active continuation. I admit I didn't give serious consideration to Qe2, it just looked potentially suicidal and a move that would lead to another free developing move for black eventually (any rook to e8).
This I expected, and now I was committed to some forced trading.
In this position I liked the way the bishops are positioned in pairs and in direct confrontation with the opposing bishops.
I get to finally castle! I will now play Rfe1 and once again try to build an advantage. I stopped again here for a while trying to find a way onto the light squares around blacks king, but I just kept reaching the conclusion that the bishop on e6 was an extremely rigid defender, priceless to blacks position. I had long term goals of my queen sitting mighty on e5, bishop on d5, and rooks firing down the centre. I think it is excellent practice to always try to imagine your dream position and make plans towards it instead of just making moves in the position.
At first this looks like a terrible mistake. Surely now I can get my bishop to its dream destination much quicker than anticipated?
Bf3 threatened, but now once again the computer throws a spanner in the works and I miss the key to winning by one move.
AH. If I was to take the rook on a8 I expected curtains to close somewhere and to do so very soon. My c4 pawn is once again under pressure. It seems I have been outsmarted, and my first instinct was to just play Rc1. But looking at this position now the winning move is obvious to me. Can you see it? I didn't until one move too late.
Throwing away a win. My worst move (bar blunders) for a significant amount of time. I am going to be a liar and blame it on time pressure.. It was time pressure that forced my hand.
The problem now is my extremely weak pawn. If I play Rc1 there is Rd4 and I am going very passive. And now I saw it; the winning move missed on move 26, and I kicked myself. I even thought my instinct of Rc1 would have been OK.
This was the winning move, a simple interference. I thought this was very active in this position due to Qxa3 Ra1 Qb4 Qe3 (hitting the bishop AND still defending b3) Bf7 and Rxa7. In fact at the time I thought this my only move to stay in the game. My bishop on f3 is preventing a back rank embarrassment on d1 if my rook decided to flaunt itself on the 7th rank. In this ending, my king will definitely need some air...
The computer decided not to enter those lines. Now I could see a nice way to get my long term dream position. If I could play Rd1 without being mated, and then take on d8, I could play Qe5 and Bd5 and be happy.
Sidestepping the planned route of attack. When playing 28. h3 I was slightly worried about losing possession if black went 28...Qd4. But now after Qe7 I started to see some tactics of my own starting with a nice pin.
Threatening Bd5, after which I would win immediately due to the party of pins. I didn't expect the computer to overlook this threat.
I thought about forcing my plan now with Rd1 but that would not be taking advantage of the extra tempo I have gained. I think if it (the computer) had played Qd6 instead I would have gone with Rd1 for sure, but now my queen can jump into an undefended hole and generate some threats. It reminded me of those hidden Japanese gunmen on Iwo Jima. I was getting excited now, and I could feel my position getting more and more active.
If it defends this bishop with Re8 then I go Bd5 again, and the black bishop is pinned both diagonally and laterally. If it moves the bishop to f7 my plan at this stage was Rd1 and I thought I could win the f5 pawn.
So this was an only move. Now, for the third time in the game, I took a break. I was pleased that I had got the black king to weaken itself and I spent a relatively long time thinking how to exploit it. I thought that what I did next was a nice try for a win.
I guess queen for rook and bishop wouldn't be desirable for black in the approaching endgame. I thought that if this occurred I would be just winning due to my queen checks on c7.
I thought that this was getting a little too complicated for me now. I wanted black to take the bishop off because Qxf5 apparently wins a pawn, but I just could not calculate or assess the position after black played Qf6. For two reasons.  1. The line ...Bxd5, Qxf5 Qf6, Qxf6 Kxf6, exd5. <--- This pawn is falling and I have a lost endgame. 2. If I DON'T take off the black queen he has (from f6) Qa1+ and Qxa3, which annoyingly defends a7. I saw nothing more than a draw here by perpetual.  So the only way for me to achieve my 'winning endgame' (I actually think I blundered severely later and was lucky that the computer didn't play the winning move) was to aim for a big pawn centre.
As expected. I thought that if the computer played Bxd5 then it must have a solid continuation. If not, then I knew it had foreseen a white move that I had not which would refute it. Such is the dependence on luck when playing a computer!
Trying to cement my bishop on d5 and hoping to achieve a passed pawn. It feels like I have built a solid wall right across the valley. But just like Helm's Deep, there is an exploitable weakness.
And now I have my passed pawn. Something to work with in the ending.
Now it cannot possibly think about taking off my bishop, simply giving me two huge connected passed pawns. My plan here was very long winded and more abstract thought than hardcore calculation. Primarily concerned with pawn breaks such as b4, and c5 if allowed, and king over to the queenside to help force the issue, I paid little heed to blacks own pawn breaks. But I trusted my strong bind on the kingside with pawns on g2 and h3. Overall I wasn't overly optimistic about getting a win but I was happy that I wouldn't lose. Or shouldn't.
I expected Kg6, so I was planning Kf2 for this. Only after f4 did I realise that Kg6 just left the bishop en pris. But I did spot the potential danger of facing a majority of pawns on the kingside here. I was very pleased that his (its, sorry) bishop was pinned or else it could help attack weaknesses on my kingside while pawns were pushed. This was duly noted, and I ordered my king to f3.
Probably so the computer can play the following devious move without having to defend f4 after I go Kf3. This is a very sneaky preparatory move. And I think I missed the idea just as much as the computer did! I think this is a perfect example of how humans think differently than machines. We see plans based on what has come before. Computers dont have plans, they just crunch numbers and bang out the best move, objectively speaking, every time.
I think this move, or more generally this idea, should have lost me the game. It is still hard to see why, but I suspect that my king cannot venture too far up the board due to the huge potential for black on the queenside. If I had had one hour in this position I would have most probably played 38. a4.
!! In my opinion the best move of the game, and one which I just cannot calculate. The threat is ...c4, and I just didn't see whether I can continue to meander my king through light squares to support my own pawn promotion, or if I should be on guard duty for the rest of the game. It is one of those things. Black never HAS to play c4, without it my king cannot get to d4 and help in dissolving the threat. It is simply a very dangerous reserve waiting on the sideline. And if my king runs too far then the black pawns will be too quick to catch.  In truth, I had no idea what to do here. And at such a critical juncture I had only seconds left. For 2 more moves. In short, I decided to go for it. And I do believe that 40. Kf5 is losing to 40...c4. Who else thinks these pawn endings are the hardest part of chess?
Three squares to go for each of my new central pawns, one king to block. One thing I knew for certain was that the black kingside pawns were going nowhere. I also anticipated that the computer would wait. Wait for me to commit to Kf5, and then push c4. Waiting for me to put my head in the lions mouth. I think in these situations ignorance definitely is bliss.
I reach move 40 with about 3 seconds. I had told myself here 'If I lose to 40...c4, then I am happy that I at least understood something about this endgame.' And of course, the computer was up about 50 minutes at this stage. That made me laugh.
? I now allowed myself another 30 minutes. And it seems that this move is a case of awful timing from the computer. Why not play this on the last move and threaten a4? Why wait now to play c4? At a greater depth I suspect c4 would be played. Its such a pressing issue. I actually felt a tinge of anti-climatic disappointment that I wasn't utterly blown away in this endgame. This pathetic move actually hands me victory. And an easy one thankfully!
41. e6 or d6? Like I said, always force the computer. If Ke7 next then Ke5 and d6.
1-0 And why not finish with an underpromotion? Not really an underpromotion though. It was a tough game, where my opinion of the position went through polar switches as frequently as a pendulum swings. I thought that black may have been able to clinch a win at the end after I decided to 'go for it' with my king. I was pleased that I didn't blunder or give away any huge positional advantages, and I played solidly throughout, although I am disappointed that I missed the clear cut win with that simple interference move 26. b3. Live and learn. Comments welcome :)
In my experience, not the best if I go for the Qe7 attack, but even so white can defend with accurate play. So I went for...
Prepared to be rejected by d4, but keeping an eye on a strong diagonal in case white would want to anvance the d pawn to d5. The problem with c5 now is that it leaves a dangerous hole on the Qside white squares (b5 for W's N or B at some point). So I went for this one.
As foreseen. I grant white the possession of d4, and a farily strong pressure against it.
Ok, I lost a tempo. And that I should have played Bg5. Was I ready to exchange my dsb for the Nc3? No! I sensed that my bishop pair is my strenght here. I won't waste it for a N, unless absolutely necessary.
Controls b5 and e5, allowing me to save my dsb in case of Na4 (Bc7). A little cramped, but holdable - I think.
I always say that castling is a loss of time etc. etc. I can recognize the smell of a position where black has to think it twice trying the Qside castling, as usual. Or simply I wanted to try something different from Qd6!?
If Nc5, I was considering Bc8 (I have to defend b7 and I don't want to exchange B's.
My opponent went for this other plan instead. Now, b4, Bc7, Nc5, and I am squeezed in and b7 would fall. I have to parry that.
This move anticipates white's plan, but it takes the black diagonal, preventing W's dsb to go to f4 (a good square for it, as g5).
This pin will be a real pain for me. I knew I had to play with a lot of care in order to handle it.
First step to ensure f6's integrity. I can't allow BxN, g7xB unless very sure about assessing it. It's easy to see a power on the semiopen g column, but I couldn't be sure white won't have found some counterplay based on my Kside messed pawns. Of course, here white has Ne5, and my answer would have been Qb8. A weird square for the Q, but it defends b7 and controls f4, eyeing h2... some strong point to exploit.
The pin on my N is restored, and it is a real... (censored). I don't find the right moment for h6-g5 (a dubious manouver).
It's ok, because it consolidates a nice pawn's structure, and I can't easily attack it due to Nf3 (preventing Be5). But not necessary, because I won't have gone for Qxc5, BxNf6, gxB. As white, I would have preferred Re1!
? See: I thought that I was not in a hurry to solve the pin issue, if I could grab some initiative, delaying white in his plans (Re1). White has nothing concrete still. The price of this would have been 15. b5. Against it, I would have not exchanged, even at the cost of b6, Bb8. Not a good square, but I hoped only temporary. But I had to keep control of b5 against White's lsb.
The quiet move must have a cost for my opponent. In this case, the opening of the a coumn, with my Be6 threatening a2... the downside of not having played g5.
Ok, this consolidation was not avoidable, and I must live with a3 to seal it... or not?
Never! Weird or good? I planned to support it with Rf-a8. The point is that unless white can't advance the pawn to a3, a2 will be my target. Distracting white to make anything dangerous on my kingside. In my plans, note, my Q is not required, so it is free to retake on f6 if needed. My lsb, despite his pressure on a2, is not really easy to remove from my Q's guard against W's Rooks...
Here, Be5 comes to mind, but fails to NxBe6, and if BxRa1, NxRf8...
Too bad Nf6 is deprived of his natural square: it is not going to move for some more moves anyway! I have to cope with Re1 though!
The idea is that White can't do BxNf6 because of QxQ, but if white starts the Q's exchange, QxQ, NxQ and black seems free from the pin at last. White can't respond with Bd3, (QxB, Ra3 supports the Q).  But all this has flaw: it misses Ne7+ after the Q's exchange, followed by NxBd4 - finally exchanging NxB the next move. Or worse.  A hell of a position for my poor skills!
It worked! A mistake from W, in my view. With it, white only "wins" the need to add a defender to a2, and lost his terrible pin on my kingside!
It was either this of Rf-h8. I can't just take the pawn, I have to do it cleanly.
...considered this the best move. If Ne7 now, NxBg5, NxBd5, NxBf3+, gxB, cxNd5, Rxd5.
Exchanging a B for a N in order to open the column and get his N to d6. I bet I would survive it, but now I'm not any sure!
Threatening at the same time Be5 and b7. But, for who likes homeworks, here there is one: White has another much more powerful threat here, that both my opponent and me overlooked during the game.
?? I foolishly played this based on Rd2, Bf3, Re2, and threatening Bxb4 in return after Nxb7. Completely overlooking White's simple but elegant Nxf7+. The point is that it forks my undefended dsb because I can't take the N or I will be mated in two (Rd8+, Rf8, RxR#). Nevertheless, things are not so simple, since after Kg8 - only one - NxBe5, f6 forks white's pieces. Anyway. The only correct move for black should have been Bd5, closing the column and preserving the lsb.
I have Bd3, assuring an exchange, but I have to solve the dsb problem and still create a threat so to delay Nxb7.
!? I'm not sure this sac was good for White. True is that it deprives me from my Bpair, but at the cost of an exchange. It's difficult to suggest a W's better. Maybe Re2, but Rf-a8, without fear of Nf7+, Kg8.
Naturally protecting the pawn with no threats to be harassed or exchanged once in d5. But this allows...
! Amazing, another R aligning I oversaw! This time, my opponent puts me in a trouble, since after f3, my B must move and e5 will fall. But moreover: Nf7+ here takes e5 anyway for free... and again, we didn't see it! This is the pity of blitzes...
Here I blundered and I went Rxh4, and I resigned soon after. Better would have been...
Preparing the mate! Very good! Ok, I can simply play one of my pawns and get out of the threat, so I would have taken the tempo to start my own attack. I just have to be aware that I "owe" my king a pawn's move.
Not a great plan. I lost my chance to play the R's on the second rank, and now with f3 I have nothing.
Forcing the exchange of my last beloved B! But it was still better than a tricky mate!
I feel I had to apply this pressure, even if...
This move threats back rank mate with Ra1#, and the other R shields any possibility of BxRa1. With the addition of a black pawn in f7 and a white pawn in h4, the position qualified as a puzzle (for once!) and it is now a puzzle. In the game, white has just one move to do:
Defending the B. Rg1 leads to the same loss of pieces.
he obviously doesn't like my light figures to snoop around in his area.
If you want to exchange, do it as I want, with my white pawn out of the way on the e line
To boldly go...
And the other goes to save the pawn.
Again, I had this feeling, so I went up with the king to be able to assist the pawns.
Let's fight. There can be only one. And I have the church with me, in form of a bishop.
Yeah, he has to try to stop me now.
But he can't with that bishop in the way.
Of course, but I still got one in the oven, and you can't get that.
Better was 12...Nb8 though it loses a tempo  because of white next move.
Now, mate is unavoidable. (if the knight on g7 moves, Qxh8#)
The Richter-Rouzer variation. Rather unlike the Sozin which is an opportunistic positional treatment creating steady pressure against Black's center, the Richter-Rouzer aims to conjure up a tactics-based attack on Black's K-side. In the Sozin White castles K-side; in the R-R he castles long and plays to cram his K-side pawns down Black's throat.
!? This continuation has been around for a long time, but I seldom see it played at GM levels anymore, and only very rarely at the level of chess most of us mortals play on. Must be a "fashion" thing. Regardless, the move aims to create a hole at e5 for a Black Knight, a post that lays groundwork for a Black counterattack striking from the center and up the half-open c-file.
Black has lost his peachy Knight at e5 but White, in capturing it, has been thrown on the defensive and it is now Black who's attacking. Notice a common theme in this sharp continuation, following ...g5 Black often has no time to castle: his game often balances on that gain of a single tempo. The second player must have good nerves to choose to leave his King in the center.
Black is a clear pawn up and has the Bishop-pair, and White's King is terribly exposed.
Preparing to connect the Black Rooks.
The exchange gives my Rook an open file.
The position has now simplified some, and White emerges with a passed KP -- the only significant difference in the game at the moment.
After some positional maneuvering, I end up with my major pieces doubled on the Q file, though with no significant threats as yet.
Allowing an exchange, but to passively retreat would let White surge forward and strangle my position.
White chooses to try and win in the upcoming endgame.
...to set it up.
standard open I move up my white pawn to d4
He counters with a black knight to f6.
I try to make a pawn wall and move up to c4.
Black pawn blocks my pawn in the c rail by moving up to c5. It's a free pawn for my taking if I want from d4.
I pass the pawn and move up to d5.
Black blocks with a pawn to d6.
I put forward my pawn from base line to e3. This opens up my Queen and my bishop in f1.
Black advances his bishop to g7.
18. I hardly considered this, must be a critical position because soon black is in trouble but here I was still happily taking pawns on c5, thinking I could shore things up with c6 and be fine
19. Here I began to calculate and realized there were some problems because after Nd5 there is a Nxc7/Qd8 threat that wins the house
So on move 18 dxc5, here at first I was shocked to find 22 h4 for white. The black queen cannot stay on the diagonal to d8, which would make Nxc7 winning.<n>22 h4 Qg2!? 23 Rf1! and there is simply nothing black is threatening or can do against Nxc7. <n><n>Then I found Qf5! and the mate threat stops and immediate Nxc7, giving black enough time and a decent position. So I went for this variation after all happily
I think a mistake, not sure if its losing, wild position, but the follow up seems pretty convincing.<n><n>23 Nxe3! is I think the strongest move for white.<n>It should continue 23 Nxe3 Qxe7 24 bxa6 Rxa6 or something, with pawns and open king for the piece and the exchange
I have been scoring poorly with my Advance French lines and my Open Sicilian lines so let's go for the KIA or Closed Sicilian.  Actually I just took up the 3.d4 Sicilian stuff as White.  It has not gone well in the first few contests.  I have played the French Advance for many years and apparently Black has figured out everything.  Just comes down to the higher rated doing better....
Interesting.  I have not used the KIA much until recently so every game offers a new vision of the opening.  My opponent is a reasonably strong player rated around 1800.  Statisitics say he is better than me so I am respecting 3...Bd6.  I assume he might like to enforce an ...e6-e5 advance soon.  Or perhaps he is planning ...f7...f5!?  Or a Semi-Slav pawn structure (French meets Caro...yuck...too solid!).
Initially (short range) this is indirect pressure on the d5 pawn mainly.  Without additional protection 5.exd5 might create issues.  Nevertheless, this is unlikely and long term I am strengthening e4 and committing to putting my Bishop on g2 or h3 since the Queen currently blocks the King's Bishop.
Now 5.exd5 can also met with 5...Nd4.  Does not seem all that good, but it is pesky.  My guess is this would be a gambit of sorts.  I do not want to fall far behind in developing pieces as my King will need four moves to castle short and three to go long.  I do not want to go long on the castle because there is not much defensive or offensive firepower for my use on my Queen side at present.
Can I get in 7.e5?
A Double King Pawn Opening type position has arisen on the board.  In my limited chess experience French players seem to rarely play an early ....e6-e5.  Viva la difference.  Je parle francais en pus en pus.  That is something to the effect of I speak a little (very little) French!  Don't fuss at me if it translate poorly.  That is exactly the point!
Well...I have to move the Knight to develop the Bishop unless I fianchetto.  So maybe I get the Bishop pair in an open position?  The Bishop is tied to the defense of e5.  I get a free pawn to munch if he moves the Bishop.  Now the open position is another story.
Yep!  Bishop pair come to me.
And maybe a backward pawn on an open file to pile on.  If I were my opponent I would strongly consider an immediate ...d6-d5 advance.
What's the word...prophylaxis? In other words, keeping the Knight or any other Black piece off d4 for now.  Remember chess is dynamic.  May need to later advance the c3 pawn to stiffen the defense of another square later.
This formation is similar to Black's Sveshnikov Sicilian formations and strongly suggests that ...f7-f5 now or in the near future is a good freeing move, but I still like ...d6-d5.  Perhaps a daring soul would play both pawn breaks? Which first I wonder?
Yes... I know the Knight is usually not on e7 in the Sveshnikov.  It is better here on e7 as it helps facilitate either pawn break.
Planning to attack on h7 if possible and clearing the diagonal for the Bishop.  The King's Bishop's first future square is undecided at present, but I do not seem to have enough time to fianchetto now.
Since White can threaten h7 quickly after 11...d5 12.exd5 Nxd5 13.Ng5, perhaps now the f5 break is "safer"?
In light of his next move, maybe 12.exf4 is better and then 13.Bd3 follows IF he does not recapture with is Bishop.  Actually I prefer the game move.
Geez...what a spoiler!  Good move!  Seals off my short term attacking prospects on the King side.  The exchange 12...fxe4 seems to benefit White more than Black.  I'm still behind in development and must now move the Bishop too...
It's always a cool move to put x-rays on the higher valued piece.  Why is it an x-ray?  Well...this is not direct pressure.  And if White is not paying attention the threat is invisible just like radiation.  Later the effect can be fatal however....
I did notice.... Black also had the threat of ...Nb4 against the Queen, Bishop and with the Bishop's help on e6, the a2 pawn. I am beginning to suspect that the d-pawn is going to stay on d6 however. If I can only get developed that pawn sure looks tasty!
This takes h5 back and threatens the unprotected Bishop.  Castling seems nice, but then Black will develope an initiative on the Kingside.  So...presently no time for classical chess principles!
This is why I preferred 15...Qg6 as a defensive resource.  As 15.Ng5 took h5 from Black the move 15...Qg6 keeps the White Queen from immediately occupying h5. Of course after 15...Qg6 16.Nxe6 Qxe6 17.Qh5 is possible, but lacking the Knight the White Queen has no teeth in her bite. Presently mate in one is threatened. To think all I wanted to do was castle....
Neither side seems to have much of an edge.  Of course the mate in one threat was easy to see and parry with 16...h6. I need to open the position for my Bishops and put my Rooks on good squares in the short term.  I probably need to retreat my Queen at least to e2, but then Black gets a free reign on the King side.  For Black maybe the long avoided ...d6-d5 is good now?   Well...I think it is.
Seems to be preparing ...d6-d5.  Had I moved my Queen back to e2 he would not have needed to make any preparations for the pawn advance.
So I stop the last chance to play ...d6-d5 just as it seems he may finally see the plus side.  That move had been available since Black's 9th.  In other words this is the first chance I have had to stop the advance and make the backward pawn something of a problem forever....  I would still call the position equal as neither sides pieces have much scope.
Of course as mentioned earlier when the c-pawn advances another hole is created on d4.  Such is the give and take of chess moves.  The idea is to get more than you give with each move!
I am willing to cede d4 to a pawn, but not to a Knight.
He opts out of 21...Nd4 once the Bishop arrives to threaten 22.Bxd4.  Of course after ...exd4 he would have e5 for his other Knight and my Bishop would be both threatened and semi-useless too.  He also would thereby eliminate the Bishop pair as a long term plus for me. Alternatively he might try 22...b5?!?, but this might end up favoring me. I could see the possibility of ...d6-d5 being revived in one line (23.Rac1 bxc4 24.Bxc4 d5 25.exd5 Nxd5), but he will need to first defend the g6 Knight somehow and 22...Kh7 planning 23...b4 is dangerous due to the Bishop being on the same diagonal. Of course playing 22...b5 does not require 25...d5 as a follow up move. There's a lot going on in this seemingly quiet position.
Solid, but boring!  I was actually unhappy making the move despite feeling the position required me to freeze his f-pawn for now.  I am obviously NOT having success opening the position or placing my Rooks.<n>And my Queen does not look real happy now.
Not a good move now in my humble opinion.  Just loses the pawn and a tempo. The subsequent weaknesses probably cause the final result.  I'd probably redeploy the Knight via g8 and f6 when White's Queen is under threats and other than the backward pawn Black will be doing well.
I missed this.  Or rather I did not consider the move because the tactic seems flawed. This move is definitely costly to Black's cause.
Flawed because the capturing pawn's threat to the Queen allows White to cover the loose piece before Black can pick it up with ...Rxc3.  Those brave little pawns!  And remember John Nunn's famous LPDO mnemic device (Loose Pieces Drop Off).  Fortunately the piece is not really loose.  Maybe this is what my opponent missed when he started the faulty combination beginning with 22...d5?  All I can say is "Been there and done that many times while playing correspondence chess."
Mate threat restored since Black opened the position for me. My opponent resigned here as he is down a lot of material after the unfortunate combination, but he could have played on for some time after 25...Qg8.  White's options then include 26.Bc4 and 26.Bxe5.  Black might try 26...Rc6 after the latter.  Alternatively 25...Qc5+ renews the threat to win the c3 Bishop, but after 26.Kh1 Black can not stop the mate in one.  Basically averting mate will leave a lost ending of pawns against pawns and two Bishops.  An interesting game.  White was never really better.  Black made a mistake late and White was opportunistic however.
...then our black-square bishops go...
This allowed me to split the king and the g-pawn...
I decide not to take the pawn, otherwise I'd end up losing two.
I decide to bring my king into the action
Now my h-pawn has some space...
In Rook endings it's important do stay mobile and attack. I now threaten RxP and the slaughter of the Black Q side Pawns.
A difficult decision. Moving the K to the N file would keep it near the threatened passed P but trap the King on the flank.
This Pawn now simply threatens to march to N8, and Black's King is cut off from guard duty by the White Rook.
Now I have a new passed Pawn -- and my King is in the best possible place, *ahead* of the Pawn.
Black resigns. There is no way to prevent the Pawn from becoming a Queen.
rook for the win!
best to trade
Black has a strong center
Black and white are attacking on opposite sides. Black looks well placed for a queenside attack, while I am preparing a kingside attack.
Better was for black to play RxR. He would have been in good position to win the game  with two pawns up
the next chain of moves was meant to free my horse and bishop from the pawn attack...
-and it worked.....
and i had to say goodbye to my rook
at this point, i dont think anyone would have believed that i could pull off a win.<n>(2 pawns, 1 bishop n 1 rook down with nothing to show for it)
preparing the chekmate....
Threatening in some cases to sac the bishop on h6.
Threatening Bxh6 and then, if he recaptures, I take with the queen threatening mate on h7.  Of course, this is an obvious threat, but the bishop is well placed in any case.
Loading up on the d-pawn.  Black is on the defensive.
Maintaining pressure, forcing black to respond to threats.
Seizing control of an important file.  In some lines I can make threats on the 7th rank because black's king is hemmed in be pawns in front.
Now it gets complicated.  Can white get away with taking the pawn on d6?  He attacks the rook after Rxd6 and forces ...Rxd6, after which Qxd6, but is it worth letting black take the a-pawn?
Creating some glaring threats based on the mate on a-1.  It doesn't work, though.
I can sense some sort of win ahead, but I'm not sure of it yet.  I've got to keep the initiative and make forcing moves so he can't coordinate his queen and rook.
The idea is that Qxd5 loses to pawn checks that force the king away from the queen.  However, I now have a forced win.
If 37...Kf4, then 38.Nxg6+ mates in a couple of moves.
[%clk 0:05:08] A new try for my standards. I'm ready to exchange the dsb if needed.
[%clk 0:04:42] A double edged move, more complicated than c3. Of course c4 was a possibility, but then I must have suffered from the B's dsb. No way. My aim with the text was c7.
[%clk 0:05:02] Protecting c7 and preparing e5.
[%clk 0:04:11] Now I plan to exchange the B in order to get more space on the center (e4,d5)
[%clk 0:04:09] Now, black can exchange his only good B left for my N and scramble my pawns. I bet I can handle that better tha a B pair later on.
[%clk 0:04:51] Now I think that Retiring the B would have been the better option. White is solid and has space advantage on a closed board against the B pair. But I wanted to attack somewhere, and I risked...
[%clk 0:04:10] ...but this drops e4, fatally, unless I spend a tempo playing f3. It was a possibility, for sure, but I didn't want to need it. It was a mistake.
[%clk 0:04:53] e6's weakness is not easily exploitable, and I lost my good center, opening the way to B dsb. A serious mistake.
[%clk 0:04:20] ...So I am a pawn down, and about to lose another one. Well done, Damalfi, this is sooo great! Now, under the circumstances, which is the "flaw" I can find in black's position... if any? How can I stop him to grab which of my pawns... f3, Bxc2, a4 (trying to trap the B with Nd4, but c5!.
[%clk 0:02:55] Needed if I don't want to lose the g pawn. Besides, I am looking for the f column...
[%clk 0:04:01] Not really sure about if there was a better way for me to go (maybe involving the other Ra-f1), but this must be enough. Still, my opponent, rightly, made me work a little more. In the way, I stepped in an very nice bind that crushed my opponent.
[%clk 0:02:35] I think this was the right move. Black can't help to lose one pawn more, if I'm right.
[%clk 0:02:26] Now it's the moment to be patient and don't risk to return the courtesy, on the way to victory.
[%clk 0:02:14] Black must concede the R exchange, after which my R will prevail without contest.
[%clk 0:02:20] Snatched another one, and... look into the position: the black N has it very, very hard to "bypass" white's R guard: can you see? My h pawn will win the game without any effort. I saved the game mainly to remember this particular R / N asset. For black it is virtually impossible to reach g6 or c7. The rest of the game is of no interest.
Instead, I did this!  My idea was to follow with f3.
Here, I got stupid trying to be too tricky.  A straightforward Queen exchange, followed by f3 as I originally planned, would have left White slightly better.  Apparently I think I need my Queen on the board to improve my attacking chances.
Black realizes that the King will have to help.  The R can't easily stop the pawn on its own with the N flying around.
Another mistake.  I think the more pawns I hold on to the better.
And Black will take the last remaining pawn and checkmate shortly.  Well-played by Black and a good reminder to me to think more carefully about exchanges!
I protect against the attack on C2 and the fork to follow
So I step up my efforts to catchup in development
and I follow suite
Undaunted, I continue to open the game
See, this is what I call a wasted move. White could have done this a move earlier, and then I would have had to react then, bit I did not worry about it until now.
with a 2 point advantage, I can now tackle the queen
now taking this knight was a bit foolish because the queen was in a position to be pinned to the castle - there is another term for this, but I can't recall what that is...
still not seeing the danger, white tries to build an attack
bye bye queenie...an 18 point lead and check to boot
begins to set up the end game.
this is calculated. I need the pawn up a row, the g3 pawn gone, and the queen on d5
like I am going to allow a bishop interfere with my plans
this is actually a very interesting move. White fails to see the danger of capturing the castle. In the event he does so, I capture the knight and bring my pawn up to guard the f2 square. With the bishop on g1, I am almost home dry
finally, step three and a move or two away from mate
in a futile attempt to distract me, white tries to threaten my queen.
This game is one I played on a site similar to GameKnot.  It was in the second to last round of a tournament and I needed to win or draw in order to avoid elimination.
Giving the white bishop an escape route and preparing to strike at the center
Forcing white to either retreat or exchange and leave black with the bishop pair.  I decided to exchange to avoid losing the initiative
Forcing away the last defender of the e pawn.  In retrospect this move obstructs the white bishop and allows black's white bishop to remain active on d7 so all the focus on winning the e pawn was probably misplaced
?? Once again I think black would have been better served to force the issue with Bf5 as this allows the white knight to become even more active while gaining a tempo on the black bishop
?? The knight on e4 is left to the mercy of black's rook
?? Declining the knight?  Blocking the white bishop on the a2-g8 diagonal is not necessary as 22. ...Rxe4 23. Bxf7  Qxf7 Qxe4 leaves black with a winning advantage
Defending the knight before it is too late
Getting the queen away from the bishop's discovered attack.
This appears to be a good move as it opens up the black bishop with a tempo on the queen but...
He played this opening both times.  The first time, I did some sort of classical response, with pawns on d4 and e4.  This time, I decided to try something a little more hypermodern.
Pinning his knight, preparing for the e5 pawn push.
Protecting the b2 square from his bishop, and possible pawn push to release the rook and exert some control on that side of the board.
Perfect opportunity for my pawn push.  If he passes, I grab it with my knight.
And the rook starts to feel a little heat.  I took a good 45 seconds off my clock thinking about this situation.
He's attacking my pawn on e5.  I debated pulling my bishop back to f4 but I really didn't like that idea.  It's mobility would be cut in half and 30 second in I spotted what I thought was a better square.  e7.
I really expected him to trade bishops there.  Instead, he puts the only piece he has that can counter my white bishop and tucks it away at the bottom of the board.
When I made this move I thought it might be a blunder.  It gives him a chance to trade off his weak bishop and curb my knights rampaging.  I was looking at 34. Ne8  Kf8 35. Nc7 winning one of the pawns, but he makes a blunder next move and I stopped worrying.
And now his king can't move.
I have to start thinking about pawn advancement.  At this point both of us had 2 mins left on our clocks.  I knew he'd be going on the defensive now so I decided to make quick, safe moves and force him to  watch his clock.
of course, it needs to be protected. but this actually pins the other knight too ;-).
!?... most common here seems to be Nxd4. This position was new to me though, so I consulted the gameknot DB and that move seemed to have a high success rate (yes, this was my main motivation to play this move, you can blame me on that :-P )
putting pressure on his knight on c6. <n>After a possible 9. ...fxg5, 10. Nxc6 would give me the knight and threaten the queen (10. ... bxc6? 11. Bxc6+ would let me take the rook and I would still be treatening f3)
After thinking for this long, I finally decided to make this move. Since black's knight is still pinned, he can't just take my knight. Also, it treatened to win black's queen by doing Ne5 next move (since the Bishop on a4 was protected now). Because of that, black couldn't play fxg5 or Bxe1 in next move, as this would have let me capture the queen.
?? Now, this move surprised me, I was simply expecting bxc6. It really seems to be a blunder, as the gameknot analyzer changes the rating from +0.55 to +5.69 for white. Amusingly, I wasn't aware of that at this point, I still thought the position is quite equal.
Now have a closer look at this position, I just find it too nice ;-). It seems that 4 of my pieces (both knights and both bishops) are 'en prise'. Furthermore, my rook still could be taken with black's Bishop, so black actually had 5 possible captures at this point ;-). Of course, at the current position I had captured 2 knights while black only had 2 pawns.
?!. And still, none of pieces were captured. I understand that black wanted to bring in more pieces and that he wanted to bring his king in safety. Of course I was threatening something like Nxf6+ for winning the queen, but I was actually expecting either Qxc6, dxe4 or probably Bxe1. <n>At this position I started to realize I really seem to have an advantage... but still I didn't see a clear path to a fast win... I just felt this position has a lot of potential, and I started to think very long about my next move again...
now I could simply capture the bishop, so instead of 5 pieces being attacked, there now only were the 2 bishops left (as the knight on e7 was protected by the rook now). So at this point my advantage was for sure now ;-). +4 in material after the capture of a bishop.
I simply accepted the exchange because I was +5 in material... each exchanged pieces makes the win easier in such a position, I think
Black's losing tempo.
An early decision to Castle, but poorly developed in my honest opinion.
No desire to take the d-Pawn, here. I prefer the flood technique in the Middle.
Finally I get to push out another Horse.
The desire to clear out Pawns Kingside makes me feel comfortable with the Bishop pin. Black is not a threat to me right now.
Forked! I knew it was not a sound decision to move the Bishop that far. I will not exchange the Bishop for a Knight.
I think I still have the advantage, but what I'm about to do with my light-squared Bishop is maddening!
Black should retreat the King to h8!
Trying to get compensation for the lost material, but it allows me to break up my Doubled-Pawns along the f-File.
And the forgotten Knight pays the price.
At this point I stand to lose some Pawns.
Perhaps I am Castling to early. Or too late.
A decision to attack aggressively almost cost me in this game. I have chosen the f7 Square to focus my power, and Black chooses f1.
I win the footrace to my back Pawn!
Locking up the Kingside.
Locking up the Queenside, to complete the Zugzwang.
Combinational Chess Theory. I don't see a way for Black to win. I can kill off Pawns on either side of the Board with my King, while promoting to Queen before Joseph.
Moving to the Ruy Lopez Spanish opening. My knight is now under attack, and my pawn is about to lose some protection...
...so I bring out my queen to the 3rd rank to defend my knight, and should I drop the latter, I can still keep a reasonable pawn structure...
...but he castles kingside, and I'm debating as to whether or not I should play Qxd4 and capture the pawn...
...but although the knight recaptures, I dare not capture it, as Re1 would be the response, causing me to drop my queen for a rook. However, she guards f7, should the enemy queen advance to h5...
...but I have nothing to fear from the dark-square bishop, just yet, as both the king and queen are on light squares...
...so I threaten the knight, and free up my light-square bishop...
The rook does indeed come out, but it is not yet threatening to take my pawn on e5, as my queen is defending it, but it needs some cover for Bf4...
...and the bishop does indeed come out, so now I target the pawn on b2, and the rook on e1, hoping to win either of the two, with latter resulting in a possible mate...
To guard the Pawn.
Countering by protecting the Bishop.
the idea was to take controll on the center with wining a tempo .
this move have some advantages and some dissadvantages , the advatange is that white takes space controll in the center and bolocks  blacks DSB on g7 . however white gives up the square d5 which all so allows the black knight to return to d5 . in positional game there are many times that , the players gives up some strong spots for getting another strong spots .
good move , white continue to develop his pieces to active positions , the idea of 8.Bc4 is to make pressure on d5 square ,and on the same time prerers 0-0 which give safety place for the white king .
maybe it was better for black to hold the central d5 square by 8...c6 ,  after the game my opponent told me that he didn't like the idea of 8...Be6 because of 9.Ng5 and probably he will lose his bishop pare , and will get double pawns on F file .
the idea of h3 is to avoid black a pine on f3 by Bg4 ,and by that 10.h3 is limit  blacks LSB moves and prepares 0-0.
i didn't see active positions on the c1-h6 diagonal for my DSB , therefore i developed my DSB to a3 which pines the e7 pawn and doesn't give black to close my LSB , however maybe , better was 13.a4 first , so if will be Na5 so i will able to move Ba2 and stay on the diagonal a2-g8 .
its a mistake , black loses a free pawn after 13.Qb3!which attacks f7with the help of the Bc4 and attacks the b7 pawn . 13..Na5 wont help because of 14.Bxf7+Kh8 and after the white queen retreats black will stay without material and with worse position .
with the move 18.Rfe1 there is a threat to win a free piece by 19.g4!-Bc2.20.Rac1!and the LSB is trapped.
black saw the threat and plays 18...h5 to avoid g4.
i didn't hurry to exchange the queens right away , it was better for me to maneuver the knight to d6 (Nd2-c4-d6)and get very powerful position for my knight . and if 22...Qxb4-cxb4 and i have good pawn structure on my queen side , and leaving d4 pawn doesn't badder me because of the maneuver of my knight to d6 , as i earlier mentioned . if black wont tack the queen exchange offer and play 22...Qc7 , my queen will be in very strong position , controling the dark squarese diagonal a3-f8 and the B file and after 23.Nc4-Rfb8.24.Qa3! with very good position .
the idea is to activet the rook and by the move 27. c4 play.28. Rb3. another idea was to avoid the blacks LSB come back to the game by ,Bd3-a6.
if 29.Rxb1-Rxb1+ , and it will diffieculte for me to defend the a5 pawn .
the diffrense here that after 30...Rb2 , i have the option to play .31.Ra1
good move if 32....Rxc3.33.Nxa7 , and it will be very hard for black to stop my (a) pawn .
good move the idea is to play 33...Be4 , and some chances to create a passing pawn for black.
good move , after deep thught , i decided to give back my free pawn , for closing the h1-a8 diagonale .
black havs no choise but to lose his piece .
blacks last chance, white must be careful not to capture the rook , because i wont be able to stop the black (c) pawn and  i will lose .
good move , my idea is to bring my king to the center for stopping the passing pawns.
good move , after i reached my king to be close enough to stop blacks pawns . the idea of .49.Rd4 is after.50. Nxc2- dxc2.51.Rxc4, and black cannot defend  longer his pawns , there for  he has nothing to do but to resign . black resigns . thank you i hope you enjoy my game .
A "Walking the Walk" club game.  A notable aspect of this game is that black's king moved a total of ONE time the entire game.  Up until move 36 (the point at which white would have resigned in a non-club game), white's king moved 7 times.  That contrast along with a few other time-wasting and questionable moves by white played a large part in the game.  Black slowly developed a stronger position and then gained the initiative, probably over the course of moves 12 to to 20, with white's move 16 perhaps being the turning point.
a standard move suggested by the game database.  very non-intuitive for me.  tried for some time to understand the value of the move.  Other than the influence on black's lsb, it will also hinder black's pawns and therefore limit space.  a potential support post and can also attack. comments?
another standard move.  I didn't really want to give up the B.  but I planned to castle long and so didn't mind removing black's B, lifting Q off back rank in the process.
this kingside pawn fortress holds unchanged to the very end of the game.
If black is setting up to castle opposite, and wasn't a master, I'd think it was a bad idea.  White has 6 pieces to deploy in that direction.  On the other hand, that same number of black pieces could be bearing down on white soon enough.
thought about putting rook on e.  but I can do that anytime and e is pretty closed down at the moment.  Bc3 puts some general pressure on black's kingside, ...could perhaps influence black to castle same side, though at this point I'd be happy with either game.  also thought about Be3, and then bringing rook in behind. Passed on Ne4 to conserve pieces.  Plus that might have been playing in to an endgame that black may be working toward.  Is the Caro-Kann known for having a small middlegame?   ---around this time (moves 12 to 17), black perhaps comes to have a better position.  this by subtle moves on his part and subtle mistakes on mine (or not so subtle?).  how did black's better position come about?  ---I note that this move, 12. Bc3, does turn out to be no good and only wastes important time that could have been put to better use.
saw no better move here and reasoned that this rook could be happy practically anywhere on e, ...with the 4th and 5th rank having "some" "potential" for lateral travel.  white's overall position appears good from the standpoint of mobility and influence on center.  a bad assessment of white's position?  I can see that black rooks are now free to cause white trouble.
amazing all the game-changing possibilities that COULD follow this move.  pxp looks like a bad idea that would open up black's game and put white on the defensive.  meanwhile, there are temptations elsewhere on the board (14. Ng5 hxg5, 15. hxg5 and similar) ...that the master would never fall for.
even though I didn't want the complications and lost time associated with extricating myself after this capture (not to mention that the b-file will soon be controlled by black), I reasoned that the benefits of breaking black's queenside pawn chain would outweigh the negatives.  I expect black was no more concerned with my capturing the pawn than he would have been if I had stayed away from it (perhaps he wanted me to take it, and maybe the a-pawn as well).  having castled "into trouble" before, I note that my king is somewhat well positioned to move to the center or right (I realize the folly of this, now).  better to leave black's pawns alone here, ...to inhibit his heavy pieces?
black completes paving on a nice stretch of two-lane highway along b and c.
while useful for defense and for potential attack, this move also proves to be a liability as the rook comes to need inconvenient protection later.
the white Q has to come back, letting go of the interesting option to cross along 6 (preceded by capture of e and/or h pawns) in an attack sequence.  nice job by black keeping such plans suppressed just enough that they NEVER come about.
cripes, 5 black units trained on b4.  ---from move 18 to 25, I wanted to take out black's e & h pawns, ...for the resultant weakening of the king's position.  a pricey undertaking, I couldn't quite get to where the cost was worth it.  throughout those five moves, I felt black could avoid checkmate and that the exchange would be slightly unfavorable to white.
my last chance to launch an attack on the black king's position.  I really did not want to spend the next move on the king...
...but I decided there was a potential exposure risk, black potentially attacking the king from a, b, c and d, ...and from the side.  razor thin that I didn't leave the king on d1, ...Bxh6 being among alternatives.  perhaps a mistake.  other alternatives?
...I let go of the bishop primarily on the grounds that moving the Q would have resulted in a more precarious situation for the white king, Qe3 or Qf3 being the alternatives (Qg3 would lose the rook).  the white king never does gain the safety I was hoping for.
pxp. tough choice.  I looked at various attack setups, ...coordinating rooks and queen in attack on the black king, but was about one move too slow to beat black's pawn promotion, ...and subsequent move by black bringing the new queen into play.  expecting Bc5 to follow. not considered here is the trouble black could cause with e5!  had I not wasted moves at 12 and elsewhere would I be more well positioned to attack now? or would I have already attacked, going ahead with Bxh6 as I wanted to from move 19 to 25?!!!
so I move with a priority on gaining some king safety, ...resolved that the knight is lost. queen move either loses forward rook or exposes king.  king advance problematic.  f4 interesting but also no good here (though may help in a move or two by encouraging pawn capture of N); ...g2 vulnerable.  Rd1 not as good as Re1./?  Aack!
ah, clever.  I hadn't recognized that this move would be an attack on the white king AND rook.  effectively prevents Kf1.  had expected the black queen to travel the long diagonal for Qxg2.  black is seeing further into the position than I am and has me fully dead here.
and viola, a nice roundabout route and black has the white queen.
it will be a feat to hang on to the rook and both pawns.  note black's fine pawn fortress, still unchanged since move #9.  30 moves!
no way to save the rook.
white resigns.  probably the best of my four WTW games.  fewer major blunders. plenty of smaller mistakes though.  The personality of the game - castling opposite and white's king safety issues - contributed to black's win.  Between move 11 (when white castled) and move 36 (when white lost his queen), the white king moved 6 times, ...good initiative for black and little opportunity to improve position for white.  these checks/king moves began at move 24.  I expect I will be taking a close look at moves 12 to 23.<n><n>as for where I went wrong, 12. Bc3 wasted two moves.  16. Qxb7 is questionable but probably not bad on its own (otoh, perhaps time could have been better spent on engineering an attack).  19. Re4 also probably not bad on its own.  25. Ke2 perhaps a waste of time.  26. Bxb4, hmm. prevents loss of c-pawn but loses bishop, reducing attacking options.  28. Bxa4.  perhaps should have made queen safe and let N deal with black's a-pawn.  29. Re1 a wasted move.  Also, from 22 to 25 (and even 19 to 22), white is somewhat well positioned to initiate an attack.  perhaps not proceeding was another mistake.  will have to see how these comments line up with what the computer has to say.<n><n>Thanks very much to hityerclock for the game.<n><n>will look forward to hearing any comments.
Re1 putting it behind the Q so the Q can go to f4 gathering forces on the K-side
The Q is alrea dy lost so Qg3 invites the exchange of your now useless Q for the principal piece in my attack.
Hi everyone!<n><n>GM Cyrano kindly invited me to a MT of his called Italian Coffee.  I am one of 4 players rated south of 2000 in this 11 player MT and two of those were Class A 1900+ players.  This is one of them.  I find myself in a KGA and I end up losing a piece for two pawns very early on in the game.  I managed to get a third pawn for a piece but alas, that proved to be insufficent in the endgame and Yours Truly had to take a 7 point rating hit, preventing me from getting my rating north of 1860.  How did this happen?  Well, here is the GA version of the game which you can follow.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16652944&fb=1&rnd=0.6964235451517038
10. ..... d6?? - after just 10 moves my position is lost.  I am about to drop my knight for two pawns thanks to a check which I overlooked from the Wicked Witch of the West.  The best I can do is block the check but the knight then falls to a pin on d5, ouch and double ouch!!
14. .... 0-0 - after the dust has settled, instead of toppling Henry I decided to tuck him away on the kingside out of the a4-e8 pin line.  Even though the end result proved to be a jstevens1 loss I think I made the right decision here in playing on.  At least it led to an interesting material imbalance of the three pawns for the piece, and opens up a debate on which is better - a piece or three pawns, but that happened later.
15. ..... Qg4 - counter-attack.  Now Glenda homes in on the exposed WK and puts pressure on the isolanis on g3 and e4.
16. ..... Qxe4 - now that the e4 pawn is hanging I do get my third pawn for the piece but is it enough?
21. ..... Bxe5 - after a plethora of exchanges I manage to hold onto my ecclesiastical twins and keep my pawn structure together but there is plenty of work for me to do.
28. ..... Re5 - after another plethora of exchanges I am still endeavouring to keep my pawns intact.  In retrospect I should have got in h4 asap (I would have avoided this pawn becoming backward later on) and tried to force an exchange of one of my kingside pawns for the g3 pawn.  If I had succeeded in doing that then my drawing chances would have increased tenfold.
39. ....... Kf8 - Henry tries to go over to the queenside.  Sadly, even with his healthy seafood diet he is still an old man and can only move one square at a time, so he will be very hard push to be in two places at once.
40. Bd3 - the pawn on a6 is now protected.  I must now watch out for Rb1 - b7 and the WK coming in via e4-f5 etc.  Henry cannot deal with both matters and two moves later I waved the white flag.  A chastening experience.
Here black starts to go wrong allowing me to chase the knight a couple of times with tempo.
Doubling the pawns on h-file was essential to the outcome of the game.
Here black shouldn't have taken the pawn on d6 because if 10.cxd6......11.bh5-ke2 followed by 12.kd5-ke6.....13.qg4 mate.
Black decided to take with bishop, makes no difference.
And here black resigns because if 12.ke7....13.qf7 mate. or if 12.kg8.....13.qf7 mate  or 12.kg7...qf7 mate. So here's third actual game I've played here so comments and advice on what i could have done better are welcome:) Thanks for checking the annotations out.
Good first move by Paul controls the center,the pawn is looking at the d5 square and the f5 square with keen interest.
I played 1..f5 to unsettle Paul straight away out of his comfort zone.
2...Nf6 well it looks to the e4 square and holds a watchful eye on the d5 square,and the g4 square.a knight is like a shuttle craft a little slow at getting here and there, but can be a good menace to the opponent.
If my opening knowledge serves me right i would of played 3.Be2 not the move played.3.Be2 allows some control of the g4 square,also with the support of the queen on d1 could land with a check on h5 at some point the knight on f6 takes the bishop then the queen takes back with check again.( 3.d3 is still not bad after all it opens up the diagonal for the c1 bishop and the pawn controls e4 square and the important c5 square.
4.Be2 a move behind see note previous,here the more forceful 4.g4 be brave and take the bull by the horns and come out of safe zone.+it holds on to the f4 pawn a while longer.
the pawn is reclaimed and equality achieved and with this move black up's the preasure on whites e4 square.
A good solid move by Paul looks to the e5 square and g4 square and d4 + h4 brilliant developing move which is what needs to be achieved in chess.
i could of played 5..e6 here to free my f7 bishop from where it could land on c5 hitting the f2 square supporting the d4 square for if i wanted to push d5 or drop a knight on d5putting the question to the knight on f3 and the bishop on e2.however i like 5...Nc6 a good solid developing move supports d5,e5,b4,a5 and if later i wanted to push e5 then a Friend indeed the knight would be.
And here comes the d4 move i was hinting at earlier.
Best move on the board at the moment.
I wanted to put the question to the knight here go home or fall where you stand.
Time to get my king to safety before the battle begins.
Not the best of moves here i would of played 11.Nd2 the threat to my pawn from the rook on b1 is easily parried.
A standard manoeuvre but in keeping with the position,Whites plan? perhaps when the bishop on e2 moves then attack is opened up on e5 pawn white knight on f3 and white rook on e1 rains down as the e5 pawn is only defended by my knight on c6
Time to take a hold of the weak c3 square nice looking outpost.
I think i would of played chance to the wind here with 16.Rb3-Bxb3 17.axb3-Nd4 18.Nxe5-Qf6 white at least straitens his queen side pawns out.
Now to put preasure on the f3 knight where is he going can blacks plan come to fruit?
I would of played 18.Re1 to hold on to the f2 front door, before back blows it away.
More preasure on the white knight, paul is about to crack under the preasure here.
The Pirc?  Really?  I haven't seen that since the old chessmaster 4000 used to kick my ass with it.  Black aims for a KID-type setup, but often denies white the big queenside associated with it.
!?  An unusual move order.  I like it because it can transpose to the King's Gambit declined if black plays e5 here (or even back to the King's Gambit Accepted), which can be fun, but it moreover immediately challenges black's decision to play the Pirc, declaring an intent to pawn-storm the kingside.  That, and it invites transposition to the austrian attack (main line) of the Pirc as well.
Setting up a big pawn center.  This is what black wants white to do.  But it's also what I want to do.  If I can get my pieces developed with a big center, a lot of space, and can deprive black of those things, why wouldn't I?
Yeah, he's going to play Bg7 and Nf6, and this is a good, aggressive square for the knight.
Over-defending d4 and developing the bishop to a good, solid square.  At this point, it looks like playing Bd3, either Nc3 (not c4 and then Nc3) with an eventual queenside castle will give me excellent attacking chances on his kingside.  c6 committed him to castling there, and I'm prepared to go right after his king!<n><n>By the way, the game DB has never seen this opening before!
Nice and simple development.  I thought about plunging in with e5 right away, but after dxe5, dxe5 allows the exchange of queens, killing white's advantage, and fxe5 allows Nd5, giving black activity and freedom.<n><n>This just reinforces white's already dominating center.
A nasty pin.  But the bishop doesn't have much hope right now, and will probably be exchanged for my Nf3 soon.  So I'm not going to concern myself with it, yet.
Better than c4 followed by Nc3.  Why? Because white is going to attack black on the kingside, and is quite clearly aiming for a queenside castle.  Why weaken the queenside pawns if I don't have to, and why waste a move playing c4 when I could be furthering my own ends?<n><n>But I thought about Nd2 as well; I wound up choosing this because of the coverage of the d5 square and the d1 square, which may become important after I play 0-0-0.
And this is why having a plan helps -- it may not be the greatest plan ever -- but my moves are now working together towards achieving some goal.  As I get closer, new goals appear.  (It's kind of like life that way.)<n><n>Now I see that black has to either exchange, developing my queen strongly to f3, or run back to d7 (everything else is awful).
Hey!  Look at that; we are back in the game DB, apparently this is an uncommon line in the Pirc, Austrian Attack with 6. Bd3.  And this is a great setup for me; I'm really happy with how this has turned out.<n><n>I have the two bishops, I have a monster center, I have the beginnings of a kingside pawn storm, and once I play 0-0-0, my development will be completed.  Black is playing catch-up the rest of the way.
Ready for anything, now.  The Rd1 opposite the Qd8 actually has me looking forward to black's e5.
This allows the Rd1 to gain some more scope, but the real reason is that the f-pawn is too useful in storming the kingside to exchange it here.
Naturally.  But now what for me?  Sure, moving the bishop will cause him to move his queen, but he wants to play Qc7 anyway.  What I really want to do is pawn-storm the king, but what to do about the threat on the f4 pawn?
Well, apparently, I'm going to ignore it.  g4 is a move that has its advantages, but basically commits white to having three pawn islands if black plays exf4.
?!  It's hard to argue with this move too much, but white is controlling the entire flow of the game now, and black needs to do something to reduce white's edge; I prefer exf4 here.
This is much stronger with g4 behind it; white's pawns are going to roll up the black kingside if he's not careful.
Counterplay on the opposite side of the board is an excellent idea.  But I will not be distracted, especially since black's pieces are out of position to support this push (and if b4, Ne2 or even Nb1 is fine).
I had thought about fxg6 here, but this really cramps black on the kingside, and tempos the knight, AND forces it to a bad square (h5).
looking to make a very strong play down the h-file eventually.  I also considered f6, but I'm in no rush; it's better for me if black plays gxf6 first.
Undoing black's fianchetto.
Some think the spectre of Nc5 is my reason for this move; in reality, I want to attack the h5 square.  The game has been pretty straightforward for me so far.
?!  Maybe my only inefficient move of the game.  I didn't know what was going to come on the queenside, but this move seemed like it was better protection for the king, plus it stops black from knight-checking the king on e2 or d3 (the knights are 2 moves away from those squares).
...and I say hello.  Hello, HELLO!  And now there seems to be a lot of kingside pressure again, while black must address the threat to the Nh5.
?!  If ever there was a time for b4, this was it!  Why, because it forces white to play the awkward Na4 or else face something like 19. ...b4 20. Bxh5 bxc3 21. Bg4 cxb2, with good counterattacking chances.
Preparing to strike back in the center.
Now, I'm not exactly sure how good this is.  Black's pawn structure was the only thing keeping white's attack at bay.  But allowing hxg6 forces black to either respond hxg6, having to respond to mate threats down the h-file, or fxg6, where the f7 square begs for a pawn fork.  This will work out okay only if black can neutralize white's kingside attack or start his own quick counterattack, which he's unable to do.
Black correctly assesses that Nxh5 followed by Rxh5 gives white too strong of an attack down the h-file.  This move also threatens Nc4, coming after the queen.
!  The bishop belongs on f5, and I need to give it the freedom to get there.  The queen belongs in tandem with the rook on the h-file, so I know not to move the rook.  The knight would do better on e3 than c3, though, so I prepare to get it there.
And if I can get the queen to h6, there's a mate threat on g7 also!  The plan is Qf2-h4-h6-g7#.
To defend the threat coming on h7.  The only other option was to try running with the king.  Nxe2 fails to 26. Qh2 Nf8 27. Qh6 with mate on g7 to follow.
Nxe2 loses immediately to Qh6; this is black's attempt to flee with the king.
The only way to defend the dual threat of Qg7# and Qxh7# is with his knight tandem on f8 and e6.  How to crack it open?
Bg4!  Where the bishop should have gone when I played Be2 back five moves ago.  Bg4-f5-h7 will bring down the house, if I can make it happen.  Black looks pretty helpless here.
!  Clever!  Black forces white to delay Bf5 in light of the back-rank mate threat.
A perfectly sufficient way to parry the threat.  The d1 square is adequately defended now.  Note how Kc1 would have allowed Qd2 , giving black some chances.
The threat on h7 is now overwhelming.  If another wasteful move like 30...a4, 31. Bxh7  followed by either 31...Nxh7 32. Qxh7  Kf8 33. Qh8# or 31...Kh8 32. B-anywhere  Nh7 33. Qxh7# (or 32...Kg8 33. Qh8#).  Black is busted, and has no defense to mate.  He decides to make me sac my queen to get it.
7. ....... b5 - now Freddy starts the standard Naijdorf pawn storm on the queenside.
9....... b4 - now it is Freddy's turn to attack a knight on c3!
10. Nce2 - as there is a pawn on e6 going to d5 is not an option here.
12. Rd1 - white piles up on the backward d pawn.  He eschews castling long.  I think he wants to keep his king in the middle for some reason.  It is safe - at least for now.
12. ...... a4 - maybe this is why he decided not to castle long.  The horsie on b3 must retreat again, so Master Albertwall ensures that it has a reasonable square to retreat to.  It must be noted that in Freddy's other game with Albertwall, he put a knight on c1 with the intent to move it to d3 at a convenient moment.
14. Ng3 - this move gives the knight possibilities of hanging out on h5 or f5 should the knight on f6 should move, or if black's lsb moves off the c8-h3 diagonal.  At the moment white will not want to compromise his pawn structure if he does move that knight to those squares.
16. gxf5 - that horsie did move to f5.  Freddy trades bishop for knight but busts up his opponent's pawn structure as compensation.  Freddy must be wary of the open g file, however, because there is a possibility of white putting his heavies on that file and it could be a little dodgy for Freddy if he chooses to castle on the kingside.
17. ......... 0-0-0 - a brave decision from Freddy.  He castles into an open position.  His king is looking very draughty, do you all agree?   I will talk about the second portent of the purpose of castling, it brings a rook to the centre and this rook ensures that Freddy will win back his pawn.  He has got rid of the weak d6 pawn, which, when I have been on the receiving end of a Sicilian Defence have often snaffled it up when playing with people near my own rating bracket.  The knight on c6 cannot be taken as white will drop his queen for rook and knight and the doubleton c pawn will be rounded up and this exchange will be unfavourable to white.  The pawn on d5 is therefore pinned.
19. ...... 0-0 white castles kingside onto an open g file.  As black cannot put any heavies on that file the white king seems safe on g1.
22. Rxf2 - bishop trade.  What can Freddy now do about his b pawn though?  He cannot play bxa3 because his queen is hanging on a4.
24. axb4 - this queen trade results in Freddy losing a pawn.  To compensate there is a doubleton on the queenside and white has two isolanis on the kingside.
31. ...... Nf5 - this move is about to precipitate some exchanges though, thanks to a discovery on Freddy's other knight on d5.
33. Rxd5 - now another black pawn drops off.
35. Kf2 - this move allows an interesting minor piece trade.  The trade results in a trippleton on the b file.
Blocking off the Bishop attack to the weak f7 square.
I Should've thrusted my d pawn to d5 but my instincts otld me not to
My knight is being pin ned down and i may lose my vauluable knight
Trying to fend off this bishop
At the moment it looks like he is going to castle on the queenside. Also creates a outpost for the bishop if i ever try to trap it
Ok now i really think he's going to castle on the queenside
Nothing to do. Waiting for him to castle. IF i was to castle He would castle on the oppposite side and he already has a strong attack on my kingside. He could sack ( Or howeer you spell it) his bishop on h6 and then he could push his pawns forwrds with the 2 rooks at the back providing support.
I moved back because i saw his bishop on E3. I thought i would lose a rook if he tried to counter
I spot the free pawn and go for it
Why doesn't he exchange  the knight for bishop
Prepring for the skewer
Reinforcing the c pawn and also meaning trapping his bishop
This is an error I win a piece at least. I capture the paw then push my a pawn
I am a big fan of Petrov.  If you open against me with e4, expect to go there.
I like bishop/knight pins against a king to see if I can create any pressure or "juke" my opponent into making a mistake.
exploiting the pinned knight to try for some early center advantage...
Now that White has castled, if I take this knight, I can create a little center play where I go up a pawn, at least momentarily.
Good counterplay.  This move gives White a potential post for a knight in my territory and allows him to undouble his pawns on the c file.  Top play for White.
Now that I've created a little center chaos, time to castle and then get that White knight out of my side of the board if I can.
Building some pressure to begin an attack for White.
This move was going to happen eventually anyway, as I needed some more protection for that e pawn.
This is a decent move for White.  Instincts are good on bringing pieces into the fray this aggressively.  White is threatening Bxf7+.  If Nxh5, then Qxh5 spells trouble as I can't protect both h7 and f7 at the same time.  As a result, I only have one option.  <n><n>Another play for White to consider is Bf3, as it threatens my queenside and I don't have a lot of good options to protect it quickly.
I didn't expect this move and am not certain what White is hoping to accomplish.  I would have traded knight for bishop with Nxe6 instead.  However, now that White is allowing me to get rid of one of his two power pieces on my half of the board, I must partake.  If you allow an opponent to have power pieces on your side of the board for a while, they become liabilities quickly.  Don't let them get established and drive them away or trade if it's not disadvantageous.
Looking to either trade queens or create space to make a play with the e pawn.
Rooks love open and half-open files.  When in doubt, place them there.  I also have the added benefit of being protected by my knight.
Offering a queen trade.  If not I have a good diagonal on the d3 pawn and some potential for penetration to White's back rank.
White declines the trade.  I would have considered moving to h3 instead to keep the potential for using my rooks to harass the Black queen, but keeping a protective line on the rook at d1 is a good idea too.  A key facet of higher level play is to try and have your pieces work in harmony together.  Let them mutually support and defend each other so that you don't leave pieces exposed to themselves and vulnerable to pins/attacks.
This play has some attacking potential and a chance to create openings for counterplay.  Notice that there are several disastrous ways that Black can respond here.  A lot of chess is about giving your opponent a chance to shoot themselves in the foot and create openings to exploit.  Let's see how Black responds.
Time to get a little aggressive and see how far I can drive this advantage.
Another mistake.  Either Rf1 or Re1 would have been better.  Now things are about to get ugly for White.  You don't want your opponent to have a passed pawn so close to promoting.  Not having an escape route for your king also causes some of this trouble, due to potential for a back-door mate.  White will be constricted in their choices because they will leave themselves open to mate otherwise.
Before I started the game I checked my opponent's repertoire and saw that he uses the Nimzo-indian as a defence to 1. d4 and the Sicilian as a response to 1. e4. I'm still working my way around finding a good line against the Nimzo so I chose to take battle in more familiar territory.
As expected, my opponent went with the Najdorf. It's endorsed by just about everyone that plays the Sicilian but for some reason it's not as popular anymore in GM practice. Much more popular are the Ruy Lopez, especially the Berlin wall line, and the Petroff, which I dread myself.
A rather rare sideline but it does have a few points to it. I actually play it myself on occasion. The purpose of this idea is to save a move in normal lines, namely Be7. It can lead to quite a few sharp lines but it can be positional as well. Kasparov used this line on a number of occasions. Trying to play Nbd7, preserving the pawn structure, allows White to play Bc4, so it's generally accepted that this is the more exact move.
This move tries to take advantage of Qc7 and weaken the pawn chain. As an extra bonus the Bg5 can travel back the diagonal if needed. The drawback is that e5 is now in Black's hands.
Black decides he doesn't want a compromised pawn structure and is ready to castle. There is another point behind Qc7, that being that Nc6 can be played, which in normal lines would be met with Nxc6 followed by e5.
10...Nxd4 11. Rxd4 and I will get some pressure on Black's d-pawn after Be2 and Rhd1. 10...Ne5 is met very comfortably by Qg3.
A typical move that makes sure there won't be any tactical resources against my King. In these types of positions it's also a good waiting move. For example, in many positions it's better to capture on c6 only after the Bc8 has moved to d7 because capturing with the b-pawn will be weaker then.
This pattern of developing pieces, including the pawn structure and the piece placement is seen in many lines and is very elastic since many plans are available to Black.
Releasing the central pressure in order to focus the pieces on a K-side attack. It's very interesting the developing the Bishop to d7 makes the capture with the b-pawn less desirable.
After 12...bxc6 White can quickly get an attack going, for example 13. g4 Rab8 14. Bc1 (having this square free for a Bishop retreat is another bonus of playing an early Kb1. Now b2 is secure and Black's counterplay is delayed) d5 (hitting in the centre in reply to a flank attack) 15. g5 Nxe4 16. Nxe4 dxe4 17. Qxe4 c5 (with the idea of Bc6) 18. f6! (and White gets a powerful initiative)
Defending e4. With the Knights on the board this move wouldn't have been possible and the more passive Be2 would have to been played.
Taking with the Knight is weaker because of the pin.
The double threat on e6 and h7 recovers the pawn.
Removing the dangerous White Bishop.
Here I looked at a few lines and decided that this was the most promising one, keeping the Queens on the board and playing this simplified middlegame where my Knight will be very strong on d5. After 17. Nxe4 Bf4 18. Qxe6+ Qf7 19. Qxf7+ Rxf7 20. Nxd6 Bxd6 21. Rxd6 Rf2 22. g3 Re8, Black can easily hold this endgame.
This was the position I was aiming for. Material wise, things are even, but I think I have a solid positional edge. My pawn structure is very good, I have a good blockade point on d5, Black's King can come under a form of attack if Queens are on the board, plus the d6 pawn is weak. Black's trumps are his Bishop which has a lot of open space to roam but nothing to bite at, his command of the f-file and the central spot e5 for his Bishop.
Centralizing the Knight. If things get bad, I can always blunt out the Bishop with c3. You can't say the same about a Knight as there isn't really a way you can blunt out a Knight.
Carrying on with the piece placement plan.
Overprotecting the Knight and preparing to contest the f-file.
Here I intended of playing h4-h5 and g4 and if Black would allow it, putting a Knight on f5, which would a true dream square in this position. Of course such a plan can only work with the Queens on the board otherwise the pawn would be pretty weak in the endgame.
Putting Black's K-side under pressure. It's not easy to find a defensive plan against the threat of advancing the pawns. Anything creates weak points that my Knight, combined with a Rook and Queen can quickly create a strong attack.
So it's understandable that my opponent wanted to exchange material in order to tone down my initiative.
This really surprised me. I saw that the pure piece endgame is better for because despite the open position and the relative advantage of the Bishop over Knight, Black's pawn structure doesn't compensate it.
Black is forced to exchange Queens because of the discovered Knight check, winning the Qb7.
A quiet move. Black's Bishop is blunted and my King can come into play. Trying to win a pawn outright with Nc7 would have given Black good drawing chances. For example 28. Nc7 d5 29. Nxa6 Bd6 30. c3 Kf6 31. Kc2 Kg5 32. Kd3 Kxh5 33. Kxd5 Bf4 34. Kd4 Kg4 35. Nc5 Kg4 36. c4 bxc4 37. Ne6 g5 38. a4 Bd2 39. Kxc4 Kxg2 and Black is still hanging on. Lines like this show the dangers of pressing to hard and trying to win at once in the endgame. Don't rush if you can wait is a basic rule of the endgame. There is not point in compromising your position if you don't see a clear win. Just play solid moves and wait.
There is a saying in chess and it's very true, the threat is more dangerous than the execution. I'm sure you've seen many GM games where they would delay executing a basic recapture almost to the point it wasn't possible anymore. This is done for a good reason. If you have a threat and your opponent can't do anything about it, don't rush. Taunt him. It's very infuriating and difficult to play from a psychological point of view. You're expecting your opponent to execute his threat but he doesn't. You begin to wonder why he doesn't. Maybe you calculate everything again, believing you have compensation. You can't find any. Then you look at the move he just made. It doesn't threaten anything. So you decide to remove the threat, seeing as your opponent has given you an unexpected breather. Then you make the fatal blunder and see what it was that your opponent was really threatening.
Such is the case here. My opponent wanted to get rid of the Nc7 threat and decided that he can only defend the pawns by pushing them. But that turns out to be a serious mistake for a very simple reason. The pawns are now fixed and easy to be munched by the Knight. Also, by advancing his pawns he's helping me create a distant passed pawn much sooner than I would have expected.
Black decides to at least activate his King at the cost of that pawn.
Notice how the Knight and pawns cover everything and there isn't anything for Black to do. He just has to wait and hope I stumble.
A common defence in simplified endings where you're material down is to exchange pawns, hopefully to the point where there is only one left and you can sacrifice a piece for it, thus securing a theoretical draw.
Denying my King access to d4 and opening more diagonals for his Bishop to move on.
Making life very easy for me. I think it was Philidor, much before Capablanca tha stated that in Bishop endings, it's wise to place your pawns on the opposite colour of your Bishop and on the same colour of your opponent's Bishop. Beginners usually do the exact opposite thing. They fear that the Bishop will capture their pawns and move them to the wrong colour and they want their Bishop to defend their own pawns so they give themselves a bad Bishop.
Time to put the steed to work.
If Black doesn't capture, I can play b5 and then the a-pawn will be an extra weakness in the already full plateau Black has at his disposal.
Defending b4 and clearing d4 for the King.
Black has to go back and cover d4 with the Bishop.
Tying the Black King to the defence of the d-pawn.
Aiming for Nd4 followed by a5. The correct plan in advancing the pawns against a Bishop is to advance them on the same colour squares as the Bishop so that he cannot blockade them adequately.
One last diversion. Ne3 is threatened and Black can't defend the d-pawn properly.
Creating a runner on the edge of the board. In case of 46...Kb6 then 47. Nxd5+ with a very simple win.
Going for b6 to stop the a-pawn.
But it's one move to slow. This Knight move makes the Black Bishop look ridiculous since there isn't anything he can do to stop the a-pawn from Queening. My opponent finally resigned here. A nice tour-de-force by the White Knight against the Black Bishop.
32. Qc7 ! Black Resigns,<n>but after:<n>32...           Ke8<n>33.Qd7     Kf8<n>And 34. Qd8# Checkmate.<n><n>32...        Kf6<n>33. Qf7# Checkmate.<n><n>And if:<n>32...     Kf8<n>33. Qd8# Checkmate.<n><n>Nice isnt it?<n>Hehehe <n>Im open for any challenge :)<n>Cya
This move does not seem very consistent with white's attacking setup. c3 seems the move to go, and black must go with Be7.
After a very long series of very logical moves, black has to make a fundamental choice. An interesting plan would be to start a kingside attack with g5 and trading the white's black bishop. Black decides to go for the trading of white's white bishop, which seems inferior, since the white bishop seems to be neutralized in this variant.
It is not clear why white would like to change the black-square bishops for a double pawn.
The arising endgame is good for black, so maybe was not the right time to trade queens.
Actually it is more important to protect the e6 pawn to play f6, so Bd7 woulda have been better.
But black misses it! After 24. ... f6 25. Re2 e5 26. Nf3 Bc6 black dominates the d-file, has an intact pawn structure, and a strong bishop.
Too early. White has no counterplay at the moment, so black can use some time in playing b5-Rh7. If white want to occupy the e-file again, black can play f6-e5
At this point black loses the thread: 41. ... Kc6 is losing (according to SF5 Mate in 31) since black cannot play e5 and make an own free pawn. The game would still have been draw after 41. e5 42. fxe5 Kxe5 43. c4 f5 44. cxb5 Kd6 and now neither of the kings can support the own free pawn.
Now is white's turn to lose the thread. White seems not notice that the threat of making a free pawn with c4 is winning and try to capture black's kingside pawns.
Now the game is still drawn. If black move the f pawn, it loses the g pawn and the game. So white must only have threaten the g pawn...
... but white decides to go with the king to g8 to keep the f-pawn under control.
This is again a blunder. Consulting nalimov tablebase shows that all resulting pawn endgames are draw. The winning line was:<n>47. ... f5!! 48. c4 (if Kg7, now e5 can be played since one of the f or e pawn is fast enough) bxc4!! (e5 draws since the resulting free pawn is too late) 49. b5 c3 50. b6 Kd7 and wins.
The final mistake in the endgame is done by white. 53. Kd5 would have drawn since after c4, if black does not capture, white can promote the c-pawn with check, and then chase the black king until queen are exchanged and then win by capturing the b-pawn.
A common move. A quick move to control the center and get some tempo.
Developing a piece and defending a pawn.
My goal for the game was to start an attack first. Sadly my plan collapsed later on in the game.
My opponent was not expecting d5, so my opponent thought for a long time to make this move. The point was to refute my pawn push by making one of his own and attacking a bishop.
I saw the chance of a risky game from this point and wanted to attack as much as I could.
I wanted to attack a lot, so I started my onslaught on f2. This also attacks e5, a pawn that I could not capture to start.
I was very frustrated while playing the game because I couldn't get a decent attack! He escapes the knight and threatens to play Nxe4.
If Rxf1, then Nxf7 is winning.
Now that I think about it, I might have wanted to take the pawn on e5. Still, I did not like the idea of giving my opponent a tempo with Nxe4 with my king in the center and my queen's bishop undeveloped. I decided to continue on f2.
I played this as a "sacrifice." I offered Bf3 to pin my knight to my rook only for an attack. Also, my threat of e3 is now available because there can be a discovered check now with a pawn a square away from promotion.
Stable. Pins the knight and rook and stops Nxd1. Do I really care about rooks, though?
I bring my other knight into the fray. If my opponent plays Bxa8, then 15. ...e2 16. Re1 and either knight to d3 depending on if you want to be safe or not.
I need to trade before my pieces are lost!
If Nxh7+, then Kg6, Rxe8, Rxe8, and the knight is trapped.
Bishops prove better in end-games where there are pawns on both sides of the board. It's either I lose my bishop or I fail to protect from superior knight placement.
He touched the rook and was moving between d5 and d3. He chose d3 to go for the a4 pawn.
If Rxa4, then Nxc5 and the game is closer to a draw.
I wanted to trade or lock the pawns with a chance of Rg3 eventually.
I wanted to go closer to the passed pawns. I thought my rook could handle the rest.
His plan was Ke3.
If Ra1, then g7, h1=Q, Rxh1, Rxh1, g8=Q and I am lost.
now .. black has a space disadvantage
This was to prepare e5 when white may play d5 and black Knight returns to<n>b8 in the style of Kings Indian ?
preventing the obvious ..d5 which would fork two pieces but I am not convinced .. white may have been better not to close in his white bishop (maybe Nb1 to d2)
here white is thinking of playing Knight to C5 ..again I was stumped as to what to play (normal moves seemed to devalue my position) .. in the end I came up with an idea !
played this as I thought I might be able to secure a knight on d4 and block<n>the white rook if needed to do so.
black needs to take action and disrupt whites pawns ?
again to stop f4
stopping pawn and protecting c5 ..if bxc then I can take back with rook and perhaps double rooks on C-file
looks grim for my black squared Bishop
Interesting move ! This is probably good sometimes, I used to play moves like this myself, however I can't help but think that the Bishop is badly placed (is it better on b1-h7 diagonal or h1-a8)
This is to secure e6 square - the rook an the queen prevent e6 and blck needs to play f6
note if black King was still on f7 then white now plays Be8  and wins the black queen
To avoid the Ruy Lopez, which she always seemed to win quickly with against me. This time it didn't help.
If I play N-QB3, I was worried she'd exchange and rip open my Q-side.
Oh, boy. If I play Q-K1, my K and Q are in the perfect positions to be forked at some point by one of her Knights. So...
I hate having my King exposed, but I'm hoping against hope I can find a way to stop the King-hunt.
12... Ne4 13.Qa3 bxc6 may lead to some problems for Black due to the inferior pawn structure. Anand prefers to maintain the symmetry.
14... bxc6 15.Bd6 would lead to obvious difference in the Bishop activity. The pawn sacrifice offered by Black involves no risk, as the piece activity and the opposite colored Bishops level the chances
Black has full compensation due to his active Rooks and a variety of possible plans. Anand decides to prevent b2-b4 before anything else. A kingside expansion by f7-f6 or Bishop transfer via 'e2' comes to mind as follow up. Or just Rc2.
The only reasonable attempt to try for some advantage in this position.
There was nothing wrong with 22... Rc2 planning doubling the Rooks on the 2nd rank and if 23.d5 e5 leaving the 'e4' pawn vulnerable.
Else e6-e5 was possible with mass exchanges resulting in a dead draw.
To pin the knight. I'm looking to get my pawn to e5 and win the knight, with or without the fork.
And white doesn't let me do it. And now I'm thinking that after castling, I may find a good discovered attack for my knight at f6 that might allow me to win white's bishop on b2. Not really "hope chess" though I do hope white will allow it - more like creating a veiled threat.
I pretty much had to take the bishop on e2. If black tried 12. ... Nxd4, 13. Pxd4 threatens the black queen, and after black saves her, 14. Bxg4 leaves white up a pawn.
I would like to play Nb4 and, if needed, Rc8 to beat up on that backward pawn on c2. But white can shrug that off easily enough so I put it on a back burner for now and think defensively. My bishop on g7 needs support if I am ever going to open the long diagonal by moving my knight.
I was expecting the knight to retreat, and then I would take over the open d-file with my rooks.
Crisis! White surprised me with the queen move. I pretty much had to trade queens, as the white queen threatens both of my knights, and I have no move that saves them both. Obviously, after white recaptures, that knight will be forking two undefended pawns. I squirmed quite a bit here before committing to trading queens (if I had to lose a pawn, I would want my queen around - no need exchanging queens when I'm behind in matrial, or about to fall behind). Then I found the way out.
Now if 18. Nxe4? Nxe4. So white could try 18. Bxf6 Bxf6, 19. Nxe4? Bxa1 and white gains the pawn but loses the exchange.
White found a clever trick, threatening my undefended knight with his rook, which also gets his rook off of a1 so he can freely win the pawn on e4 now. But I had anticipated this move. Now I am forking the pawn on a2 and the empty d3 square - which is a fork of the two rooks.
I am still threatening a2 and d3, but my bishop is hanging. I move it to safety. White now must chose whether to lose the a2 pawn or lose the exchange.
White sees the mate, but chooses a very wrong way to prevent it. It leaves a backward pawn on e3 and a defenseless knight on e4, and I know just the way to attack them both.
And now I am a pawn ahead. Liquidation time - which is easier to say than to do, in this position. However, the pawn at b3 is hanging and cannot be saved. If 29. Nc8? Re8  wins the knight. Oh, and I'm very conscious of the threat of Nd7 which, fortunately, white cannot reach for several moves.
Hmmm, I might have outsmarted myself. I'm not really sure trading two pawns for that night was the best way to liquidate. Now the position looks fairly drawish. I'm up by a full piece, but K B vs. K is a draw, so I have to use my material advantage to win a pawn, and there's precious few of them left, and they're well positioned.
I'm thinking liquidate the rooks, if white will oblige, then liquidate the knights if at all possible, then eventually find a way to sacrifice my extra piece to eliminate a white pawn in such a way that my 3 vs. 2 pawn ending will be favorable. I expect white to avoid this eventuality.
White proved me wrong, and it proved to be his undoing. Here I was expecting a long difficult endgame threatening to draw if I'm not careful, and maybe even draw if I am careful. Then white commits a game-ending blunder with 35. h4??. Now after 36. Nxa8, black plays 36. ... Nd5! leaving white's knight trapped in the corner with no moves. White can try to dislodge black's knight with his king, starting with 37. Kf3, but 37. ... f5! blocks white's king's route and gives the black king time to support the knight. Then maneuver the black bishop to d8 and hunt the white knight with the black king, and black will be up by two pieces instead of one. Apparently black foresaw this too (one move too late) and resigned.
?!  This positional error lead to a collapse on the queenside.
The knight can head to d-5, but it should take a role in defending the queenside.
?  Loses a crucial tempo and the game.
The pin will win a bishop.
I've tried the obvious b6, in order to fiachetto the lsb. But white players are normally well aware of it and manage to have it blinded by my own d5, which has to be played in most lines.
Probably there are alternate moves, but this seems to me almos forced for black, if not now, at some point.
This is MY favourite asset with white pieces (but for the B)... and I use to win with it!
Uh, oh! My opponent is playing seriously. My "normal developement" Nc6, carelessly played, probably costed me a strong attack on the kingside!
The best way to control f5 (Ne7 I wouldn't dare without solid knowledge). Anyway, as white I would have played g4 at once (now that I can).
I don't like to move this B, since after dxc4 it has to move again. But I was a little scared. Now I think that cxd had to be played, and the N exchanged in order to counterattack him, instead of this "normal developement" move.
I plan to pawnstorm on the Qside, if white doesn't attack soon. Again, cxd would have been better, but let's say that is not a bad thing to keep it for whenever I want. True is that now W playing 8. dxc, Bxc4, 9. b4 had won tempo, but hey: white's e3 is hanging! Of course, I won't, ever, castle here: it's asking for troubles! Bd7 instead supports the b5 advance in another way: I'll have to take out of the way Nc6, probably with Na7 or Na5... I'm at a loss, in a board completely different from the ones I normally play.
I'm a pawn under, but white has no more advantage that the good B, which can be managed by me in two easy moves. If white does not creates interferences with his Q. I have nothing on h4+, and if I want to recover the pawn I'll have to play aggresively. The white Q is too dangerous, for example on g4, to be allowed.
Aaaahhhh.... relax! Now, castling is not my priority, either. It is to neutralize the B on the diagonal.
I was now on a dilemma. Bxf6 isolates a pawn and activates some play against the black diagonal pointing to Ra1. But, at the same time, I felt that this pressure won't go anywhere, because of white will get a scope for his dsb. So I preferred to keep white closed in, and play with with the semi-opened resulting g column. My best result will be to play the e pawn without allowing f5 in response. I need to be patient.
Now, to free the way for my lsb I have to play, very counterintuitively, f5, defend it with my R and play e5. If I go e5 now, white will reply with f5 and my lsb will languish, being his best to be exchanged.
...but didn't I just said...? Yes. But now the situation has changed. Now I can use the g column to make pressure on white.
Not a good move. But I have to avoid further checks and take advantage of his misplaced lsb.
This "must" be wrong, I sensed. Then I asked myself why. Then I found the answer. And played...
The exchange is assured, because white has a mate net, and he has only ONE move to save his K, which is Kf2. (well, no: he had 20. Be1 (...Bc5+, 21. Kd2 forced and black has nothing better than BxR - and I doubt I would have played it, since Bd4 by white would have sealed the draw) and ... b4! was the other one, but black would have won the exchange and maybe more).
No, my dear, not this one. This is the worst of all. And I started the game so "scared", and then I was just about offer a draw... instead of this, I had some tactic vision to apply to a very nice position.
Nh2, it is better to have a weak plan than to have no plan. Here I wanted to launch an attack through the king side.
Ne2 with plans to maneuver it to the king side.
This sets up white for the kingside attack.
Black has layed havoc to the white queenside, white continues to set up the mate.
Black has allowed greed to take over and neglected kingside defense.
The bishop capture will not save black.
And now the French attack variant.
This move is designed to stake a claim to the center and post my knight to be a constant thorn in white's side.  An early priority should be to dislodge my knight or attack the d5 pawn, all while developing your own pieces.
Castling is a good idea here as it frees up the rook to play as well.
This move was designed to give my knight and the d5 pawn some staying power.  I anticipated that his c pawn of remaining knight will come into play soon.
And there it is.  This is a great move as it puts pressure on my d pawn but also allows his knight to develop as well, to bring on the heat.  There are a lot of good possibilities here for white.
Time to castle in case I need to bring my rook into the game.
This was perhaps not my strongest play, but I wanted to put some pressure on white's knight and see what shook loose.  I also didn't want to give white the chance to shift another pawn to his center, giving him a stronger center advantage.  My d pawn is weak and isolated, but if it is, I'd rather his was too.<n><n>If white takes Nxd5, Bxh2+ regains parity.
I prefer this move to Qc7 as it continues development, but also puts some added pressure on his d pawn, and maybe something good can happen.  So far white is playing superb.
I believe that this exchange is a bit premature, as you need to have pieces in order to mount an effective attack, however, it does break up my queenside pawns and they are now isolated, so in and of itself, that's not a bad thing.  Pawns are more valuable when they are connected, and isolated they are weak.
This move is great, but it is potentially dangerous if you don't follow through, as I will show in a few moves.  White wants to relieve pressure on his knight and allow his queen to move freely.  This is good, but if you want to take that step, follow through and either protect your newly moved pieces and/or move your knight on to the g5 square for an attack on black's king.  Dangling pieces (protected by only air) can lead to very bad things if you're not careful.  Where possible it is always better to move pieces to a place where they are protected and/or have some support from a secondary piece.  A better move sequence, instead of 13 Bxc6 would have been 13. Qd3, forcing me to 13... h6.
Here is a little gambit ploy I try, to see if I can coax white into a big mistake, but he doesn't bite.  Moves like this in blitz chess can be damning if you fall into the trap.<n><n>A better move here is to take a rook to an open file (thanks kingcruel).
This move appears natural and one that will make me either trade pieces with his knight or shoo away.  I chose the latter.<n><n>A better approach here is to target my king with something like Ng5.
This move is actually a good one that I didn't appreciate that much in game.  I thought that white was giving away his pawn for free, as his queen cannot take or risk capture, but doubling up my bishops with his potential for a rook/queen combo able to come online and it can be dangerous for me.
I was holding my breath, hoping that he would take with 17 Qxd5.  He didn't make that move, but this one is not so good either.  It does connect his rooks, which is always a plus in development, but it doesn't add much attack value with where he placed it.   More damning, however, it will also cost him his knight for free.  If he re-takes, very bad things happen.<n><n>The better move here for white would have been to put the knight on g5 followed up by Rd1, breaking my chance to exchange with the knight and earning a bishop for the pawn I took on d5. (thanks kingcruel)
And very bad things are about to happen.  Here is the biggest learning point of the annotation.  If you go all the way back to move 14, I said that you don't leave pieces supported only by air.  If you do they can become a liability.  Here, after retaking with his g pawn, because his queen isn't supported, it will now be exchanged for a bishop.  You have to be cognizant of a bishop's potential check, because it can hurt if you aren't paying attention.
d3 to push the knight...He's trying to be typical...
The oponent tried to develop his pieces and took my knight...
d5! i think was a nice movement to do...
I decide to accept the queen's gambit to get ahead. I do like to capture to do so, so then I can look for exchanges.
Moving to the Linares variation. I could force the king out of his initial position if my opponent captures: 4. dxc5 Qxd1+ 5. Kxd1 e6, then attempt to win back a pawn, or even 4. d5 e6 5. dxe6 Qxd1+ 6. Kxd1 Bxe6, or even get a queen exchange 4. Bxc4 Qxd4 5. Qxd4 cxd4 to be a pawn up.
I think this was a reasonable exchange for me: I'm a pawn up, the queens are off the board, but my extra pawn is quite well advanced and unsupported, despite it being passed. So it will need some cover, especially that the c-file is now open...
...as the knight comes out to attack it. Alternatively, I could attack his pawn, as I am behind on development, as the pieces could come at me...
...so I bring out a knight to attack his pawn. I have pulled back on development, and I am attacking another pawn. If the pawn advances to 7. e5, I could play 7... Ned7 or Ng4 to attack it; should he play 8. Nxd4, I play 8... Nxe5 to regain the advantage.
...but he declines to do either, developing another knight, to cover from its twin. There's now no chance of me capturing the pawn, as the knight is now defending it...
...so I now bring out my other knight to defend my own pawn. I have two developed pieces, he has three. However, I'm not too worried, as 8. e5 could be met by 8... Nd7 to have double control of the e5 square, and a potential fork.
He hoping to fianchetto his bishop here, which would place my pawn under attack, so I must cover it...
...but my king's pawn won't stay guarded for too much longer, as the bishop has pinned my knight down. So I must find another way to defend my pawn from the knight on f3...
...and that's bring my free knight back. Both knights control the e5 square, so my king's pawn is well defended, and could also be defended by my kingside bishop's pawn by playing f6, which would give a chain...
...and as predicted, he fianchettos his bishop, but my pawns are too well defended. However, I have another idea...
...and that's to pin his own knight down. Because I am ahead by virtue of having an extra pawn, I can go in for exchanges...
...and I do just that, swapping my bishop for his knight. His rook was the piece which completed the exchange, because he didn't want to lose any tempo...
...and I get the opposite exchange, this time, my knight for his bishop. OK, I've now isolated my rook's pawn on the queenside, but it is currently defended by my rook, and by my bishop, but I am ahead on material, even if it is only a pawn, and the light squares are now slightly safer.
This move prevented me from castling kingside, but castling is not such an issue with queens off the board (why is it so?) However, I have another potential plan...
...and to put it into action, I fianchetto my own bishop. I'm hoping to capture the pawn on e4, to potentially create a second passed pawn, which I would get if I capture his kingside bishop's pawn, as long as the knight's pawn didn't capture on the f-file...
...and my king's pawn is in trouble again, and I had to think carefully as to how to defend it...
...and that was to create my chain: g7-f6-e5-d4, where the g7-pawn is the most vulnerable.
I now clear the path for my bishop to attack the e4-pawn, and to defend my d4 one with a second pawn...
...but now there's no chance of me capturing his pawn, now that the rook is defending it...
...so I advance my king forwards to attack the bishop, and to connect my rooks.
I may have lost a pawn from this exchange, but the rook is on the same file as the king...
...so I pin the rook to the file, as both of mine are connected on the bottom rank, and the c8 square is also covered by my bishop...
...and I get the first rook exchange, and check at the same time, which is why I used my other rook to complete the exchange.
And now I advance my rook to the 6th rank, hoping that he'll panic and play Rc1, so I can win back the pawn. There's not a lot my rook can do there, as I would need to play Bc6 then Bb5 unless he plays a4...
...but he sure gave up the exchange here! Yet another opponent gives up an exchange, as his pawn is now exposed to my bishop...
...and I win back the pawn, after exchanging rooks. Again I have a bishop and an extra pawn for a knight, and I felt I was favourite here: I control g8, f8, e8, a8, h7, g7, e7, b7, h6, g6, f6, e6, c6, f5, d5, b5, f4, d3 and c3, he controls h4, c4, a4, h3, g3, b3, h2, d2, b2, g1, e1 and d1, while we contest g5, e5, d4, f3, e3, c2 and b1.
He moves his knight to defend its pawn, so I cannot capture it. Instead, I must move my king to keep his own as far back as possible...
...so I advance mine forwards to help out my bishop. We contest the f3, d3, g2 and c2 squares with our pieces...
...and as the king relinquishes control of the b1 square, trying to stop my own king...
...I can attack his queenside rook's pawn, and force it to move...
...which it does, forcing the knight's pawn to lose some protection.
My king can now close in on the queenside pawns, and threaten to create a passed rook's pawn on a6...
...and as the knight moves in to cut off the bishop...
...I can trade the pieces, leaving a pawn endgame, with me a pawn up. I control h6, g6, f6, g5, e5, d5, c5, e4 and d4, he controls a4, h3, g3, f3, d3, b3, d2, b2, d1, c1 and b1, we contest b5, c4, e3 and c3. My king is better placed, so I can restrain the enemy quite easily.
I now close in on his queenside pawns...
...so I now advance my queenside rook's pawn to wast a move, as I am inviting the kingside pawns to come at mine...
...and I now decide to shorten the chain, to contest my 4th rank...
...and I move my bishop's pawn to contest the g4 and e4 squares, and to help my king's pawn...
...and we again trade pawns, giving me a powerful hold on the 6rd rank: the only squares on that rank I don't control are h3 and g3, so the king would have to go the long way round to eliminate my pawn on h7...
...and I can now eliminate his queenside knight's pawn, and I can now go for a queen on e1 or d1...
...and I now advance my e-pawn forwards, hoping to get a queen on e1...
...and my king can now ensure it is possible. My opponent resigned here as 41. Ke1 e2 42. Kf2 Kd2 43. any e1=Q or 41. Kc1 e2 42. Kb1/b2 e1=Q, and I could go in for four queens to really rub it in.
take with the queen which can move to h5 and further attack f7
want to move to d5 and disrupt his queenside pawn structure
removed his protection on f7,HAVE U SPOTTED IT NOW
he wakes up to this new attack
I thought if I could get the d pawn on d5, that would be a strong center.
Protecting the pawn to try and keep some center control
My bishop announces "Here I am!"
Further central loss. I don't want to push my pawns forward too much further, lest he get behind them.
Didn't want to trade my bishop for a knight. It looked like an open game and I think the bishop more valuable.
I can't remember exactly when it happened, but I am fairly disappointed in my performance and this point.
I decide to trade rather than give up ground.
I decide to fianchetto to see if I can make 42 moves. I also noticed black's queenside rook just sitting there.
Wait, I thought that was a defensive knight.i thought he would try to fork my king & rook, but I had the queen in place.
Containing the fianchetto plan and in case he moves center, I'll trade.
Hiding the white queen behind all the pawns. Hoping to get an opportunity to develop the other knight soon. Queen has moved three times already, knight not at all... not good.
I like the fianchetto, because sometimes people forget about the bishop and later in the game the rook capture is a surprise. So much for the surprise. In this move, black takes that surprise away and pressures b2 requiring a response. In fact, since I initially moved the queen black has driven the moves I make.
Take away the "rook surprise"
Now he has the bishops pointed through the center and the pawns are holding as well. Black is so focused on the middle now, I wonder if I can go around it all.
I push the a pawn to perhaps weaken the central pawns and then attack them, but I did think if it failed I run the risk of opening up the queen side for an attack <n><n>(***spoiler alert***) Which is exactly what happened!
Didn't think this was a problem because of my rook, if only I would have gone one step further in analysis.
Even through the black pawn structure in the center is weaker, the bishops are still staring down from across the board. Not sure what to do about them.
Following through on my plan to weaken and attack the center.
Had planned on trying to line up the rooks and queen, but it was truly desperation.
I was just recently reading about the strength of bishop pairs, so not really thrilled that black has two and I only have one.
Another blunder, I might have made it to 42 if not for this move.
And so the king is on the run.
...unable to act on it though.
defiende el peon de e5. to defend the pawn in e5
with the knight morphy close the diagonal e1 - b4. and the black queen can not check.
My opponent choose not to play by the books.
I'm going for g5 square whit my knight, if my opponent choose to block it with h6, I have possibility to play my knight to f4.
Here i gained material back, and place my LB to a very dangerous position.
It is time to take the White lady to action.
? I think my opponent try to isolate my LB, but he gave me a chance to support him whit my e pawn.
Dangerous position for me, because my LB is now pinned to white King. But not so dangerous, if he take my pawn whit his knight, white lady will come even more closer to black King, and his knight is lost for a pawn.
Nice, I don't have to worry about my pawn on d5 anymore :)
Time to unpin my bishop, and bring my rook into action...
Handing me the bishop
?? this was a bad move on my part. Better would be 12...b5 with another gambit <n>(cxb...axb; Nxb...Ba6) Then I would attack on a & b files withe my two rooks, then play Nd7 opening up the long diagonal for my dark square bishop. Attacking in the Benko gambit fashion
I was prepared to exchange pieces now. I believe my opponent did not see the reason behind Qd7 back up by the bishop. The Zig Zag motion by my bishop saved me from defeat. Yes white can capture the h pawn but it is bait! Once we exchange pieces we'll have opposite color bishop's
!! This is one of the reason why I play Kxf7 earlier, as to let my rook maneuver about here and fro
The king is toiling and struggling
The King's Gambit, and Miller is an honorable person: it must be accepted!
In some variations of the Bishop's Gambit, White is prepared to move his King to KB1. Both sides must worry about an attack centered on KB7.
The lightning-bolt strikes.
The King-hunt is on in earnest.
Taking advantage of the momentary lull to attack the B. But the lull was just the calm in the eye of the hurricane.
I've always played at my best with e4. In serious play, I've yet to deviate from this. His preferred opening with White was a variation normally seen in Queen's Gambit Declined, where White plays d4, supports with e3, and then after playing c4, would push for c5 and immediately support with b4. I rarely encounter these games when Black, and I found it a bit difficult to play accurately with my camp so cramped up from the Queenside. I would pull through from the opening frequently, I'd even take an advantage for a good bit of time, but I got blindsided enough for him to come back and win the overall game both times.
d6. So we have ourselves a fan of the Philidor's Defense. I openly herald this opening as a passive opening for Black, as it immediately does White the favor of trapping the bishop on f8. It's rather easy, I find as White, to grab hold of the center almost right away and launch early attacks, as Bb4 is not a problem to worry about most of the match. However, he handles this defense well when in a Blitz match, and I'll show you how this happens.
Main line for White. Philidor himself, when he invented this opening, believes that the opening is best played for Black to now attempt f5, with a counter-threat on e4 and a nice diagonal on the light bishop. Opening theorists have ultimately decided that should White play carefully, however, none of these lines result in equal positions, but rather an advantage for White as the color ultimately gets the first attack.
But, this is my opponent's twist on the opening. f6, blocking the knight. Black welcomes White to try to seize the light squares, while Black tries to capitalize on his own patience and the dark squares.
Black normally exchanges the pawn on d4, but I know that there will be a bishop on g4 eventually, and I'd rather my position be ready for the inevitable exchange about to head my way. Also, Nbd2 is a much stronger move now, a move we tried in one of our earlier games, but didn't quite get to this time around.
This was new for him, eyeing the f5 square, and bringing some fight to d5 as well.
White could exchange, but with all of Black's developed pieces on dark squares, the weakness on e6 is something that he will have to deal with for much of the match. With such a strong outpost, Black must defend very carefully.
Black plays this, a surprisingly strong pawn while never quite making the overall intention of the move clear. If White takes the pawn, it's simply replaced by the b7 pawn, or either knight could grab it as well. I'd rather keep the outposts my pawn offers me, so...
...I respond with this, forfeiting whatever power a minor piece on b5 could grant me, in exchange for my control of e6. White's plan here is immediately clear and obvious, though.
Black's, on the other hand, was not. If Black played c5 at once, then the outposting done against my dark bishop would have been much more obvious, and the idea to then capture en passant could have been far more justified on my end. Even so, with an extra pawn move spent, Black sacrifices tempo for discrepancy, forcing me to respond in a way that makes me question the tactical or strategic motivations behind his movements. The idea here still is not quite yet done, either...
So, ultimately, the move 5 ...c6 provokes White into playing c4, strengthening this check, where I have to carefully consider where I want my pieces to go while he starts to exploit the dark squares he can pin on my queenside. Overall, I still like my position here, but the amount of counterplay Black has here is not to be taken lightly either.
Still, the greatest solution to this move here would probably involve me moving my bishop again to c3, which I really didn't want to waste time by doing. Black's moves seem rather predictable for now, but I'm not fully sure if I was playing the best way for White to have dealt with this line.
This move finally appears, developing a virtually useless bishop given my pieces occupy mostly the light squares. Black hardly has much other use for it at this time.
I play this, though I'm still not overly too sure about how I want my kingside to look once I've castled. I couldn't make up my mind between me wanting the knight on h4, or to just force the exchange by pushing h3. I was searching for the exact combination of moves, but...
...this threw a wrench into my thinking. I see Black gaining power with a knight on f4, while stopping my own Nh4. I didn't want to sacrifice my dark bishop should Black play ...Nf4 either, because I figured I had a better space advantage. Therefore, my dark bishop was stronger than his light bishop, which he was likely going to exchange in a moment.
So I decide to weaken my light squares, daring Black to play ...Bh3, while preventing the Knight from grabbing those dark squares.
Looking back, I think I told myself that e4 was potentially in danger of an f5 push, and I wanted my pieces in place to defend such an idea after Black castles. A sound idea, but perhaps too soon...
Black captures the knight, something I knew was going to happen eventually, and something I didn't mind having to retaliate using the queen.
I did forget about how my Queen was busy defending two squares at once, and the unfortunate placement of my light bishop costed me a pawn.
But even though I'm down for material, White has four very active pieces, whereas Black really only has his queen and knight. Dropping that pawn wasn't going to be the end of the world, because I was pretty sure I was ahead in development. I was working my way toward having about 7 and a half minutes at this point, so I was pretty comfortable with where I was.
The queen must retreat again, allowing me more tempo at the cost of my pawn.
I finally take the chance to castle. I still wasn't too sure how I wanted to attack yet.
Whereas Black has a very clear target in mind: f5. It's a bit bizarre, because even though Philidor's defense isn't exactly among the list of Black's most successful defenses, here my opponent found himself having a very clear reach of the key square the former GM prided himself in regard to this opening. I may be ahead in development, but for me to use that development to form some sort of attack, I needed an idea on how to clear the air on Black's side of the board. And right now, that meant going on the defensive.
Right here I decided that grabbing the extra pawn movement was probably going to help me out. It also prevents Black's a5, creating an outpost on b4 for a Queen or Rook to invade upon.
This was probably best for Black. Qc7 has a lot of blockage before h2 is reached on my side, but at least the Queen over here gives the bishop more power. However, Black has now moved the Queen five times, just to return her to her original position.
I continue to develop, still looking for a way to push ahead.
Her sixth move, but the threats along this diagonal are serious and need to be addressed at once.
This move made me cringe a little, putting the pawn directly in the path where the Black Queen could stare down my king. Even still, my position to me looked rather safe, for now, because the pawn is secure with all my efforts to control f5, but the player treading dangerously is definitely White at this point.
Black took a few moments before playing this move. I imagine he also was wondering where h5 would have brought him, but decided against it. Interestingly enough, looking at the line, I'm quite worried about ...h5, gxh5 Nh4, Qg3 f5. The e4 pawn is immediately threatened, and my Queen cannot defend f5 from h3 prior to that move because Black's Queen controlled that square. Nor can I take the knight, because after f5, the bishop guards h4, so I'd now need to debate how to deal with the rook on f8 coming into combat. It's a bit unclear (perhaps Bg5 would help me, trading off the bishops by then?), and while I think this move is okay, I'm left wondering where that alternative line could have taken us.
A few moves prior to this one, I did tell myself that the queen would have been stronger on h3, attacking the knight while defending from f5, but at this point I just reacted after seeing the knight go here, knowing the Queen would need to come off of f3. I was a bit upset at just blundering away some tempo like that.
But here, Black chooses to defend the knight, and maybe with the added idea that my bishop can't reach h6 anymore? I'm not too sure if the only purpose of this move was to protect the knight or not.
Either way, I was happy to get the chance to place my queen on the correct square again. Now Black can't push his way into my camp once more.
I think he took some moments to think here as well. If I were Black, I think I'd consider asserting control over the f-file even more by playing Rf7, stacking the rooks down the column before White can do so himself, but I guess he decided he wanted to bring his queenside pieces into the game a bit more, eyeing Nb4 to kick the bishop, or even Nc7 to work the knight into the kingside via c7-e8-g7. I kinda feel like Black has a bit of an edge here now, but he wasn't too sure how to begin chiseling away at my development yet either.
I can't let my bishop lose sights on e4-f5, so I retreat it while I can.
Next, he plays this. I think he was hoping to bait me. If I capture, then after axb6 axb6, his rook is protected, but mine is exposed after he moves the knight somewhere else. I'm forced to either move it and lose more tempo, or exchange, and Black's other rook recaptures onto an open file.
I'm not going to waste time and accelerate Black's attack. Instead, I see that my knight can help drive into the fray via e2-g3-f5, potentially kicking the bishop or disrupting the King's defences on h6. Plus, I need not worry about the bishop on b1 needing a defender, as long as my other rook stays on the first rank.
I think here he decides that if I'm not going to capture, that he might as well take advantage of bxa5 with a rook on the mostly open b file. However, in doing so...
...in moving the Rook, the threats in capturing vanish completely. Without the rook on a8, the Knight doesn't allow any kind of discovered attack that could cause me too much discomfort.
Black isn't threatening anything on the Queenside anymore, so I resume my plan to put my knight on the outpost on f5.
Black tries this, his timer was thinning down to about 3:00 left on the clock at this point, I believe. Still, I think I find this move inferior, as all it does is kick a bishop that isn't really doing anything. Better for Black could have been Rfb8, I think, as it forces me to reconsider the place of the far more important b1 Bishop. This just wastes Black's time.
Now the Rook must retreat. I did also have 25. Bxg5, equalizing material after ...fxg5, Rxa6. At the time, I didn't see it, but even if I did, I'm not all that convinced that opening the f-file would be in my best interests. An alternative line I can see continuing this is ...Rb4, Bd3 Rb3, Rd1 Rb2, Nf5. But the thing is, White's Knight is now stuck being a defensive, though rather well guarded piece. But now my f2 pawn becomes horridly weak, and even though it's not immediately clear to me how Black could have exploited this (perhaps by stacking the rooks?) I think I'm right in not wanting to give the Black rook pair a new possible way of entering the game, and that the closing of the f-file is worth being down a pawn.
Finally, my plan completes and my Knight assumes a completely offensive position from this square. I have several options, and I'm starting to like my position again.
Black's knight, on the other hand, wasn't really doing anything on there anymore, and decides to trade off his bad knight for my good knight. I'm not sure if this was necessarily a thing to have to beat me to doing- say Black plays Rfb8 now, and White plays Nxh4, next comes gxh4, Qxh4 f5! Qh5 fxg4, and again I'm a pawn down, only now the only blockage on the kingside is Black's protected g4 pawn and my Queen is stranded without much way of getting her the help she needs.
But now, I dominate control over f5, and now Black's light squares around the King are dismal, without virtually any chance of fighting out of this now. My g4 pawn also strengthens as a result, no longer needing my queen confined to reach of it with the f5 pawn in the way. Having realized this, I started seeing ways of being able to move my pieces around to start focusing on working my way around Black's structure to make my way toward the king. My real only weakness here is f2 and c4, but if I'm careful, there are ways of bringing about a hopeful attack. Starting with the obvious- kicking my rook from a3 to h3 somehow.
My opponent began rapidly realizing he needed a new way to crash through my defenses, but at too much a cost to his clock. Hanging steadily around 2 minutes left, he begins maneuvering this bishop, and while it's not immediately clear his intentions, I was relieved by the passivity of this move. It was a sign that he needed to give me breathing room, for once.
I remember being a bit unhappy about this being the second time the Queen came here, but regardless, the Queen needs to move off so that the h pawn can move forward.
Meanwhile, Black moves the knight here, either hoping I'd exchange, hoping that there's a place for his pawn, or the rook, or he's waiting to see what I'm up to next.
Meanwhile, the h pawn comes out. My Queen can now take h2, controlling the h file while being able to spearhead an attack after a rook joins her on h3. My clock here is about 9:30 right now. Time looked rather well for me, it was certainly on my side, but the battle to pierce through against Black is still far from over.
My opponent had about 2:15 when he started here. Once he finally came up with this move, his clock fell down to about 0:40. He really needed to think about what other ground Black could advance upon to prevent White from coming in, and right now, I could tell he was really grasping at the best way to maintain his defenses while winning the overall game. Here, it looked like he was trying to figure out how to counterthreat me if I took the pawn on g5. Black's Queen could come around on b7 and help the Rook on b6, while the other Rook could find a home on g7, reaching g4, and wholly guarding h7. Black's defenses are rather solid- unfortunately, his clock was certainly against him more than anything else!
I don't think my Queen has any business being on the 3rd rank anymore, so I move her where a Rook can come in front of her. I'm not in any hurry to resolve the pawn situation just yet.
But Black is. He eagerly grabs the pawn and wonders what I'm going to do about it.
The bishop had to move off so that the Rook could come over to h3, but from there, what to do about the bishops? Originally my thought was to pair them between a1-b1, but I noticed that this would be potentially dangerous due to b1 being weak if Black were to stack rooks down the b file. So I move the bishop here, a new diagonal where it could move a bit more easily, but more importantly- a diagonal that could strike h6.
Meanwhile, Black hits the pawn here, forcing me to defend g4 once again.
So I'm forced to capture the pawn I was happy to ignore. I'm desperately grasping at how to go about getting my rook to h3 without my Queen having to be in front of it, wasting moves just to protect the g4 pawn.
The knight retreats. I'm worrying at first, because I see Nc7-Ne8 again, but with the strong Black Rook occupying g7, I'm not entirely sure how hazardous this piece was actually going to be.
Meanwhile, I don't want to tie my other rook down on the back rank, so I move my other bishop to here, removing any chance of pushing e4 by Black, and defending b1 directly.
The knight continues its journey and I anxiously watch what Black is trying to get out of it.
I continue trying to move my other Rook somewhere it can help in the game. Kg2-Rh1 doesn't work because the g4 pawn is still pinned to the king and my Queen still leads the charge.
Meanwhile, Black kicks the bishop again for no real reason.
I move the bishop here. I guess I told myself I wasn't too concerned if Black tried making a makeshift pin with Rb1 at the time, but looking at this again, I can see how such a move would have caused me grief, even if I were to try a move like f3 right afterwards.
But I'm shortsighted, and I completely miss the other rook move. Whoops. In hindsight, this blunder actually drove me to lose a lot of my other pieces and to a pin, so I really wish I saw the other rook move when I had the chance to.
So I drop another pawn again, and the Bishop on c1 comes under fire anyway.
Or, they were. Black is able to exploit the pin on g4 now, even at the cost of his rook.
White can't capture the Queen, the Rook is threatened to move, h5 is viable, and my pawn structure is falling apart. My next choices are going to be difficult ones. Black, meanwhile, has been able to take advantage of these mistakes. His clock has improved to about 2:00 now, and mine here was about 6:30 and falling.
After quite a bit of time, I finally decide to give up the Rook-Queen team on the h file.
So the Queen eagerly grabs the pawn, and my rook is attacked once again.
I can't move the other rook, or else I'll lose g4 to Black, with check.
I break the pin, and if Black takes, I have the opportunity to reverse back onto the Black King, should Black play a bit carelessly. I'm not seeing any better alternative lines for White here.
Black retreats the bishop, preventing Qxf6.
Meanwhile, I thought Black had a discovered check with ...f5, threatening capturing the rook while hitting the Queen with the bishop. So I move the Rook down to here, hitting the queen. Naturally, because it's Blitz, I completely overlooked the fact that if Black had done this, Queen takes Bishop is check, and the Bishop had no defenders. Gosh, do I ever hate Blitz sometimes :D
I move my rook here, wanting to to find another way to coordinate my pieces, but I completely overlooked Black's next... and rather obvious... next move.
Horrid. No other word for this. Two skewered rooks, and neither piece is really defensible by this. Just, horrid. I had to take three minutes to see any kind of hopeful counter-attack, because I knew that any decision I make after this next one was only going to be difficult choices from here.
It was a tough choice, but I decide to try to counter-threat the only reason the Bishop was sitting on d8 in the first place. I brace to lose a major piece, but Black has a different idea in mind.
I suppose, like when I hesitated in taking back the pawn, Black wanted to use this edge on the board to start moving his pieces toward my king, because even with the rather staggering advantage, there was a gap he still had to close.
I'm still bracing to lose that Rook on c3 at this point.
Instead, he plays this, a staggering blunder. Again, to be fair, he has a rather short clock to deal with. I've taken probably most of my excess time, down to about 3 minutes at this point, and he was alive only due to the bonus 15 seconds per move. But in playing this move to close the gap on my king, he allowed me just about the only chance I was going to get to counter-attack on the Black King, to go all out on one final stand to rescue myself from this game.
Bh6, Rf3, Rf1. Between all three of them, I felt this one gave me the greatest chances of escaping the most positions resulting in check. With Rf3, I was worried that a rook capture would be check, and with Bh6, I wasn't too entirely confident that the resulting checks after ...Rf7, Qg5+ Kh8 with the bishop on h6 would rescue me from the Queen and Bishop screaming down my King and Rooks. Looking at the Bh6 line now, it looks a little more promising, but I didn't have much time to entertain what would be my final big think for my only chance to turn the game around.
Anyway, his clock declined to under a minute again, and sees he's forced to move the rook here.
And the Rook blocks, and I see that Black's King is extremely confined to the corner now... which was fantastic, but my queen is on such a terrible diagonal that trying to fix her position basically means I lose the momentum to attack!
So after another 30 seconds to think over my counterplay, I decide to put all my eggs into one basket in one final push toward the king... even if it means losing the queen!
Even though I knew it was temporary, seeing (-11) on that scoreboard was also cringe-inducing for me to have to look at while this game wore on.
Black tries to exploit the position further, but his queen cannot lose control of f7.
I'm still able to force the Queen to move to a square where she either can't check the King very easily, or where she can no longer defend the Black King from a rook on f7.
So he plays this. Probably the better idea, but Qd5 would have been stronger (if I blunder by moving the wrong Rook, Black has a mating attack with Qh1).
But I'm not falling for that! I move here, confining the Black King still, and allowing my bishop to help with the attack. I was pretty sure that this was mating by this point.
The bishop invades, and Black is finished.
Even though the move is strong enough to lead to a mate anyway.
Forced, but White must fight off the urge to capture...!!!
The final move that traps the King, and the Queen can't capture either Rook, either.
And here it is, a smothered Mate, with White being down the equal of two minor pieces! I really barely managed to pull the win out of this one, and I was sure I was had after that skewer on c3 and e1. This truly was a fight to the bitter end, a game I should not have won after some of the mistakes I had made. It was an interesting set of games none the less, and it should remind all players that no matter how down you are in material, the chance to come back and save the game could appear at any moment! I had made a great friend for blitzing, at least, and I had loads of fun with these games. Thanks for reading this annotation!
I was lucky enough to have white again. This game is an excellent partner to the previous game. In that, I gave up bishop for knight to gain and pawn, and then I prevented him from play the freeing c6-c5 and kept the position closed, so that my knight was far better than his bishop. This game is the reverse. He gives up bishop for knight, and the open position favours my bishop over his knight.
He threatens cxd4 with a discovered attack on my bishop.
Played partly to try and stop the freeing e6-e5.
So now he can take on e5.
He continues to mobilize.
My plan is to build up on the king-side. As such I don't want the exchange pieces, so I avoid rook exchanges on the c file. I plan to prevent him infiltrating on the c file by playing Bb5-d3 and then my bishops cover the infiltration squares.
Blunting the effect of my Bb2 bishop, but making his e6 pawn weaker.
I threaten e6 and prevent exchanges on the c file.
So the king has to come this way.
Bishop runs.
He gives more protection to his knight.
Threatening his knight again, and now his bishop no longer protects it
I was very tempted to take the knight off here, with Bd4xb6, but then I thought "If I move my other bishop, he can't move his knight without losing his a7 pawn, and he can't move his a7 pawn without losing the knight. So, if he does nothing, I just wander over to the queen-side with my king, using the black squares and eventually take twice on b6."
He decides to lose the bishop rather than the knight.
I just have to be careful, I need to mobilize my king without losing anything to a knight fork!
The king finally advances to the centre of the battlefield.
Knight temporarily prevents my king getting to e6, but his knight is not secure on this square.
His knight almost looks like it is trying to solve the ancient task of visiting every square on the board!
I try to restrict its movements.
Knight returns to e5.
Black has virtually run out of moves now. next move I am going to play my Bb6 to either d4 or d8 and then win the f pawn, so black resigned.<n><n>Many thanks for reading my annotation. Please leave a comment or two. Did I miss any better moves anywhere? I wouldn't be too surprised! Please rate the annotation on the start system, so that I know how I am getting on. Until next time dear reader!
this actually blunders and traps my bishop but i relized it after wards so i started thinking about after the bishop is gone ill make him pay for taking it.
forcing someone to block
after the queen blocked i was planning on f4 but the knight was a nice insight
the rook can wait
a rook for a rook and a bishop, hmmm must i even think?
gotta tango with this knight some to get in the right place.
the rook can wait
keeps the pressure and continues the plan
you can have the pawn, i also notice th attack on my queen by i see that he will not get the move to take her as i am about to enforce mate.
yah i get to do a silcian
i did not anyone to go to b5
he pins his own knight, and now i can attack his bishop
he pushes my knight bac to square 1
i cannot stop ra8 which would spell mate i resigned here. for after ra8 my queen has to interpose the cehck and he checks with his knight on e7 and i have to unguard my queen the rook takes(either one) and its mate.

...my king moves behind his pawn to give it a clear run. 41. Re7+ would be followed by 41... Re4, so the rook cannot get back in time to prevent a promotion, and can also offer to exchange rooks: 42. Rxe4+ Kxe4 43. any e1=Q.
...my king's pawn makes it to the 8th rank, and queens, instantly checking my opponent's king...
...and as he moves to attack my rook...
...my queen moves across to help it...
...there's no escaping my rook, as it finishes the job for a queen and rook checkmate.
And I take
Black has to do something about the White threat to take on c6 and then play e5.
I, and probably most Sicilian players, prefer to meet this, rather than the sharper variations where White castles queen side and Black on the king side and both sides throw forward their pawns against the respective kings.
Now this move is not in any database, but it seemed quite logical to me - delay his intended e5 advance. Instead the database has 6 games with a6, one with Bd7 (white win) and one with Nxe4 (black win). The computer actually spots a tactic in this position, b5 is playable.
Played to discourage e5 - I can exchange on e5 and then dump my Knight on d5. Computer prefers a6.
This is a logical move. I think he was planning on playing his bishop back to c1, but I decided not to give him a chance. Computer prefers c3, but for reasons I explain later, I don't think c3 is a good move. I tend to think computers play tactical positions very well, but strategic positions like this, they are not so good. Any views?
And now I hit the knight.
and he retreats to the best square.
I'm not a great fan of this move. Presumably the ideas are to support d4 and to give his bishop another square on c2. The disadvanatge is that black's basic plan in this position - and most other open Sicilian positions - is to launch a minority attack with the 2 black queen side pawns against the 3 white queen side pawns, hopefully eventually weakening and winning a white pawn. c3 makes a target for black, if black can get in b4-b5 and then exchange on c3, files are opened on the queen side, white's pawns are weaker.
I don't like this move either. It avoids tactics on the g1-b6 diagonal, but in an endgame the white king is further from the centre.
I think this is a wonderful square to put the knight, and much better than taking on b3. Computer prefers Nxb3, but I am not convinced it is any better.
So he moves the c pawn to safety. Computer prefers to exchange on d6 and play Rd3.
He has to exchange to prevent the pawn on c4 going.
Computer actually prefers the recapture with the pawn, and thinks black is 1.56 ahead. This seems much easier to me, the bishops are getting into play on the queen side with a vengence! Any views dear reader?
and he has to do something about the attacked knight.
Computer actually prefers Bc6, with the idea of taking on f3, but I think it is better to play this, my bishops are so good! Any views?
I had to move my rook of course.
and this is heading for a massive square on d4, where it will attack on both sides.
And I block. He resigns now, because if he, for instance play this
and now black has several discovered checks to win. OK many thanks for reading this, please comment and rate my annotation!
We're both preparing to attack the center squares. Control of d5 seems to be the key here.
I expected a d5 move.. however, I know the fianchetto is coming. He wants to apply flank pressure on d5 and aim his LSB at my future castle.
so I need to support the under defended e pawn, and prepare for castling.
defends the d pawn, opens up the castle.
preparing to castle
this particular move was a key learning move for me. It was an error. In a subsequent game I played in an MT, I noticed my opponent made this exact move and was able to take advantage of it based on elyhim's instruction. I wish I had the comments from the chat to share here, but they were erased.
and now the queen is open.
lining my rook up against the black queen I think I'm a sharp dude... totally suffering from my chronic "knight blindness".. he has my queen if he wants it.
now she's running.. I may have been able to pick up h6, but can still threaten it from here and defend c5 at the same time.
rook and queen lined up for the kill.. not forgetting the LSB way over there on the diagonal, so I need to leave the queen in place.
black is going to do something about the queen defender.
back to defending the rear rank
trying to defend the king
So far the opening has been quite easy to play. I was expecting him to play d5 and move into the grunfeld defence at this point. Nf3 is more of a waiting move with the hopes that he plays d5. I was sort of hoping for it since it was one of the few openings that I actually had prepared for that day. However my opponent didn't play with a lot of ambition and just sort of turtled up.
Not the move I was hoping for, but a valid move. For as far as I understand the position he'll turtle up and wait for me to go on the offensive and then hope to somewhere gain an edge.
Setting up for his bishop to come to g4 and make a break via either e5 and c5 in the hopes to undermine my center.
This was the first move on which I spent more then 5 minutes, surprising my opponent. It may seem like an easy move to make, but I had to calculate potential c5 and e5 plans. I figured that I was okay with e5 being played. I'd probably respond with d5 and suddenly his bishop on g7 becomes a lot less valuable. If he played c5 then I was okay with dxc5 since  I could potentially get a stronghold for my knight on d5. Granted that's looking many many moves into the future, but still. I was also considering to put my bishop on f4 since it puts a halt to e5 ideas, but didn't find a lot of value there. The d6 pawn is rock solid. I also could have put it on e3 but felt that wasn't ambitious enough.
The idea is to chase away my bishop, but this move weakens his structure considerably and is the start of me slowly building towards a decisive attack.
Retreating the bishop and provoking him to play g5, seriously weakening his position.
Creating another diagonal for his queen and supporting an eventual b5 push. He won't play d5 since it doesn't actually accomplish a lot so I was sure that his plan was b5. I wasn't too afraid of it since him trading on c4 could create an interesting home for my light squared bishop.
Another prep move for b5. He really seeks counterplay via the queenside of the board. I still wasn't terribly concerned.
This move took me a surprising long time to make. The idea is very simple, but I had to look into the entire b5 affair.The idea is to capture the knight on f6. He loses a pawn if he recaptures with the bishop so he'll recapture with the f-pawn. It creates a nice open e-file for black, but his bishop is temporarily rather bad and the doubled pawns don't help a lot in defending his position. The open e-file can also serve as a way to get my own pieces into the attack.
The dreaded b5 move, at this point I already had an idea on how I'd handle the situation. I had about an hour and 5 minutes left on my clock ( we started from 1 hour and a half ), he had spent 3 minutes.
Preventing b4 before he gets that idea in his head. Maybe I should have castled instead, inviting b4 so I'd have a reason to play Nd1 -> Ne3, but I felt like there might be better things in the position rather then castling. Let's asses the position for a second. My control over the center is arguably better, he got doubled pawns and his pieces are still stuck on the 8th rank. On the other hand he got a nice open e-file and some questionable counterplay on the queenside. f5 is also coming after which the position becomes quite a bit more complicated and sadly all those complications are mine to calculate. I have about 55 minutes left on my clock.
Let the complications start! The difficulty of this position is that if I allow bxc4 or fxe4 I lose material. Let's say I play a hypothetical 12. h3 bxc4 13. Bxc4 fxe4 and I can't recapture with the knight because of d5! forking bishop and knight. At this point I start calculating every possible way of capturing and if I can get away somehow with leaving the position as is. The conclusion I come to is that I can't  ignore it. Now I need to make a decision on whether I capture on b5 or on f5. There's also the issue of Re8 that's coming, pinning my bishop and king.
This variation seemed the best result for White. Now there are 3 possible moves for black. axb5 which activates his rook, but makes his c6 pawn very vulnerable. cxb5 which isn't bad, but I could get a pawn on d5 and create a strong square for my knight on c6 or I could maybe get my bishop on f3, push e5. and then threaten to win material. The other option is fxe4 and it's the variation I was most worried about. fxe4 Nxe4 and with Bf5 he gets his bishop active again. That or he could play Re8 and threaten my knight. Either way my response will be the same.
Winning back the pawn, but his knight will have issues developing to a good square. and his c6 pawn is rather weak.
I am okay with him moving his bishop to f5. I have ideas after Bxf5 to play d5. If he trades cxd5 I can capture on b5 first and his doubled pawns in the center will become an easy target.
Not the response I was expecting, but it's definitely more challenging then the ideas I had in mind. I can't take axb4 since Rxa1 follows. I don't have the time to castle either because of bcx3. I start looking for ideas along the lines of 13. fxg6 bxc3 14. gxf7+ Rxf7 15. Qxc3, but came to the conclusion that his now weakened kingposition wasn't worth the knight on c3. I also had some concerns still about Re8 that can come at any moment, but it's then that I noticed that if my knight was on g3 then it'd also defend my bishop on e2 and as a result I don't need to fear Re8 since I'd have enough time to castle out of the pin.
Defending the bishop on e2 and threatening to create yet another weakness in his position with Nxf5.  At this point in time I had about half an hour left, my opponent had 1 hour and 16 minutes left. With the additional 30 minutes still nowhere in sight I became a little bit frightened, but I knew my position should be winning.
Allowing the capture on b2 since I'll have Qxb2. Either he captures my knight and ruins his pawnstructure in the process or he goes through with his plan and I'll still have a superior position due to his pieces being stuck on the 8th rank.
Capturing is more or less forced. Kh8 gets met by Nxf7 winning a pawn in the process and Kh7 gets met by Qxb2. It's the   same position, but his king is slightly more vulnerable. Note that Ng5+ after Kh7 looks promising, but doesn't lead to much. You can take on f7 and fork if he takes on h6, but with him promoting while winning your rook you'll be down in material. About 20 minutes on my clock left. My opponent gets an arrogant look on his face as if he finds it hard to believe that someone of his strength is drawing/losing to someone of mine. Especially since I'm a slow player. At this point I was a little bit sad since although I was convinced that my position was better, I wasn't sure if it was enough to force a win. Interesting to note, better was to just take Qxb2 here since he'll have to recapture gxf5 and it ruins his pawn structure completely, giving me a decent advantage.
Material is dead even again. Black might do well here to just trade off the rooks and hope he can hold a draw. Computers even suggest that black is up 0.7 after the trade of rooks for reasons that aren't completely clear to me. The position has been around equal for a long time now ( according to computers ), though it definitely didn't feel that way when I was playing. Perhaps because the position feels relatively easy to play for white.
Finally developing his knight ( I can't say much as I haven't castled yet, but still. ) I start thinking about h4 ->h5 ideas, but found that while interesting I'd like to castle sometime soon as to not risk losing to some dumb thing I overlooked.
Preparing the d5 push. The plan was easy. Either he captures and I'll get my rook on the 5th rank where I can wreak havoc in the future or he pushes and I put my knight on c6.
I was thinking of Qa2 since it makes him unable to move his f-pawn, but I was pretty sure I couldn't force anything on Qa2. The plan of Qc2 is to eventually get my rook to g3 and do some kind of sacrifice perhaps. Especially since I'd also be able to win his bishop, which is adequate compensation imo. Sacrifice on g6, get my queen on g6, his king moves to h8, I capture the bishop, he goes back to g8, I play Ng5 and it looks like it'll eventually end up in checkmate. That was the basic idea.
A good defence. Now Nxg6 fxg6 Qxg6 gets met with Qg7!. The only way to progress is to keep on adding pressure until he cracks.
Preparing Rf3 or Rg3. I wasn't 100% sure of this yet, but my opponent finally started to realise he had an hour left on his clock and started to think. I'm pretty sure I decided on Rg3 back then.
Preventing d5 and creating a rather strong knight. That being said, it does bring some trouble with it and I'm not sure if this is a blunder.
Pinning the knight. If I manage to play Bxd5 I'll win since he can't recapture with cxd5.  He can't defend with Re5 or Rb5 since I'll just capture them and retreating the knight means I play Nxg6. There's only one good move here in my opinion.
I don't want to retreat my knight to f3. so instead i opt for g3. It creates a flight square for my king in the future or g2 can become a home for my knight if it for whatever reason wants to retreat. More importantly it defends my rather strong knight. The only issue with g3 is that my rook can't get to there now, but I was planning to push my f-pawn in the future and attack that way.
My bishop wasn't as strong anymore with his king now on the dark squares so I opt to trade it in preparation of f4.
The plan is to push f5 and make his king vulnerable.
Although it seems strange it's the only way that doesn't lose material and more importantly his pawn will get on g6 undefended so it's a potential target in the future. I will also most likely get a passed pawn on either the h or f-file if it comes down to an endgame.
Cleverly pinning the queen and king. Sadly for him he doesn't have the time to take advantage of the pin.
Here my opponent resigns since after Qh7 Rxh7+ there's nothing he can do. My opponent played well considering how little time he used ( he ended up using 40 minutes of his 1.5 hours ) and the position never reached a stage where either one of us was down 1 according to computer analysis, but it makes me wonder what he could have come up with had he used more of his time. My performance wasn't as convincing as I had liked either, but it'll do. This game is the first out of 9 games that will be played. I started well, hopefully my second game has the same result.
I was only trying to play the Queen's pawn game, but Black decided to take Long Ave. and play this move resulting in the Queen's Pawn (A40), English Defence.<n>This opening gives me, playing as white, an option to double check for tricks, or develope the wrong piece and lose.
This move was an inaccurate move. It does not pin the knight and Nc6 Blocks the Bishop's entire usage. Analysis recommended 2...Nf6 (Why did analysis consider this inaccurate when anyone playing this opening plays this line)? I think we should ignore the analysis's opinion because I see both sides of the argument.
Computer analysis predicted this after Black's 3rd move was classified as a mistake. (I'm not sure that Black wanted this to happen or to play 5...Qa5).
I reboot and start another attempt to gain central control.
I'm still questioning Black's tactic for this opening, but the next two moves I play poison my position slightly. However, I'm not going to end up as mashed potatoes for Black.
I'm bewildered about the moves played in an unusual opening: Why is Black not paying attention to his winning threat and is more focused on my queenside threat? I really think I shouldn't have played moves 7 and 8.
Black's Bishop (not his knight) took my e-pawn, and now we're going to get even with each other.
After I castled, this move became a mistake due to the  surprising 13.Re1.
This move didn't seem right once I played it. I lose a tempo and forcefully lose a knight.
Flimsy Blunder loses knight by force. I wished I had played 15.Qe3. No wonder why 14.Qd3 didn't seem right at first glance! From now on, I wanted myself to play more cautiously to win, and this isn't even half of the mistakes!
I think Black thought that My Queen was a knight because he did not take my free Bishop!
Apparently, I can just play 18.Qd5. 17...Kd8 was a better alternative.
Welcome to Ridiculous Ave., where I crazily blunder (this is the wacky pattern: I blunder, Black blunders).
Long story: My Queen is stuck between two guarded knights (one is pinned to the King) and can't move unless I really wanted to lose the game entirely. Next, my savage bishop doesn't want to retreat and make-up another plan because he also is attacked 360. I abhor this Rook move and wished I played 21.Re8+ (If it's safe). Confused?
Same story here except now, even though this is a mistake, I am going to work around Black's active Queen and Rook (this is a successful plan).
The idea here was to launch a big Kingside attack, with a kingside castle followed by advancing the f pawn.
The game has now become a race on each side, with the advantage going to whoever can break down the opponent defence fastest.
I was confident that this looked better for white at this point. I had totally missed most of black's counterplay on the Queenside, but I would be interested to know if black already had the upper hand here.
With hindsight, I think fxe6 would have been better, and opening up the f file to bring the black Queen away from the defence of the b4 pawn.
Hoping to get in h5 and make a hole somewhere in the black defences.
Material is even here, but black is likely to gain the b4 pawn and has already gained a much better position. White simply cannot break down the kingside quickly enough any more.
I had completely missed the checkmate trap at this stage, and had not seen the Queen's influence on the a7-g1 diagonal.
Rf3 would be helpful both for defence and to use in any possible kingside attacks later. Nf1 may be needed to prevent black from getting all of their forces down the queenside.
As I said, I'd simply missed the checkmate. Great play by black to exploit my kingside weaknesses, and a thoroughly deserved checkmate. I think 18. f6 was my big mistake in this game.<n><n>Annotation for team benefit, apologies for any mistakes!
One of many choices I normally use in opening. All designed to maximize the particular defensive structure I choose for the game in question, while making attempts to control the center board.
(knightnothorse) Howdy! I am Trace, nice to meet you. Good idea, by the way, to do something like this.<n>--> I will go with 1...d5 to counter your opening.<n><n>(A typical opening response, and a decent one, lets see where we are headed here.)
I chose the knight because to simply advance my kings pawn to e4 is to give him away. This develops my knight, threatens his pawn, and hopefully allows me to build a good central pawn structure in later moves.
(knightnothorse)I chose my move, e6, because it protects the d5 square, and allows for development of my Kingside bishop. I am definitely one to aim for the early castle, and that is my short-term goal with this move.
And now for the pawn thrust, as it is covered by my knight. Bg5 is a nice thought, but in my mind too easily blocked with a pawn, and therefore a wasted move.<n>(knightnothorse) 3...Nf6 to develop the knight and make way for castling. This also covers the e4 and d5 squares as well. You might capture and start the trades, or just move your pawn down to e5 to threaten knight, bypassing pawn.
(knightnothorse) 4...Nfd7 will move away from your pawn's threat. I at first thought about going to Ne4, but I felt like yes, that would get it more towards the center of the board, but I feel like that move would just shove the knight out there in the open. Like you said, a bit too risky for me. I also at first thought that Nfd7 would clog up the development, perhaps suffocating the Queen side bishop, but that can be remedied in the next few moves, and it is "safer" than Ne4. If I were you, I would have my eye on 5. Nxd5, hoping then for 5...exd5 and then 6. e6 to fork my knight and pawn, and then after I move my knight, you could go for what looks to be a solid pawn move with 7. exf7  not only breaking the h7-f7 pawn wall, but also putting me in check, making me move 7...Kxf7, preventing me from castling, and bringing my king forward, and thus away from safety. Wow...I better watch it! :)<n><n> (adui) A well thought out plan for me. You are playing my side as well as I, if differently. I chose this to remedy the one flaw in your synopsis. Had I followed your route to its conclusion, that would leave my pawn unguarded at e6. While you would still be forced to brake your king side castle defense up, I would lose my pawn at that point.<n>The Nh3 move allows for a later Ng5, covering that possibility. It also opens up the possibility of taking a different approach with a 7Bg5 checking your Queen.<n>Were I you I would either play Be7 both blocking the potential Queen attack and opening up King side for Castle, or Play Nc6 to develop my other knight. I would probably do both, 5Be7, then 6 Nc6. Follow ups from there are entirely dependent on how the board develops.
(knightnothorse) Yes, I will go with the 5...Be7 to block any attacks on the queen via the d8-h4 diagonal, as well as threaten the g5 square for a possible knight move. You could then go with 6. Nf4 to threaten my e6 pawn and know that I would probably have to use my f7 pawn to recapture your knight, thus leaving a large hole in my pawn wall.
(knightnothorse) Develop the knight, and threaten d4. I had considered Bg5 to threaten the knight, but didn't think that would do much - your thoughts on this? Yeah, the knight is threatened, but I can get recaptured...?<n> (adui) Hmm, At this juncture I would likely not have done either move. Bg4 is moot for the reasons you state, and while its just my personal feeling, I will trade a knight for a bishop, but not vice versa as I seethe bishop as the more threatening piece.<n>I think were I you I would have advanced the b or c pawn to row 6, to allow development of your queen and or bishop. This knight move, while giving you the knights power out front, completely blocks the rest of your power on the back row.
(knightnothorse) 8. .. b6 to free up room for development of the bishop. I had considered 8. ...Nxd4 and getting a free pawn, but I felt as if I would be shoving him out there unprotected just to get a pawn; not worth it.<n>As for your move, castling doesn't look too bad at this point, or maybe Be3 to develop your black bishop<n>Comment: (adui) While I really should get on about Castling, this I feel is the better move. Develops my bishop and covers that pawn I so foolishly left hanging

Most common move, White can also try<n> A. 2.d4 smith morra gambit ( Black MUST be careful i recommend it!)<n> B. 2.b4 wing gambit ( not very common, i don't recommend it)<n>C. 2.c3 alapins ( Is considered quite harmless to Black)<n>D. 2.Nc3 and follow up with 3.f4, 4.Nf3 and then 5.Bc4 for the Grand Prix attack!
2. d6 is the most common but also Black can play.<n> <n> A. 2.Nc6<n> B. 2.e6
This move initiates the Najdorf's pet opening the Narjdorf variation<n> Other choices Black has instead are;<n> <n>A. 5. g6 Sicilian dragon (most popular, I don't play it much, but i recommend it)<n><n>B. 5.Nc6 Sicilian classical variation ( not the  fun Sicilian, i dont recommend)<n><n>C. 5. e6  I like to play as White because I like to use the Keres attack 6.g4<n>        ( another reason Paul Keres is my faveroute chess player.
The sharpest way to play against the Narjdorf as White.<n> Also possible are<n>  A. 6.Bc4 Bobby Fisher's move of his choice and I recommend it!<n>  B. 6. Be3  I dont  recommend because a future Ng4 will disrupt development.<n>  C. 6. Be2 I don't recommend because it is passive<n>  D. 6.  f3  Is atleast ok. follow up with 7.Be3 but it looks rather slow.
Breaks the pin and allows the King to castle King side when ever he wants to.
Preventing 8. b5 because of 9.e5! threatening the Knight and the Rook on a8,<n> also allows White to castle Queen-side and supports a future f5.
White is correct not to exchange by 9. Bxf6 Bxf6 then Black is threatening the <n> Knight and also has the advantage of the 2 bishops.
LIKE THIS!!! to tear away Blacks defenses!
!!  AN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT SACRIFICE!!! that I did not myself, see coming!<n>  If Black accepts the Bishop 13. pxb5 then 14. 0-0 ! The castling also gives a<n>  check, how funny! 14. Bf6 ( If 14. Kg8 or Kg7 Black walks straight into <n>  checkmate after 15. Qf7 mate) 15. pxf6  ( If 14. Nf6?? after 15.pxf6 White gets his piece back plus the Bishop on e7 because it is totally paralyzed!) and White<n> anyway has the better position.
Black would rather move his King now than have it move by check and then<n> immediate mate with Qf7 afterwards!
Threatens 16. Bxe5 dxe5 and then 17. Qf7 checkmate.
Now to Block the Queen from mating on f7.
Black now fells that he can accept the sacrifice and also survive but <n> Paul Keres' answer to that was "NO I DON'T THINK SO!!"
To pin the Bishop to the Black King.
To increase the pressure on the pinned Bishop.
!    So White can move his King to h2 and not have to play Rf1 to block the dam<n>       check and therefore the exchange of Rooks which would favor Black a lot.
Probably not best but I choose to develop rather than protect the pawn. Besides it is not like I cannot win the pawn back.
e5 is the only playable option I think to avoid the fork. Be7 does not really work because White can force more of Black's pieces from the center.
Weakening my king defense to make the bishop retreat
GK says this is a mistake and says Rd8 was better. I guess Black was still thinking about the threat of e5.
I was expecting a c5 response here to open the line for the bishop and extend the chain on the queens side.
At the time I felt the queen trade was necessary, but now I am not so sure.
I have a solid center, a rook on an open file, I can't complain overall. The thing is, my pieces are drifting away from the king-side, and I am not thinking of aggressive resources of my opponent at all. I think this move is already a bit unconventional. First, 10. ... a5 fit better the idea of queen-side attack. Second, Black has to think about what will happen when White will push forward the e-pawn. And I am not doing that.
This is an attempt to open the center which I consider now not likely to work.
I did not resign to the knight dominating the center. This weakens the castle: the Black should worry more about gaining some space to maneuver, before opening the lines.
The bitter truth. e6 will become a far too easy target, if the Black takes the pawn otherwise.
This unduly concedes f5. The Black must call the far-away forces to the king-side: 17. … Rbe8 18. Qh6 Qf7. The c4 pawn and the black bishop are laughable.
Black resigns. So if you're attacked, don't forget: seek space and bring the pieces to the bombed area!
Hi everyone!<n><n>For the first ten moves you could be forgiven for thinking that the player with the black pieces was the beginner here, until you look at that number against black's name and then what happened after white's 12th move.  Yup, it certainly looked as though I was heading for a real slip on the banana skin.  Thankfully I managed to turn things around.  White kicks off with d4 and I respond with the popular Nf6.
6. ........ Ned7 - trying to avoid a pawn bust up on the kingside.
9. Bxa7 - it begins to dawn on me, ouch, that a7 pawn was only defended once and attacked twice!  I got that real horrid sinking feeling once before, about 11 or 12 years ago when, helping out at a kiddies chess club I blundered my queen to a six year old beginner.  My gut feeling told me to play on and I eventually won but boy did it not take me about what seemed an eternity to compose myself!  Thankfully I lost only a pawn, so I transformed myself from Jo Pessimist to Jo Optimist!
10. ....... Bb4 - I looked very carefully at the board and slowly a seed began to germinate in the thick grey matter between my ears.  I may at least bust up his queenside pawn structure here.  Little did I know my opponent was about to give me another Christmas bonus.
12. ........ Rxa1+ - I net the EXCHANGE!  I am now one point up in material and not down.  White has only one legal move - Nd1.
13. ..... Ndf6 - I improve the placement of my d7 knight and unblock the c8-h3 diagonal for Fou Leblanc.
35. ...... Rxe2 - bishops are now traded off and I am the exchange and four pawns up, wow, and it gets better .....
42. ..... Rxc1 - only to lose it to the knight, but I am now a Rook and 3 pawns up so I have come off very well out of that deal.  My b pawn now spends the next four moves marching off to Glendadom and this time arrives safely.
46. ...... b1/Q - and to a loud fanfare the humble b2 footman becomes a drag queen but as soon as he picks up the black wand he turns into Glenda.  The white king now marches towards Valhalla.
48. ...... Qe6+ - it is now mate next move and I set up the conditional move for my rook to deliver mate.  Thankfully I only had a minute to wait.  In fact, only two days later I found myself in a position to annotate another won game which I will call Two against One so watch this space.
This was the idea, after all. No need for that pawn when you can load your bishop against K castling (future)
With the idea to support e4 and also bringing it closer to the King´s side.
All most logical, now the idea for black would be to attack on his queen´s (obviously, with that extra pawn and the whole column open) while wrestling on his king´s
White´s, on the other side is basically betting on attacking on the castling and holding both his left wing and the center (considering even maintaining the king there)
Consolidates the superiority on the queen´s side but also fixes somehow the center and opens the a1-h8 highway for white to attack.
As I said, it seems for white to have gained one time, but now B can return to his post and defend, along with Nf6 the h5 spot. Didn´t like what I had, I was stalling somehow.
With the idea to remove B in g4 using Nh2 and advancing pawns on that side.
Sticking to my plan.
Now the queen comes to the first line. Didn´t see (or at least the whole chain of movements) the next 14...b3, and as I liked my N in d3, I did not consider to defend with Nb3. I think I was wrong.
I continued with the attack. I had confidence that after ...b3 I could recover the pawn without major loss, since B in g4 is now threatened.
...but then I saw (or thought) that if 15.axb3, then Bxd2+ I was going to exchange my rooks for the queen (which is not that bad at all, considering I keep my Bb2 and the queen, and also the threat in g4 -which didn´t seem clear during the game-) and felt like not doing it.
Now again, since Bg5 is threatened, black cannot either gain the "sacrificed" pawn by bxa2.
and my pawn is back. Both BBb8 and WBh2 seem to be ill-positioned. A run for a better place will take place, but white´s rooks seem to have the upperhand on a-column, and the pair of bishops might be more efficient here if I can attack on f5.
If 18...Na6, then 19.Ra2
Closing the couln, but keeping the N diplaced from the center
with the idea of ...Nc7, but then that knight seem to be far away from the action.
I was thinking on weakening black´s by advancing onto f5, as I said, but first I have to hold g4, and that will require time.
Didn´t like it very much, since I lose a supporting pawn for f5, but it also prevents black´s ...f5
To avoid an undesired exchange
Now here comes the most interesting thing: black´s doubled pawn in f-column would not be so weak if supported by d6 and the danger in c2 persists, which may look like a gained time for black.
Now the threat is Be7. Kf8 seems to be a must here.
Giving time for white to attack on d6
Interesting sacrifice! Activates BK. In case now of 34.gxf6, white weakens his chain of pawns. I rather keep on  attacking d6, which will make Wd5 a strong pawn (and also we have to consider that d8 is a black square and can therefore be dominated by WB)
f5 cannot be defended, since 38...Ng6 follows 39.h5+ and then pawn in f6 will crown.
blocking g6 for black. Now WK has to move either to e5 or e6 to support his pawns or finish black´s on c and b
...and God knows why I did not move the king. Wasted time.
Now if I can only get my Knight to d6!
Annotating this one from black's perspective, hopefully helping the lower-rated folks on the team like me. Black plays solidly through the opening, then a few mistakes around move 12 prove costly and give white a pretty dominant time of it.
Ok, this one is listed as a mistake and the suggested optimal is h6, presumably because it preserves the DSB that is left hanging here. The line from h6 shows: <n><n>14.	Bxf6	Bxf6<n>15.	Rxf6	gxf6<n>16.	Ne4	Ne5<n>17.	c3	c5<n>18.	Nxf6	cxd4<n>19.	Kh1	Qc5<n>20.	Qf4<n><n>This line minimizes the damage, but it also assumes white makes the optimal moves, which seems like a safe assumption given the performance so far.
This is why the trade was better earlier. Now Ed gets nothing in return and white can't be stopped.
i did this to try and intimidate my opponent, to really try to make him scared
this move puzzled me it gives away a pawn even if my bishop wasn't there
relising the king couldn't stop it he tried the knight but that was doomed from the start
embarks on an unwinable race
my win. because i blundered of a rook i was up 11 points
White goes for the pawn in order to trap the rook stuck on h8.
Black traps whites bishop In order to do the same to white.
It being Monday, I assumed it was a home game, so turned up at Didcot and set about putting out tables and chairs etc.  Come 7:30pm, match time, no one else had turned up, so I checked my diary and saw the dreaded word "Away".  With quick apology to the landlady of our host club, I hastened to my car and up the A34 to Oxford.  I had 25 minutes to beat the time-out and made it with 4 minutes to spare.  My opponent had also arrived late, so I was only about 7 minutes behind on the clock...
Oh no! the dreaded c3 Sicilian.  A few years ago I got so fed up with facing this boring riposte to my favourite opening that I bought Murray Chandler's book on it.  I wish I'd studied it more effectively and done my revision more recently!  In our post-match analysis, Matt admitted that he'd taken up this opening  because "if you can't beat them, join them".  He too had used the Chandler book to learn it.
The most vigorous response but it can lead to positions not at all typical of other Sicilian lines, so I soon become uncomfortable.
A mistake according to Matt: White doesn't intend to put his WB on b5 anyway, so no need to discourage him.  Given my problems with my WB later in the game, his advice to play 6....Bg4 makes a lot of sense: much more active.   As an inveterate Najdorf player, I'm over-fond of ...a6.
and there's no need to retreat all the way to d8: d6 would have been OK.  If I'd compared my position more closely with a Scandinavian, I might have considered this option as well as ... Qa5 and ... Qd8.
After the game, Matt thought that he started to drift around here but this looks good to me.  From here on, I'm concerned about potential sacs on e6.  More direct was 10. Bg5.
Confirming Matt's diffidence around here.  I assumed it was a waiting move and he confirmed this, though it does have the purpose of preventing 13... Nb4 in response to 13. Qd3.  After the game we thought that an immediate 11. Bg5 was more direct and to the purpose.
But, funnily enough, Matt reiterated that when he had played this he felt that he was drifting into a bad position at this point.  I was already concerned about how I would complete my development.  Putting my B on d7 would cut my Q off from d4 and d5 and, potentially, if the Q went to c7, as it often does, it would cut it off from the defence of e7.  Moving the b pawn to allow the B to b7 leaves the Nc6 undefended.  If I don't get the B off the back rank soon, I'm going to have trouble connecting my rooks.  This becomes thematic in the denouement.
Nimzowitschean!  Over-defending the B and the e6 pawn prophylactically.  I resisted the temptation just to automatically push the B back, creating  weaknesses on h6 and g6.
Now I become concerned about the threat of Bc4-Bb3-Bc2 followed by Bxf6 and Qxh7 with probable mate to follow.  After-game analysis indicates that this was a chimera: after Bxf6, my e7 square is free for my K; and White's Q, if it ventures to h8, will have to retreat ignominiously under threat from the Re8.  Consequently, Matt had dismissed this possibility while I was worrying desperately about it!
but now I felt I had to force White's black squared B to make a decision.  I couldn't just wait for W to develop his attack.
played to help my WB develop while gaining a tempo on White's B, though, as I'd rightly predicted, W wanted to move the B back to c2 anyway, so I'm just helping him here.
and this was played to distract W from that plan.  If 16. axb4 Nxb4 prevents Bc2.  In my previously mentioned delusion about the attack on h7, I thought W could ignore the attack on the N  and play 16. Bc2 anyway but later analysis suggested that he was right to respond with 16. Ne4.
I'd feared this.  Now I fantasised about N or B x d4 and failed to find a satisfactory conclusion.  Subsequent analysis suggested that this would have been successful: 18.... Bxd4 19. Nxd4 Qxd4 (I'd only considered Nxd4 at the time) 20. Qxd4 Nxd4 21. Nxb7 Nxb3 looks OK.  Other lines also seem OK for Black.  I failed to see far enough and blundered.
Yuck - disconnecting my rooks and allowing the pin on the N which looks fatal
The N falls with no compensation.  I trust my opponent to be able to beat me from here, so I resign
I love the Sicilian as black and play it often.
I prefer Nc6 because I dont like to bring the queen out early and expose it to attack.
White gambits the e4 pawn to get fast development to blacks kingside.
defending the e4 pawn and developing a piece
Now white develops his bishop to a good diagonal and threatens with a knight fork
White foregoes the fork to put pressure on the black king.  The king has one forced move and cannot castle
Black blunders here by placing his Queen on the same diagonal with his king.  I still have my light squared bishop.
black tries to do some additional damage here but to no avail.
Black is going after my knight here and i gladly take the bishop
black is trying to fork my rooks here but to no avail
I moved my bishop here to protect my knight and cover the e3 forking square.
He's going to try and trap my bishop here but to no avail as you will see on the next move.
Now im looking to promote my pawns here on the queenside
Now ill get my king into the action
The king has done his job here cutting off the d5 and b5 squares mate in two.
At this moment, Black could choose to take on e4 thus entering the Rubinstein variation, but with a somewhat passive game. But if White is not cautious, Black could awaken his pawn majority (e and f) on the king side as Alexander Alekhine showed. This will be the case in this game as Black is going to transpose in this variation later.
Here Black had the opportunity of taking on f6 with his g Pawn opening the g file for his Rooks and castling queen side.
Tigran Petrosian's move vs Mecking in 1972, repeating the happy experience of another famous player Xavier Tartakower vs Sir Thomas in 1945. Both games were won by Black. For the moment, White has to deal with the opening of the center by e6-e5.
This move is new. The best move for Black should be 10...e5 and even after the exchange of Queens on f6, the ending is quite good for Black due to his advance in development.
But I did not want to exchange Queens.
Happily my opponent missed the strong 11.Qg3 and it is not easy for Black to push the e-pawn without half sacrificing it and falling into complicated and double-edged play.
It would have been better for White to castle even with the very small disadvantage here of an isolated pawn. 12.O-O exd4 13.cxd4.
Now Black has a pawn duo attacking with his pieces behind, and the White King cannot castle queen side due to the Black Queen on h6. Black is better now.
the right pawn to push, as White will not be allowed to occupy the e4 square.
Forced, 16.Qe4 Bf5, and 16.Qd2 f3 ! and the attack begins.
Trying to hit the Queen on f3 and the Pawn on g2 by a Nh4 fork
the Slav Defence. the Slav is a solid line against the queens gambit where black retains some counterattacking chances.
Nf6 would lead to a more normal position, black is trying to hold on to the extra pawn but this cannot be done
? giving white a free tempo. black already has a difficult position, the only reason the position isn't losing for black is the b4 square. black should be trying to get his dark squared bishop to b4
forcing the bishop to move again
defending the d4 pawn again so white can play Qxf3 if black decides to capture the knight.
black should probably develop his kingside and castle quickly as it is clear white is going to start attacking in the centre soon
removing the king from the centre before comencing operations in the centre
black finally takes advantage of the b4 square but this should really have been done earlier when the king was still in the centre when the bishop on b4 would cause white some problems. as it is black isn't even threatening the e4 pawn as he would have been if the king was on e1
?? loses instantly. black should try ...e5 trying to keep the centre closed
black hopes to win another minor piece for his queen, maybe Bxe7 retaining the option of castling is a better try
the only way to hold on to the extra piece.
taking the bishop loses to Qxf7  when white regains at least a piece due to the 3 loose black pieces
Strong move, black doesn't win the bishop on b6 as 17...Nxb6 18.Bxe6 reveals an attack from the queen onto the b4 bishop.
?? loses another piece, Black needed to move the dark square bishop
?! not a good square for the king, e8 looks better although it is quite unnatural to centralise the kingin this situation!
A nice tactic sacrifice... the strenght of the London attack.
I plan to develop the b1 knight to d2 anyway.
Still safe. If black exchanges, I have time to defend e5 before black can threat it another time.
The white pieces are already pointing to the black's kingside.
Black can try some kind of sac here, like c4, 16. b4, Bxb4. White threats Nxf7, KxN, g4... another interesting tactic sac. I can't bet for any of the two sacs, deeper analysis would be necessary.
I've done this one since black can attack with c4, threating c4xb3 (which is bad for me, and I cannot defend it easily) or Qb2, if I take the pawn.<n>Now, by this move, I'm setting the "trick": Nd2-c4, and he cannot take it because Nxc4, trheatening the queen and the bishop at the same time, recovering my piece and a pawn, along with a good position. <n>Bd3 was ok, apparently, and if c4, Bc2. But after Ne4, I'm giving him an "attacking" position, I didn't like it. <n>Be2 sets the threat Qg3 (for Bh6), but it is easily met, and there are a lot of ways the game can go on. <n>I hoped the trick I am building is too deep for him to see. Anyway, not a bad move as it seems to be.
This is to avoid Nh4 after Qg3.
I am already seeing the knight sac on g5.
My bishop is blocked, but this allows me to play the sac (Ng5). Black's self blocked pieces are playing in my favour, so I have time for another preparatory move.
I liked it. It is not a "perfect" sac, but it was too nice not to play it.
This simple move is definitory. Black is tied to defend the h column, and this allows me to play freely and eventually recover the piece.
At first, I thought about Bxf5 after the black's move. This is not enough to win. I was sweating, since if the sac doesn't bring me to a victory, I will be playing an idiot.
Another simple move that makes the difference. Black cannot move the knight, because it is mate in few moves. He must have returned the piece, but still with a weak position. <n>c4 gives him a breath, but without avoiding the mate threat. If black lets me take the knight, his king would have had a square to escape... but he, apparently, didn't see it.
1.e4 remaining as the all time favourite move to begin the game with, no matter are you beginner or grandmaster you are going to face this best-by-test move more than any other opening move. But back to the game, my opponent decided to go for this instead of playing 1.d4 which was his main opening move(I would have tried to go for kings indian defence if that would have happened).
This move(we should say formation f2-f3, Bc1-e3, Qd1-d2, 0-0-0 cause Rauzer started it with 6.f3) was first demonstrated by well-known player Vsevolod Rauzer. It is beginning of organised attack on the kingside with already mentioned formation.
With this move we come to position known as Yugoslav Attack(old name Rauzer Attack), white has long castle and a pawn storm in his mind on kingside. Less common replies in use here are 7...Nc6 and 7...a6(which are sometimes called anti-rauzer cause black delays castling counting on other benefits like first bringing pieces on queenside where white intends to castle).
Most common reply, "Come on, I am not afraid of your attack on king's flank". Black is going to trust on his counterplay which he can get from queenside.
Black is ready for the battle, counterblow in the center that is. So white is going to either allow it by playing 9. 0-0-0, prevent it by 9.Bc4 or be a haymaker and go for 9.g4.
Some call this a modern approach of this opening as after many games and research done with the move 9. 0-0-0 this is regarded as the best shot by white to get the advantage in game(keep in mind, that in openings you never know when old moves come into fashion again. There is surely room for new ideas in 0-0-0 variation, you just have to find them). This move is to prevent any ...d6-d5 plans while developing light-squared bishop to its most active diagonal. So what white is planning then? Long castle, h2-h4-h5, Be3-h6 if needed, launching attack against black king.
Alright, I am not going into details with other possibilities as 9...Nxd4, 9...Nd7, 9...Na5, 9...a6 or 9...a5(if this would be introduction of opening, then yes). Bishop move ...Bd7 is a flexible choice in this position, black has lot of possibilities. For example, there is knight manoeuvre possibility ...Nc6-e5-c4(without developing queen before it cause simply saving tempo).
And white continues the plan I introduced. If you want to try something else here then go for 10.Bb3 cause immediate 10.h4 Rc8 11.Bb3 Ne5 leads to transposition(unless you are planning to delay castling then maybe some difference).
I don't believe there is much anything else. 11. Nxc6 Bxc6 12.Bb3 is not recommended as it doesn't give anything and black can even sacrifice pawn for an initiative: 12...b5!? 13.Bxa7 Qa5 14.Bd4 b4 15.Bxf6 Bxf6 16.Nd5 Bxd5 17. exd5 Rc5 and chances are usually on the side of player who is having more active bishop in cases where bishops are different colour included with other pieces on board.
And continuing with manoeuvre plan aiming for c4. White has now option to go for interesting 12.Kb1 which is prophylactic king move(when I was younger we used to joke about these as "GM moves"). Other interesting possibility is to play 12. Bg5 where white wants to play e4-e5 break cause of a pin on d-file. Main continuation is 12.h4 which we shall see in the game.
Flank attack, following the spirit of this opening and starting the attack against black king.
Black weakens his castled position which should not be done if following general rules. Reason of this move is not to prevent g2-g4 advance cause it will come at some point anyway. But the reason is to delay it and make white to prepare it first. Question is: Can black achieve anything during that duration. 12...a5 is another move reducing blacks possibilities and 12...Nc4 is played here frequently.
Now this is interesting move which needs an explanation. Here has been tried 13...Nc4 but it doesn't look promising after 14. Qe2 Na5 15. Kb1 and white is happy to set attack on the kingside(1-0, Nunn - Mestel, London 1986, can be taken as example game). This rook move is unusual in Dragon but wonderful possibility in this position, prepares b7-b5 and scouts important squares on 5th rank.
Instead of going 15...hxg4, the sharpest continuation and where every move values extremely high, I decided to go for other accepted idea here which is to get a-pawn threaten bishop while it's not the only reason. Other plan is to get a-pawn to a3 and open up diagonal h8-a1 for bishop in some scenarios.
Okay, now this is some sort of novelty. Move that has been tried here instead of this is 19...b4 where black should be doing just fine. But as I mentioned earlier this move is to increase power of dark-squared bishop(and yes it does some damage around whites king) so idea to play this came quite naturally into my head in this game. How much I spent thinking the move 19...b5 as I do have some analysed lines in my old notes... well, I can still remember this like yesterday that I was simply too excited to find out where 19...a3 leads and didn't spend much time on 19...b5(I want to show you funny execution in here 19...Qc7 20.Bxe7 Re8 21.h5 Rxe7 22.hxg6 Nxg6 23.Rdg1 Nhf8 24.Nf5 Bxf5 25.exf5 Bxc3 26.fxg6 Re1+ 27.Qxe1 Rxd5 28.Qe4 Qc4 29.Qe8 fxg6 30.bxc3 g5 31.Rh8+ Kxh8 32.Qxf8+ Kh7 33.Qf7+ 1-0 and German player Hausrath was defeated in fashion by the best ranked player from Estonia nowadays, Kaido Kulaots, in wch U16 1992)
White decides to grab the material. 21.Bb3 would have been another choice and its hard to determine which one is the more accurate one between these two(hopefully someone finds the reason). Maybe 21.Bb3 would be the right choice by keeping dark-squared bishop on kingside for possibilities or that is what I have started to believe more I look this position. Problem with 21.Bxf8 seems to be that it just throws the fuel out and white can't create anything but aslong as his bishop stays on board it can be nasty for black. One example would be 21.Bb3 Re8 22.h5 g5 23.f4 b4 24.Nce2 Ng4 25.Bxg5 Nxg5 26.fxg5 Nf2 27.g6 Nxd1 28.gxf7+ Kxf7 29.Rxd1 Qg5 and now white has 30.Qxb4 otherwise it would be better for black but now it leads to whites advantage.
Now we get to the same point but white doesn't have his bishop and this doesn't look bad for black.
Now this looks weird move. The reason why I wanted to do this is that in some scenarios in chess it is not good to give opponent change to do check and develope a piece to good square same time(in here rook to g1 and check same time).
! This had to be done now. Leading to forced sequence of moves after which black has his dark-squared bishop in great position towards white king and possibilities of using his h-pawn. And when you add the fact that black wins a pawn by clearing white pawns that stand on squares e4 and f5 this is starting to look really good.
Now after seeing this position arising it makes me think would it have been any difference if white would have gone 28. axb3 keeping pawn on c2 to maybe(?) prevent ideas against his king.
This is beginning of interesting and one of my most successful endgames. There was no reason to accept draw. The truth might be that black can't win this but as so often in games with these kind of chances you might sometimes earn the prize by trying. Black has a3-pawn in nasty position preventing whites play and three passed pawns from which h-pawn should be used in order to make possibility for chances. So maybe the earlier bxa3 would have done good for white(and that f-push included with losing those pawns on center was just terrible).
? This might already lead into lost game for white cause of possibility to play 32...Qe8 and when analysed further it seems to be really good for black. 33.Rde1 Re5 34.Nc3 h4 for example is promising. So what else if not 32.Nd5... it seems that rook move 32.Rc1! would be the move that could save the game like if the game would continue 32.Rc1! h4 33.Qd3 Rc5 34.Ne4 Rxc1+ 35.Rxc1 Qe8 36.Qd5 there is good chances for draw. Maybe black has some other possibilities but 32.Rc1! must be strong move here.
Straight ...Qe8 was the right plan but this doesn't throw it away yet and black still has possibility to play queen to important e8 square. If white goes for move 33.Rge1 preventing queen from moving to e8 then it seems black can maintain advantage by playing 33...h4 34.Nc7 Qb6 35. Re8+ Kh7 36.Nd5 Qf2 37.Re2 Qg3.
Focing knight to move away from center.
This move had to be made otherwise white manages to hold. For example 40...Qb1+ 41.Qc1 Qxc1+ 42.Kxc1 just throws it away.
Not 41...Bxb2? cause white has rook and this forces white to give knight away.
45.Rh2 can be tried here as it will lead to game where black needs to play carefully if he wants to win the game. So I am going to introduce one long variation right now for that: 45.Rh2!? Bd6 46.Rh1 Be5+ 47.Ka2 Kf8 48.a4 Ke7 49.a5 Kd6 50.Ka3 Kc6 51.Ka4 d4 52.b4 d3 53.b5+ Kb7 54.Kb3 Bc7 55.a6+ Ka7 56.Rh4 f5 57.Kb2 Be5+ 58.Kb3 Ne6 59.Rxh5 Nc5+! 60.Kc4 d2 61.Rh7+ Ka8 62.Rh1 Ne4 63.Rd1 Bf4 64.b6 Nf2 65.Rb1 d1Q 66.Rrxd1 Nxd1 and black wins.
Black must push h-pawn in order to win this.
White plays his last hope to get a queen on table.
This had to be played now and not to react whites idea of promoting queen.
White is already in position which can be resigned but this good example how to win this position with black and something like this could be found from some endgame manual even(yes, I am flattering myself cause I was and still am so happy about this game.)
My friend mikey45 asked here why white doesn't trade queens. I agree, that would be the best try but black manages to stop b-pawn from promotion without losing a piece(just in time). Then it would be bishop+knight checkmate pattern.
And white resigned, showing that title players are not immortal(even against patzer like me). Black made few small inaccuracies which lost him the game: maybe trading the bishop to rook and not taking a3 pawn earlier in the game where bad choices and f3-f4-f5 push was something horribly wrong. Endgame which arose was really nice for myself to get a win out of it(feels good). Hopefully you find this game exciting aswell. I won't say it is 100% won endgame but it is clear that black is playing for win, which I did!
Same as my previous games, I preferred to return my king to its original position as I believe I can protect it better in this way. <n><n>However, id=antagonistknigh responded to this move as : <n><n>"First off with 8. ... Ke8 it shows that you are attempting to draw the game by threefold repetition (or at least that is what most people are attempting with that move.) The other thing you may be thinking is that moving your king back to this spot puts him at a more protected location than at c6, now that is a matter of how well you can set up your defenses. There are several holes like e6, e5 and f7 I can use to attack your king. So choose your defense/counterattack carefully. It is my job to prevent you from setting up the best defense and checkmate you before my initiative runs out, because the longer the game continues the better your chances are. ..."
Again, since my king is not at c6, I can play 9. ... e5 to attack the white's knight defender. The idea is to remove the defender and the attack to the knight, or at least force white to re-place his knight. I played the same way against id=antagonistknight, and he responded with 10. O-O, which seems better than 10. d3
Trying to force white to remove his knight from the strong position that it holds.
White offers his knight for exchange, which I willingly take it as the rule for white to win was "not to cash in soon". So it means black can take advantages by cashing in soon!
Now while the defender of h4 square removed, black's queen can freely start to attack.
It is clear that 17.Kh1 was better than 17.Rf2, as Rf2 pins the rook to the king.
The poor white pawn, which was released helpless in the mercy of black's nobility was betrayed by black's queen!!
Trying to be close to the king to limit its moves.
Trying to open diagonal for the DSB to attack f2 square.
White found about the attack, trying to capture the free diagonal.
Instead, black attack the defender of the bishop.
Best move in this situation, trying to block the way of black's bishop.
As white's king life depends on not to let the black bishop take the diagonal, his life depends on white bishop. On the other hand white bishop's life depends on white rook and rook's life, itself, depends on white knight, so can be said that white knight was pinned to his king. <n>By this move white tried to remove the undirected pin!
Defending the bishop and also f2 square. Now all the pressure is on f2 square so white tries to protect this square.
One more attacker brought to the game to attack f2 square.
This was the mistake, as opened the rank for my rook to cover my queen on g3 square. All the White's defenders focus on f3 square and g3 remains on the mercy of no one!<n>I think better was 24. Nd1. However, as white sacrificed his queen and also lost one of his bishops, the losing was certain.
It was simply too soon to play d5.  Instead, Nf6 prepares d5.
I actually don't intend to hold onto the pawn, and yet I intend to make him work for it.
I doubted the pawn capture was in my best interest.  Can it be soundly played?  8...b6 leads to 9.d6 forking rook and knight.
I expect 10... exd4 11. Nxd4.  I still need to castle, but he has no viable strategy to keep my king in the center.
He blockades the pawn, a good idea in isolated queen pawn positions, but it will take him a little while to attack the blockaded pawn.  Bd7 still seems like a waste of time.  The more the b7 pawn is offered, the more I feel that he wants the counterplay and time I would have to use repositioning the queen.  I think Qxb7 is perfectly playable, but I know my nature as a chess player.  I could just as easily lose my queen as gain a solid two or three points heading towards a solid endgame.
He has again offered the pawn on b7.  In addition, I can capture the pawn on e5.  Perhaps taking the relatively free material (e5) in exchange for a doubled pawn seems like a bargain, but I felt my King's safety as a higher priority.
Now this is a common tactical move in Tarrasch style positions.  The pin can be brutal and the pinned must be really careful because the knight (c3 here) can often force a doubled f pawn.  The pin undermines black claims on e4 and strongly discourages the black knight from moving.
Now there are many interesting lines to contemplate.  The highlights of the position are as follows: The a8 rook will be lost if white gets to play NxN with tempo, black's dark-squared bishop will be lost one way or another, and white seems fine in the resulting play.  14...Bxd6? 15. Nxd6 exposing the black rook to white's LS bishop.  14... Nxe4 15. d6xe7 threatening queen and rook followed by 15... Qwhatever 16. exf8=Q  Q/Rxf8 17. Bxe4.  AND the line that follows:
Threatening the queen seems hollow.  What if I accept?  Even if I lose the queen, a queen for a bishop and rook is very close to an equal exchange.  I can't say I actually worked it out.  It seemed to promise an interesting game, so I played it!
Interestingly he now has the isolated queen pawn!  I think I got all the advantage out of it though.  He had to avoid letting the d pawn take e pawn because the knight is still pinned.
I considered Bxa8, but I decided to let him decide which rook to keep.  After considering, he resigned.  Oddly enough letting the central rook be captured is most correct because he can recapture restoring it.
The gameknot database describes this as Benko's opening. It;s a slightly unusual one for me as black, however I wanted to push my pawns forward in the centre as I knew I would have the opportunity to do
This restricts the diagonal of the fianchetto'd bishop and applies some pressure in the centre
This applies further pressure on the centre and opens the diagonal for my lsb. The disadvantage of this position is that it is tricky to get my dsb to a good diagonal, it is however supporting the c5 pawn should it be needed
This is probably about the best square for my dsb at the moment and it opens up the kings side for castling
At this point there are two games in the Gameknot database and black won both. Although both sides are almost equal in development I prefer black at the moment as  I feel the peices are a little more co-ordinated for an assault.
In the end I opted for this to maintain pressure on the centre. I was also looking now to prevent him from castling if possible
I wanted to keep my lsb and this also opened the diagonal for my queen as he will most likely castle on the kings side now. If I had taken with the knight he would probably be forced to Ng f3 preparing the way for him to castle. I didn't want to push him to making a move he wanted to anyway
Putting further pressure on the centre and preparing for a push with my pawns
I think this is probably a mistake, in his position I would be strongly tempted to castle, pretty much completing development. my threat of pawn to e4 would probably come to little
I'm happy for him to take the pawn as it gives a half open e file and If I get to open the file I can pressure his king
reopens the diagonal for my bishop and cramps the white position further, the white queen has limited options
Threatens the bishop and the e pawn. however if he takes the bishop I retake with my queen and can then put a rook on d to pressure his d pawn which would be difficult to defend.
Pinning the knight and relieving some of the pressure on my e pawn
Links the rooks which is almost always good, also means that  15 ... bh3, 16 bxb, Qxb applies some pressure to his king
Finally it falls and he has two strong knights in the centre
He has completely demolished the centre however my forces are not too badly placed for an attack
This applies pressure to his pawns with my f rook well placed to provide support
Possibly no tthe best move but it puts the rook on a half open file and resigns the white queen to defending a pawn
This move seems uneccessary to me however it does mean that the queen can move away, leaving only a rook defending the pawn
This is a key move for me as it blocks off his bishop from the defence of the king. His options are limited now and taking the b pawn with that bishop is beginning to look like a mistake. My queen still has her eye on h3.
HE can't take with the pawn or he loses his queen and if he moves the queen off the h1-a8 diagonal I can mate in one with Qg2
Not sure why white played this. It gives away a tempo.
Lining up with the bishop on g5.
Oops. guess it was me who wasn't thinking, again.<n>At this point I started thinking. The board is opening up in the center. And I really would like to save that dark squared bishop. And I spot a way to do that.
The immidiate threat here is Nxc2, forking king and rook. I was thinking he'd take the knight Nxd4 then Bxe5 forks knight and queen. Note that I had missed that Qe3 then would have made me loose material (2 pawns for a knight.) since I can't take the knight because I would have lost my queen. Actually here he can take my knight with his queen straight away. And I would have lost a knight for only one pawn. This is a really silly move. More to come.
Trying to save face. Threatens his queen and delays the bishop exchange.
Seems my opponent doesnt want the bishop exchange either. Maybe he is also thinking about having bishops in a fairly open game.
This makes the white pawn on e5 extra important. I need it to stay where it is. And keeping it there becomes a major headache. It also locks down my king since I cannot move that f7 pawn.
I need to keep his knight away from d4. I really don't want that pawn to move.
I think this was just to link his rooks.
I needed to protect my own pawn. I had no Lightsquared bishop to fear.
This position feels fairly ok. I just need to extract my bishop from h4 and activate my queen a bit, and I should have an almost equal game.
again I have to concetrate to keep my knight in place.
Rxb5.. Sometimes I just don't believe how truly blind one can be.<n>But I liked this game. Very much because it had some very nice possibilities,<n>and it flowed so nice. Mistakes were made on both sides, but the better player won in the end i think :-)
The accelerated dragon.  Often, the goal in this opening is to proceed as a regular sicilian dragon but to delay d6 in order to get in d5 directly, thereby saving a tempo.
!?  Alright, now we have to take a look at what's going on here.  If black had played d6 by now, white could play f3, setting up the yugoslav variation of the sicilian, which has very interesting chances for both sides.  I *like* the yugoslav as white, but black hasn't played d6 yet.  The pawn serves an additional purpose by being on f2; more on this in the note to move 12.<n><n>My analysis tells me that if black and I both castle (him short, myself long), and he plays d5, the game will continue roughly as a standard yugoslav with 9. 0-0-0 instead of 9. Bc4 (and without f3).  I do note, however, that I could have played Bc4 here, instead of Qd2, preventing black from playing d5 directly.
!  Black cannot recapture with the knight or he loses a rook, and a king move loses a full minor piece.  Black must play Qxe7.
And now white is up a pawn.  Note how useful it is for white to have NOT played f3, as the pawn on f2 protects the Be3.  (I had to calculate this back on move 7 -- something I couldn't have done were this not correspondence chess!)
Completing development and tempoing the queen, which will allow black to save his dark squared bishop.  White is up a pawn, but black has a lot of open lines towards white's king.
Offering a queen exchange to blunt the firepower in black's attack.
The only way to keep the dark bishop on the powerful a1-h8 diagonal is to exchange queens here.
Hitting the rook and forcing it into a more passive position.  Black is down a pawn, but his bishops are in command of the board.  Compare the activity of the black bishops to the passivity of the white ones.  (And keep an eye out for a reversal of fortunes.)
! The best square for the rook.  It allows the Bf1 to develop and gives the Rh1 full freedom along the back rank.  The one care is that the dark squared bishop must guard against a move like Bf4.
?? Back before Bobby Brown was known for beating his wife, doing drugs, and singing the monster mash with Mike Tyson, he had a song that went,<n><n>"Kiss her, miss her, love her... that girl is poi-i-son"  <n><n>That pawn on a2 looked poisonous to me that I didn't really consider black would take it.  On the other hand, with so few pieces left on the board, can it really be bad to take a pawn?  I had expected Ra-c8, and that was part of the reason I played Rd2 on my last.  But now I had to think.  My game note to myself was "does 16. b3 trap the bishop?"  I spent a couple of days thinking about it, and then played...
!?  I like this move as an in-between move.  It drives the black bishop back to either f6, g7, or h8, as any other move simply allows white to play 17. b3, 18. Kb2 and the bishop falls without a fight.  Also, it allows the Be3 to move freely without having to worry about the rook getting pinned to the king.
Hard to argue with that choice, as it preserves the possibility of a pin on the Rd2 if white blunders.
!  Alright.  Time to prove that this bishop made a mistake on the 15th!
Threatening Bxb3, where the bishop is immune due to the pin along the c-file.  White would love to play Kb2, but that pesky bishop on g7 prevents it.
?  Too slow, I think.  Perhaps best for black was to play b5 immediately, or even to play Rxc4, giving up the exchange for a pawn and the bishop pair (and chances).  One mistake doesn't usually lose the game, but two can be decisive.<n><n>Now, white has the means to win the bishop.
!  Blocking the dark-squared bishop's path to the b2 square, and allowing the king to get in there.  Note the contrast between the positional power of the white bishops after this move vs. after black's 14th.
This is definitely too slow now.  Black needed to try Rxc4 and try his luck in an inferior endgame.
!  The black bishop on a2 is lost now.  Black must recapture with the king or white simply has an overwhelming advantage.
Attempting to complicate...
But the threat is a phantom.  The bishop will fall and all black will get is a pawn at most.  After 22. ... Rc5 (the only way to threaten the light-squared bishop), 23. Rh-d1 clinches the win for white.  Black resigns 1-0.<n><n>This game just goes to show that pawn-grabbing is not just bad in the opening, but can be fatal even in the endgame!
This game evolved from a rather rare line of the Sicilian to an extremely complex middlegame - and ended up with an "objectively drawn" endgame with opposite coloured Bishops. Unfortunately these kind of endgames are seldomly played out - because there are still a lot of tactics involved. But let�s start with the beginning...
The Accelerated Dragon is not seen very much at master-level these days, but it is still a fresh alternative to the bulk of theory of the more common Sicilian lines. GM Lothar Schmid played some interesting games with Black back in the Sixties and Seventies.
We are at the crossroads of theory. White can opt for the Maroczy with 5. c4, which is linked with the English Opening, or go for 5. Nc3 - the so-called Classical. This line can even lead to the more orthodox Dragon. Of course there are other moves, and my opponent prefers one of these. But it just leads to a transposition in a few moves.
(!) This is the critical test of the line, according to a specialist in this opening, GM Heine Nielsen. Black has no tricks with a Queen move to b6, and White prepares an attack on the King-side with f2-f3, Qd2, 0-0-0 and h4. Black has other ways to go though, and I chose to try a fianchetto of the other Bishop too. This leads to a very open game.
(!?) A very aggressive move! I had expected 9. f3 to limit the "bite" of the comming Bishop on b7. Black needs to react in the centre immediately, and the time is just right since White hasn�t castled yet.
White brings his King to safety, but it will cost him a pawn. At the moment this is not so important, since there are lots of attacking possibilities on both sides and in the centre. I must admit that I felt like walking into a battle-field more or less blinded by smoke from the gunfire :)
This is the kind of position I would hate to have in a blitz-game - even with a pawn up! Of course the Black d-pawn is strong, but White has plenty of play around it, and the final question could be: Which King is the safest. I decided to seek for simplifications instead.
The obvious threat of Bh6 (hitting both Queen and King on same diagonal), gives Black time to put a Rook to a more active position - the cover of the d-pawn.
Hoping for a Queen-swap, but my opponent rightly tries to get it under the best conditions.
Please look at this position. I must admit it took me ages to analyze it - but it leads almost forced to an endgame with opposite Bishops and Black a pawn up! Whites problem is the lack of communication of his light pieces and the threat of mate on the baseline. Without these tactics, Black would have been out of ammo, with only a handshake left...
After all the fighting this is an esthetically beautiful position: Two Bishops left right beside each other - and ready for a very different kind of game. I am no expert on endgames (but I love to play them!), and my opinion around here was: Probably a draw, but with pawns on both sides, Black has chances. First: Get a passed pawn on the king-side.
My opponent plays very skillfully in his attempt to take out the venom of the pawn-majority.
Without the Bishops this would lead to an easy win, but having the opposition of the Kings dosn�t do much here. It may sound strange, but Blacks win is where his pawn-MINORITY is right now! That should explain the next moves.
With the aim of changing to the more active diagonal a7-g1.
Controlling the white squares and the Black pawns on the Kingside, it is hard to see how this can be anything but a draw. I decided to leave my Kingside-pawns to their own destiny and go for the other flank.
(!) A crucial moment - and a great trap by White. The "automatic" move 46. - Kxc4?? will be refuted by 47. Kf3 followed by eg. Bb5 and a rock-solid draw, since White has build a fortress on the light squares. Maybe I am wrong - but I don�t have Fritz to prove it... Nevertheless, it became obvious that the c-pawn helps BLACK to win, because it blocades Whites Bishop if the a-pawn goes. The next move is therefore both simple and decisive.
White resigned. After 47. Bxg2 Kxa4, White cannot stop the a-pawn without giving up his Bishop. A very inspired game by both players, if I may feel free to say so.
Black now adopts the system previously mentioned.
Notice how blacks moves are all simple and the plan can be played without much analysis. Black can try for an advantage by playing e5,Nge7,0-0,h6,Be6 and f5. In contrast, white has to work for active play. The move f4 is blocked and wont be available for a while, and he is in no position to go for an initiaive on the queenside. As a result of this analysis, I prefer blacks position.
White sees blacks plan and knows that he will get squashed on the kingside by f5,f4,h6,g5,and the pawn roller will force ts way through to the king. Instead he sacrafices a pawn for some activity.
White can now capture the a7 pawn, but black can get in f5 and will be well on top.
I think that h6 may have been better. Swapping off the light squared bishop leaves alot of white squared weaknesses. I think that h6 may be better. Then followed by f5 to try and gain space in the centre and kingside. The immediate f5 can be answered by Bc4  and then Ng5 which is a little awkward for black. Hg first prevents the Ng5 and after Bc4  the king can go to h7.
Now black has some queenside pressure.
If white takes on a7 with the bishop, then f4 traps it and if he takes with the knight f4 forces the bishop away from the defense of the knight. Therefore the pawn on a7 is immune to capture at the moment.
Black has to try and untangle himself. I thought that it would be best to do this by Qb8,Rd8 and Nc7.
Now if Nxb5 the rook gets an open file all to itself.
Now that white has a good position on the queenside he opens up another front on the kingside.
White is hoping for a tactic due to the fact that the black kings lack of squares. It is difficult for white to engineer this however.
Fortifying the kingside.
Black is quick to swap as it makes the win easier.
White need to blockade the pawn.
Although black will be able to promote it with fairly accurate play.
Forced as the pawn is too close to the queening square to be ignored.
Necessary to guard the a1 square.
The introduction of the bishop to the attack is the move that seals the win.
Although White has now gained in both time and space, he will have some difficulty in holding on to his advanced post on K5.
If now 12 NxBP Q-Q5 ch 13 K-R1 QxB 14 NxKR, and Black virtually has 2 pieces for his Rook. The best line for White was the simple 12 B-N3.
In return for the sacrifice of the Exchange it is Black who has the strong point on K4, a surprising turn after his opening moves.
The threat was 17 PxP PxP 18 RxB.
White resigns. [Afterword by Mr. Coles] In the Hypermodern movement the name of Julius Breyer must always rank high, for he was one of its greatest pioneers and probably had a clearer idea than any of his contemporaries as to its true nature.
I am going to annotate a game played in the 70s by Kasparov, the strongest player in chess history. This consisted of a pawn sacrifice(pure) in the opening. the compensation black gets is not very clear, and white gets an edge, but Kasparov uses his skill to win back the material and after some more tactics, he emerges with a decisive material advantage.
the strike in the center.
the best choice, maintaining a space advantage in the center. Right now, these center pawns decide the strategy for black and white. Black has more space on the kingside, and he should attack there, which he usually does with a pawn storm. White should try to make gains on the queenside.
the defining moment of the sacrifice. Black ignores the attack on his knight and plays f5 immediately.
black is now down a pawn. However, the compensation he gets is unclear. he averts time loss by not retreating the knight, but a closed position like time has little meaning. He does gain the bishop pair, and he can make the remaining white bishop very passive. These factors may compensate him, as they are long term advantages in this closed position.
black will want to attack on the queenside, so he makes space there.
black is ready to strike with pawns on the queenside.
white's attack is on the kingside.
the square f5 is an interior weakness. White's knight can go to it.
space on the queenside.
the pawn is well blocked by the knight and is easier to attack here.
this fixes the black pawns on the dark squares.
this targets the black pawns, but black can win more material.
now white has no time to get the bishop.
At this point I had already looked at chesssafari's profile (I always look at my opponent's page) and after seeing he is a correspondence chess master I decided not to play my favorite 1. f4. Instead I chose to rely on my strength of tactical calculation to go for the win in this game.
Ah the Sicilian Defense, I must admit I don't really care to see this as white and that is why I tend to play 1. f4, b3 or Nf3 (although here on gameknot I play e4 a lot, in the many OTB games I play the other three openings mentioned).
I had a couple of options here Nxc6 being the other main option(according to gameknot at least), but I went with the pawn break e4-e5 instead expecting the continuation 8. ... dxe5 9. Nxc6 Qxd1+ 10. Rxd1 bxc6 11. fxe5 which I considered best play by both sides. The continuation would have majorly disrupted black's pawn structure creating two isolated pawns as well as remove the queens from the board, taking the queens out makes it easier to calculate continuations.
I wasn't quite ready to trade away my bishop yet, I was also hoping to entice the Ruy Lopez-like move g5 helping to disrupt black's pawn structure.
The move I was looking for, this will create many holes in his position due to white being able to take with fxg5 (at this point I was already planning to castle queenside anyway). Because of these weaknesses it would be unlikely for black to castle kingside now, and with the hole on the c-file it looks like his king will be staying in the center making it easier to focus my eventual attack.
I gladly take the g-pawn forcing the knight at f6 to move. This does isolate my e-pawn though, but I had calculated out the continuation 10. ... Nd5 11. Nxd5 exd5 12. exd6 trading it for black's e-pawn creating more open lines for my eventual attack on his then exposed king.
Going with my previous calculation to break up black's pawn structure.
This move had 2 benefits, the first being that it releases my queen from guard duty allowing me to develop her and then castling my king to safety on the queenside. The second benefit is that it destroys the pawn structure of a6 and b7, a haven for the black king should he make it to a7. <n><n>I also contemplated Qe2+ here but decided to go against the needless check and go with the more positional move.
Three isolated pawns and a very open position for black, not looking good for defensive purposes. This compared to white's position where after castling my position looks solid.
This took my a while to decide, I also looked at Qd4 placing my queen in the center of the board but this comes up against 14. ... Qe7+ 15. Kd2 losing my castling privilege and losing a tempo really (15. Be2 is met with Be5 forcing my queen back). So I went with the quieter move of Qd2.
A forcing move, trying to develop his pieces and giving his king some breathing room. I find it very interesting that we are up to move 15 and still have not completed development here.
Blocking the check so that I can then castle to the queenside and then start attacking.
Black sees that I intend to castle and attacks my now undefended b-pawn, with his dark squared bishop and queen already pointed at a3 he is already formulating his own attack plans.
I must first deal with the many threats to my queenside before developing my attack further. Abandoning the g5-pawn to its fate, I entice an exchange of bishops (also pinning the bishop to the rook on b8)to help diminish black's attacking threats.
Not really sure what other options black had here, taking with the bishop 16. ... Bxg3 was bad due to 17. hxg3 Bg4 18. Rxh6.
Diminishing one of the threats, allowing me to castle more safely.
This move was not what I was expecting, it looks like black was trying to trade queens here. Earlier I was willing to trade queens before the position had fully taken shape, but now it was more advantageous for me to keep mine on the board. f6 was probably best here to support the g5-pawn to at least keep some structure to his pawns.
c3! I decline the exchange, attack his queen and defend the b-pawn all in one move.
Still trying to keep pressure on the b-pawn, if he had really wanted to trade queens then black could have gone with Qf4. Although I feel that even after the exchange on f4 white is better due to his stronger pawn structure.
Releasing some of the pressure allowing my queen to move.
Sacrificing the pawn to allow Qf4 lining up my queen and rook with either continuation.
Black has to the threat of Qxf6+ forking the king and rook now.
Defending the f-pawn while keeping the pressure on white's position, should white falter black can push the c or d pawn forward to break through his defense.
The lesser of the evils so to speak, Be6 is met with 26. Qxf6+ Kc7 27. Qe7+ and if black moves the queen the rook on b8 falls.
The best option was c4 so that my d-pawn would continue to block my rook and cxd4 is just bad for black.
No choice, g3 loses a pawn. White can not castle anymore and with the f-pawn offered in the gambit black may have a chance to launch an attack on this side.
To stop the threat at f7 and to open up the bishop. (which will not move during the entire game...).
If 11 Ng4 then not 11...., Qg5 because of 12 h4, Qf5, 13 Bd3 loses Q.
11 ..., Nf6? N on h5 has no space to go anymore. It follows 12 g3, note fork on pawn f4 (white Bishop takes black Queen). Possible is Nxg3, 13 hxg3, Qh2  14 Qg2, Qxg3 15 Qxg3, fxg3 16 Kxg3. White has material and black 3 free pawns on the King's wing.
13 ..., fxg3ep? 14 hxg3, fxe5. 15 Bxh6, Rxf3. 16 Kxf3, gxh6. 17 dxe5 is definitely better for white, leaving black with two awkward h pawns and having converted the blocked d pawns into strong d e front.
White gives up the other rook to completely stop the black attack and develop one of his own.
White completely owns the center of the board!
The white attack will be too strong for example when that Bishop had moved to e5.
Important to get the black Queen back to where the action is, occupy that diagonal and square f3 accessible to come to the rescue.
Not exactly the best. Preferably Ng4 for black here, attacking the bishop, and forcing my queen to go to Qe2.
Not sure why he played this. No way I'm going for the pin, since there isn't a pin. His bishop is there.
Sending my knight in the center.
Threatening Qh7 mate. However, my opponent was more into the pawn to notice the mate.
I want a race and castling on the oppoaite side is the way to do it.
I am winning so much there is no wrong move. So take the Bishop. I'm not gonna go out of my way to save it.
1. d4   e6 - going to try the stonewall defense<n>went with e6 first in case white replies with e4
White's Bd2 means I don't have to worry too much a exchange involving the black square bishop.   Suppose he could do a3 followed by Bb4.  Plan is to back the Bishop up with Queen, especially if I see a3 on move 7.  I prefer to castle on move 7
Continuing with Stonewall development.  Plan is to castle next unless there is a threat to the Bishop
Is White thinking of some kind of Kingside attack - Ng5 followed by Qf3 then Qh3.  I have got to keep the N on f6 as it guards the h pawn.  Looking ahead, I could begin the process of moving the white square bishop over - Bd7, Be8, Bg6.  If on move 8, White does Ng5, I am ruling out h6 - at least for now.
I am not too worried about White capturing d5 as I would just recapture. However, advancing to c5 would cause me to retreat the Bishop to either e7 or c7, neither of which appeal to me.  b6 will prevent the c5 advance, at least for now.
Starting the zig-zag - I am a little worried about Ne5, plan is Be8, then Nd7<n>Also considering Ne4, but in a closed game, Knights are better than Bishops and I think that could lead to Knight for a Bishop exchange.  On the plus, White would be forced to move the Knight on f3.  It also open up the F file for the rook.
Looks like White is going to attack Queenside.  I remember losing one game because I allowed White to push pawns far down Queenside.  I think a5 would stop the attack.  If he pushes the pawn to b4, then my reply is axb4.  If he takes with a pawn, then I get the Rook.  If he captures with Bishop, I will reluctanly take the bishop Bxb4+.  If he retakes with the pawn, then I get the Rook.  If he blocks the check with Knight - Nd2, then my best course is to retreat the Bishop to a5, keeping the white Knight pinned for now.  Bc3 attacking the Rook can be easily defeated by moving the Rook. When I look closer, Bc3 could force a Rook move, allowing Rxa3, guarding the Bishop.
Interesting.  In a closed game, I don't mind trading a bishop for a knight, especially a light square bishop that is usually problematic in the Stonewall.  Bxb5 will also allow me to develop my queenside knight to d7.
Think the c file will come open so let's position the rook to hold it.
Up till now I have had a good idea what to do next.  cxd4 will just be a pawn exchange.  I will also have to defend the e6 pawn after white recaptures (persumely with e3 pawn).  cxd4 also opens a black square so the bishop has a little more room.  How would I defend the e6 pawn?  Re8, Qe8, or Ne4?  I am also thinking that if White moves the Knight, the Ng4 allows a threat to White's h pawn.
so much for my thinking - white recaptured with the Knight.  e6 would be a good forking square for the White Knight.  Be5 looks interesting for the next move.  At some point I should also consider Ne4.  With no pawn on d4, I can also consider Ne5
I have to do the Rook swap
Knight for a Bishop - just though it would be the white square bishop
Thinking Rf6 to guard the e pawn.  Will allow me to move the Queen so that I can get a king side attack going.  Ne5 was also appealing but feel that I would be force to move the knight after f4.
I can post a knight to e4 now.  Is White thinking Bh5? After I reply Qh6, then Rc8+.  Things are about to get interestig.
Rc8+, Bf8<n>What does White do next - move the queen - lose the bishop, retreat the bishop to threaten the knight?
thinking I might trade the bishop for the knight, can also swap rooks because the knight is pinned to the queen.  He can recapture with the pawn but I will be even again on the pawn capture by the queen.
did not see the attack on the b pawn
down two pawns - don't want to swap, things are not looking good - can't get the king over to help stop the pawn
Good to stop any knight or bishop excursions on the b5 square.
Good response from Black, threatening b2 and getting some good counterplay on the center.
Threatening his knight, forcing the next play.  Qd2 is a more book play.  The other downside of this play is that it leaves a lone center pawn with no other pawns to lend support.  Lone center pawns can prove troublesome to protect, and can sometimes cost the game down the line.
Now comes a moment of decision for Black.  There are a few options worth considering, getting the knight to safety, but the Queen has the best play.  White will also now have some burden in attempting to protect the e pawn.
Notice that the rook is not really threatened, but the even if exf6, Black can do some unpleasant things with some check combos.  Black also gains a 1 pawn advantage.
I think that Na4 is a better response, forcing the Queen to the a3 square, but this move protects the knight and prepares for White to shoo away the Black queen.
An interesting move by Black.  The original goal was to get the bishop out to the c5 square, but White could simply move the knight to b4 and cause the bishop to have to move again.  The anticipated move by White of Rb3 would block that path and allow the bishop to go to where it would do the most good, c5.
Good placement for bishop.  When in doubt of where to place a bishop, centralize.  Another possible good spot would be c4, as it would prevent Black from moving the f pawn.
Nice way to add some pressure on the b pawn.  This move gave Black some positional choices to make.  Also it centralizes the LSB on the main diagonal, so it can affect the maximum amount of squares.  I actually anticipated White moving a bishop to protect the e pawn.
Moving to get the King into the game to offer some protection to the DSB on e3.  It also prevents a back row rook check down the line, threatening to lose another rook.  More importantly, it will allow White to marry up his rooks on the b file.
Black's final development is seriously hampered by the LSB on e4, so in order to uncomplicate things, I decided to trade pieces, allowing more flexibility in maneuvering.
White now has a 2 bishop to 1 advantage in a fairly open board.  If White can keep both bishops it will make things more challenging for Black.
Another option considered here was f5 to chase away the LSB on e4, but ultimately decided to offer White a trade, and a split of my a/b pawns.
And White denied Black.  A good rule of thumb when you're down in points is to trade pawns and not pieces (unless you're trading up!).  With this move White further complicates Black's position and Black has no easy way to extract the bishop.  Nice move.
Recognizing I'm not getting much action for the bishop otherwise, time to open a diagonal and put that piece to work.  Also threatening f5 once the LSB is on e6.
Looking to make a permanent post for the DSB, and if Black wants to trade for it, will reconnect White's pawns in the process.  Nice.
Preventing a piece exchange that would break up the a/b pawn chain.
Uncertain of the utility of this move.  I would connect the rooks on the b file and then try to eat Black's b pawn.
I would have probably have looked at Bd3 or Bc2 to preserve the 2 bishop advantage.
Now there is a different color bishop end game.  Black will need a pair of pawns to promote.
Better to connect the rooks on the b file.  The bishop on b6 did not need to be moved yet.
Looking for some room to start marching the pawns down.  Also looking to get the LSB into the game more forcefully.  Also looking for a perch for the bishop with some follow on pawn action.  There can be no better perch for a bishop than bearing down on the diagonal to protect a pawn for promotion.
Removing the threat of a rook battery going after the b7 pawn.
There were a few choices to be made for Black at this point.  I could take with the pawn and completely block the c pawn, or take with the bishop.  My decision point was that if I took with the pawn, I now have another open file into my backside.  To limit White's options at counterplay, I opted to take with the bishop.  Later on this could cause me problems if White put a rook behind the c pawn to start pushing down the board.
White will need to get his bishop into play to stop those pawns.  A 4 on 2 advantage will require a piece sacrifice to prevent a promotion, with proper play from Black.
Good instincts.  Hoping to break up the e/f pawn chain.
Besides blocking off the file, it also allows for more support to push pawns.
The hope here is to get the other rook up on d3, but the White bishop on b4 is making that a multi-move endeavor.
Rooks do love open files, but a dangerous move as it puts both rooks on a diagonal of the LSB of Black.  However, Black's rook is totally in the way.
Another move I considered for black was Rc7, to protect against the d7 check.  Ultimately I decided against it since it was too easy for Black to move the bishop around.
So many tantalizing "almost" options for Black.  Alas there was no obvious way I could see to trade a bishop for a rook.  Rg3+ could be captured with a pawn, which would make it a poor trade.
Forcing the trade.
Now White is stuck on the c pawn and has to defend against 2 pawns down the center.  White needs a blunder from Black to survive this one.
To allow the king to get into the game and still guard the c6 square...
A decent move to get the king involved, but regardless, coming 2 against 4 pawns is tough.
An important move to block the c pawn from advancing  as well as provide support to the f/e pawn march.
Allowing my king to advance and get the square.  It might be best to give up the c-pawn and get the DSB involved.
in preparation for f4.
And that, as they say, is the ballgame.  Interestingly enough if the pawns on f/e were not connected, it would be very very hard to win this game, as opposite color bishops can block all sorts of promotions without the connected pawns to force the issue.<n><n>White should have given up the c pawn and instead brought his bishop into play.  The end likely would not have changed, but everyone makes mistakes.  A lone king against two connected pawns, a king, and a bishop is impossible to beat.
Uh-oh, I knew this was coming. The good news for me is that his LSB is gone, I've had major problems in other games with people using the LSB and the queen to attack my king's knight twice.
His queens wipes away some more pawns
If I played Be7, he could pin my queen to my king with O-O.
If I captured with my queen he could have moved his queen and pinned mine with his rook.
I take his knight, but he can take my bishop
He sacs the exchange...
Two... My king is shoved to the block...
Just trying to maintain symmetry which is a well-known technique for Black in the French exchange variation to achieve a draw. However, this move leaves my pawn on b7 undefended and my opponent doesn't hesitate to exploit that...
Forcing the queen exchange with 5... Qe7 loses also a pawn because of 6. Bxc7!
The b7 pawn falls for sure, I can't do anything about it.
The only move to defend my rook on a8.
Offering a queen exchange, to avoid the loss of more pawns.
Unfortunately I didn't have time to take the undefended pawn on c2, now as my opponent castles queenside it's too late.
Avoids to let my knight go to e4 and prepares g4 once more ;-)
I didn't want to block the e-file with 13... Be6, and this was the only alternative, which keeps the bishop on the fine b1-h7 diagonal.
Of course, the opponents wants to make use of his pawn-wall and catch my bishop.
Forcing the exchange of white-squared bishops.
I decided not to take, but instead developing my knight on the queenside. If White takes my bishop, I get a doubled pawn, but it also opens the f-file, I thought it can be of some use maybe.
I expected 18. Nce2, I don't think the knight is very well-placed here. However, it avoids that my bishop reaches the a3 square.
Trying to get rid of my doubled pawns. I overlooked that the opponent can simply play g5 -- the doubled pawns remain and my knight has to leave it's place on f6.
Developing his knight and connecting the rooks. The knight is not very active here, but it's the only square it can go to.
I thought it probably can't hurt to take one more pawn - not expecting that I can hold it for very long.
25... Bb4 was tempting but doesn't really lead to anything because of 26. a3, and my bishop has to move back again.
At this point I resigned. Mr. Schwab was very nice and offered to take the move back and play another one instead "to keep the game interesting". I happily agreed and played 28... Nc6 instead of my blunder, but lost the game after approx. 12 moves anyway, because I couldn't avoid the queening of his a-pawn at the end.<n><n>However, the event was great fun and I encourage all interested chess players in Vienna to participate in one of the future tournaments or simultaneous exhibitions organized by the "Schachfreund", it's really nice.<n>Not to forget, five participants achieved a draw against the FIDE Master, hats off!
It is good to see that white has a clear simple plan here. His idea is to gain space on the queen side with the hope of creating a passer later on.
Nice move, appreciating the fact that black may wish to open the e-file at some point. But it creates a significant weakness on f2.
Nice active defensive in a desperate situation. At least white is giving black something to think about!
Black decides not to waste time and develops his knight, attacking the center. The d4 square is now attacked twice by black.
Ahh, Ruy Lopez. Once black's d-pawn advances, the knight will be effectively pinned to the king, and therefore unable to attack or defend. Strong move!<n>Trying to scare white's LSB away with 3. ... a6 will only cause 4. Ba4 ; the pin will still stand, and both players will have used up a move, while Black would also be left with a weak queenside....
...Therefore Black decides to advance his e-pawn, as so far it is still protected by the knight.
Ruy Lopez allows White to be highly aggressive, disputing the center, attacking on the queenside and protecting his king very early.<n>Excellent opening really! the pawn structure in front of White's king, along with the presence of his rook and knight, makes for a very tight defense, as long as the pawns aren't moved.
Black gets his DSB off the back rank, developing a minor piece. It now protects both e and c-pawns, so it is a little overworked.<n>The move is not too bad, although in hindsight, a better square for the DSB at this stage could have been e7 instead, choosing 4. ... d6 before.<n>Now the d-pawn is stuck behind  the DSB, and the LSB is also therefore stuck! However, this way the knight isn't pinned yet, and is one of three attackers of the d4 square; not too shabby!
This move sets up many things at once: White's Queen has now an additional diagonal to act in, LSB has the c2 square to run off to in case Black decides to chase it away from its position, and finally, 5. c3 supports the advance of White's d-pawn to the d4 square, which is defended thrice.
Black decides to move his b-pawn in order to give his LSB some breathing space, while also defending better the c-pawn
White develops his b-knight. In general, moving a knight to the side of the board means giving up half of its attacking power.<n>In this case it defends the LSB and prepares to move to c4, a very nice square to be controlled by a knight.
Gets the knight out and prepares to castle.
The rook comes into play! it defends the e-pawn, which was attacked with the previous move.
Black gets his last minor piece off the back rank, in the only other safe square available to his LSB. this position is very cramped for him, so all he can do his park it behind the knight in order to eventually unleash a possible discovered attack.
....And the knight comes into action! occupying this square, a lot of options are available to him. The one that catches White's eye is to attack Black's DSB, which is currently undefended. Black's gonna have to do something about that...
...And he does so by developing his queen! Bishop is now well defended enough, and actually Black has a choice of which side to castle to.
White is a little bit behind with his development, having moved a couple of his pieces twice, so he decides to continue. <n>This pawn advance protects the e-pawn and allows his DSB, up till now doing nothing in the back rank, a long diagonal to get into play.
At this point, castling on the kingside would have probably been better for Black.<n>It seems though he wanted to get that d-pawn into the game, while employing the DSB elsewhere.<n>Both of Black's bishops, although off the back rank, aren't really being used to their maximum potential, while White's are much better placed!
But black takes the offering with his LSB, which now has more breathing space than before.<n>In hindisight, it seems like because of black's cramped position and misuse of his bishops as a result, white wanted to cripple him further by taking out 1-2 knights, the best piece when it comes to navigating similar positions.
This strong move confirms that idea: black's remaining knight is now pinned to the queen, rendering it useless.<n>black starts to feel the pressure, as white's more open position allows for more long-ranged attacks.
And here is the move that will prove to be a bit of a problem for White.<n>This pawn advance helps to protect against an enemy bishop or knight parking on the g4 square.<n>Unfortunately none of the opponent's minor pieces are in a position to do so at the moment, they will be able to do so in 2 moves minimum.<n>This is therefore a bit of a loss in tempo, a move which could have been used instead to get white's queen into position for example at b3 and allowing the rooks to get in touch with each other.<n>Moreover, changing the pawn structure in front of a castled king, creates an immediate and irremediable weakness in the kingside's defense, one that black will take advantage of.
Puts his a-rook to work, protecting the advance of the d-pawn. Black plans to disturb the position in the center, aiming to at least dislodge the knight from its excellent c4 square, and perhaps to take hold of the d4 square.
And white goes for another exchange, taking both black knights off the board.
White queen makes space for the two rooks to talk.<n>But why this square? surely taking b3 or even taking the diagonal passing from d2 would have been better?
Second rook is moved into position.<n>Black wants to get the d-pawn out into the center, disturbing the current position, probably cause an exchange or two, which will hopefully prove distracting enough to white.<n>at the same time though, an attack is being setup on the kingside, which the LSB will lead, and the queen supported by one or two rooks will continue.<n>essentially both rooks on this position are meant to distract but also to prepare for the real attack.
But black doesnt bite and advances one more square! the center is now much better controlled by black, and the important squares e3 and c3 are attacked!
17. cxd4 would have given white doubled pawns on d-file. he was also perhaps in fear of a followup 17. ... Rxd4.<n>he decided then to settle for this move, sealing the pawn structure as it is for the foreseeable future.
The second part of black's plan is set in motion.<n>The rook is now ready to spring into action as soon as the queen gets out of the way; the two key squares of d7 and d8 are also freed up for the bishops' convenience.
Setup is complete. LSB is ready to spearhead the attack.
White understands what's up, and rectifies by bringing a minor piece to the defense of its king, and freeing up some space for the queen.<n>Unfortunately, because of the presence of black's pawn at d4, the queen is still somewhat limited in movement options.
And the kamikaze attack starts!<n>LSB sacrifices its life to breach the king's already weak defense!
Black eliminates the now undefended knight, while at the same time giving space to his d-rook to enter the fray! the followup is is 21. ... Rg6+ ...
Black moves the rook anyway, pinning the knight.
Tries to scare black's queen away!
Luckily a pawn is there to save the day! black queen's position is slightly changed but the attack can continue.
The Rook now pins the h-pawn to the king, and black threatens mate in 2.
added defense to the knight.
In a last attempt, white tries to scare black's queen off, or at least to force an exchange...
...But white's h-pawn is pinned, and therefore cannot defend the Queen, which is then taken as spoils of war!<n><n>at this point White gracefully resigns, giving the game to Black!
"A logical and sound move to start the game, grabbing central space and opening lines for quick developement of the Bf1 and queen. Other pawn pushes with no real drawbacks include 1. d4 and 1. c4. And for our hypermodern players, there is always 1. Nf3, controlling the center with pieces and not commiting to a set pawn structure. "<n>Morphy one and only true love, his confidence never wavered with the best move "best by Test" Bobby Fischer.
The best move to defend. Also attacks two squares and develops <n>a piece.
The Italian game. An old opening that is now thought to be rather dull and boring. Black now has two main options here 3....Bc5 the Giuoco Piano or 3... Nf6 The Two Knight's Defence. The Italian game can evolve into the romantic Evans Gambit if 3...Bc5 then 4. b4!?
The Guicco Piano. This is less agressive than the Two Knight's defence. Moprhy now has the chance to play his and my fave as I have already mentioned, the Evan's Gambit 4.b4!?
This the move that signals the beginning of the Evans.  White sacrifices a pawn for center control and a kingside Initiative with a quick attack on the Black king which will hopefully end in mate. Most  gambits like these give White an early initiative, however  if Black can defend accurately, he stands better in the ensuing endgame, with plenty of chances for a win. When people tell me this I simply reply " I don't give a crap, I don't plan letting Black get into an endgame position anyway. Lol."
It is often said that the way to refute a gambit is to accept it. Black grabs a pawn so as to have the option of uploading it in a later stage in the game in order to neutralize whites resulting initiative. This is atleast what Black  is meant to try and do!
This is the plan of giving away the b4 pawn to gain tempo by forcing black to move his bishop repetitively while he gains  momentum in the centre.
Grabbing the pawn center, unleashing the dark squared bishop, and attacking the c5 bishop all with one move. Remember the best moves accomplish multiple goals or hit multiple targets
An exchange in the centre.
Keeping the pressure on the d-pawn. However it is obvios that White has the edge in this positiion.
Castliing is not only a defensive move, but also an offensive move. Notice that now the f rook is in the game, and surely will be moving to the powerful and <n>open e-file soon.
Moving the knight to an inferior square where it no longer attacks the center.
Not wanting to trade that good bishop for that half-knight stranded passively on the side of the board where it will find it hard to affect the game.
With the bishop gone, black is able to challenge white's awesome pawn center. Not a bad idea although flawed because it gives Paul the opportunity to open the e-file.
Bringing the queen out early is very dangerous, because white can attack it with his developing pieces, there are no other options though if he wants to regain the material deficit.
Developing the bishop to a powerful square where it will prevent black from castling, pressure the critical squares around the king, and pin the king to the middle of the board,, sometimes in the Evan's Gambit Black play the pawn move d7-d8 but oh woops Blacks excanged all his central pawns while his King is stuck in the centre.
White finds it necessary to block the critical e-file since it is obvious white rook will be coming to town with R-e1.
Black does not go all the way back because he hopes to castle queenside since castling kingside is out of the question because of the a3 bishop.
A pawn sacrifice which clears the e-file for an attack on the king.
Black accepts the 'free' pawn.
White wants to trade this bishop off because it is black's critical defender.
! A piece sacrifice, typical Morphy! The reason for this move is to clear the d-file for white's queen so the king can't run out of the center.
CHECK AND MATE! This shows Morphy was always was a big one for development( just look at all the other games by Morphy I have annotated.!). Perhaps the first chess player to stress the need to develop before you attack... He just simply annihilated all the competition in his time. I believe that he was the greatest player of all time, his genius goes along with Capablanca, Alekhine, Fischer, and Tal. I hope you liked this game. I hope you liked this game. I'm happy for positive and negative feedback aslong as its constructive criticism! and feel free to leave comments. One thing I would like you to do is before you rate this game please think honestly and think how I can improve on it and leave comments and PM me with them. Don't just give one and a half stars and not tell me why leave a comment or PM.<n>Thanks<n>Tom
"A typical Morphy move, striving as soon as possible to overcome his lack of development." (Euwe) In Maroczy's opinion, 8...Be7 was more circumspect
(?) After a series of dubious movies, Bird commits a decisive mistake. "However, had it not been for this move, chess literature would not have been enriched with one of Morphy's most staggering and profound combinations...After 11.Nxf6+! (11.Bxf6 Qxh5) 11...gxf6 12.Bxf6 Rxf6 (12...Qh5 13.g4) 13.Qg5+ Rg6 14.Nxg6 hxg6! 15. Qxd5+ (or 15. h4) =" (Maroczy). Euwe does not agree with this evaluation: "In the resulting open position the strength of the two black bishops should quickly tell." But in Kasparov's opinion,  White would have been lucky to reach such a position, since in fact he is destroyed by the interposition of 12...e3! (this Morphy would NOT have missed!) 13.Qxe3 Rxf6 14.0-0-0 (14.Qg5+ Rg6) 14...Bf8 etc.<n>Bird's mistake is fully understandable from a psychological standpoint: he already was facing a difficult choice...
The prelude to Morphy's combination, although the immediate 16...Bg4 would have been more efficient, when Black is a very healthy pawn ahead.
(?!) I tip my hat to the great chess artist, but the crude 17...Bg4! was correct, or even, according to Euwe, the slow 17...Bf5 and ...Bg6.
(!) Clearance of the b1-h7 diagonal for Black's LSB. This reply was overlooked by Bird - but it is unfair to demand of a master from mid-19th century that should be correctly able to weight up all the consequences of 18...Qa3!! and 22...Bxb4. Whereas Morphy's sound framework and his wide-ranging tactics already resemble the play of a modern GM. The pure fact of the matter is, Morphy's genius and talent at chess was so enormous that he was simply 50-70 years ahead of his time...to combat such a hurricane on the board was simply impossible.
This is all theory.  I am used to 16...Bg7 here but the text makes sense.  I am not sure whether of not I should play d4-d5 or try to keep the central pawns adjacent
now i am getting pushed around the board.  there is no good way to get rid of this knight
I was quite annoyed here, as I had missed that I can't grab the d pawn due to 33...Rxe1, 34.Kxe1, Rc1+, when the knight controls d1 where I had planned to move the rook!
now the rook has nowhere to go and i can't stop the pawns.  30 seconds left
Hi everyone!<n><n>The Sicilian is not an opening for the faint hearted.  Defense and passivitis will get you nowhere in the middlegame!  Well, I can tell you that neither player showed much passivitis in the middlegame.  However, unfortunately for my opponent, small-potato, a bigger concentration of white pieces in his position at the right time ensured that it was not Henry that was to topple.  In this game, much to black's chagrin, Glenda snapped out of her defensive role and became one hot potato!  So, how did all this happen?  Well, let's kick off with 1. e4 c4.  This is the Sicilian Defense and the word defense is a misnomer because both sides may end up being at each other's throats.
6. .... a6 - this is a move I am becoming all too familiar with.  This move characterises the Naijdorf which prepares b5.  Now if the two sides castle on the opposite side (white normally queenside), then I am aware of the fact that Henry can be subject to an almighty barrage down the a-c columns by major pieces and they can all line up neatly behind the pushed pawns.  So somehow, I must counter-attack vigorously on the kingside and get my punch in first.
12. ..... b4 - the race and the heat is on!
15. ..... a4 - aha, a white knight on the queenside is en prise to a pawn and a black light square bishop is also en prise to a pawn.  I wonder if black will play B x N here.
17. ..... Rxf7 - thanks to the berserker effect of my f pawn which perished on f7 material is still even.  I am eyeing up that black rook on f7 and I sincerely hope he leaves it there.  I have plans for Fou Leblanc!
25. Qg8+ - now she flies to g8 and the BK feels the white heat.  Pity that rook on a8 is defended by the Wicked Witch of the West.
26. Qxg7 - I now snatch a pawn and am a full exchange up.  However, I must beware because there are still two major pieces and three pawns swarming around Henry at the moment.  I must therefore at least ensure that the two black minor pieces are firmly pinned down.  As an exercise for the Inquest Jury, which two black pieces are pinned at the moment and what by?
31. Rxe5 - now a black pawn disappears off the board and Glenda is getting some assistance.
31. ...... Qxc2 - a strong looking counter-threat on my d1 rook, but, alas, the dark squared bishop on e2 is twice attacked and only defended by the BK.  Now which piece should I take the bishop with?  After considerable thought ..... Rook, I choose you!
32. Rxe7+ - I felt more comfortable about this move because at least black can be checked along the second rank and there is a possibility of a lawn-mower mate.  Black now waves the white flag.  Gameknot analysis showed that I had a forced mate in a few moves.  After conceding that Low Draw in the Grob game, I was quite relieved to get four of the ten points back and to do it in such an aggressive fashion after my usual diet of passivitis is really something.  I will have another annotation coming soon, so watch this space.  Kind regards - Joanne
And again with the centre game. I do this to free up as many pieces as possible, that is the queen and bishops, as the knights are already free to move onto the 3rd rank.
I wouldn't have minded 2... exd4, as my queen can gain a tempo and possibly sit nicely on the 3rd rank, but with this move I could potentially force both off the board if we trade pawns on e5...
...and although I capture his pawn, threatening to open up the queens' file, so I can trade them, so he can no longer castle...
...and as he moves his queenside knight into the middle of the board, developing it a second time...
...I attack it with my kingside one, hoping for an exchange...
...which is exactly what I get, and my queen sits nicely on the 3rd rank. I'm ahead on development again, with two pieces at least on the 3rd rank, to his none.
He's hoping to fianchetto his bishop with this move, no doubt hoping to surprise me on the long diagonal...
...but with his queenside bishop's pawn leaving its staring file, after capturing my queen's pawn on d6, I can develop my kingside bishop to check his king...
...I decline to take it, hoping he'll take mine, so I can recapture with my knight.
But as he attacks my bishop with his pawn...
I bring my queen to the 6th rank, hoping to wreak havoc...
...but his knight helps to see to that, as it can attack her if placed on c8, although I control the d5 square...
...which is where I place my knight, to try to help her out...
...and I opt to block with mine, pinning the queens to their kings...
...and we exchange the queens, with my dark-bishop emerging.
...so I castle queenside to protect the threatened pawn on b2, and for my rook to cover the d4 square, should his bishop remain on the long dark diagonal, so my bishop can move there.
...I can threaten his bishop with mine, which is covered by my rook. If he makes the first capture, my rook controls the 4th rank...
...but he declines to take my bishop...
...so I initiate the exchange. I went in for these five like-for-like exchanges because I am ahead by the odd pawn since move 4, and that is the advantage I have in this all too familiar double-rook endgame. If I exchange both pairs of rooks without a single pawn being dropped (the last time this happened was on move 4), then I should make the most of my extra pawn to win the game.
I bring out my inactive rook to take control of the only open file on the board, hoping to advance it to the 7th rank...
...but as one of his rooks lines up my pawn on d5, my other rook is now in a passive position...
...but he doubles his rooks on the c-file. An attack on c2 looks on the cards...
...and as my pawn is now under attack from the rook...
...I cover it with my rook's pawn...
...and as the rook lands on my 3rd rank, lining up my rook's pawn...
...I move my king up one rank, to cover it...
...and I move one of my rooks to cover the 3rd rank, so my pawn can land on c3 and give the one on b4 extra protection...
...and I move up my kingside bishop's pawn to help get an exchange if necessary...
...but as the king is now exposed to a rook attack, I can check him...
...and my higher rook can move in for the kill, giving a two rook and two pawn checkmate. The moral of the story? You don't have to exchange all your best pieces in order to win. Also notice that since move 4, no more pawns were sacrificed, with me having seven, and my opponent six.
This is my traditional move where by i attempt to make a quick win by going for f 7......I admit it only works on weak opponents......so i use this opening to size up my opponent and see what i am up against
I eliminated the pawn on d5 because I want to keep that white diagonal open for my bishop n c4
Wekk I have to keep the bishop safe
With this move I am trying to keep a straight path to his Q and King....to try an get his Queen
I am trying to get that Q
I need more pieces to attack E6 so i am creating the space for my Q to support rook
oh I see what he is up to...he wants to capture my Q by attacking C3 with his bishop
I just have to defend and continue with my assault on E6
Just keep the pressure on E6
Just keep the pressure on E6
He is trying to force me to reduce my pressure on E6
now I am so under attack...I have to reorganise my defence
this was a blunder too because my Bishop is still in danger.......but I did not see it at the time
Now I have a chance to get something big here
I have to get that rook
Seemingly winning the exchange but notice the pieces focused on c7.  I decide to let black decide and throw in a threat.  I was looking for the draw here.
Nb5! This move balances the powers of the game a bit.  Whites best try for some kind of counter play.  Black best might actually want to ignore the rooks for this turn and play Nc6 or possible Nd5 to respond to the threat I stumbled upon.  This seems to be a tall statement but lets continue the game.
The worst possible move leads to mate in 5.  Would have been nice to be able to see my opponents face when I announced this in game hehe.  Black is expecting Rxe1.  I was toying around with a drawing idea Nb6+ and forcing a draw which I'll explain in a moment when I found the mate.  If black was going to capture Nxc1 would be slightly more effective then I would have played Ncd6+!? cxd6 (White could also try Rxd6 which may be more accurate.) Rxc1+ Kd7 Nxd6 white is down a whole rook but only for a moment.  White has a strong minor piece attack and should be able to regain some material if not the whole.
Here was my drawing idea Kb8 Rd7+ forcing Kc8 to to stop Rxd8# and repeating till draw.  I was overlooking the obvious Rc4+ leading to mate.  Which will play out in blacks final moves.
He offers the bishop trade, and I accept.
If Bxg4, Kf6 recovers the piece with no compensation for white.
NOw if g4xNf3, Rxg6 , and if a7xg6, Qxg6 , Kh8, Qh6 , Kg8, Rg1 ... and if Kh8, Rg7 wins.
Now I think that at the very least I can gain a tempo by attacking the underdefended d4.  I am not afraid of d5 because of Bxc3+.
Once white played this move, I began to think about getting my bishop to g4 where at the very least I might be able to double the pawns on the kingside.  I was already thinking about maybe getting my knight to d4 adding to the attack on f3.  I thought that if things went exactly my way, I could have mating possibilities.
This is to prevent the knight on c3 from swinging to e2 and then g3 to protect the king.
Black defends the Bishop, but cuts off its retreat.
Trying to force the Bishop away.
Adding a defender to the Knight.
Setting a trap: 8 PxB? QxR! 9 QxQ N-B7 ch winning the Q and ending up ahead an Exchange.
Now, however, White wins a piece! If the Knight retreats, White plays 9 PxB. If Black tries 8... BxN, 9 BxB forks Q and N and White still wins a piece! Black resigns at once.
Moving this pawn is generally pretty weak, but white's bishop cannot attack the black king's open diagonal without first moving three times, nor can the white queen move to h5 or h6 in under three moves.  Plus f6 discourages Nf3 opening an attack on Pb7, defended by Na5.  The drawback is that black's castle pawns are in disarray.  But that won't be an issue if the queens exchange.
Black just needs to deploy king side pieces, and can't move the bishop if the knight moves first.  White might have taken advantage of this with Nd2 (either one) Ne4, to attack d6.  The only other piece white could deploy against d6 is the queen, which is kind of blocked by hooves on a5.
Now black is defending the weak Bd6, and adding muscle to Pb7.
It looks like a stupid move, and probably is.  But white's queen and rook share a diagonal, and whether or not Pd4 was ever played black needs support for Bb5 (which ultimately occurs on move 18--four moves away).
Pulling the bishop back preserves Pa6, and white has nothing to attack the black bishop.
White blunders.  I think, "hey, a pawn attacks one rook while the bishop another?"  White should probably trade rook for bishop with Rc2.
Black can avoid having his own pawns split by this expensive exchange.  Expensive, because that pawn moved three times.
Black will be happy to trade rooks.
Seeking to mix it up right away.
At this point, the beginnings of an idea to attack what I assume will be black's castled position arise.
To restrict black's light squared bishop (which at this stage I'm a little scared of as it is still very strong.
Opening the way for white's light squared bishop, and further restricting black's dark squared one.
I'm guessing my opponent started feeling the walls closing in on his position and wanted to open things up. This pawn move just weakened the squares around his king even further.
And now the race is on. Can black get his pieces over to defend in time?
With the idea of a pawn grab, but notice that black has a knight with only one available square to move to (which is weak at best) and a rook that couldn't move even if it were on fire.
Black finally opens up a space for his knight.
And the fireworks begin. White is now preparing to throw everything including the kitchen sink towards black's king.
Realizing what is about to happen, black attempts pre-emptive action with a rook sac.
?? The worst possible square to move to. Black has now just walked right into a pin. Kg8 was far better.
I learned this in "How to Utilize a Pin 101".
21 moves into the game and black completes development. His challenge now is to hold on and try to weather the storm that is on his horizon.
As my good friend and teammate webb31620 is fond of saying - "Passed pawns MUST be pushed", although I'm sure he stole it from some GM:) Black is now on life support.
.......and a bicycle, and a catcher's mitt, and some dolls for my sister. Thanks Santa:)
If there is one lesson to be learned from this game, let it be this......The development of minor pieces early is vital for long term plans. Unless your opponent makes an obvious blunder that allows you to maintain a strong attack with only a few pieces, it is always best to station your pieces on active squares early and THEN figure out what you want to do with them. My opponents slow development caused his position to be lost.
As a rule I prefer this to a Ruy Lopez opening (from blacks perspective), but I have had a number of disasters against the Lopez, so am probably biased against it.
Clearly a pre-prepared move, I hadn't faced this before. I would normally expect Nf3, or Bg5 but as the game develops it becomes clear why white chose this.<n><n>Looking through variations now, Ng4 looks interesting. If<n>1) 6. d4 exd4 7. Na4, with a small advantage to black<n>2) 6. 0-0 Qh4 (possible since knight isn't on f3) 7. h3 (avoiding # on h2) Nxf2 looks pretty good for black, since black is going to have to give up the exchange
The final stages of whites development are in action, and the reason for putting the knight on e2 clear. Kh1 unpins the f-pawn allowing him to make the push f4 undermining my center.
As predicted, I am unwise to take the pawn, as the variation 9...exf4 10. d4 Bb6 11. Bxf4 leaves white in a very strong position covering 5 ranks against my 3. <n>If any of my former students are reading this, they should note that in under 10 moves we have both completed development and are ready to start the middlegame, it is essential to prepare your forces in the beginning as rushing into attack early almost never pays off
Feeling concerned about the potencial problems on the kingside, I move to free up my queenside. This move will remove the powerfully placed bishop, allowing me to gain some control in the centre, and frees my c-pawn to help advances in the centre and queenside
White knows he will be doubling pawns, and chooses to do so on the b-file rather than the c-file. Clearly allowing me to capture on the c4 square leaves his center very weak
Supports the e-pawn if I manufacture a chance to push the d-pawn forward
Chooses to lock up the center. This move leaves me in a tricky position, I know he will attack down the g/h files, as indicated by his choice of opening, but both of my bishops are now blocked from helping to defend. My personal experience has shown that under an attack like this the best way to defend is attack
Planning to push the d-pawn and hopefully break his chain of pawns
Unable to prevent anything happening kingside, I drive forward through the middle hoping to gain counterplay against the attack.
White now has a very dangerous open g-file pointing straight at my king. From my point of view many things can go wrong, and white has a clear attack, bringing the h-pawn forwards with the help of his well placed f4 pawn.<n>From black's side the plan is to open the center as whites king is very exposed.
This seems counterproductive as I want to open the center, but I can't force the position open at the minute, taking the e-pawn only results in strengthening the line as I won't be able to challenge it with pawns. I also thought the pin on the knight prevented me from protecting the d-pawn sufficiently.
Repositioning the bishop, at the time this was played as a defensive move, and just waiting for white to commit to an attack.
If now Bxe7 then Nxg3  loses the bishop at least after Kg1 (Kg2 sets up fork after Nxf1, and Kh2 leaves check after Nxf1 so loses the exchange)
Interestingly after such an aggressive start from white I had feared a continuation such as f6. However this slightly quieter move leads to a forceful attack supporting the h6 pawn forwards.
Better than f6, as after 20. Nxg5 fxg5 21. Rg1 the pawn will fall, and white's attack is difficult to defend.
Unwilling to let the knight join the attack I chose to remove it. It also gives me a tempo to try and set up some sort of counterattack down the center.
About the best I could come up with, I now have lines open and aiming at the exposed white king. Despite this I do feel that my pawn advantage is a very slim one, if at all.
Bringing the knight back to support the attack, and with a threat to capture the c5 pawn. This is easily blocked though.
Pins the knight to the king, and will remove it next move. At this point I reasoned that fewer pieces on the board will mean a reduced attack.
In my view a slow move, but then again I knew I would take the knight regardless of the move played (within reason)
Played to allow my major pieces to defend the vulnerable g7 square against the threat of Rg1. However this wasn't the only threat white has in the position
This move would have to be played at some point, so might as well do it now. However the inevitable h5 comes next and a slow but unstopable threat is on the horizon. My only choice, as said many times before, is to attack
Penetrating into whites terratory, this also aims to clear the way for the manouever Q-d2-h6 if I have enough time. Though time is something that is decidedly against me
Naturally white has no incentive to play risky chess. His attack is well poised and I am rather floundering despite my material advantage
A obvious but good move. Rooks are very strong when lined up on the same file. White now has the option to do this either on the g-file, building pressure on the g7 pawn, or he can move to control the open d-file
This should be the final nail in the coffin, the threat of Rd8 is now very effective as my e7 rook is pinned to the g7 pawn to protect against checkmate in 1.
With the impending Rd8 I really want to move to f8, so the king can protect the e8 rook (since the e7 rook can't). But the threat of h7! makes that impossible.<n>No other feasible move to make, so just sit back and decide when to hit resign
The only move, I can now push whites king around waiting for him to block with his queen forcing a drawn endgame, or force a draw through repetition. Really a lifeline I didn't deserve having been outplayed all match, but chances like this don't come every day and I had to stay alert to make sure I don't slip up and gift my opponent a win in a drawn position
Note that 34. Kh4 leads to 34...Qe1 and 35...Qh1 forcing a queen exchange in 1-3 moves (depending on the variation). After which I can take the h6 pawn giving me a pawn advantage 5-3 in the endgame (after Rxb7), and thus potencial winning chances.
Winning the h6 pawn and defends against Qxg7#. The middlegame is now over, and a queen   rook endgame is in progress. As in any major piece endgame piece activity is far more important than material advantage. A well placed rook vs Inactive rook can be an advantage of up to 2 pawns, so this finale should be anything but easy to convert
Grabbing the free pawn quite correctly, but even a quick glance at the position shows that for the first time in the match black has gained a winning position. An advantage of 5 pawns to 3. Here it is tempting to move Ra8 defending the a-pawn, but this takes my rook right out of the game...
Rd8 however gives me a well placed rook in a dangerous position holding the open file, worth more to me than the isolated pawn on a7. Also since the pawn is not a passed pawn, (the b3 pawn can take it) my plan can't be to just push the pawns to the end of the board, supported by rook and queen
Continuing to grab pawns, but still with a material deficit. His rook is miles away from the action, while I now have a great opportunity to close a box around the white king using my well placed rook and queen.
The rook check is preferable to a queen check, as my rook is brought up the board to smother the king. A queen check would lead to the same result, but I would still need to bring the rook to this quarter of the board to seal checkmate, so further queen checks would be needed to allow the rook to arrive on the scene
1 of 3 moves available<n>1) Kf3, the game line<n>2) Kf1, leading to Qh1 and Qf3 and checkmate to follow<n>3) Ke2, leading to Qe3 and checkmate to follow<n>So in all probably the best move, but failing an awful blunder, white is lost
Closing the box, Only 2 options<n>1) Kg3, the gameline<n>2) Ke3 leading to Qe1 and Qf2#
! secures my opponents resignation, my queen and rook will either force checkmate in a few, or I can take his queen and ease to victory Q vs R. Either way white saves himself some time and resigns.<n>In all a good match, both players showed some really good positional play, in the face of losing material we kept to our guns and showed material isn't everything.<n>Any comments on the game are welcomed, and I understand Robin is doing his own annotation of the game, so look out for that.
Grabbing a pawn and allowing for Black to ...
Trap the bishop.
Bring the Queen in to protect the bishop and put the king on the run.  I've yielded the second rank (hanging pawn on b3) but is there enough attack potential to create a mating net?  Black's buried dark square bishop help's White's cause.
And now the king is on the run.  White's queen and bishop are stuck behind black's b6 pawn, and White's queen is stuck behind White's a3 and c3 pawns.  Unfortunately for White, Black's queen also protects his b6 pawn.
Trying to drive the Black king closer to White's camp.
Perhaps better is ...Rd6. After 23. Rcxd6+ exd6, Black's bishop has a little more breathing room.  Though the line could continue with 24. Re1+ and if 24...Kd7 then 25. Qb7+ makes things interesting.
This move gives Black a tempo to counter.
And Black wins back the rook and has brought his queen out.  Now how can White take advantage?  His bishop is pinned (as is Black's) and his king is exposed (though not quite as bad as Black's).  White can bring his queen into the action again pretty quickly.  The real advantage for White is his rook is on an open file while Black's rook is trapped and useless.
Sacrificing the pawn to draw the Black king farther from his queen and to the edge of the board.
And the Black king is mated as his queen watches with a wide open spectacular view!
Wanting to castle early.
Now I get the bishop for knight.
Now I am +5, and after my rook gets active, black is helpless.
! The bishop is pinned, not to a piece, but to checkmate.
Now black must push all his pawns, until he is forced to move the king or bishop.
Now I must use my king to stop black from queening.
Nice try, black.
Checkmate, extremely simple, the bishop protects the rook and stops Kf7, while the rook delivers the mate. Thanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed.
Marks the beginning of the Lavitan Gambit. This is totally new ground for me, meaning that my opponent (who calls this gambit his favourite) definatly has an edge
basic chess rules state that the queen should not come out too early, but it makes sense here - both protecting the f-pawn and chasing away the knight. Besides, I was just relying on the database at this point (though I guess there must be some refutation to 3...Bd6, which does not appear on the DB)
Black really doesn't want the knight on such a powerful square, so he chases the knight away (I don't really like these moves - it makes Black look weak with the pawns all over the place)
?! maybe Ne7 was better, once again allowing d5? I considered it, but dismissed it due to the fact that it seemed to cramp Black's style...
! not for long though. Black is forced to undevelop his queen to prevent Nxc7+
the bishop trade - usually not recommended, since Black is down in material, but it allows for castling for Black
Black does the same, and the king retreats to the other side of the board. Development is just about even, but White has the advantage, as he has more space to work with
putting the question to the bishop, who decides to initiate a fairly large trade (I have no idea whether White wanted to trade in the first place -.likely, as White is up in material)
now the pressure on Black has abated, and now he can focus on more important matters...
?! but maybe 16.c4 was a move left unpunished? I think better here would have been 16...d5, which would (partially) open up the d-file, which has my queen and rook. This was also why I moved the h-rook instead of the d-rook. This move can't be bad though - with the threat of the discovered attack...
thus giving the e-file to Black. I realise that White can force my knight to move again with his next move...
but the alternative, Nf5, didn't really make sense to me, as the knight had no purpose on that side of the board (I've heard that having too many pieces on one side of the board is supposed to be a bad thing, but why would white focus its attention to a measly two pawns on the kingside, especially when they pose no threat? well, maybe for the passed pawns, but it's too early for that)
forcing my knight to move once again (I'm thinking to myself here, 'goddamn en passant!'
!? not a waiting move anymore - Black hopes to weaken the defence around the king
?! Defending the pawn, as well as switching the queen-rook action to the e-file, but maybe g4 would have been a better idea
The last of White's pieces get into the action, with the threat of a discovered attack to boot!
! a three-way fork on the queen, the knight and the h-pawn - Black can't save then all! There is a way, though, for Black to cut his losses....
and expected. Black comes out of this another pawn down, but now he has an attack, whereas there isn't any clear attack on Black's king
Black could force this if White retreated to the a-file with Ra1+, then Ra2+, where White wouldn't want to accept a draw
the knight moves to dispose of another one of Black's pawns... but blocks the passed pawn - this is the opportunity Black was looking for!
and now it's time for the endgame - White's passed f-pawn verses Black's (soon-to-be) passed a-pawn. If both sides concentrated only on the pawns, Black would promote first, but then there's the matter of White's knight...
as such. If Black wants to win, he'll have to come over himself to get rid of the knight...
But this lets White's pawn promote first. Black could try to cut off the f-pawn instead, but that wouldn't work either, because Black would soon have no other moves but to move his king and the f-pawn along with the White king would easily promote
because White's king is closer to the h-file. The h-pawn will fall, and all Black can do now is hope for a draw
? I forgotten about g5's weakness, and planned to start to pressure on white's kingside with the two bishops.
Now, Nb3 shouldn't worry me. By delaying d5, I hope to take advantage of the open diagonals.
It seems a good set for an attack, isn't it?
... the b5 square was reacheable by the WN.
...and this, if it induces white to exchange BxN, provides my queen with a good square to escape and stops Nb5.
Weird, but how to save the dsb otherwise?
Last desperate attempt to provoke white and open the h column for a rook, if ever one can get to h8.
White threats an exchange I can't lose tempo to avoid. After Bg6, I have no plan.
Giving my king a semi-safe square to go, and inviting white to...
Very important. If Nxe4, NxN, dxN, Qg4 returns the attack to white!
A surprising non-inmediate sacrifice. If gxh3, Qh8, Kg2, g5, Rh1, Qh4, with a hard to stop attack with Rg8 and Kf8 to come.
The most critical response. Other moves that are playable here are: 9...Nxd4 10.Bxd4 Be6, although a plan involving 11.Bb5, with the idea of Ba4-Bb3 has proven quite successful for White, and 9...Bd7 10.g4 Rc8 11.h4, and it looks like White's attack will be faster than Black's.
10.Kb1 is a new idea here, though I'll hopefully play it in a future game and explain it more thoroughly there.
Believe it or not, I think this is the losing move. It's not really apparent but Black is left without an important tactical resource to counter White's defensive set up.
As a side note, only play this after 14...Qb8, if 14...Qb7, play 15.b3. It doesn't allow the following trick by Black 14...Qb7 15.Qa3 Bf5 16.Bd3 Rab8 17.b3 Qc6!, with the point that if 18.Bxf5 Qc3 and White is in trouble.
Stopping a5 and now allowing a Rook to come to c8.
Preparing Bf4 and freeing the Rook from the defense of the h2 pawn.
Forcing the exchange of one pair of Rooks.
If 19...Rxd1+ 20.Rxd1, White has stabilized the position and the Rf8 has no good places to come into play.
Threatening Qc6. If 22.Rxe7 Qc6 23.Bd3 Qxf3 24.Bxf5 Qf1+ (forcing the White King to come to the center) 25.Kd2 Qxf5 and Black is better.
One pair of Bishops has been exchanged and now White can be a little more relaxed. Black has to either exchange the dark squared Bishops or reroute to a less active diagonal. I can't blame him for choosing the latter.
If 29...Rf7, then 30.Kb1 and exf4 isn't possible on account of 31.Re7.<n>If 29...Kg7, then again 30.Kb1 but now 30...exf4 is possible but still 31.Re7+ is the move of choice, and after 31...Kh8, it's time to give the White monarch some breathing room with 32.a4
Finally breaking the pin.
Trying to win a pawn. But now it's White's turn to harass the King's castled position.
Making room for the Queen to come to f7.
32...Bg7 loses to 33.Re8 and Black has to give up the Queen to stave of mate.
Black resigned.<n><n>I'm still wondering why this line has fallen out of favor with top GMs, White just seems better and with a little defense he should hold on to the extra pawn and succeed in the endgame.
2 good bishop for white versus a possible castle...but 2 good bishop for black versus a castle done. It's necessary push away the c5 bishop with b4 and start an attack on queenside to be ready in every side; i think with the right plan the white is a little better
i think it's too soon to exchange a good knife with a not yet good knife
i think a beginner's wrong:<n>- 2 good bishop versus the castle<n>- a new problem, the G-column (a pawn it's now enough...)<n>- some time will be lost to save the queen from rook attack<n><n>it's a strange move for a good player...in general computers make this kind of wrong
another coloum for another pawn....it's really too
?! This is an inaccuracy, as if he recaptures with his knight I can chase it and get a strong center.
! If he blocks with his knight I win his rook, otherwise I win his knight.
I extricate my bishop.
Allows the pin, but the bishop can block it.
I add more pressure to the bishop.
! I'm going to give him this for even threatening mate when he's this far behind. In fact, I was kind of worried here as I didn't see a way to stop it. I found a mate though.
Even if there weren't a mate I could take his pawn.
Move not given in the database, but it seems efficient, obliging the queen to retreat.
Black prefers not to retreat his queen but this move suits me as well, blocking the queenside as I anyway planned to attack kingside and e file.
I hesitated long but if black takes a4, I'll have one pawn late but the a black pawn will block the file as good as mine and anyway, I'll attack within two or three moves, so that it won't have time to be a queen. If I fail my attack, the game will be lost anyway but with queen, knight, two bishop and one rook on e file, my attack should succeed.
Black must take with the rook and it will be vulnerable
Now the rook or the knight are doomed
Black prefer to loose the rook
Protecting the e knight and aiming at the center
White need the rooks on line 1 to defend against the queen but one rook can also support the attack. The e file will be the crucial place.
I thought that black would have plaid Nxe5 then Qxe5 menacing the e pawn and permiting Bg4 or Bh5
Black chooses to carry on attacking. White has a mate in 3 moves.
Hi all! Queen's pawns games are often considered to be less tactically sharp than games that begin with 1. e4. But this game certainly shows tactics can come in very quickly in some variations! This was a hard-fought game where white sacrifices material early to try to keep the initiative and not allow black to consolidate his material edge. It's a tense battle, with Black succeeding over time to force some of white's aggressive pieces off the board. So how did it turn out? Well, read on and don't forget to comment and rate.
Establishing a big center, but can it be maintained?
Black hits right away, and wild complications are in store.
White deprives black of castling rights and makes the king march forward, cutting off lines for his DSB and queen.
According to one opening database, Qc5+ and Qb3+ had both been tried, but neither one seemed sufficient to me. Qc5+ runs into 11...Ke6 to protect the knight, and the queen is under fire from the bishop. So my idea is to get the queen away from attack on either c4 or c5, and to get her onto b3, but with check.
Probably a mistake. The downside of 11.Qb4, was that it allows Kxf7, but after 12. Qb3+ Kg6, the position is still a little unclear.
Pinning the knight, which is black's extra piece, to the king, and making the king keep guard. This was blacks best piece, so it must be pinned. If the 13. gxf3 to get the piece back, ...Nxf3 is painful for white, as white is vulnerable to forks... For instance... 14. Kd1 Ke5+ 15. Kc2?? Nd4+, winning the queen.
With the knight pinned, the bishop now needs to save itself, keeping guard of d1 preventing either Rd1+ or O-O-O
!? Ripping the c-file open to further expose the black king. Throwing away a second piece, may not be entirely sound, but this one will be recovered in a few moves.
Black has little choice, since the Knight cut off the c7 square.
Controlling squares around the king, attacking the Ne5, xraying the Bh5, establishing control of c4 for the bishop, a nice centralized square...
Driving the king away. Note that 17...Nd5 18. Rxd5+ Bxd5 19. Qxd5+ Kc7 20. Bxe5+ is not at all good for black, as the white bishops and queen are deadly against the exposed black king.
Probably not the best move. The point is to put pressure on d7 and d8, so the Be5 is immune to the queen. I totally missed black's terrific response.
! Attacking the Be5, putting white on the back foot for a minute and also shielding d8 for the king.
When in doubt, but a rook on the 7th - knight is double pinned now - to the king and queen! Be5 is still immune.
Unpinning the knight, and renewing the threat on Be5.
Reinstating the pin on the knight and threatening to infiltrate via b7. But doesn't this allow...??
Yes, black will get the queens off, and one would think the attack would be over, but white wants the exchange on his terms...
! Putting the question to the queen.
And the LSB replaces the queen and keeps the pin.
? I think Be6 is a little more flexible, although black does still have issues, most notably ideas like Kf2, Rd1, f4, f5 and or e5, e6 in some variations. The rook is now threatened by the DSB.
Black moves to interrupt with Bb6.
Did not like Bxg7 here as Black's rook gets active after Rg8. This forces the Black bishop to move again to a worse diagonal. It needs to stay on the a3-f7 diagonal to prevent against Bxg7 followed by Bf6, eliminating black's rook from protecting the knight (Black needs to have Be7 as a resource if ever white plays Bxg7). So Black must leave the a7-g2 diagonal, which will allow Kf2, activating the rook while keeping guard of g2 in case the g-file opens for black.
Creating two outside passed pawns, and protecting the a2 pawn from the black sniper. 27. Kf2 a6 brings black some reprieve. Now, the pin is still in tact.
Black continues to exchange the attacking pieces.
Time to displace the bishop with the pawns!
I thought f5 would have been better, since there's a neat little trick in the following line: 31...f5 32. exf5 Bxf5 33. Rd5! Rxg2+!? 34. Kxg2? Be4+! 35. Kg3 Bxd5 and black is still worse, but has some hope to draw the endgame. However instead of 34. Kxg2?, Kf3! keeps white's strong advantage.
Only move, so as not to interfere with the rook. Notice white's control of all the squares on the a2-e6 diagonal.
White voluntarily gives up control of c4, because what can black's bishop do there? All black's pieces are tied down to the knight, and the king can't move out of the pin without dropping the knight, so white is free do to do what he wants. Black is not quite in zugzwang, but can't make any moves that improve his position.
With Rc7 and b7 to follow...
35...Bh5 wouldn't help any after Rd2 - again the bishop has no useful squares. But now there aren't enough defenders of the pinned knight.
And black resigns, as soon the b-pawn will promote. Thanks to my opponent who defended well, and made me search for the right continuations. A crazy game, showing the importance of active pieces and also pins. Hope you enjoyed. Please comment and rate, and let me know what you liked and didn't like.
I like this move because it's not very well known and it has almost the exact same motives as 1. e4. This move develops a piece and attacks two central squares, albeit it does not open lines for pieces. I play this move when I want to play aggressively because I can't hope to play this move after 1. e4 when I am allured into playing 2. Nf3.
This move prevents any further advances of the e5 pawn, blocks access to 2. ...d5, and opens lines for my bishop and queen if it should be necessary. I also have the standard Vienna Gambit position. My next move will be f4 regardless of most reasonable enemy moves.
This move attacks the white e4 pawn and develops a piece. I personally prefer 2. ...Nc6 as it frees up the f7 pawn that might make a difference in the game.
This move tears open the center with a side pawn in exchange for a weakened king-side. This is an aggressive move, but it's not as aggressive as the King's Gambit. The goal of this is to make a long-term queen-side attack or a short-term king-side attack. There are so many lines to this opening and the King's Gambit that there are thousands of books made for the opening in question, but nobody I know has analyzed both of these openings.
This is accepting the gambit. Black hopes to remain up a pawn the entire game but sacrifices his center-pawn. Other decline variations are possible including 2. ...d6 (not very good) 2. ...d5 (may be good), and 2. ...Nc6.
I play this move because it is like the King's Gambit. In that opening Black cannot play Qh4+, but this move right now prevents moving the pawn to g5 in order to protect the pawn. Alternative variations include d3, d4 or Bc4.
This move was likely played to undermine the e4 pawn. I do not recommend it as it blocks the bishop from moving and does not make any attempt to develop pieces.
I didn't want to move my queen to e2 because it would block the bishop. I also didn't want to play d3 as it would block the bishop as well,and I also wanted to play d4 later in the game. I played e5 to attack the knight. Black still has the pin on my king.
Black wants to further undermine the e-pawn. Nc6 would have also worked, but this gives a line for the bishop to pin the knight and queen.
If I had played d4, a pawn exchange would have left me in an uncertain position. By that I mean I wouldn't have been confident in my play at that point. This move alleviates the pin, and will also offer a queen exchange should I capture on d6.
This was a mistake. Black forgot about his knight on f6 because he became too entranced with my e-pawn. At least he got it out of the way! A better move would have been possibly Nd7, Ng5, or dxe5, but certainly not this.
I capture the Trojan Horse and the Greeks are left without hope. I am up the exchange, and it will be difficult for Black to retaliate at this point.
I would have traded queens first and then recaptured. This would have reduced some tension on the board and would have created a more open position where my knights would not have done as well. Either way, the pawns would be detrimental.
I attack with my knight to produce a quadruple fork. The best move at this point is to trade queens.
After this move, Black resigned because of 9. Nxc7+ forcing Black to lose the queen. Personally, I thought that this was a good game to become reacquainted to the opening. Beginners may learn from this game a stable offensive opening and to not make simple mistakes. Advanced players may have had some exposure to the opening after this game. Thanks for your time and I hope you enjoyed this annotation!
This is the Modern Steintitz variation, not very popular, because it blocks in the dark squared bishop and developes the knight to a less agressive square than the more popular Berlin and Morphy Variations.
The bishop flees.
Not the best move as it chases the bishop onto a very strong diagonal, better may have been d6, or even d5. Though this move does have the benefit of readying black's bishop for fianchettoing, if I play d3 at any time, his Bishop will be biting on granite.
Blocking the bishop and knight out of the strong g5 square and severely limiting the bishop's scope. Probably the best way to meet the threat of Ng5 because of the knight sitting on e7. Atleast it's better than f6 which allows white's light squared bishop to aim deep into the black kingside.
Challenging Black's center and trying to open the game up so that my lead in developement will have a greater effect.
Capturing the pawn. Not forced but 7...d6 will end with an unpleasant Queen trade, 7...f6 will weaken the Kingside and 7...Ng6 looks bad after    8. dxe5 Ngxe5 9. Nxe5 Nxe5 10. Qd5 which forks the Knight and Rook, and should the Knight move, it threatens mate on f7.
It was probably not best to trade the knights, because this gives up Black's only well developed piece and brings the White queen out. Normally you want to keep your queen safe and out of the center at the beginning of the game, but here Black doesn't have enough pieces to really threaten the Queen. And with the Queen out, it may be able to work with the Bishops to get a powerful attack. Better I think was 8...Ng6 9. 0-0 Nge5.
Not the best move, as it block in the white bishop, and it does not even keep the Queen out of d5, as the knight controls d5, but that is probably why it was played. Better I think was 9...Nc6 10. Qd5 Qf6 followed by Bb7 and Bd6 or Bc5 and Black's game is fine.
Developing the bishop and adding the potential for threats againt the enemy queen. Though 10. a4 Bb7 then probably 11. 0-0 Ng6 was probably the best way for me to continue.
Finally moving the knight away and freeing up Black's Bishop and Queen, and attacking the Black bishop.
Once more the fleet-footed Bishop flees from it's fearsome foes.
This move wins by threatening mate on f7 and capturing the rook on a8, but I think that 12. Bxf7  Kxf7 13. Qd5  Ke8 14. Qxa8 was also playable, but now Black has no isolated c-pawn, as you shall seem him get in the game.
Trapping the Bishop but it's not enough.
The Bishop is lost anyway, and his Rook can't flee because of mate on f7. And if I has just taken the Rook he could've messed up my pawns.
Now I'm up a rook and a pawn against a Bishop.
Recapturing. Now I have the open b and d files to work with.
Claiming the d file and lining the rook up with his queen, and saving the other rook to support my e pawn should my d file battery fail to win. Qd5 to win the pawn immediately and Rfe1 were also very good moves.
? Another blunder, this time carelessly allowing the Queen to fork King and Pawn. This also leaves the knight unguarded and weakens the kingside in general.
And the last Bishop the Bishop joins the party.
Trying to defend the d pawn.
Preparing to triple, after which the bishop would have to go back to c8 and my queen could then roam the board freely attacking whatever it wanted to and I could march the c pawns up the board to eventual queening. His defenses are stretched to the limit and he can't handle anymore threats,  so he resigned.
I offer to trade Queens.
White wants me to initiate the exchange.
...and White completes the exchange. At this point, I should play ...B-R4 to prevent the Knight fork.
To clear a square for the B, so I can discover an attack on the Knight.
This B is en prise, but I'm too intent on winning the Knight to notice immediately.
White guards his other Knight, presumably to castle without it falling to ...BxN.
The King&#039;s Gambit. This usually leads to a lively game.
? - But I can argue with this because there was a better piece developing move (7...Bg4 with Nd4 ideas). The drawback here becomes apparent in just a few moves.
A position you could easily see coming in your mind before playing 7...Nf6. There is enough in there for you to reject it. White has won back his gambit pawn, the double pawns are on an open file and can be easily attacked. The c7 pawn is getting hit. If it goes the d-pawn is passed and with the Queens off, that matters.
? - That&#039;s a baddie. An unforced exchange. The f3 Knight was going nowhere. Moving that h8 rook was worth a try (14...Rg8). If you have double pawns then cheer up, it means you have an open file for your Rook. Use it.
!! - I was attempting to swap off the f2 Rook with Rd2, but this is a waste of time. Or is it? As we shall see, I am a crafty player and this move inviting something spectacular...
Still some difficulties to overcome for White, his King is cut off. Black has an extra piece in play (his King).
Black releases the White King to win back his pawn and create his own passed pawn. Either the d-pawn or the f-pawn will fall.
That looks correct. I elect to give Black a passed d-pawn. The White King is handily placed to handle that. Also the Black Rook has to dance around that g3 pawn to get behind the running h-pawn.
See previous note. Black did not want to give this check but he needs the tempo. 29...Re2 allows me to play 30.Rf7 and the two passed connected g and h-pawns will walk home.
?? - That&#039;s wrong. Black just gives up a pawn for nothing. He may have been worried about the White King chasing the f-pawn. Yes it&#039;s a future idea but no need to give up a precious endgame pawn.
!! - Yes! It works. I figured it all out. The a and h-pawns dominate the Rook. If Black declines the Rook, 37…Rxh7 38.Ra5 Ra7 (forced. Note the a-pawn promotes with a CHECK.) 39. gxf4 is a simple win.
Black resigned, but definitely a well fought match if I do say so myself. Not my best effort but I hung in there till the bitter end.
I have always like the Reti. 1.Nf3. After making my first move, I noticed a game between Freddy and Joanne, where Freddy states, "In my opinion you should not play this line against anyone above 1950 rating." Get the game in the comment below.<n><n>So now I'm thinking "Should I have played 1.d4 instead?" On one hand I am playing an opening that Freddy suggests I don't play. On the other hand, I do have his game against Joanne as a reference, so maybe I can avoid some of the traps she may have fallen for. I will review and analyze that game before playing further.
3.d3. In Joanne's game, she played 3.d4. It's also the only move made by the masters on GK database. So in avoiding 3.d4, I automatically put myself out of the GK Master Database. I still have the GK regular database, but that may not be much help since the games are those ranked 1600 and above. I stated previously, "I do have his game against Joanne as a reference, so maybe I can avoid some of the traps she may have fallen for." Yet after 3.d3, I won't even have that. So unless this position transposes back into a line the masters play, I am on my own, in uncharted territory!<n><n>On the other hand, I need to go beyond making the moves the masters play, and understand why they make their moves! My analysis says, "Set up a sound position, maybe a KID reverse, with Nf3, and g3. Hold on the pawn, if possible, but be ready to give it back if Freddy applies too much pressure. So 3.d3 hinders Freddy from playing ...e4 chasing my knight when I put him back on f3. Alternatively, develop quickly and be prepared to castle long, if need be, to get my king away from the open g-file. The pawns on f2, g3, h2 and the fianchettoed bishop will give the king a good deal of protection if I short castle, but not necessarily after he plays ...h5, ...h4, ...hxg3, giving Freddy two open files to his royal highness."
4.g3. On 2nd thought, I am wary of bringing the knight back to f3 too soon as this will take development time. That knight will have moved 3 times, while I have no other furniture moved at all. I know how it is with these Master Mater guys: You give an inch of development, and they take the whole board! So if 4.Nf3 Bg7 or 4.Nf3 Be7 and black is ahead in development, with his king-side almost completely mobilized. Wait a minute, I thought black is supposed to be a half tempo behind...
So Freddy starts an imposing pawn center and I begin my first assault on that center. I am thinking of 6.c4 and if ...dxc4 7.Qa4+ followed by Qxc4. That would leave me with a mild attack on his c7. Then possibly drop Queen Esther back to b3, for a double attack on b7 to keep the c8 bishop harnessed. All of that is supposing he does not chase away the knight with h6 somewhere along the way, or throw a different wrench in my plans.
13.e4 ?? I need to develop my queenside and castle! Bd2 would be more appropriate.
I resigned as Freddy advised me of the forced mate threat (Qe2#). Yet I see it is not a forced mate as I have Re1.<n><n>Freedy, it's been a long while since we played and it is not fresh in my mind. I apologize, I was on vacation mode due to work and have not annotated until now. Can you refresh my memory, please? What was the forced mate?<n><n>Thanks a gain for the game, and for taking me way out of my comfort zone! Good Game!
Without time to think, this must have been the defense he had planned to use before the game began.
Planning the fianchetto...
...and completing it.
Doubling on the diagonal and clearing the way for castling.
White, ahead in development, tries to open up the position.
White is up a Pawn and Black has no good options. With his Q and KB both en prise, he's in a world of hurt.
An attempt to swindle his way out of trouble. If White falls for 11 PxQ?, 11...B-B1! saves the piece. 12 PxP BxP 13 BxB KxB 14 R-K1 ch would still leave White with a strong game, but Black would be able to drag out his resistance for a while.
White wins a piece. If Black moves his Q on B6 out of danger, White will play 12 PxR (Q) ch with a winning material advantage. Black resigns.
Consistent, and White might have hopes of renewing the attack against f7 by bringing his Q behind it at b3.
Threatens to come in at d4, but also has an eye on a5 if White does try Qb3 at some point.  The main purpose of this move, though, is to develop quickly.
Some good thinking here: White wants to dominate in the centre.  At the same time, the move cuts across Black's threat to play 4...Nd4.  Remember that if there is a useful tactic, then moving the same piece twice in the opening may be justified.  White felt the threat from a knight reaching d4 (striking at the Q at f3 and the c2-square) serious enough to require preventative measures.  The drawback is that now neither of White's knights can reach their most 'natural' squares.  Not a fatal drawback, but it will make life a little harder, all the same.  Better was 4.Ne2.
More ambitious than 4...Be7, and Black certainly does not want to block in his d-pawn with 4...Bd6?  This move prevents White's d-pawn reaching d4 for the moment.  Its secondary purpose was to clear the way for a King-side castle.  The drawback - though a minor one - is that it offers White a target.
Staying on the diagonal that strikes at f2.  Black had perforce move this piece a second time, or lose it.
(?!) Not so good, even though Black has to move a second piece a second time.  Although this costs Black time, White is not profiting very much thereby.  True, White gains some space on the Q-side, but his pawn formation becomes a bit ragged in the process, and his pieces are still at home.
(!?) OK - not necessarily the best.  Black had good alternatives in 6...Ne7 or 6...d5!  The problem with the text move (i.e. the move played) is that if the bishop retreats to e2, this knight is left rather out on a limb.  Of course, such a loss of time by the bishop doesn't make this an attractive proposition for White.
Not bad: preparing to retake on c4, developing the knight with a gain in time.  Although Black didn't really have make this concession, he decided that on balance, to rid himself of his 'off-side' knight it was worth giving White something.  Black will retain a small lead in development.
(!) Developing, with gain in tempo.  White's Q has just one square available.
(!?) A deliberate invitation to White to take the g-pawn.  At the same time, Black threatens to take the c4-knight, and then win a pawn (11...Bxc4 12.dxc4 Nxe4).  Better, however, was simply to castle.
(?) What Black was hoping for.  Much better would have been first to take on b6: 11.Nxb6! axb6 12.Qxg7!? (Now it's OK!) 12...Rg8 13.Qh6 Rg6 14.Qh4 (Qd2 is also OK) 14...Nd7 15.Qxd8 Kxd8 with a reasonable game for White.  Although from Black's point of view this would have been something of a concession, in creating the chance for White to go wrong, the risk was not such as to compromise his whole game.  If White went wrong, Black got a large advantage; if White played correctly, at worst Black got a roughly even game.
(!) Now inviting White to help himself to the bishop as well!
During the game, I thought maybe White ought to leave the bishop alone in view of what follows.  But after 12.Kf1 Rg8 13.Qh6 Rg6 14.Qd2 Bxc4 15.dxc4 Bxg1 Black obtains a strong attack anyway.  It seems for that the slight risk Black took in playing 10...Be6, he has reaped a larger dividend than expected!
(!) Now Black's scheme takes shape.  He wants the Q to go to h6, whereat the knight forks K and Q at g4.
Actually, I rather think I overlooked 16...Qf6+ here, which would have picked up the bishop.  But as it happens, this move is very nearly as good, if rather 'too' subtle.
At first blush, this is a simple oversight - and it probably was - but in fact the oppressed prelate had no decent moves anyway.  E.g. 17.Be3 Qxe4 threatened the bishop again and ...Rxg2; 17.Be2 Qg4 (or even ...Qxe4 at once), and the same response meets 17.Bc1.
With a material deficit of -6, White is busted, of course.  Naturally, White fights on.  For the remainder of the game, Black tries to win as efficiently as possible; White tries to throw obstacles in his path.
Sticking to his plan.
(!) From an objective standpoint, this isn't really the best, but I was rather taken by the idea.  The 'correct' move was 20...Qd3+, with the same ideas as in the note to Black's 19th.  But this move also guarantees a decisive simplification.
Good thinking, even at this late hour, seeking to disrupt Black's plan.
(?) A mistake that gives Black a forced mate.  The problem is that the king has fetched up on a file about to be opened, whereas 24...Kg1 would have left the King on a file about to be closed (24.Kg1 fxg5 25.h5).  Not that 24.Kg1 would have saved White in the long run...
Going for broke.  If he fails to find a quick win, then bxa7 could prove very embarrassing for Black.  But Black had already seen a forced win.
Relatively better was 28.Kg1.  True, it makes practically no difference in this game, since Black had mate in two either way.  But in general when faced with a forcing line, it is usually better for the defender to play the move that will give him the most options after the enemy's reply.  After 28.Kg1 Rf2 White would have had a completely free hand (29.bxa7).  In another game that might have allowed White to turn the tables.  Not here, though...
Although the game involved some strategic decisions, Black relied heavily on tactics to seize and then to increase his advantage....
White has thrown me for a loop with 3. c3. I don't have any chess library to speak of, and this move isn't in what I have. So I'm winging it with the GK DB for now. Edit: Note that now black's knight attacks the white pawn on e4, but if black captures it, say with 4. ... Nxe4?, white replies 5. Qa4+ and 6. Qxe5 and black loses his knight.
Ah, there's a bit of a lame attack on the white pawn at c3, and a bit sneakier, pinning that pawn to the rook enabling 13. ... Nxb4.
Fact is, I'm pretty much done for. I am hoping to trade everything off in such a way that white has to sacrifice a piece to stop the promotion. That would leave black with two pawns for a piece. One more promotion threat, one more sacrifice, and black is up a pawn. Yeah, not gonna happen, but maybe if I can threaten it, or if my opponent makes a mistake along the way, I can still get a draw, or a lucky win out of it. Maybe. Worth playing on to find out.
This is an unorthodox response to the Reti, more common are ...Nf6; ...d5; ...e6; ...Nc6 and ...f5
Black had the opportunity to transpose back into a relatively normal line but instead makes this move. As a general rule a piece should not be moved twice in the first about 12 moves, especially if its a wing pawn.
Now white has a strong foothold in the centre.  This becomes important later as black tries to challenge it but doesn't have the firepower and white crashes through on the uncastled black king with a stunning attack.
I can't remember whether I had a good reason for playing this move at the time, but looking back it is a pretty appalling move, the queen is on a bad square and relocates in a few moves anyway and she also blocks in the kings bishop
Black has various opportunities to develop one of his knights or his kings bishop. This pawn move is unnecessary (5.Bg5 loses tempo for white although it does create a weakness in black's structure, but 4...Be7 is much better for black)
perhaps not the best move, but I felt at the time that it was best to oppose blacks a pawn
This kingside pawn expansion might be OK if black had pieces developed and was planning on castling queenside, but right now its just another waste of tempo and weakens the kingside squares, particularly h5
Simply building up an advantage in development which black seems desperate to hand to me anyway, I have read somewhere (I think in a GK annotation) that the best way to meet unorthodox openings with lots of pawn moves is to develop as quickly as possible.  I have a feeling my opponent was simply trying to throw me out of book, so I think this is the best way to meet that sort of thing. (In any case, I don't really have much opening knowledge except in the Ruy Lopez and, to a lesser extent the Petrov)
6...Bg7 would follow logically from blacks 5th move, perhaps he is planning Ba6 to harry my queen and potentially stop me castling kingside.  Better were ...Bg7 and ...Ne7
And black finally gets off the back rank.  Taking a look at the positions now, white is well developed except his poorly placed queen and trapped kingside bishop, he has a vice-like grip on the centre and his c-, d- and e-pawns are very commanding.  He is ready to castle queenside which can be done perfectly safely despite his queenside pawns having moved.  Black, on the other hand has 7 pieces at home, a weak kingside, and pawn-structure generally, with holes at h5, f6 and d6 of which only f6 is adequately defended.  His king can't castle for at least 3 moves (4 if he wants to castle queenside, which would be safer given the state of his kingside) and his pieces are hemmed in, with none of them able to advance beyond the 6th rank.  White is in control.
Makes my 4th move look silly, which of course it was, the queen had to move to make way for the Bf1 and is also safer off the a6-f1 diagonal.  I think this is the best place to move
development was necessary, but this just allows the knight to be chased, either back home or out to h5 where it will be hastled for a few more moves and become a liability as black tries to get into a middle game.  The bottom line is that this piece should have developed ages ago, but right now the best place for it was e7
the d pawn was the one to push here, giving the black pieces a bit more breathing room and punishing white for delaying e5 by making a good escape square for the knight on d7 and also guarding e5.  This also makes blacks light square bishop horribly bad and also weakens the queenside dark squares generally.  This is the second move by the b pawn - another loss of tempo
here comes the e5 push - one move late, but the white centre is beginning to roll towards the black king and black has no space to co-ordinate a defence
It was this or ...Ng8, the text move is perhaps slightly less accurate, but black desperately needs to avoid un-developing
A pointless, no, downright bad move.  Allows black some counter-play on the queenside and does absolutely nothing constructive in the process.  Better was 12.cxb5
Black misses the opportunity to capitalise on white's mistake once again, ...bxc4 was the move.  This allows 13.axb4 Bxb4 14.Bd2 Be7 15.Rxa4 with a clear advantage for white
The mistakes are flying in!  This move is not too bad, it threatens the offside black knight but again completely overlooks blacks queenside counterplay.  I suppose thats one of the troubles of trying to hold down 30 chess games, an LLB course and some sort of social life all at the same time.
The obvious move, now black has a fairly dangerous looking, supported pawn on my third rank, it is an asset which he needs to consolidate and work with if he is to have a chance in this game, but his king needs to find a home first, on the queenside where black is in some measure of control, because white rules the kingside and the centre.
This is dubious, black wants to postpone his knights departure from h5 for as long as possible, which is perfectly reasonable, but ...f5 is better here.  White is practically forced to make the en passant capture, otherwise his knight is knocked back to d2 and black is starting to gain some sort of initiative
and that is not how to do so, ...Nf6 was better, exchanging the defender of d6 which can then be captured with development.
Poor move.  16.d5 was the move, followed by Nf6  winning the black queen and sitting on black's doorstep!
The best move for black, now white can still play d5, but although he will win the black queen and have a frightening attack, black should win material overall and, if he manages to weather the white onslaught, should have a reasonable endgame.
White was actually probably best to take the bishop here, I spent ages on this move and then decided on this, I'm still not sure if it is most sound, but it worked out OK
Black is probably better after 17...Qa5 18.Qxa5 Rxa5 19.Nf6  Kd8, the text move smacks of materialism and allows white to continue with a strong attack on black's centralised king
I was tempted to play 18.Nf6 , but that would be a bit too hasty and black would be able to defend and have a reasonable endgame, the text move is most accurate for continuing the attack.
Black is looking to prevent 19.c7 which would queen, however, he is better to play 18...Bxf3 and allow 19.c7 Bxe4 20.cxd8Q  Kxd8 where black is losing but white has lost both his knights and his attack is at an end
The obvious move, forcing off the black queen and maintaining the menacing pawn presence on c5 and d6, white's attack looks dangerously close to being winning.
By far the best move, white brings another piece into the attack with the threat of mate on d7, leaving black with a few distasteful options.  Black can avoid mate but only with heavy loss of life.
Thanks to peteywheatstraw for the game.  Although it was very unconventional gameplay, it gave rise to plenty complications and tactics and also some lessons.<n>1)Develop, pawns can't win games on their own<n>2)Meet unorthodox openings with development<n>3)Capitalise on your opponent's mistakes<n>4)Don't get greedy for material, especially if your king is under attack
I started the Scandinavian Defense here.  I wanted to give it a go, a good test, to see if I can get a good game out of it.
A queen fork is scary.  However, this woman has a suitable strategy.  She waits until she can get into a position where she could cause a trade.  Notice, though, that I haven't taken the pawn.  studentofkerry had claimed the file already with her rook. I have challenged her claim and now I'm waiting for the perfect moment to claim the e file for myself.  It has become a waiting game, where one of us could make a mistake.
Here is where I grabbed the second rank -- the seventh rank to me playing as black.  Studentofkerry is now doomed to lose.
Here, we moved to Checkmate.  I feel sorry, of course, but she will continue to play chess and win more games.  I guess you have to lose many games of chess before you attain Grandmaster status.
Playing this after Bb5, rather than immediately means black can't immediately retake on d5 with his queen after the exchange of bishops.
Probably incorrect. White now gets to grab some space by playing c4. Better may have been to play Nb6 first, which covers c4 and also might allow to take with the queen instead.
Only Nc8 would allow to avoid the upcoming fork to win the pawn on b7, but that seems way to passive, especially compared to this square, which is an excellent outpost for the knight.
Here I had the opportunity to defend b7, but since white has removed his bishop from defense of b2, it seems to me that I should be able to get enough activity by bringing my rook to b2 in case white takes on b7, especially if all my pieces are well developed.
This is a bit strange to me. Now I get to take on b2 and be out of the opening stage relatively care free. If white would have taken on a7, he would at least be a pawn up.
After 16. Rxb1 Nxc3 17.Nxc3 Qxd4 18. Qxc7 Bxc5, white is down a pawn. Taking with the knight instead of the rook prevents that, but now black's pieces are looking more active.
This move means that Nxe3 xe3 Bxe3 winning a pawn is now prevented, since the check was necessary to ensure that the pawn could be taken before securing the knight on e4
Bishop is now threatened because of the pin on the f-pawn and the move brings out the queen to more threatening squares as well.
Protecting the white bishop, as Nxe3 can still be met with Qxe4, but because of the pin, there is no urgency for white to get his bishop to safety either.
The queen is now truely threatening to harass the white king and with the white queen completely unable to help, it is looking dangerous.
defending f3 with Kg2 doesn't look great either, as that would allow Rb2+. At least this might create some counter play for white if the black attack is not decisive.
I want to put as much pressure on d4 as possible. So one plan to do that is to put the king's knight on f5. However, white can usually eliminate it with a timely bishop exchange.
Even though I have completed half my development this seemed to be the best moment to exchange as moves like ...Bd7 or ...Qb6 did not seem to be as forcible as the text move. I.E it creates a weakness
I am thinking that white would want to aim for a b4-b5 push so I am preventing it now with this move and the next.
white has good pressure on b5 so it is important that I take care of the weakness. Besides clearing the c-file for my rook it does prevent the immediate b4-b5. The trade off is that I have a poor knight.
This retains the bishop and keeps the white rook pinned to the defense of e3.
limits the LSB on d3 and creates a potential strong point for attack on f5.
White so far has managed to maintain the balance in the position but things are about to change quickly. My goal is to slowly improve my piece development without creating further weakness in my position. While at the same time hoping for white to overextend himself somehow.
heading to the defence of c3 via b1
anticipate an attack on f7 and clears the desk for the queen to assist on the f-file.
The game down a lot at this point. It was here that my opponent offered a draw. However, I decline because I hope to slowly outplay my opponent.
x-raying f5. I hope to exchange queens on f5 to clear the 3rd rank for my rook on c3. Giving it greater scope.
I decide to go for it. After all someone has to, even if it ends in a draw. Though I see to potential for a possible ...e5
Black has more than enough compensation for the pawn. My Bishop pair along with the queen will easily outplay white's queen and rook.
pinning the rook to the back rank
attacking the bishop and pawn
the semi vacant center is far more useful to the bishop pair.
White has to keep his rook on the back rank so there is no threat of mate for white. However, the black bishops will start a witch hunt on the queen.
The queen exchange lessens the threat of mate for the time being.
With the two pawn advantage and bishop pair black wins easily
intro: the game is characterized by an aggressive attack on the exposed king by white, rated 1840, resulting in a delay of development, and a shift of focus away from center. black answers by playing for queenside space, his position gradually improves to compensate for the material deficit, squeezing out his opponents mobility until tactical resources can be secured, creating a nice finish. ----
12. d3 ?! this inaccuracy frees the bishop, but 12. d4 was better - since my bishop is pinned and can't win the pawn - it demonstrates white's focus on the king, rather than on the center.
14. Bf6 ?! now white wins the f6 square, but again, like 12. d3, this move is focused on the king's corner. better was the central 14. Bf4 which still retains the advantage. as a result, my opponent allows the following clearance...
my general strategy is to gain space, squeezing out my opponents mobility, with focus on the knights. here, i take away b5, weakening the knight on c3 which will need to find a stronger square.
21. Bf5?!  to provoke g4. i wanted to finish development and prevent the rook from infiltrating. white could not find any tactical way to take advantage of this mistake.
27...a5, there are some winning lines that initiate with Bb7+ available for the next couple of moves, but were quite beyond black's ability to calculate the risk.
34. Ka1?! to help stop promotion threats, other squares for the king give white chances for longer survival.<n>perhaps 34. Ka1 was played to lure Re1+?? i do have a back-rank mate, but the knight on f3 defends. eventually i found a complicated way to wrest it from its guardians.
34...Bxf3! simply crushing. the bishop cannot be taken: if 34. Rxf3/gxf3 then its 35...Re1+ 36. RxR RxR#
35. Kb1, the king flees for c2 to prevent mate. i need to stop him, but 35...Be3 and i am blocking my own way.
I have to admit it... I knew I was up against an opponent who plays 200 pts above me. Going in I researched some of his games. He's a very clever and solid player; my work was cut out.... so I started with my strength.  The French  against his Queen Pawn .....
now with Bd3 White deviates from the main opening lines staking out the long and open diagonal and ready to Castle.
An attempt to stifle Whites King side development and  get the black Bishop out.
A trade encouraged by Black to open up the closed game and eliminate the strong white Bishop.
Pow! A nose punch. Time to wake-up. Black becomes very aggressive going after White's king side before White can take advantage of his superior development. Timing and speed become critical in this bout.
The Knight retreats and Black now controls the king side.
Black moves to dissuade any counter play to an attack that is getting ready to strike a serious body blow.
The Knight move is too late. Black give a pawn to open up Whites belly with a kidney punch
Trying to free the queen.....
A huge uppercut with the Bishop now on the winning diagonal has white shaky in the knees and unable to budge. He is defenseless and just  waiting  for the.......
and here it comes....  the knockout blow....
White can do nothing. Black plans Nexg3  and mate in two. <n>I enjoyed this game and hope any readers do as well. <n>Comments are welcome as I'm not sure how much of this game was strong play by black as opposed to weak moves by white.<n>Thank you
Chooses not to take. A mistake I think because instead of losing the a pawn black loses the b pawn
[TR]<n>This is an English Opening (1.c4), and can turn into independent lines only found in the English, or can transpose into one of many different types of KID. If you play 1.c4, your opponent can play 1...c5, and in fact there is a "Symmetrical English" mainline that goes for about 10 moves with Black exactly copying White.<n>Here, if you play 3.e4 then I pretty much have to play 3...d6 (to prevent 4.e5) so this will commit me to some sort of KID setup. If you instead play the "normal" 3.d4 then I have another option in 4...d5, the Grunfeld Defense, which is extremely tactical. Playing 3.Nf3 keeps options open for both sides but also limits your choice of attacks against a possible KID setup (for instance, the Averback Attack would not then be possible for you, but plenty of other stuff would be). After this 3.Nf3 Black could then choose all sorts of other stuff based on 4...c5 (a Benoni or a delayed Benko Gambit for instance. I think Grandmasters like Reti and recent Soviet champion Gulko used to play stuff like 3.b3 here too, but I don't know much theory.
[DK]<n>I'm weighing d4 versus Ng3. d4 feels good in that I can gain control over more of the center and in response to the impending e4, I have the flexibility of either guarding or pushing d5 to make it difficult for you to develop you queen knight. Also it opens up my bishop file which can lay the groundwork for an attempted exchange with your king-side bishop. I would be a little concerned about defending all those pawns, but not unduly so. Ng3 has the advantage that I can castle sooner, but I don't feel any pressure at all to castle yet, so I think it can wait. I'm not sure if there are other moves I should consider, or lines that I should be looking further down.
[TR] <n>By the way, THIS is the absolutely critical stage where both players decide on their strategy for the next many moves. Don't just play any old move at this point. You have committed to Qside expansion with the great move b2-b4, and there are many ways to continue, just try to form the long term plan for your piece placement now.<n>I recall that Walter Korn in MCO13 didn't like my move Ne8 here, but I disagree. It has been played by Kasparov and it has many good points; the fact that it doesn't inhibit the c4-c5 advance (like it would on d7) is a weakness, but White can force c4-c5 in any case, so I'm not concerned about that.<n>One setup for White is Be3, Ne1, f3, Nd3 and c5. Another involves Ba3, Qb3, c5 and Nb5. Another is to play on the Kside after f7-f5 by Ng5 and if f5-f4 then Bg4. There are many more as well.
[DK]<n>Okay. Let's start looking for tiny chinks in your armor. Your rook on f8 is terribly immobile. Possibly I could exert pressure on it through the a3-h8 diagonal if I could depose your d6 pawn. Your queenside pawns are a little backward, if I could gain control of the b file and again depose your d6 pawn, placing a pawn on c5 with R on b1, then I could constrict your queenside development (forcing B to guard b7). Your knights are backward. I do not know how to take advantage of this. A pawn on c4 would block all movement for your e7 knight, but not worth exposing my king...
[TR]<n>That reasoning all sounds good. I'm playing a safe move to keep the N (or B) out of g5, because my plan for playing f7-f5 is messed up by 10...f5 11.Ng5 f4 12.Ne6 BxN 13.dxe Rf6 14.c5 etc. My move ...h6 is very slow and gives you the initiative on the Qside, but it is the safest way to continue a clear plan without making the tactics too muddy. Comming up: Kh8 (getting the K off the White Q's curent diagonal), f7->f5->f4, Rg8, g6->g5->g4, Ne8->f6->h5, Ne7->g6->h4....attack!!!...um, if you don't kill me on the ignored Q-side first :)
[DK]<n>I've convinced myself that the crux of my attack must be against d6. If I can unlodge d6 and remount an attack against the center (e5) before your pawns come raining down then I feel I might have a chance. It feels like a race that is critically hinged on timing. I was looking for moves that might hinder your attack, but the best defense I can come up with is a quick counterattack. If I can force you to make defensive moves then your attack will necessarily be slowed.
[TR]<n>I like the moves you are making. Your thinking corresponds to how I understand White's strategy in the KID. the things that are different that I see here are this: Normally, White's K knight moves immediately to allow for f2-f3 strengthening the center. I came very close to switching tactics here and taking in the center, but I want to prepare a little bit more for it. With Rf7 I can close the center (f5-f4) or open it (f5xe4), I block the diagonal between K and Q and I prepare to play the B to f8 where it will eventually help protect d6.<n>----------------------<n>Ok, so after your Bishop move I decided to take in the center for various reasons: 1) Because you left the Knight on f3 and didn't try to support the center with f2-f3, my "normal" KID attack of f5-f4 then a pawn storm doesn't really work. 2) Again, due to not moving the Knight from f3, yu have built up a very strong initiative on the Q-side and if I just go about "business as usual" then I am surely going to be behind when the attacks start to show their teeth. Lastly, quiet development by me could have tactical problems (ie, 13...Bf8? 14. Nxe! dxe 15.d6  -).<n><n>[DK]<n>That was unexpected. I was planning something along the lines of 13. .. f4, Nc5 _, Nxc QxN, cxd Qxd, b5 Qf6, d6 Nxd, Bxd Qxd, Bxf , although I'm not entirely sure it's sound (not sure if I could have forced regaining material after sac'ing my knight)
[TR] This is why my Bishop retreated all the way back to c8 on the last move. I considered that you may have also played Bb2, in which case I needed to retreat the N. I am not working up much counterplay, and I'm afraid that I'll quickly be in a worse position unless I can activate my pieces better than this. My 13...fxe was probably a poor move, as now my structure isn't coordinating very well with my pieces. If your pawn was still on e5 and mine had gone f5->f4 then I would have a much better handle on what's happening here.
[DK] Deferring opening up Qside with cxd. That threat is not going away and the tide of the game is returning to central control (e.g. the long black diagonal). Tactically, if dxN, I will fight for the pawn and threaten your bishop with Bb2. I think I'm okay with a knight exchange followed by fxN. If you do it immediately, then Ne6 _, fxe loses the knight? With no black pawn to block the e file, I can advance and with say Bd3 and Qc2 threaten g5 (which looks hard to defend). Does that seem reasonable?
[TR]<n>I think the exchanges were probably best under the circumstances--for both of us. This is the position I was playing for when I played the Q check, feeling that I was in a worse ending that I may be able to hold to a draw. You have every right to play for a win, you will very likely come out with a healthy pawn, and my compensation will not be much--I expect to have either a very active rook, or a more active King, and do my best to draw based on this activity. ------------ You played before I could finish and post my comment above. Looks like I may get the active R. If you had played something like 27.cxd cxd 28.b5 then I was planning 28...Kf6 29.Rxe Ke5 holding the R to guard your e pawn and threatening Kd4 with a double attack on both your pieces. This activity was what I was banking on, although it isn't much. Now I hope that my pieces will be able to take up reasonable positions and help me to hold the draw, but I am still not out of the woods.
[TR] They're all good things to be considering. On my end of course I am searching for possibilities to draw. These kinds of positions where Grandmasters either resign because they can see it's clearly lost or they agree to a draw because they see it is clearly drawn. Guys like us duke it out just trying to find our way through the minefield of blunders.<n>Here are some things I know about this type of position: 1) If I can trade all the pawns off the board one for one, then I can sac my B for your last remaining "extra" pawn because R B vs R is a theoretical draw (unless my King position is exceptionally bad). 2) The "same-colored" Bishops make it harder for me to draw than "opposite-colored Bishops" would. 3) There are strange material-down endings that I can shoot for in some variations that are theoretical draws....one of these is trading everything off the board except for the 2 Rooks and your a and h pawns, as long as they aren't very advanced I can supposedly hold the draw 2 pawns down.<n>---------------------------->;I wrote all of that while you were playing 36.d6. This is definitely the move that was coming....I just didn't know when it would come. If you have calculated out a way to push the pawn through, then clearly it is the right move. If not, then it is a very committing move, as now the B cannot defend it anymore on a Black square. I expected Kh2 or Kf2 to be consistent with your h3 move. In one line it makes a big difference: 37.Rb5  Kf6 38.Rd5 Bd7 39.Ba4? at first looks very strong, except for now 39...Rc1  (because the K is still "checkable") 40.Kf2 B
these is trading everything off the board except for the 2 Rooks and your a and h pawns, as long as they aren't very advanced I can supposedly hold the draw 2 pawns down.<n>---------------------------->;I wrote all of that while you were playing 36.d6.

xB 41.d2 Bxd2 42.RxB and pawns are now equal.
[DK] Yes, I was originally going to h3, to avoid exactly the line you pointed out, 39. Ba4? Rc1 , 40 Kh2 BxB!, but this, I believe can be avoided better by 39. Rd1 ... Also moving to h3 opens up possibilities for getting stalemated on h3 or even checkmated on the h file. Furthermore, barring those dark thoughts, it doesn't protect my king as much as I had thought since your pawns can exchange and blow my pawn cover (I think).
His counter basically soon had us seesawing between trying to get the other's queen and trying to move our queen out of danger somehow.
This was pretty nice I thought. If he didn't take the knight with his rook (and did something like Rxa2) I could've taken Rxh5 which just looks like an awesome mate.
3. c3 is often played in this system, although I prefer to play Bd3 or Nf3, to develop a piece, or 3. f4 is more aggressive.
4. Nf3 is good, developing a piece. However it does block the f pawn. I quite like the idea of playing f2-f4, Nf3, Bd3, 0-0 and then the Bc1 can come into play Bc1-d2-e1-h4. If black wasn't careful white would build up a good attacking position. In this game white's bishop on c1 is not very well placed.
Black breaks the symmetry!
5. Nb1-d2 is another sound developing move, but doesn't help the problem of what to do about this bishop on c1. b3 followed by Bc1-a3 was another option, but by moving the knight from b1 this is no longer an option as the knight defended a3.
7. Nhf3 is a good move. It was the only square the knight could move to.
It is better to put the knight here than retreat it.
But white's attention switches back to the king's side. Bb2 was better, or continuing development with moving Bf1. Generally it is better to open up the position after developing pieces and castling. f3 allows black to open up the position.
Nothing wrong with this move. I think it is best followed up with Bd3, 0-0 and e3-e4, if possible, to free the Bc1.
This check shouldn't achieve anything. Black should retreat the king to h8 and then play Rf8-g8. It is not a good move by white.
This is a good move, advancing the knight to a better square.
This is a good move too, moving the rook to a better square.
This is good, as it opens up the g file for white to attack down.
This is an excellent move, as no matter where the black king moves to, white will be able to check to win the black queen. If the black king goes to the g file then white can play Ng5xe6 and give a discovered check to the black king from the white rook on g1, while simultaneously threatening Ne6xd8. Black can't save the queen.
Because if the black king moves here or to h8 then white plays....
Black moakes the most of it and attacks the white knight.
This is a good move too, the rook had to move.
This is a terrible move! Black could just take the rook with the knight on d7. I think the best move was Rf4-f2 check. There are only two squares the black king can go to. If the black king goes to g1 then white wins with Ng5-f3 check, forcing the king to h1 and then white can play rook takes Bishop mate. If black plays Kh1 immediately, I think black is still mated. It takes a bit longer, but basically white moves her bishop to b2 or a3, plays Nf3 and Ke2 to discover an attack by the Rook on a1 and white eventually plays Ra1xBg1 in most variations.
I don't think it makes much difference if the king goes to d1 or d2
and this move saves the d pawn.
This was the only square the king could move to.
Probably best under the circumstances.
I tend to prefer Kc3 so if black takes the rook on b3, white can take back with the king, attacking the other knight on a3. This then gives white time to advance one of her pawns.
This is a mistake, as the bishop was guarding the knight on g5. She has to move the knight before taking the pawn. Kc4 to support the advancing pawns was another good move.
It is a good idea to advance pawns in an endgame like this.
and now white throws away another one. Ba3, protecting the pawn was called for.
Keeping the king and bishop together is a good idea.
This moves looks silly, allowing black to take the bishop on h8, but...
But white had cleverly spotted that if he takes the bishop, the final position is a stalemate. many thanks for reading this. I hope you enjoyed it. Please leave a comment or two and rate it on the star system.
The Jackal Attack
Now would I pick the best move? The short answer is 'No'. Best here is 11.Nf5! while 11.Nxe6 is also very strong. My excuse is that I was playing my moves very fast - my wife left me - I had to catch a train - but most of all - I wanted to 'save up' the N-f5 move.
But this is also very strong - and more in the  'coffee-house' style.
Now 16.Rxe5 wins the queen. The trouble is that the chances of beating the 21 move deadline will probably evaporate after 16...Nxe5 17.Rxd8 Ng6 because of a check with ...Bh6
Now - here I had my chance - and I blew it. It's a mate in three after the obvious 18.Qe8+ Kxf5 19.Qf7+ Nf6 20.Qxf6 Kg4 21.Qg5#
I was too keen to keep my precious knight.
did consider exchange with bishop but wanted to force mate
now looking to win queen with knight to g6
black sees it
black wants to force pressure on g3
and monuvers blacks king
By the look of it, preparing a d4 break
Black ignores the potential d5 break and continues development
now Black need not worry about the d4 break anymore... he now need to worry about what plans White may have for the queen
Black plans to castle next move, so he feels perfectly safe playing this move. It gives Black a head-start on a future queenside pawn storm, if he chooses to do so.
but first he must do something about his bishop. Simply defending it (e.g. 9...Qe7) isn't the best idea, since White doesn't need to exchange. Instead, he might play a move like 10.d5!, and White seems to have the better position then. Also, the other squares for the bishop didn't look like they suited it, so...
I decided to exchange here.
White strikes first! the knight is obviously heading towards the c5 square, ready to exchange knight for bishop. It can't be stopped if White is determined to get there (14...Qe7 15.d4!), so Black might be better off letting it get there. So with the move he has before that, what can he do?
?! There are probably better moves than this in the position, but I was concerned about king safety. This does, however, take the king off the diagonal of White's remaining bishop. The Gameknot analysis didn't mark this move as an inaccuracy, but the advantage (which had been pretty close up until now) jumped from -.36 to -.76, which means that White has the advantage.
Although Gameknot has nothing bad to say about this move, I wonder whether White may have been better off playing 16.d4. After all, c5 was a good outpost for the knight, and with this exchange Black has the knight pair, whereas White has a bishop and knight, and the knight pair is better than that, I believe.
!? Following in White's footsteps on his 10th move. Black hopes to use the f-file to his advantage
White brings his last piece to where the action is - kingside
With the idea of doubling up on the f-file, and, if White decides to move the knight then play Rxf5, Black can recapture with the pawn and improve his pawn structure
If I played this game again, I don't think that I would choose this move, though again GK analysis doesn't fault it. What moves would have been better then? One option is 18...Raf8, letting White initiate the exchange; 19.dxe5 Nxe5 20.Nxe5 Qxe5, but here the e6 pawn becomes weak. Another option would be exd4, and I can't see anything wrong with that!
?! This marks the first inaccuracy of the game, according to Gameknot. Nf6, the only move that saves the pawn on f4, was best, but I had hoped that the pawn sac would be justified by the action that Black gets down the f-file
Black now has a very strong influence over the f-file now, and should White have insufficient defence on f1, Black can mate. Not that he's forgotten about the other areas of the board...
a double attack on the rook on f5, and Black's next move is forced...
! Nice! To save a pawn (and stop Qh7#, of course) Black needs to relinquish the pressure on the f-file...
? Black misses the trick - 24.Rxf6 Qxf6 25.Qxg6, and it starts to look a little desperate for Black... 23.Qg8 would be the move to make here.
? Fortunately, White also misses the trick, and inevitably allows Black to improve his position...
the knight is very aggressive in this position, and I had ideas of a a move like Ne2+ or Nh3+ later on to achieve mate...
forced. Black would love the pawn exchange to get his knight into the action...
?? Now here's where things start to get interesting! I though that this could turn into a mere exchange (because if the knight moves, Black will have this; 27.dxc6 h4 28.Ne2?? (Nf5 is another variation I considered, but I just want to highlight the mate) ...Nh3+! 29.gxh3 Rxf1+ 30.Rxf1 Qxf1# [I always like playing through possible mates in my games, even if they don't work out... it gives me confidence for the particualar game :)] However, White has a trick that refutes this and leaves Black down a knight... Best was Na5, which puts the advantage 0.70 in White's favour - of course, that means that Black would be in no way losing!
? Qxa2 lets Black salvage something from the mess he put himself in...
! and now the queen must vacate the f-file and White's knight is safe to move out of harm's way.
Gameknot prefers Qe7, but I was still looking for opportunities to attack. If I was four points down with absolutely no prospects of attack whatsoever, I may have been tempted to resign, but here I still have some considerable pressure on the kingside
But I was actually happy for the exchange! The reason for that is simple; it opens up lines for my pieces to put pressure on White's king.
Black's target has now switched from f1 to h2!
the natural way to defend h2...
and I counted on it! (White's extra piece, the bishop, proves to be quite a thorn in Black's side, preventing the f8 rook from easily getting into the action)
White launches a double attack on e5 and f8...
and Black capitalises - the open h file can now be extremely useful for Black!
as I've said, Black wants to attack down the h-file. This pawn move will force White to defend the pawn again...
and now Black threatens 39...Rh6!, and the forced line; 40.Rxf3 Qe1+ gives Black the advantage.
and renewed....
! and stopped again. I guess it might have been here where Black's attack is officially at an end, but Black isn't giving up yet!
According to the GK database, Rxg2 was the best move to make here... though I believe that it's just analysing that in terms of material. The line that Gameknot gives trades off both rooks, and then Black has no attack. Here, Black still may have chances to pull off a surprise win here...
but the king now doesn't need to block the d2 rook!
forced in my view (I still didn't want to trade material) but after White's next move, I wished I had traded material. I had a vague plan here involving a rook to h4 and rook to g3... I can't remember what I was planning...
!! but this move just brings everything crashing down to the ground! The exchange of the rook and queen is forced, and Black has nothing. Here I resigned. So what makes this game so interesting to me? there are two things; 1) Despite the material defect, Black was the one putting the pressure on White, and White had to respond to Black's threats quite a few times. [Question: is that keeping the initiative?] 2) As I played through the games, I honestly thought that I could pull off a surprise win, until White's final move (and that win would have been my highest on Gameknot). Still, it was a great game - thanks very much to my opponent! :)
This is the French Defense starting position. A future move for black is d5. From what I've read and experienced, this defends the a2-g8 diagonal and reduces the f7 pawn weakness. However, it also blocks the black LSB. So in a sense, moves the weakness to the back row. A better player would probably know how to exploit this weakness, but I am not yet that experienced.
Well, it worked. Now, I'm thinking this through. If I pass the pawn, I lose it, not an option. if I take the pawn, I trade, keep him from castling king side (one of my stretch goals!) and take his rook. That said, my queen ends up in the open, that's NEVER worked out in the past.
So I advance the h rook, hoping he takes the pawn... which I may pick up later. I want to disturb the kingside further.
But I stick to my plan.
This move stops the advance and protects the g4 pawn, foiling my earlier idea of "picking it up later."  Knights can be so pesky. Now I'm -1. I don't like being -1. Does anyone really?
I think the black bishop will ultimately land on b4, so I want to get my pawn in play before then. This makes my DSB happy, because he can bear down on the pesky knight. In addition, it develops the center. I am thinking perhaps the next move will put me in bishop check.
But, black continues with his original plans as well, pausing things on the kingside.
Death to the pesky knight!
Stretch goal almost complete, black will not castle kingside! However, that DSB is bound to check me soon.
Waiting on the pin. I need to castle queenside now, so think this move will get things prepared.
Well, I didn't see that coming. After reviewing this for quite a while, it appears I won't be able to castle in this game at all. I don't see anyway to interpose a piece and I certainly am not castling kingside. Having the black rook and queen in this configuration really I really miss my DSB. In fact, now that I'm looking at the pawn configuration, I REALLY miss my DSB. Don't think the pesky knight was worth it.
My thought process: (1) stalhandske can do a lot more damage with a queen than I. (2) the black advanced queen is more dangerous than my queen on the back rank. (3) I'm not going to be able to castle anyway, so exchange and get the king active.
Black believes the exchange is a good idea. I am somewhat relieved because my rook was definitely in danger.
I think the black DSB was worth more than my knight given I had already sac'd my DSB and the d5-f7 pawn chain will limit his LSB.
Lost my pawn.. but this leaves black with a couple of unsupported pawns in the center. I am -2 now, which is not good, but there are two currently unsupported black pawns hanging out in the center. The other thing I notice is there is a serious pawn imbalance on my kingside. I now turn my attention to "picking them up." I also not black's queenside pieces are undeveloped.
King flexes his muscles on a pawn now. I don't see how black can immediately push the king around and now he needs to move to defend the pawn. This gives me the initiative, just not sure how long I can maintain. I expect 12...f5. I have a couple of things I can play 13. Bg2 seems the most straightforward or a two move knight play e2-f4... but will have to see how black responds first.
Tempted to check, but I really don't want to give black reason to develop queen side. Many moves from here, I see a potential fork at c7. I know odds of actually achieving this are remote given my opponents expertise, but it was fun on the analysis board. My only advantage is he may underestimate me.
Black knight moved in preparation for the castle and threatening the bishop. Not sure black has seen the crazy look in the white king's eyes yet.
I would rather sacrifice at mid board then struggle in the rear flank. Just not sure this is enough.
Trying to calm the white king down, black decides to mess with the bishop. The king doesn't care.
Frothing at the mouth now, the king can taste the rook's fear!! Hahhahaaaaaaaaaaaa.
King is moving in for the kill. I think I'll lose my bishop here, but I'm definitely taking that rook if black doesn't run.
A haiku in honor of the rook: "Black rook straight your moves, Maniac King slow but fierce, there can be but one!"
White pawn is quite a menace. I intend on bringing my other rook to bear soon. I will likely lose a3 as well.
Bye bishop.
Awwwww, and we had such big plans ahead. It is probably best to put Maniac King out of his misery anyway. However, beware, for when he rises again, he will be Zombie Maniac King!!!  Muahahaahaahaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
Thanks very much stalhandske for the game. I'd like to think you were concerned when the King did his crazy-eyed-running-with-his-hands-up attack, but nevertheless I enjoyed it very much. I would appreciate any feedback anyone would like to provide.
Here's a strange game that I won despite a series of blunders that deserved to lose.  Fortunately my opponent had already ceded plenty of material.  It's hardly a game "worthy of publication" but it does show the value of perseverance :-)  As it's a team game, we must have had similar ratings at the start, and my opponent won with White.  My rating has only recently shot up as a result of several fast ladder games against low-rated opponents, so don't expect my play to be commensurate with my current lofty rating.
A popular response to the Spanish, putting pressure on f2 to inhibit White's attack.
Normally, in the Spanish, I develop this knight via d2 and f1 e3 or g3 to f5 or d5 but, in this position, I'm still defending f2 with my rook, so the knight can't go to f1.  Also, I normally play c3 to support a pawn advance to d4, but as my d-pawn is defending e4, I can't do that without defending e4 some other way.  Anyway, the result is that I'm developing in an unfamiliar fashion.
keeping the pressure on f7
renewing the threat to f7 and simultaneously threatening the Nc6
Black easily defends against those threats.  Now White seeks to exploit the holes in Black's kingside with Fou Lenoir
By attacking Glenda, Black is able to ignore the pin against the Ra8
further penetrating the kingside.  Black could still castle kingside but Bh6 would then threaten mate in 1, the knight would then have to impale himself to save his sire: 16...0-0 17. Bh6 Ne6 18. Bxe6 fxe6, leaving Black with doubled e-pawns.  Alternatively, White could just win the exchange on a8.
threatening to trap Black's bishop
Black blockades
exploiting the pin on c6
? distracted from the task in hand.  40. Rc7 was better.
Black had gained the opposition but White is able to use his pawn to return the favour
rather than go straight for the f6 pawn, I push Black's King back further first.  This gains White a crucial tempo to prevent Black getting to e7.
I chose the king's knight this time to pressure e5.  I thought I was conceding d5.  I thought I knew Dave.
and Dave gains the advantage.
Dave developing and preparing to castle.
Preparing to castle.
Dave gets pushy.  He can spot by now that I'm thinking a kingside castle and he's gonna try to muff that up.  He's a hater that way.
I go on about my business.  I can't afford to lose anymore ground.
Dave is my friend.  He really let me have it for this move.  I don't know that I've ever seen an initial knight move to the a or h file that was annotated as smart.  My thoughts were of planning an attack up the a side at some point, plus guarding my bishop with something other than my queen.  Not wise to guard more 2 pieces with one I'm told.
Dave takes the knight.  I'm not sure if he meant to concede the bishop or if my queen had slipped his mind.  We chat while playing, and he questioned why I'd just give up a knight and allow him to pressure my rook.  He does this to play mind games sometimes, so I just played dumb (it wasn't hard to do) and said oops.  So he took my knight.  I considered it a victory to get one of his bishops off the board.
I end up castling queen side.  This protects my bishop and puts me in a fight for the d file that I'll gladly lose to get daves queen off the board.
Before dave made this move, he told me he was going to 'school' me on how to break up my pawn structure.  He hadn't factored in my queen.  He may have been aware of her when he lost the first bishop, but he wasnt aware on this one.  At this point I've lost both knights, but the tradeoff for both his bishops would be huge for me.   Still it smells of a trap.  I hate jumping on a piece when it looks like I'm supposed to do it.
I decided to pressure his queen.  I felt I had his black square bishop if I wanted it.  I'm sure this isn't a 'book' move, but throwing Dave off his game is the only way I can gain advantage.
Dave is trying to gain some ground.  I never know what to do in cases like this.  The pressure is certainly applied on me.
To the chess world this was probably dumb.  To me it was staking out new territory!
I concede the bishop.
I'm thinking about Daves queen at this point, trying to put something together to take some of his pieces and gain an advantage.  I've got firepower pointed at his king so I've got some room for error.
he had to do something.  Right now I feel as if he's reacting to me.  It's a good feeling.
This may not have been smart, but it felt smart at the time.  I could see I was a move away from being checked by dave's knight, and with his queen looking at me I felt I needed to create an escape route.
Dave looking to get back in the mix.
Trying to screw with Dave.  The more of his pieces I can get off the board, the better I'll be.
I've got a mate in mind here, but I really need my queen to be out and about and she's not.  I'm lining it up anyway.  A better player could probably squash the black king in 2 or 3 moves.
Dave makes it even rougher on me to try to make a kill shot at this moment.
I thought this was a pretty good move, it was the beginning of me putting the screws to dave.
Dave blocks my mating move.  I am sad.  I'm struglling for things to do to salvage a mate.  I've way ahead of dave, but I'm nervous instead of thinking clearly.  I'm too focused on how I can't get the queen to g7, and I completely miss that I have him mated with Bc4.   This sort of thing is why I'm still an rookie.
So I clumsily blunder around trying to get back.  This is a pretty climactic moment (if you can have one of those after you should have won the game already) because I figure Dave's queen is gonna dive on the grenade.
Now to back the bishop (the one coated with the blood of Dave's queen) back out and hold the diagonal.
I have so many people I want to thank for this victory....<n><n><n><n><n>Actually no I don't.  I did it by capitalizing on Dave's mistakes.  Thats about the only way I can beat a player THAT superior to me.  He made the mistake early on and I didn't make mine until it was too late for him to do anything about it.  My little diatribe hasn't done this game the justice that it deserves, as annotating doesn't show the comments left at the top of the page, nor the instant messages that added the real flavor for the match.  Think of it in "Down goes Frazier!!" terms, and I hope you've enjoyed! =)
i figured my best chance was a back rank mate of sorts and i focused on it
use my knight to block his line to d8 mate in one
u can have the bishop i want mate
big mistake i think, now if i can only get my rook on the back rank.....
Not Nc3, because then the c-pawn can't support d4.
5.Bb5?! First move out of book.  I was not prepared for this move.  Does White want to trade the versatile knight in this closed position for his strong light bishop which normally goes on the d3 square?  Only about a dozen players over 2100 have played this move.  Definitely some advantage for black now.  Two best responses are block pin with Bd7 or continue with thematic Qb6 earlier than normal.  I chose Qb6 thinking it would force the trade or bring more play to the queenside where I have a space advantage.  I thought the line would progress 5...Qb6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 with my side pawn toward the center which would soon continue to pressure d4.
White holds position.  I did not think about this move because normally a well timed a3 and b4 pawn advance is very strong for white which is now lost. I decide to open play a bit here, take the d4 pawn and being in my kingside knight into play with ...Nge7 and then ...Nf5 to put pressure on the backward pawn that white would now have to defend.
This defends the bishop and frees the pawn to force the queen away.  It also continues to keep the play on the queenside where I want it.  I think Ne2 would be better here.
Time force the the bishop to act.
An unforseen advantage to 7...Nge7 now allows me to take with the Knight and win the a5 pawn.  I figured the bishop would just retreat here to a4 or d3.
Is this a bait to swap another bishop for a knight?  If so I'll definitely take it.  I want to bring my knight back to the center and giving me a target only makes the decision easier.
I am unsure what black was planning with this move. I'm going to take the bishop unless it is moved.  The pawn could be easily be defended with Qc2 Qb3. Also, with some of the pressure released planning a castle and kingside attack would force me to either counter attack or bring my pieces back to defend.
Gioachino Greco, also known as Il Calabrese, was born around 1600 in Celico, Italy near Cosenza in Calabria. In 1619, Greco started keeping a notebook of tactics and games, and he took up the custom of giving copies of his manuscripts to his wealthy patrons. In 1621 Greco took off to test himself against the rest of Europe, visiting Paris and later, London. He spent the last years of his life at King Philipp IV's court and died in the West Indies, seemingly from a disease that he contracted there around 1634.  This is one of his exciting games that includes a queen sacrifice. The moral of this chess game is dont be materialistic.
? Owens Defence. This is an old defence which is now considered dubious. This obviously prepares to fianchetto the light squared bishop. This move is still however popular against the English(1.c4) where it is far more effective. An early fianchetto by Black shows a willingness to defend against a big pawn center, picking away at it from the wings. In ceding so much territory, Black must be on constant guard against direct attacks on the King, as this game illustrates :)
!This move tries to undermine the center at the expense of the pawn, but this move also undermines the safety of his own king as you will see, because he is opening the dangerous h5-e8 daigonal.
Greco seizes the pawn, and the fireworks begin.
Threatening the queen, but black is to greedy and loses immediately. The typical continuation is 6...Bg7 7.gxh7  Kf8 8.hxg8=Q  Kxg8 9.Qg6 (or Qg4) Bxh1 and Black has a reasonable game.
I was expected g5, where I wished play a Muzio-like style
I like the white position. Now, White has objetives in the kingside and can cramp the queenside whit 9 a4, and, later, a5. Black has alternatives; black can play Na6 and Bd7, for example, or open the center with Ne8 and f5. I choice attack the kingside (h6, specifically) with Qd2, but Qe1 and Qg3 is another idea.
Ok, Black did believe in the attack and decline the bishop.
Freeing the LSB, and place in a better position  a piece (e5). It`s true. But, this move allows a exchange and do not give attack for black (12 Nxe5 Bxe5 14 Nd5 Qh4 15 Bf4)
If 16 ... Bc3 17 c3 and white gains the piece.
But, now, for keep the bishop (white threat Qa4), black need misplaced the queen. Now, white has attack in the kingside
h6 to prevent the c1 bishop from pinning an already cramped position
e6 is needed.if,e5-e6 is allowed.black will have more problems.
though black looks passive and pieces lack mobility,but its like a coiled snake...always ready to defend and pounce...
to allow for Be7 and subsequently castling
black must aware of the open f file...dont underestimate it
bishop develops and the rooks connect
white vacate d2 square for his knight to drive the dominant knight away
black defends f7 pawn...besides black is waiting..its queen will wait on the h6-c1 diagonal to land on the square e3.the double rooks are in a great position too
white knows the threat and blocks the diagonal....black has no chance but to seek other ways
rook defends back rank and tries to trick white to take at f7....because 29 Rxf7 Qe3 . if 30 Kh1 Qe2 31 Rf7f2 Qxf2 32 Rxf2 Ra1  wins<n>                  if 30 Rf7f2 Rxf2 31 Rxf2 32 Ra1#
queen drops back because to defend the back rank...the double rooks on a file is too strong...and because there is no pawn on f2 to cover the king...white has to be constantly on the alert
black knows his c4 pawn is his trump and wants to prove it.so he tries another option
now black attack the backward pawn...
now my queen wants to join in the attack
white tries hard to stop black
Center of the board is going to be mine... This is a big advantage.
hes to take it.
Hi everyone!<n><n>In my penultimate annotated game against untateve I was talking about regaining some of the lost points from the low draw because I had some favourable games in my active games list which I was hoping to convert.  Here is one of them.  After yesterday's "nightmare" against the Master Mater (although let it be said, from all your kind comments the reason I lost that game was because although I had the right ideas I wasted a tempo early on by forking Freddy's Q + R on c7 and it was enough to cost me the game - so it seemed my performance was FAR FROM BEING HORSE DUNG!) it was nice to wake up to a white flag.   In this game I find myself in a closed Ruy Lopez and become passive and find myself facing a mating attack.  My opponent once had a rating in the 1600s before he suffered from some timeouts and for a long time in the game he played to that level.  But in pressing his mating attack he made a big oversight.  Here is how the story unfolds.  My opponent kicks off with 1.e4.
7. ....... d6 - supports e5 and keeps my options open as to where to put Fou Leblanc.  The square b7 seems thematic to this opening however.
11. ...... Bb7 - Fou Leblanc goes to b7 and connects the rooks.
13. axb3 - another N for B trade.  The downside is that it opens the a file and ties a piece down to defending the pawn on a6.  It does however double up pawns on the b column and relieve the pressure on f7.
18. Qg4 - should Glenda move off the second rank then it is curtains for Henry.  The Witch will come down to g7 and I will cop Old Matey.  The knight must be driven from f5.  How do I do it?  I know but it will take several moves to accomplish.
18. .......... dxe4 - I want to put Fou Leblanc back on his home square to pin the knight against the Witch and this is the first stage of the plan.  This pawn trade relieves Fou Leblanc of the defense of my d5 pawn.
20. b3 - white thinks I am going to play Nc4 so he plays this move to prevent this.  However it allows me to proceed to Stage 3 of my plan.  The knight is now pinned with 20. ........ Bc8.
21. Re3?? - natural, this rook lift is planning to put pressure on my g7 pawn, but this little footman is to become a little blighter as far as white is concerned.  My position has been like a hedgehog, spikes with a soft underbelly.  Here the spikes prevail as the pawn moves to g6 piling up on the pinned knight on f5.  So my opponent is well and truly spiked on the hedgehog.
22. Nh6 - I expected this but calculated for it.  This will result in a queen trade and after the knight takes Glenda on f7 my rook will snaffle it and white will be relieved of a piece.  It makes me look like The Artful Doger here!
24. ........ Rd7 - I decide not to move Fou Leblanc but to attack his dsb instead.  If he takes Fou Leblanc I take his dsb establishing the Bone in the Throat on d7.  If he moves his bishop out of the way I trade rooks on d1 which is even better!
After black moves the c pawn, white must move his own in order to defend b2 with the queen after Qb6 by black. No matter if black goes c4.
This seems actually a mistake, since it seems possible for black to go Bf5 now, based on the weakness of b2 (Qxb2 and the rook is lost). <n>BUT for Qc1# by white. Black can't take the rook at once, but has white compensation for it?<n>I'm sure theory says a lot from this, but I don't read books, so I don't know. I appreciate some help...
With an obvious threat, QxB#. It is possible to take wiht the knight, and probably better, since the key of white's game is to shield the queenside... but it becomes pretty naked now.
It was profilactic a3, since the diagonal is weak.
Good, of course. Now the bishop and the knight are coordinated. I have to react.
Giving a plus to c2.
Increasing the pressure. But here, probably a6 would have been better for black, since this allows me to...
Gaining tempoes for castling, accepting to lose the bishop's pair. It's a fair exchange. Now it was possible 13. BxN+, and balck has to go bxc6. Then, QxBa3 and black can't castle. It looks simple now, but during the game a lot of lines came up, with slight differences... and sometime, those little differences are THE differences.
The normal plan it dxe5, but not now, I need solidity, no attack is going on on black's king.
an interesting try. The truth is that black pieces can build some tricks...
My turn. Now whitehas an edge, and due to a "slight difference", I win a pawn... that can be the difference. But in doing this, I give up my bishop pair, wihtout realizing the engame will be from opposite bishops... and this calls for a drawn.
If I take his pawn, his rook will revenge on my pawns somehow. That was what I thought.
This was the idea, since his bishop can't defend the pawn. Was this "the little small difference" I looked for?
Was this a good plan? Probably not. I looked hard for a tricky mate, but I miss a tempo and the h pawn.
This is closing up, and I can't see it easy to win. I'm looking for something to alter the equilibrium... maybe...
But the bishop can.
This pawn is on the 6th, untouchable, as my bishop. And it is still not enough to win? Come on...
Maybe, here I can find the way to materialize....
I am realizing that I am playing a fool, since it becomes clear that I cannot push the pawn further. So I tried a last way to scramble the game: to sac it.
It was interesting Rxa6, Re8, e5 and black can't take it, but a player like my opponent won't fall for such a cheap trick.
Now, probably, my worst mistake. Or not, I can't tell...
12. Nh5!, good move, eliminating the threat on the Black's king side
Now beginning the exchange
31. Qb4!, the trap is set for mate here and the will coordinated forces of the black make it difficult to get away
White can always play d2-d4 and transpose to a King's Indian, but if I wanted to play that, I'd play 1.d4.
Even now 7.d4 is perfectly reasonable, but my opponent is sniffing, again, and he gives the impression that I'm some old fart who's going to manoeuvre around for 30 moves whilst he tries to hit me down the long diagonal.
?! Too slow surely.  The Nf6-e8-c7-e6-d4 is seen in some lines, but this is simply slow.  8. ... Rb8, ... a6, ... b5 is one way that Black is going to give himself play here, or he should be playing 8. ...h6, 9.Be3 Kh7 and trying to blockade.
Nobody said that I had to be subtle.  Now 10. ... Bxh6, 11.Qxh6 followed by h2-h4-h5 is a standard Yugoslav style attack from the Sicilian Dragon, but without the open c-file to allow Black counter-play.
Still very slow though.  It might be worth playing 10. ... e5 first to clamp down on the centre and try to force ... f5.
White shows his hand.  A straight-forward K-side attack against anything that Black has to offer.
English purists are busy getting upset around now, but Black's play is just too slow.  White can always throw in e5, opening the h1-a8 diagonal, or f2-f4-f5.  Importantly, if Black can play b5, so what?  b5-b4 isn't going to help him, and bxc4, dxc4 won't achieve much either.  Suddenly, White has a free attack.
Too slow.  If anything, the rook belongs on the f-file, looking to play f5 or f6 and coming to f7.
Black gets his knight to d4, but that's not where the action is at the moment.
White continues his brutal attack.  Is it sound?  The more important question is how do you defend against it at 30 moves in an hour.
Black's knights look pretty and give him some counter-play, but with the f-file and the h-file open, his centralised knights aren't helping.
Black confessed after the game that he'd forgotten about Rxh8 after his initial calculations, but this gives some play.
Black carefully moves his knights from their centralised positions, but the move has the merit of getting the Queen away from the h6 square.
?! After all that effort to preserve the Bh8, why block it off.  White gets d5 for his knight, Black loses e5 for his.
The knight has to die (Qd2 Nf3=) and I'm minded to give up the rook for Black's dark squared bishop in any event.
There was some debate after the game was to whether Black should play exd4, but if he's to get counter play, it must surely come down the b- and c-files, and why give me Nf4?
Not so long ago, Black's knights appeared to dominate the centre.  Now they're history and the Nd5 looks huge.
White stops Qg5+ and threatens to come in to h6 in due course.
Doubling with tempo.
Jupíter is now thinking about the new fragrance for men from Axe. Buy it. buy it buy it.<n><n>Ok, some guys paid me to do this one, so its ok, im the smart one.
"Give me a queen, and i will kill you three kings", said once a person who says vague things. Baco knew it was necessary to keep the queens for his personal use after the game. The bohemian gods would not let the hard-fighting queens over the board to spend the night alone after things were done.
Jupiter is mad and angry. Baco was twisting the nature of the situation with his mischiveous ways, but now he played the move that was later on considered the most brave move in the history of chess.
Baco was trully in panic; someone was gonna bang his hoes. He had put that little pawn in the h6 square in order to get sober acording to the most lucid analysys.
Bang. Bang. The knight got his hoes. One of them at least.<n>Baco is desperate, he cannot accept the fact that he can´t have a menage a trois anymore, because using any of the remaining peaces would sound really awkward.
Baco decides he is gonna count on his five fingers tonight. Exchange is necessary to keep the advantage.
now baco has a headache, he drank too much and the situation is unclear. especially about his stomach.
Now Jupiter cashes in the prize for his persistance and luck for playing against a drunk sexholic who was worshipped for some reason nobody will ever fully understand. Baco's flaw of character seems to be the biggest flaw in here.
Standard.   If black's going to offer me the centre, it'd be rude not to accept.
The Tarrasch.   At various stages, I've played the advance and the Winawer as well, but I've settled on the Tarrash the past couple of years.   Maybe that'll change again in the future!
The best diagonal for white's light-squared bishop in the French, usually.   Here, it targets h7, which is that bit weaker now that black's knight can't get to f6.
Again, a standard motif in the French; black attacks white's pawn chain and hopes to create a decisive weakness on d4.
Centralising the rook, and also allowing for the d-knight to manoeuvre via f1 to a more active spot on either e3 or g3.
Always a teensy bit risky in the French; black needs to play an f6 push sooner rather than later so as to get some pieces back protecting his king.
?!   I don't like this; the knight does nothing here. Again, 11. ... f6 12. ef Nxf6 was preferable to untangle black's position a bit, I think.   I don't have to take, of course, but then 12. Ng3 (say) fe 13. de Qc7 and the e-pawn is coming under a bit of fire.
Looking to force some concession in black's kingside defences, though Black can probably meet this fairly comfortably with 13. ... h6, followed by 14. ... Rc8, harassing my queen.
Trapping the bishop.   The gameknot analysis prefers this over the meek concession of the h-pawn.
Looking to swap, but also to distract white's queen from defending the c2 square.   GK analysis calls this a mistake, and wants black to complete development with 17. ... Rc8 instead.
Obviously my attack is severely blunted if I swap.
?!   Better was 19. ... Rf7, but I just drop another piece into the attack wth 20. Ng4.   The text see Black lose one of his defenders.   My queen has the g5 square as well, and I've more pieces to follow up the knight I've lost, whereas black's minor pieces aren't contributing to their king's defence.
??   In desperation, black goes for the knight fork, and prays to luck at the other end.   His luck's not in though...
Naturally.   g5 is now freed for the bishop too.
Back to mate in 5.   Analysis preferred scrambling a piece back to defend by 23. ... NxP, but black is still lost after 24. Bf6 (threatening Qh8+ and Qg7#) RxB 25. NxR+, forking king and queen.
A rather brash move, sticking a pawn in the middle of the board with only a single knight as protector. In addition, the bishop at b3 has a clear aim at the vulnerable f7-square.
The Black king has been driven to d4, and the extra queen is of no use. The king tries to hide on e3.
Now, you may well think that this game is cmposed. Especially when my source for the game indicated it was dedicated by Mr. Wellmuth to the late Perrier. The sparkling gem was created in the middle of a World War, when there wasn't time or opportunity serious tournament play, and I'll admit the the other offerings fro that year didn't impress me enough to set this aside, and besides, it doesn't seem to be well known. Actually, it isn't all that complicated, just long. Notice how few branches had to be calculated. A very short computer analysis found the move, but concluded that Black might gain a slight advantage. Of course an exhaustive search would have led the program to the correct conclusion. Even after looking just 7 movesahead, White gained advantage.
black finaly receives the message from earth that something went wrong with his game.the threath b6 is too strong to be ignored. offering an exchange doesn't seem to be too much of a price given the situation.
black takes the chance and activates his bishop. with it on d4, things will not look that bleak .
white is on the wrong track. f2-f3 is a bad idea when one doesn't have the means to chase away the black overseer from the a7-g1 diagonal.
taking a pawn with Bxc3 and Nf3 is shallow. white can exchange the bishops with Bg4, with better position. the only chance for black is to encourage his opponent in going forward with his bad idea of playing f2-f3. honestly, it looks bad for white, so there was some calculation involved. g3 seems like a good idea. Bd3 is also a plan. all in all, black has just a few threats, possibly not enough to equalise and he needs some sort of cooperation to make it happen. white, on the other hand, has played superficial the last couple of moves, and is still unaware of the fact that he has to be precise in defence for a while before claiming the win.
it's simple: put the knight on g3, then search a mate with the queen on the h file with a subsequent Qg5, since there is nothing to interfere.
ich verstehe nur bahnhof. white is still under the impression that he has to defend against Qh4. but, as I said, this was never on the table. The real threat is Ng3.
suicide. the other option was to sac the queen (and the game) with 25. Bd3. In fact, White knows what's what already.
Hi everyone!<n><n>I hope you enjoyed my previous annotation of The Master Mater at work.  He is at it again in this game against yours truly.  I end up exchanging bishop for knight to bust up his pawn structure.  Yes, and I also get rid of his marauding horsies.  I felt that inflicting a break up of Freddy's pawn structure would stand me in good stead in the endgame where Freddy is pretty strong.  But, although I was out of the opening, there was the middle game to play.  Boy, didn't Freddy make full use of that g file. Funny, Freddy's opponent had the g file to play with and got nowhere, in fact Freddy made use of it.  I can only say that it is because Freddy was so much better developed than NN when the g file was opened that his attack was so successful.  I kick off with d4 for a change as I do play e4 quite frequently.
10. 0-0 - which side shall I castle on, kingside or queenside.  Black's queenside looks a little draughty so I think he will choose the kingside.  Freddy proves me wrong.  Like the game "Henry seemed as Safe as Houses" he keeps his king in the middle!  He now moves his knight to h5 and I play a double edged move which I will discuss after the bishop for knight trade.
11. ...... gxh5?! - behold - Freddy's kingside pawn structure is busted.  If I can get through to the endgame then Henry will have the last laugh on Freddy gobbling up those pawns.  The thought was just too tempting.  Trouble is, it will now give Freddy's heavies a highway to heaven down the g column.  Do you the jury think the dubious symbol is fair?
13. Be3 - Fou Lenoir is driven back.  I choose e3 rather than h4 because my dsb will strike at a7 should Freddy choose to plonk his king there which seems more likely now that the g column is open - I would not dare to put Henry on that open g file even with a dsb for a shield.
14. f3 - to prevent Bg4 and to perhaps line up Glenda and Fou Lenoir on that g1-a7 diagonal.
15. h3 - to stop the h pawn from advancing any further.
16. Kh1 - sss, here comes the Wicked Witch of the West!  Henry must now sidestep the pin.  I was wondering if, paradoxically, Henry would have been better off moving to f2 - but no! The witch can check on g3 and win the g2 pawn for starters, so it had to be h1 for Henry.  That castled position could become the condemned cell for me pore ole 'enry.
18. Rg1 - I eschew taking the free pawn on h4 in favour of gaining an attacking/defending tempo by moving a rook to g1.  In hindsight, I think that that rook should have gone to f2.  What do you the jury say?
23. ........ 0-0-0 - at last Freddy castles.  He means to line up another rook on the g file, in fact to triple his heavies on it.
24. Nb1? - In retrospect I think the knight should have gone to d1 then e3 to protect g2 yet again.  At least it would have delegated the task of defending that g pawn to a lower value piece.
26. Kh2?? - the move was well intentioned, Henry tries to add protection to the h3 pawn.  But Henry is not allowed to stay there.  Unfortunately there is nothing covering f4 so the witch can land there immediately giving check and pushing Henry back to h1.  Freddy said I should have played Rd1, that I am sure would have saved my neck.  I could then have pursued my queenside pawn storm.
27. ...... Bxh3 - steals a pawn due to the pin on my rook on g1.  True the rook on g1 is twice defended, but Glenda is too high a value for this task.  The worst part of this pawn loss is that those h pawns of Freddy's suddenly become dangerous!
29. Re2 - I move the rook to the e column.  Somehow I think that c2 might have been better.  At least the rook would have been in line with the BK and I could have gathered a bit of momentum with the pawn roll I started.
30. ...... Qf6 - Freddy refuses to trade queens otherwise there would be no mating attack.
32. Qa7 - Freddy has already announced mate.  Well, if you are going to get checkmated and you get a chance to play a token move, then do choose the most aggressive move.  At least this reminds Freddy that he has an opponent, even though a weak one.  Glenda threatens mate in one!
35. Rge1 - will make no difference to the result.  I decided to delay the mate, but somehow the most aggressive token move would have been d6.  That would have allowed mate in 1.  But now it gets really gruesome.
38. Rxg1 - the crowned queen is taken but I now lose both Henry and my rook at the same time.  Freddy now plays the deadening Qxg1#.  Back again to the drawing board.
So this is a game I faced the Morra Gambit, against which I had had very poor score in Blitz games. People don't play it too often here, since altough it is full of traps and zaps for black and gives him lot to think about, it is most probably a little unsound.
This is the Gambit. White gets a tempo, open lines and space advantage for the price of pawn.
Interesting position. Obviously White will get his attack, but somehow he must succeed in creating some sort of weaknesses in blacks camp.
White has to get agressive to show he have something for the pawn.
Continuing the theme of restricting the bishop. ...b5, ...Na5 and ...Nxb3 is a possible plan, trading of a piece and creating weakness to white's camp, then face the storm and win in endgame.
The good thing in Morra as white is that he can play pretty much natural developing and attacking moves, while blacks developement is made bit awkward as the d-pawn will probably have to stay on d7 for some time, Kings Knight is hard to place to f6 due the possibility of e5.<n><n>The good thing for black is... err... the pawn. Winning chances in endgame. White is the one having all the fun for now.
I decided to develop this knight to g6. Don't know if it's the best plan, but the logic is clear. Knight out of the way so the black bishop can be developed and king be tucked to safety.
I'm not sure about this move in positional basis, as it's not clear yet where the queen belongs. I'd probably play 8.Be3 black has stepped out of the option of ...Ng4 and e-pawn is under no pressure.
Black sees that there is no obviously good squares for the dark squared bishop, so he decides to trade of white's bishop, make room for the light squared bishop and double white's pawns, trying to later prove them as weaknesses. Later in the game we'll see that altough doubled, black has no queenside pawn majority, so the doubled pawns are maybe not so weak. This is probably what white expected when playing 8.Qe2, as the queens rook may be active on his original square after eventual hxg3.
The obvious square. Black queen would like to be on e7, but there is the problem with th dark squared bishop, who has no obvious squares.
Making blacks developement even more awkward. Black decides to defend by covering some dark squares with pawns, as light squares are hardly becoming weaknesses.
Probably not a bad move. The e-pawn can go to e5, as light squared bishop controls d5.
Threatening Bb6. Now dark squared bishop must move to avoid being locked up by the black queen.
There is no better square, as e7 is for queen and on d6 the bishop would be somewhat vulnerable. On Bb4 the bishop has no function, but is at least out of the way for castle.
Preventing f4. Black tries the best he can to keep the position as closed as possible.
Centralization. Black threatens to remove weaknesses by e5, maybe after castling.
More or less forcing the trade and thus driving blacks knight away from e6. The problem is that the knight will be very fine after g5-f7-d6. Second problem is that after the trade it is hard to attack the d-pawn.
White wishes to gain acces to newly vacated e4-square.
Black is quite happy to get rid of the ever problematic bishop.
White has the better knight, but now the lines for rooks are both blocked. I think black has passed the worst already.
This is a mistake, walking into a fork. But then again, on d5 the knight would be unchallenged and wonderful, eyeing the weakness of f3, e2 and c3 and preventing some rook activity. It's hard to avoid dropping the exchange, for example 26.Qc1 Nd5 27.Rd2 (Rc3 Ne2 ) Nf3  and rook drops. 26.Qd2 Nd5 27.Rc3 b4 and rook cannot cover c5 and f3, so white loses a piece.
Now black needs to find yet again a plan to penetrate. I admit that at this point I didn't give this game too much attention, thinking it to be winning and not bother to find the best plan and just plan and then move when I have to... Very unhealthy approach.
Locking the queenside with the idea that if the b-pawn falls, then the whole position falls.
This was whites idea, but while it works tactically, it fails positionally. White should have tried to show that the rook does nothing on e3 and try to drive it aways from there or prevent Kg6-h5-g4.
And the pawn queens. The knight is useless. The funny thing is that if black queen were 'in the box', say, at d3, the knight would be worse than useless, taking b2 away from the king, losing.
axb2 is of course winning king-and-pawn ending, but why not to queen if one can?
Trying to see if I can bully my way out of it.
Can't interpose and the only other move they can make is k-e7, r-d7 and I grab the queen anyway.
Now I'm a much happier Panda. So much so that I want to encourage her to take c6 so I can move B-d5 and baggsie the rook.
She doesn't fall for it so now I'm going to wander down to d7.
Trying to gently persuade her to have the pawn.
Ok....can I have f8 then instead? She is determined not to fall for any of these....
At this point I'd decided to try and force her pawns off and see what she could do with rook vs knight and pawns.
Another trap, begging her to take the pawn and then K-c4
Finally! She grows too ambitious and here is the killer.....
Now I'd wanted for the sake of elegance to finish it with queen and knight. But I'm not elegant. And when I try working it out on analyser I kept stalemating. So I chickened, trapped the king in a repeat cycle and went got the other queen.
The bishop's game, my new beloved opening against open games for almost a year now. While there's not tons of theory to learn, it's perfectly solid and playable, though not seen in top level chess anymore. After the usual 2. Nf3, Black still can choose between a variety of openings (...Nc6, ...Nf6, ...d6) where White has to be prepared. The bishop's opening often transposes to King's Bishop's gambit (1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4), a very fun opening but one that is, directly played, too dangerous for me in tournament play. Also there is an affinity to the Vienna game (1. e4 e5 2. Nc3).
Continuing to develop; I prefer Nc3 over Nf3 in this position as it keeps open a possible f4 pawn thrust (in the spirit of King's Gambit and the Vienna game).
!? Offering a bishop exchange with the idea of opening the f-file (my favourite file ;-)) and strengthening the centre with another pawn.
Freeing the light-squared bishop.
I was wondering why Black, already behind in development, is wasting time with another pawn move. Not thinking further about it, I quickly...
...castled and herewith occupied the open file with the rook.
Damn, I overlooked this simple double attack tactics which obviously tries to win a pawn and already exploits the backwards pawn weakness! As I am far ahead in development, it isn't that bad, but still a decision has to be made: Save the pawns or sacrifice one and continue with the own plans?
I decided for not caring about a lost pawn, as Black loses only more time with this and even opens me another file. It isn't healthy to go for pawn-eating with the queen in the early development stage, is an important rule in chess, why should the opponent be able to break this rule? The rooks are already connected and development is completed, it takes Black at least three more moves to achieve this! The other option would have been Qc1 which defends both pawns, but then ...Ng4 Re1 results in a cramped position.
Obviously, White wants to continue with e5, driving away the knight in turn to exploit the weak f7 point.
Attacks my bishop and pins the knight -- though the pin can't be directly exploited in this case (not even after castling), as ...Nxe4 Nxe4 results in a position where the queen is defended.
This bishop has reached it's dream spot and will not move anymore for the rest of the game ;-)<n>Bxf7+ was very tempting at this point, following with e5 and using the open f-file, but I wasn't sure if it would really work out.
I found this move to be more dynamic (opens d-file and drives away the knight), though it creates a pawn structure weakness in form of an isolated pawn.
Somehow I have overlooked that with this move, the pawn is hanging... the rook has to come to help
The second move which surprised me, I overlooked that Black can simply enforce an exchange of bishops! Now Bxe6 fxe6, h3 was the first tactic which came to my mind, but this doesn't work out since ...Rd8 drives my queen away and allows my knight on c3 to be taken. Instead I tried to prevent the exchange with...
...this interesting move! If Black takes my bishop, I can simply take the knight with the following threat of Qxh6. The second important purpose of this move is to make space for the queen to leave the d-file, where she can still defend the knight on c3 (on e1).
? Black should definitely have taken my bishop here to get rid of one of my best pieces, incessantly eyeing the weak f7 point.
Okay, after Rf4, ...Ne3 is still possible now, since a following Qxe3 would result in ...Qxf1+. But anyway, why not giving away the Exchange for an awesome position?
Happily giving away the back-rank rook, knowing that I will soon get another piece for it.
The queen has to leave again, and the bishop is eaten on the next move, with huge pressure on f7.
This rook is doomed to passivity now.
Increasing the pressure on the f-file and defending the rook, enabling the covered queen attack e6.
This pawn is like a rock (if Black is not able to catch the bishop with the knight or wants to give away material) and will prove to be VERY useful in the rest of the game.
The knight needs to get back into the game.
Not sure if this was really necessary already (I was worrying the queen check on a1), either Qxa7 or the fork threatening Ne5 would have been stronger probably.
I was truly shocked and paralysed by this move -- another one which I have completely overlooked! It looks as like White is losing a piece by force now: The rook is obviously attacked by the pawn and has to move along the f-file, but then this leaves the knight on e5 undefended and the queen can happily eat it. Already thinking about to resign, I luckily found the saving move.
That's funny: Black can't open the g-file now as this would immediately result in a mate in two, through a quick queen-sacrifice-and-rebirth (Qg8+ Rxg8 fxg8=D#). The bishop is proving to be extremely effective for White, Black would have better exchanged it!
Trying to keep the files closed. At this point of the game we both had only a few minutes left (before the 40 moves boundary) and had to move rather quickly.
The safe way to play it -- the rook sacrifice Rxg5! had clearly to be considered, as it looks like after ...hxg5, Qxg5 there is no way to avoid mate anymore for Black, but being in time pressure I wasn't 100% sure if it really works out, so I decided to move the knight.
Just trying to get quickly closer to the 40 moves boundary with a forcing move...
The good-looking fork Ng6+ would indeed lose a piece: ...Kg7 and after White notices that the mating thread is still present and opens up space for the king, Black eats the knight ...Kxg6
I wasn't sure how to continue now to convert this obviously promising position into a quick win. Attacking the rook and repositioning the queen for a possible Qg4/Qh5 couldn't hurt.
With the idea of following with Qh5 and hitting on h6. Another plan that came to my mind was getting the rook on e8 with Re5, however this can be easily prevented by Black with Nc7.
This knight now has two winning places to go: e6 and d7.
!? Another move which I wasn't prepared of, attacking my queen. Looks like it has to move away and Black then has a discovered check ...gxh3+, but again, like before in move 34, the rook doesn't need defence, as the queen-sac-and-rebirth trick is still going on on g7. So I can offer to exchange queens.
I think he exchanged his bishop for my knight because of my pawns in black squares to make the action ability of bishop fewer.
I tried to make kingside weaker by using the pinned knight of white.
And here i made a terrible mistake.To avoid attack of the rook on g file, i lost my queen.
and here he makes a mistake and loses his bishop.
it is not so difficult to mate with an extra castle and two extra pawns so my oppent resigns here.
An adventure in the main line of the 9.Bc4 Yugoslav, the Soltis Variation. It is a typical Dragon encounter, which is to say pawn storms rage on both flanks and Black sacs the Exchange for attacking chances (but not on c3!).
The 9.Bc4 Yugoslav, signaling a double-edged game. This move is far from refuted, but White players are lately flocking to the 9.0-0-0 plan, keeping the bishop at home (intending to save time on the Bc4-b3 maneuver by simply avoiding it) and virtually forcing Black to play 9... d5 with liquidation and a very small edge for White. After 9.Bc4, plenty of tactical possibilities arise.
The most flexible move, as the bishop retreat is inevitable. Another perk of this line is to de-claw one of Black's more interesting options (and a personal favorite), the Chinese Dragon with 10. .. Rb8.
({The point is that after} 10... Rb8? {White can soundly grab material. As much analysis has shown,} 11. Nxc6 bxc6 12.Bxa7 {leaves Black with very few options. The bishop on b3 effectively covers<n>the queenside pawn trio and White's 11.Nxc6 has taken the ...Ne5-c4 maneuver<n>off the menu for Black (which is the only reasonable way to harass the b3<n>bishop.}) ({It is worth noting that} 10... Nxd4!? 11. Bxd4 b5 {is a direct<n>attempt to exploit White's move order, intending to frustrate the b3 bishop<n>with a speedy pawn storm before White has castled, as} 12. h4 ({<n>The seemingly harmless} 12. O-O {is a real threat to this variation, as White<n>has not committed to the kingside and can still contest the rest of the board<n>via a4 and Nd5 ideas.} a5 13. a4 b4 14. Nd5 Nxd5 15. exd5 e5 16. dxe6 Bxe6 17.<n>Rad1 {is very much unclear}) 12... a5 13. a4 bxa4 14. Nxa4 e5 $5 {gives Black<n>a very interesting, albeit highly unusual, game; Black fights for the<n>initiative at all costs and White's king is left in the center. I'm hoping to<n>explore this line over the board sometime.})
The main idea of the Soltis variation. It seems odd that Black spends time shuffling kingside pawns, but it turns out that the h-pawn advance usefully hinders White's attack, buying Black valuable time on the queenside.
This funny move is actually a main line. White decides not to jump in with Bh6 immediately, opting instead to pester Black along the dark squares and threaten a defender of crucial g4 and d5 squares. There is no immediate threat of Bxf6, but it looms as White 'slows down' and improves his position.
The main move. Black's rook enters the game on an active square (which is difficult to attack) and prepares ...b5 while leaving open the threat of further c-file pressure via ...Qc7 or a future ...Rfc8. And, of course, the thematic ...Rxc3 is still a future possibility.
the White king is safer on the light-square b1. This move is a key idea for White; much as ...h5 frustrates White's kingside efforts, Kb1 can cost Black crucial tempi on the queenside (in particular, the queen can no longer reach a3 with check. This looks far fetched now, but in many ... Rxc3 lines it is a main thrust for Black).
! - an excellent idea (and still very much in theory); Black voluntarily opens up his kingside because...it works. Concrete analysis shows that Blacks capture is most challenging for White, so long as Black continues accurately. Of course, one small slip from Black and his open kingside will surely doomhim.
? - This move is a well-known (and once-popular) inaccuracy. The f-pawn advance is simply too slow.<n>Alternative variation: [Much more testing is] 16. h5 [when Black should probably respond ...Nxh5! with a strange looking, but solid enough, kingside and plenty of chances against the White king. It is worth noting that ...Rxc3 has long been a main move here, but it looks dubious after the simple Qxc3] Nxh5 17. fxg4 Bxg4
A reasonable response, but possibly not the best one. Black reasons that a knight on h5 is useful in stopping White on the kingside and activating the g7 bishop.<n>Alternative variation: [Worth a look is] 18... b4 [ again fighting for the initiative. Given ...bxc3's attack on the d2 queen, the mutual exchanges favor Black and force White to find something else, e.g.] 19. Qd3 Rxd4 $1 20. Qxd4 bxc3 21. exf6 exf6 [and Black is much better. Such is the power of ...b4 and fighting for the initiative in general. In this case, White's g5 bishop is entombed and thus helpless to save himself from ... fxg5.]
Alternative variation: [Far more spirited is] 19. exd6 f6 20. Ndxb5 e6 [with a wild game, as ...Rxc3 and ...fxg5 loom while the White queen can easily swing to h2 after ...fxg5 hxg5 and the whole position is a mess! (though Black retains better chances)]
I find it diff icult to believe in this move. Even as the e7 pawn is such a crutch in the Black position (e.g. now d6 is weak and White's pressure on the d-file threatens), Black has a dangerous attack and this move does nothing to help things on either flank. In any case, the computer favors this move and it seems to work out practical equality if White walks a precipice of tactics.
! - Black ignores the threat to his f8 rook in pursuit of his queenside chances. The game now becomes very sharp, as White can decide to take the material and rely on defensive resources or simply recapture on b5.
This turns out to be a mistake. Often it makes sense to decline material when facing a dangerous attack, but sometimes declining a sacrifice is even more dangerous than accepting one! In this case, Black keeps material equality for now and reorganizes on the queenside under favorable circumstances.<n>Alternative variation: [ It turns out that] 21. Bxf8 [works, as] Bxf8 22. Nxb5 Qxb5 23. exd6 Bg7 24. c3 Rc8 25. Rhe1 [lead to an approximately equal position where Black's active minor pieces and queenside pressure (not to mention the g4 pawn) compensate for White's central pressure and powerful d6 pawn. The game would remain razor sharp.]
! - Black keeps his bishop on the long diagonal, anticipating an opening and forcing White to hold off creating passed pawn counterplay via exd6 owing to ... Qxb2#
It is hard for White to find more reasonable moves in this position. The natural Rhe1 may have been stronger, but it's not clear if White can survive.
The g-pawn advance wins on the spot. White cannot hope to stop the pawn and hold the game, as Black's 2 minor pieces allow him to protect the pawn and go hunting for straggling White pawns on the kingside while White is tied up. There is no defense. 0-1.
And then I make a second mistake and almost kill my knight, but for some reason, White doesn't take the knight.
Wanting to keep my bishop for now.
Now I want to get my rooks out of the back rank so they can support my queen.
White can take my pawn with the Bishop but I have a possible mate in Qd4+ followed by Qb4#, as the Bishop will no longer be protecting the King.
Moving my rook to support the queen.
Mate. I think White was doomed upon losing both the Queen and Rook and willingly exchanging bishops and knights. My personal theory is that if the score isn't tied or if I don't have an advantage, I refrain from trading or exchanging pieces unless absolutely necessary, especially if I'm behind more than one or two pawns.
This was one of my first and probably the shortest game I have played (so far) in the Walking the Walk & Learning to Run Welcome MT 11<n><n>I think it can best be described as a painful reminder of what can go wrong in a game
At this point I was reasonably happy that white had a weakened pawn structure and I would soon be able to castle
This is where we vary from the Gameknot database which only has h4 as an option. Although I was suspicious of this as an unusual move I couldn't see what was to come. In fact this move serves two purposes, firstly it keeps the d1 h5 diagonal clear for the queen and secondly it threatens the rather nasty Ng5
simple developing move to threaten the pawn on e5
This was a bolt from the blue for me. My first instinct was not to take it, however after Qh5 I would be in serious trouble
Pretty much the only way to avoid mate, if I can get my king on f8 it can at least get a little protection from the knight which can go to g8
with hindsight I realised the purpose of this was to open the a3-f8 diagonal for whites dsb
The first phase of the assault is initiated by White with 4. Ng5... White is poised to hone in on that f7 square -- twice attacked, once defended.  So white ceases the moment to begin his attack on the king side.
So black defends in the center by cutting off the white bishops pathway to the f7 square.
White forks Blacks queen and rook and provokes Black to recapture. By moving his king, Black forfeits his ability to castle so as to extinguish White's onslaught, or at least have it contained.  In the opening play, it is generally not a good idea to move the same piece twice.. thus white looses a tempo and exchanges knight for pawn and is now down in material.
...which forces Black's king closer into the center and becomes an important defender of his knight on d5. Here we have the Fagatello attack, Leonhart variation.
White takes with 9. Bxd5+.Black only has one piece developed on the board compared with White's three pieces actively in the game.  White's pawn structure is still solid and unscathed.  Black has a very weak e5 square that White can manipulate. There's just not enough hiding places for Black's king; he's abit stuck in the middle of the board being drawn further into White's territory.
Here White threatens 11. Ne4 mate which leaves Black in a pickle.  How is Black's king going to defend himself against White's mate in one?
10....Be6 Here Black wants to trade bishops; his bad one for White's strong bishop.   White wants to build up pressure in the center and Black wants relieve built up pressure and open up the center so more of his pieces can actively play.<n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><n><

Now both light squared bishops are off the board.  Black must somehow regain his equalibrium and put an end to this downward spiral.
Now the walls are coming down for Black; his position is crumbling.  After this check with 12. Ne4+, Black's king is forced to come closer into White's territory.
With 12....Kd5, Black's king seems to be on his last leg. His king has moved all over the board which lost quite a bit of tempo.  Soon as the queens come off the board, the tables turn on White when Black's king goes on to become a powerful attacking piece.
White has no time to make a weak passive move.  He cannot let up on Black's king. White must  keep the attack going without taking time to stop and smell the roses. Black's king is steadily being pushed further away from his comfort zone.  White, a bit up in material, can afford to sacrifice his knight on e4. Leading to 13...Kxe4 14.Qxe6 Kd3 15.O-O Qd6
White's queen squares off with Black's king. White's queen controls the d5 and f5 squares preventing Black's king from retreating back into his own territory. Black's not going to last long after this. He can't hold this position together.
So now Black has walked himself into the corner with a mate in 3.  He still is an inch away from being checkmated.  15.Qg4+ Kd3 16.Qe2+ Kc2 17.d3# and mate.
Black is passed the point of no return and his king is doomed.  White is only helping Black by tightening his noose... unfortunatly it will back fire like the many times before and then before you know it, he's tightening the noose around his own neck.  15...Kd3 16.Qe2+ Kc2 17.d3# and checkmate.
The only square Black can move to.
Very unusual, and a little premature to develop the Q. It also blocks the Black KN from its natural square.
Now because of Black's Q and KN, his KB is blocked in.
My King is now safe and I still have both center Pawns held in reserve to open the position at my leisure.
A mistake. This piece should have stayed on the Q-side to guard the King. 10...N-N1! was the proper move. This would also strengthen the QB3 square, in preparation for ...P-QB3, sealing off the QB file as an avenue of attack.
My Pawns are now secure, and if Black tries 13...PxP e.p., 14 PxP preserves the intiative with a dicovered attack on the Black Q.
I'm not sure what exactly Black's idea is here. Two Pawns cannot by themselves conduct a successfuil attack. Although maybe the point is to gain space on the K-side.
I double on the QB file, with the intent to weaken the Q-side Pawns... and an ancillary threat of mate, which I didn't think he'd overlook.
2. ....... dxc4 - the QGA.
6. ..... Qe7+ - after Ion's Q and lsb pile up on my poor little f7 pawn, Glenda finds herself pressed into defensive (and attacking?) duties on only move 7.
9. Bxb3 - queen trade.  At least the threat on f7 has now disappeared but Ion has a lead in development.  I need to clear the decks fast!
13. ...... Ke7 - Henry must defend that e6 pawn and stop a knight incursion onto f7.  Although one of my knights is on an active square I still have to develop my queen knight and Fou Lenoir.
21. ...... Rae8 - In the chat Ion wondered why I exchanged my active knight for his seemingly passive bishop and for uniting his d pawn with his e pawn.  The solution is in this move.  It prepares e5 where I will swap off my isolated e pawn with his d pawn giving him an isolated e pawn.  However, the plan did not work out in the way I expected.
24. dxe5 - the pawn push to e5 was scuppered by Ion playing his rook to f1.  I would have lost a pawn if I had played e5 due to the rook pinning Fou Lenoir against Henry once his knight moved.  However, Ion gives himself a doubleton isolani on the same file as my own isolani so at least I have given him a bit of a concession.  However, there is a danger that Ion could make use of the f and d files for his rooks and so I must now prevent a rook incursion on my second rank by playing my rook to e7 on the next turn.
26. ...... Rd8 - preparing to double on the d column and then harass King Ion.
30. ..... Kxf7 - so I find myself in my first ever K&P ending against The Coach.  Can Henry get over to the queenside to stop King Ion coming in trying to gobble up my pawns?  We shall see.
Here is a short English Attack in the Sicilian, when Black adopts a true Najdorf setup with ...e5.  The action gets going quickly out of the opening with an opposite side castling situation and direct attacks against the kings.  Note:  As usual, my annotations assume some prior knowledge of chess, therefore, you won't find me annotating a move like 2...c5, or 3. d4.  My annotations are not for the rank beginner.  Thanks!
The Najdorf Sicilian was first played in 1937 Warsaw in Steiner-Najdorf and resulted in a victory for Black.  The variation employed in that particular game is now referred to as the Schveningen-Najdorf, as it features an early ...e6.  The variation with ...e5, was first played in 1942 by Karel Opocensky.  Najdorf would not take up the line with any regularity until 1955.
This is the modern move order to reach the English Attack.  Previously, 6. Be3 was the main line, however, the obvious 6...Ng4 can take a swat at the bishop and force it to move again.  While this is not a threat to the existence of the English Attack, the theory does run deep, and by choosing the 6. f3 move order, I have been able to streamline my study.
Continuing in the vein of the "True" Najdorf.  Mentioned earlier is a Scheveningen-type setup with 6...e6.
The knight has been forced to decentralize and Black has good control over the d4-square.  In return, he weakens the d5-square and the d6-pawn.  Black also has good counter-chances on the queenside due to the a6-pawn spring loading the pawn storm.
The most natural square for the bishop, as Black wants to contest the d5-square.  As usual in the Sicilian, if Black can expand with ...b5- and/or ...d5, the game will most of the time be an equal contest.
Developing the queenside to prepare for rapid castling and pressing on the weakened dark-squares created by ...a6.
Black reinforces the dark-squares and also keeps the c-file unobstructed.  White will push the g- and h-pawns and Black will attack down the c-file and throw forward the b- and a- pawns.  Straight forward and violent.
The race begins...
Fischer chose 12...Nh5 against Robert Byrne in 1971, more recently in the 2007 World Cup Bu Xiangzhi chose this move, the more aggressive 12...b4.  On the face, ...Nh5 does seem to be a solid defensive move, as Black can keep the g-file closed and block the h-file.
After I played this move, I checked the database to see how popular this move was, and it turns out that this move is relatively rare.  Only 17 games in the Chessbase Database.  Opening the g-file seems quite an important factor in the attack against the Black king.
Scooting the king off the c-file and preparing, if necessary, to play Rc1 to defend the c-pawn.
A little finesse I wanted to throw in, to get the rook to move off of the c-file, the purpose will be clear in the next move.
Now if Black returns to the c-file with ...Rac8, White would have the move Be2 for free!
Forcing the knight to c1, as I dont want any bishop sac tricks on the a-pawn.
Double-question mark.  Black had to play ...Bf6 to guard against my next move.  Tactically it fails, but why would the attacker want to exchange more pieces anyway?
Black must return the piece to clear the 7-th rank for defense, but this overloads the queen and the bishop on c4 drops.
Thanks to my opponent for the interesting game!!!
The dear old Sicilian Defence, more popular these days even than the Mutual king's Pawn (1...e5), owing to its aggressive attempt to wrest from White the initiative.
A crossroads.  White still had the option to play a Closed Sicilian, but with this central thrust irrevocably embarks on the much more popular Open game.
The Lowenthal Variation - described in MCO 11 as 'a kind of hyper-accelerated Boleslavski-Pelikan-pawn-push dating back to 1839!'  It goes on: 'It has ... retained its feasibility.'  These ...e5 counter-thrusts by Black (a feature also of the Najdorf) herald an aggressive approach to the game by Black.   There is a downside, however, and that is the d5 and d6 squares become weak and the Black d-pawn backward.  Black 'expects' that his active play will mask or offset this strategic defect.
This move is just about White's automatic response to Black's central aggression, and indicates White's readiness to go toe-to-toe with his opponent.  Also feasible were 5.Nb3 and 5.Nf3, but neither places any pressure on Black.  The text move immediately tries to exploit Black's weaknesses on the d-file.
(?)  In general, moving a piece twice in the opening is not a good idea 'unless there is a tactic'.  On the other hand, White's knight has moved 3 times already, and will soon have to make a 4th.  But given the strategic risk inherent in Black's choice of line, perhaps more celerity in development is called for.  Indicated (and usual) is 5...d6, solidifying the centre, and freeing the light-square bishop (LSB), and gearing up for Q-side expansion within a few moves.
(?!) 'Knights before Bishops' quoth GM Lasker.  But circumstances alter cases.  At the moment, White's small advanced guard is imposing a little bit of a crimp in Black's game.  One way to free this is to enquire of White if he is interested in exchanging Queens: 7...Qa5ch  8.Bd2 Qc5.  After 9.Qxc5 Bxc5, Black will have at least have caught up in the race for mobilization (development).  The Queen exchange itself would be justified by its effect in freeing Black's game.  Meanwhile...
Forking K and B.  Fortunately, White can defend both...
(??) ...but fails to spot the threat, and hence loses a piece and, pretty much, the game.  Instead 9.Bd2 Qc5 invites Q exchanges in circumstances similar to that two moves ago, but in which Black has stolen a march (...Nf6).
(??) Black hadn't seen it either!  Well, this sort of mutual oversight is not unknown even among grandmasters, but all the same, one wonders what Black had in mind for the Queen check.  Bearing in mind that the move played is a poor second best, it still made a lot of sense to prevent the further break-up of Black's pawns after Bxf6.  Of course, ...QxB would have served the same function.
(??) Developing, but still failing to connect the dots between a5 and g5.  Black is the first to wake up...
Completing his mobilization.  Black still has some work to do there, but with his extra piece has nothing to worry about.
(!)  Fine move, placing his bishop on a more active posting before mobilizing his Q-side.  12...d6 would have shut the DSB pretty much out of the game.
The e-pawn had to be defended, and White in understandably reluctant to relax his guard over f2.
(?!) The GK engine much prefers 15...Be6, here, and I'm inclined to agree (I don't always).  For one thing, if White exchanges bishops (he has little other option), Black find his f-file opened for the Rook(s).  However, this pawn advance does secure the DSB's tenure of the a7-g1 diagonal, and its pressure on f2.
(?) Gratuitously weakening his own K-side.  I'm willing to bet Black was hoping this would come sooner or later...  Instead, White ought to have been looking to the other wing.  Something like this might have been worth a crack: 16.b4 Ba7  17.Qxd6 Nxe4  18.Bxf7ch Rxf7  19.Qd8ch Rf8  20.Qd5ch Kh8  21.Rxe4.  Black can vary from this, but so can White.  A possible variant is this: 16.b4 Ba7  17.Qxd6 Nxe4  18.Qe7!  Probably best for Black here is 18...Bf5, but 18...Be6 may be as effective, though it does carry a risk: 18...Be6!?  19.Bxe6 fxe6  20.Ne5! Qf5? (Looks plausible, but best is ...Qh5, which preserves Black's edge)  21.Rxe4 Qxe4?? (21...Bxf2ch keeps things about level) Qxe6ch and it is White that is winning!  Probably Black would have been best advised after 16.b4! to avoid the whole shambles and played 16...b5 instead.
(!) The GK engine indicates ...Qf4 instead, but like id=ic3man1970, I prefer this.  Two well-known motifs are being exploited here: the Black Queen and Bishop exploiting the pin at f2; and the threat of ...Bxh3 and exploiting the pin at g2.  Combining motifs: the mark of a tactician.
(?) It is hard to determine the motive for giving up the exchange like this, unless in White's opinion Black's active and deadly DSB was worth more to Black than his rather moribund rook was to White.  Instead 18.Re2 was called for.  Now White goes a whole rook down, without the slightest chance to turn things around.
(!)  Well judged.  A whole rook ahead, Black is prepared to give back a tithe of it in a good cause.
I was trying to bring my queen to e3.
Didn't worry too much about open flange in front of king because black bishop could easily replace the pawn.
Probably one of the my strongest move in the game.
His pawn was protecting my king. And he can't move it.
My king was closed in also. Trying to engage it somehow.
Ah! now both rooks looked to be going for the kill.
Attacking the rook and protecting the pawn.
Why didn't he get my rook? 29. ...Rxe1 leads to 30.Rxg6 hxg6 31. Qc8+ Kh7 and if king gets to h7 I have no more checks and black can play his game.
white giving up his bishop pair is important as it determined that black's gameplan would be to open up the game and get as many pawns as possible off the board.
A better move here would probably be d4. Because if d4, cxd4, Nxd4 then white has an advantage in controlling the center of the board.
The knight probably had a better spot on d5. If Nd5, Bxd5, c4- then the position seems to be about even. The only downside to this variation would be that it is opening up the board for blacks black-squared bishop.
c4 is probably better as it locks up the position more and the goal of white is to keep the game closed up and prevent black's bishop pair from really controlling the game. This also gives up the e pawn for free.
Black is more than happy to trade queens as it clears up the pawns a bit more and his doubled past pawns will start to be important.
Black finally gets his king to safety.
Another questionable move. It doesn't accomplish anything as Black's king can move to h7 and White can't continue the attack.
Black is threatening checkmate here and white has to deal with the threat of RE1+. After the exchange of rooks its mate.
Giving the king somewhere to run to, moving the h pawn up is probably better here though.
Bad move, gives up a pawn and lines up the black queen and rook after Qxa2.
advancing the two past pawns will be the key to the game for black.
Offering to exchange h5 for f7.
Not a good move. Doesn't accomplish anything. Basically forces Black to advance his past pawn, which Black is more than okay with doing that.
Better move here is f7 as Black then has no way to stop the pawn from becoming a queen.
Another blunder, allows mate in 2.
Black succumbs to his greed.
The Black Q is in trouble.
Defending with a counterattack. if 7... Q-N4, 8 N-Q6 ch wins the Q [8... BxN 9 BxQ.]
This was my first game after joing the gameknot. After awhile of no practice due to my work
In his move of Queen, in my mind was he was he will try to mate me as early as he can...
in my surprice, he sacrifice his 2 knight for my 3 phone and that makes his King naked on my attack..
and the anticipated checkmate...
Unusual even on Gameknot!  The second move of the same pawn doesn't develop any pieces, or increase the scope of any, either.  It does deprive Black's KN of its natural square but it also relinquishes control of f5 and d5.  It's also more difficult to defend than a pawn on e4.
Normally a good developing move for White, supporting a subsequent p-d4, and providing an outlet for the Q on the d1-a4 diagonal, this move in this position deprives the Nb1 of its best square and fails to support the pawn on e5.
I saw no need to take the e5 pawn immediately: development was more important, so I launched the d-pawn forward, attacking White's Bc4, releasing my Bc8 and potentially my Bf8.
Attacking the now-unprotected g7 pawn and setting up pressure on e6 but Black, being better developed, has the resources to respond.
defending both the threatened squares and setting up pressure on f2
?? Whoops.  Black now forks on d3, revealing the attack on the Q from d6, so that even if White takes on d3 he still loses his Q.
After my crushing and stylish defeat at the hands of mrvroom, in my recent annotated game (the one called "I looked surprised but..."), I thought "Boy oh boy, I really want to do that to someone else". So, soon enough, I managed it.
Black must be aiming at fianchettoing his dark-squared bishop. If so, that rather defeats the purpose of 1...e6.
Those of you who know my playing style will know that I always try if I can to establish a pawn in my opponent's side of the board. I have recently had several shocks when I failed to effectively back up my pawn formation and the whole lot has crashed down around my ears, so I am trying to be careful when doing this. However, my central pawn formation looks strong enough to hold here.
When the two players castle on opposite sides, this always makes for a sharp game. This is probably because you can easily use pawns to help attack the enemy king's position if those pawns aren't shielding your king at the same time!
On the one hand, I want to play Ba6 in the near future. Then if ...Bxa6 Qxa6  Kb8 Nb5 and Black's king is in a spot of bother. But then if Black did not play ...Bxa6, my attack would not succeed and I would lose the under-defended pawn on d4 into the bargain. So I moved my queen to d3, where it can back up the bishop move to a6 and defend the pawn on d5.
Note that I would probably not have attempted that if my king had been castled on the queenside. Proof of how castling on opposite sides creates sharp games...or at least kingside attacks.
An irritating setback, but sets the scene for a beautiful sacrifice and checkmate. Can you see it?
Oh, I'm just going to show you anyway. A typical knight-and-rook checkmating formation, called the Arabian Mate, carrying the distinction of oldest checkmating pattern. A nice finish to an interesting game.
Black decides to just develop normally and allow a trasposion to the Yugoslav Attack which normally goes more like 5.f3 Bg7 6.Be3 Nc6 etc, without commiting the King's bishop.
Here black could consider 7...Ng4. There is a win for black in the GK database, but 8.Bb5  Kf8 seemed a bit too commital for my taste. In the game the black king eventually walked to f7, thus freeing the rook. Now white chooses tro transpose to Yugoslav mainline.
Common theme - the bishop gets out of the fire to mantain central tension; after 11.h4 Nxd4 white is forced to capture with the queen.
This is somewhat uncommon move propably played to prevent ...h5 at some stage. 12.h4 is in my opinion more to the point, as the move g4 can turn out to be unnecessary. 12.Kb1 is a possibility too.
Black pursues to play on the half-open c-file and show that white has lost too much time with the manoeuvre Bf1-c4-b3xc4.<n><n>12...b5 might be objectively stronger. Black intends to advance the queenside pawns and start an attack. Nothing deep in planning here, but those races are known to be quite hair-raising.
A solid move, preventing ...Qa5 for the time being, owing to the little trick starting with 14...Qa5 15.Nd5. <n><n>The game is now reaching the middlegame and both sides need to find a plan to follow. If allowed, white will play h4-h5xg6, Be3-h6xg7, Qh6 and mate on the h-file. In general, there are two kinds of plans that black can adopt. The first is to play the minimum amount of defencive moves on the kingside and take all measures possible to embarrass the white king on the queenside - a common race-situation. The other one is completely ignore whites play and try to find a sac-sac-mate-solution!.<n><n>In this position, it seems that black needs to find something more than ...Qc7, ...Rfc8 etc, since whites attack is likely to be quicker. 14...Re8 is one approach, aiming to keep the dark squared bishops on board and maybe prepare ....Qa5. I opted for different solution.
An exchange sac of a different kind!
So the thing here is that now it is black who has all the direct threats and long term pressure towards the king. Play on the b-file is premature, but it is not a shame to let white take over that file - after all, he has to play Ka1 to achieve that and it makes my bishop quite a threatening piece. White isn't now in form to attack on the kingside but then again, he is an exchenge and a pawn up. My guess is that this position should be somewhat better for white.
The knight has obviously improved, as has the bishop, so it has to be said that black has made progress. The loss of the d-pawn is at the moment important, as the c4-pawn is about fall and d5-pawn after that, too. White now tries to roll blakc over whit those pawns, to make as much damage as he can.
Material equality has been restored. I'm quite convinced that black has the advantage at this point - but my plan to realize it could be somewhat dubious.
Black now takes aim to the a2-pawn, trying to tie the white pieces to defend it. There could be a better plan, don't know about that. 26...Bxd4 looks terrible although black can then win a pawn. (Bxd4 Qxf3) I really didn't want white pieces to get unnecessary activity.
Improving the worst placed piece but, this is double-edged. The rook is better on a6 than c8, but allowing check in the back rank forces ...Bf8 which, of course, restricts the bishop. I maybe should have played the calm ...e6, cutting out any f5-ideas, giving the dark-squared bishop alternative diagonal and keeping the tension.
And now I actually started to have time trouble. I saw that the pressure on a2 does cramp white so that I could pick a pawn but I felt strongly that is was a wrong way to proceed - but I simply couldn't come up with a better plan. So I crossed my fingers and went for the pawn.
So here we see that with that had ...e6 been played, the bishop would at least have some scope and it would have given black some control of the a3-square. Now look at it! It used to be great and see through the whole board but now it is just miserable.
Black lost on time. I was about to move ...Re6 but hadn't the time to analyze 36.Bg7 (Kxg7 37. Qd1 Qg2  38.Ka3 Ra6 39.Kb4 Rb6  was the mainline - black keeps his pawn). I think I won't forgive myself for spoiling a game like this with a blunder like this!<n><n>Other possibility that I looked was Qc6 with the idea of Qc7. There was, however, 36.Na5 with complications. I must say that I'm not too happy with myself landing in this position, where white has the better bishop and some activity for the modest price of a pawn. I'd like to have some open analysis for this position, too!
I opened with the Reti, which my opponent claimed was his least favorite opening.  However, Black can usually transpose to many different lines.
The Nimzovich-Larsen attack
I fianchetto my dark square bishop, because I want to mount a heavy Queenside attack.
e6 clears the way for his dark square bishop, which should lead to quick castling.
He clears his bishop and is looking good in my opinion.  I'm glad he chose not to exhange pawns early, because the c4/d4 area becomes the focus of my attack.
I force the issue in the center now, because I want to open up an attacking line for my light square bishop over on the queen side and Bb5 is looking like a good destination.
Black fianchettoes his bishop, and his bishop pair has good angles on my king now.
Now my bishop is on an excellent attacking square which now happens to be inline with Black's rook.  Now he has to wait to take d4 or at least reinforce his knight...
Which he does with Qc7, however I now have all the ammo I need in the area to mount my attack.
He chooses to move the queen, but does so to a bad square in my opinion.  This move loses another piece.
And now I am up another pawn, but more importantly I have a mating solution (I actually had one after Qxb5).
6.a3 would lead to 6...axb4 and if 7.axb4 then Rxa1
Perhaps it would have been easier to promote the pawn if I hadn't allowed a queen exchange.
I offered my opponent a draw, and he accepted. He was worried about my passed pawn, and I was worried about his material advantage and strong pawn formation.
Was asked to annotate this game for the purpose of improvement by Nathan.<n>He says he GAMBITED a bunch and it paid off. I believe he meant that he countered a bunch. Its always nice to have some contempt towards the opponent. In other words, don't always reply as he wishes. If you do, then he simply controls the entire game with initiative and momentum.
Bishops Opening for white. The trouble with bringing the bishop to c4 prior to black playing e5 is that now black can play e6 and have the bishop bite on a chain of pawns.
Pinning the Knight to the king and prepares to castle.
Getting creative: defending the c3 knight, if black plays BxN then NxN preventing doubling of the pawns if white replied PxN. Also eyeing the juicy square d6 for the knight.
Shoe horsey!!!  What black could have done here is a tactic common in games with B at c4. That being 7...... Nxe4, 8. Nxe4 oh! wait white can't reply that way due to the pin. The tactic would continue -8.d5 forking white.                                                                                                                  So the best move for black is 7.......Nxe4 defends d6 and 8.Qd3 or 8.Qe2 is met by d5. If 8. Bd3 then black plays Nxc3 and white either replies bxc3 or (Nxc3 then Bxc3 followed by bxc3 anyway). This leaves white with double isolated pawns = a major weakness.  <n>Even 7.....O-O is better for Black<n>on 7.....Nxe4, Qf3 or e2 or g4 is okay for black as the knight capture is again met with the d5 fork.
If BxN then white plans QxN and black has a cramped position and unable to castle either side. So black forfeits castling by moving the king. Initiative to white still.
Guarding the knight but Bf4 was stronger as it gets another piece into the fray.
The best here. Gets another piece into the fray.
Trying to simplify things.  Here black missed a strong move (Nxe5) this forces the queen to move and also guard the hanging bishop at c4. After the queen moves to e2 then white still has two pieces in jeopardy, the knight at d6 and the bishop at g5.
After things simplify more, black decides not to take at d5. This again is a mistake as after the knight capture white will also lose another piece as two are still in peril. Black would have the two knights to block in the open position.
Saving the bishop and attacking the knight but this forces the knight to move or be guarded. What better place then c4, capturing a piece. I liked Bb3 here for move 14. as exd5 is met by Bxd5 and check. getting a pawn at least for the piece and opening the front door for an attack.
White could of moved the knight back to c3 or e3 but would be a piece down and black could play R to e/ f 8 and then K to g1 a type of false castling. <n>  Black also had a strong candidate move in 15.....Qa5 starting an attack of his own which requires white to react and give up his attack for the moment. Intiative to Black.<n>  Black must have seen 15....exd5, 16. Qxd5 with check and the loss of the c4 knight.
Offering to trade queens and then gets to back-off the bishop after QxQ,NxQ,rook moves.
Ouch! black didn't need to give in to whites plan as exf4 is fine due to the rook guarding the queen.
Now white is looking much better. White is down a piece but has the discovered attack on the rook yet to play. Rook to b8 was called for as it would of prevented this. Leaving the rooks on the back rank and able to be connected is usually good.
An intermezzio (inbetween move) that helps white greatly. Gets the rook out of trouble and allows the capture of the black rook.
23.Re7  is stronger as it flushes the king out from behind his pawn wall to f5. Kd5 allows Rd1  and gets another heavy piece into the mix for white.
White is ahead in material and has a simple win ahead. In hindsight: black had several chances to equalize and even pull ahead. Black just missed more things than white did.  Hope I was clear in my annotations and this was instructive.
Nimzowitsch originally came up with the idea of 1.Nf3 d5 2.b3 and 3.Bb2 to put pressure on e5,but Reti's idea of 1.Nf3 d5 2.c4 putting pressure on d5 is better.
The center is ripe and for the taking.
Putting my rooks in the center.
Now Black has the "hanging pawns" in the center
A flexible move.protecting the b-pawn and preparing to double my rooks on the d-file.
Now black has a beautiful placed Rook on the 2nd rank.
Black's knight on d3 forks White's Queen on e5 and rook on b2.The rest is pretty straightfoward.
d2-d4 comes, now Black must take d4
Black prepares to fianchetto his dark squared bishop (DSB).
I move my Queen to prepare for a Queen side castle. The idea at this stage is to attack Black's king side with pawns to open up the king's cover. Black's Queen side still had all pieces firmly hemmed in so he had to castle king side. Question: Is this the best position for White's Queen against the Sicilian defence? It would be good to discover a square similar to d6 for the Black Queen in the Caro Kann defence. Any thougths are welcome
Black attacks my DSB. What to do? I am usually loathe to trade a bishop for a knight, but in hindsight, I should have allowed the trade as then Black would only have his DSB developped... Oh well, I did just the opposite
Black readies to redeploy queenside
I help him along with tempo, as I can take my pawns up the board to open up Black's king side
I move my pawn up as opposed to defending it with my king
I continue with my original plan. I have to open up Black's position
I should not played b2-b4. Short term it is good as it stops the mating threat, but long term I have weakened my king's defences. In hindsight, I should have payed Na4, protecting the b2 pawn and attacking Black's queen. The queen must have moved and I would have traded a pawn for a bishop. Thougths?
I belatedly attack Black's queen. My plan at that point is to regroup my pieces around my king for defence
I pin the knight to the DSB and the rook
Black decides to open up my pawn cover
I continue with my original plan of a pawn attack on Black's king's position
In my mind, this is the big moment in the game where Black has taken a decisive advantage but gaining time, I had to take the pawn and Black would have my DSB
Not good. And my queen is in the line of fire of the Bishop
The king is on the march
The second alternative was the least worst one... Thoughts?
I must now take my king in the middle of the board
Black aims at my a3 pawn. At that point, my chief concerned was about my queen and king on the same rank, ripe for a rook fork. In hindsight, I should have protected the pawn with Ra1. Instead, I return to my original idea. Opening up Black's king's position
Hence 4 dxe5 Nxe4. 3... d6 is an alternative but blocks the bishop. 3... exd4 4 Nxd4 Nxd4 5 Qxd4 is equal on material but white has an iron grip on the centre.
The white square bishop is still unmoved. 5... b6 leading to Bb7 would have been a viable option.
Forces the exchange and weakens the black queen-side pawns after the next move.
9... Re8 aiming at attacking the king is negated by castling next move and Rb8 is too easily blocked to be useful. This prepares for 10... Be6, hoping to exchange bishops without weakening the king side pawn structure.
White tries to force open the e-file for his rook.
The advantage of this move is that it blocks the e-file and also attacks h2. Black's bishop pair is now a useful threat against the castled king. The game is wide open at this point, with white one pawn ahead.
Anticipated by black. White retains the tempo and restricts black's bishop, but black has snatched a pawn for nothing.
This move and my next few show my biggest weakness - I tend not to think through moves properly. The gambit is an interesting one, but I had hoped for a mate after Qxe1#. I missed the fact that white could move the king off the back rank. This move, g6, was intended to let white think I had made a mistake and move the c-rook off the back rank.
? The white queen has left her defence of the white king, and some interesting tactical opportunities for black are available. Black has 3 lines of attack, two of which are fairly unpromising but the third can easily lead to mate if white does not take care. The unpromising lines are Rh5  and Qh6 . Black played Qf4 .
In the end, white missed those options and played a move (quite quickly, as he happened to be online at the time) that allows a decisive black attack.
I won by checkmate.<n>As far as move 13 both players were doing fine, but I made a tactical error by sacrificing both bishops without looking ahead properly. It was mostly by luck that white made a worse tactical error in move 22. I spent about 15 minutes analysing the position - which for me is a very long time to spend on a move - and my suspicions were correct: there was a promising mating attack on. White made one last error in move 23, where he could have blocked the mate, but by playing without looking to the end of the sequence he let me force a mate.<n>I hope you enjoyed reading this. Please feel free to comment.
This was an uncommon Bird's opening, we were out of theory just after move 5, both black and white's light square bishops were exchanged by knights, but white allowed some damage to his pawn structure, white then followed a good plan to fianchetto his remaining bishop queen side, but with a bad timing he wasn't able to change his plan according to black's moves and lost a pawn and allowed further damage to his pawn structure, black was a bit underdeveloped, but white willingness to exchange the queens and the rooks allowed them an superior endgame B + extra pawn vs N, finaly I'll sacrifice a pawn to get the white king out of the fight and to force a promotion of my c pawn and to finally convert the advantage...
and this pin is the best white has...
as black doesn't want to compromise his pawn structure, I chose here a different move from the other game, were white played Qd6, the main purpose is similar to protect the knight, and after exchange, if it ever occurs, the position will be the same...
I'm the first to deviate from previous games, e6 (1-0) and 0-0-0 (0-1), were the moves already tried in this position, now white has to decide upon Be2, the best in my opinion, or Bxc6 giving up the bishop pair for nothing.
and now black has successfully prepared the exchange forcing white to decide to double pawns or to lose a pawn...
...but white didn't understood it and keep playing according to the previous plan, better was 0-0, and white could have recaptured with the rook after Bxf3
white decided to double pawns if Qxf3 then Qxc2 wins a pawn for black
? again keeping up with the previous plan, better was to postpone the development of the knight, to keep the control of the d4 and e5
the pawn break makes even more sense than before Nc3, now if exd4 Nxd4 recaptures with tempo as it attacks the white queen, and forks c2 and f3 (a triple fork) then Qd1 is the best for white Nxf3+
? this allows black to simplify his task, the pawn majority on queen's wing might became decisive
now black has to develop his last piece and connect the rooks
the idea is if 23.Nxh7, black can capture the knight with 23...f6 to trap the knight 24.h4 white last chance is to get to h5 to control g6 24...Kf7 25.h5 Kg8 and the knight is lost, and so is the game as is just a matter of technic
black just improved his pawns with tempo by attacking the knight
now allows white to undouble his pawns, but gains space in the process
to limit knight access to a4
?? blunder allows Bb4 to gain one tempo and play Be1 to skewer the h4 pawn
... gains one tempo
isolating the h pawn to engage the king to it's defence
maybe with the idea Ng6+ but after Kd6, if white plays Nxh5, then Bxh5 wins because white king would be out of the fight far away from the queens wing were my pawn majority is sufficient to promote
Zugzwang, leaving white with the choice, anyway the fight would be king against knight, with the bishop to win any occasional tempi if needed
Now black will bring the king to the opposite wing and if white decides by the exchange on h4, then white's king will be to far to fight against promotion
two options here for white:<n>a) e4+ fxe4 fxe4+ (Ke3 to try to get to the queens wing is countered by exf3 and white's king is forced back to the f column) Kd4 gains opposition and achieves the promotion<n><n>b) bxc4 bxc4 (creates an isolated pawn) e4+ Kd4 (gains the opposition, also possible is fxe4 similar to the first variation)
Mistake here I think on my part. In retrospect I would probably either move f6. The issue with that though is that if they move 4.Bxf7 then I need to take with the king leaving him in a vulnerable position. Any idea on a better play here?
Whilst not perfect the knight did the intended job perfectly avoiding me having to move my queen though still vulnerable to 7.Bxf7 forcing the king to move.
Is this a blunder on their part? Allows my knight to sweep in.
Advancing the pawns and hemming his bishop back badly.
No need whatsoever for me to take that trade-off especially as their pawn is now isolated and I'm putting pressure on the sole knight defending it. Next turn I can attack the pawn with either the bishop or the queen developing them at the same time. However I've managed to totally miss the fact that c4 is now undefended and has a clear line to my king...
I'm annotating this because in a previous annotation of mine concerning the shortest game possible a comment said that this mating pattern could only happen to a beginner. That's not true. It can happen to the best of us when we least expect it.  My opponent has played over 1400 games here on GK.  He could hardly be classified as a beginner.  Besides, 1423 rating is still fairly respectable.<n><n>Most players would not think to be careful about allowing 'fools mate' when starting off with queen-side play. That's what makes this game somewhat unique and interesting. You must always think about what your opponent can do to you, not just what you can do to him.
Since e6 was planned, I needed to make sure the bishop didn't get blocked behind my pawn structure.  Weak bishops belong in front of pawns whenever possible.
Perhaps he was going to contest e4 after all. I was not worried about it. The count was 3 to 2 in my favor.
This was not the best of moves. It creates serious weaknesses in White's pawn structure and does not really do anything new...except perhaps allow the queen move Qa4+.  It's a little premature to attack queen-side with the pawns, especially since he played 2.c3 instead of c4.
My only serious choices were Bd6, Be7, Nbd7, a5, or c6.  Be7 and c6 were too passive while Nc6 blocks the pawn action.  The move a5 was a little bit too aggressive to be made before castling. For me, Bd6 was an obvious choice given my plan to castle as soon as possible. I only needed about 2 seconds to make this decision. <n><n>Again, I'm only playing by principles in this position.
This move makes no sense to me. The advance of the b pawn would leave it in take. I expected 6.Qa4+ instead. There were lots of better moves than this one. In retrospect, Nb3 was probably one of the better ones.
This was a severe mistake.  Again it weakens White's pawn structure. It also severely weakens the e1-h4 diagonal.  The 3.Nd2 is now made into a bad move too; it blocks in the King.  I had to think a little bit here...to make sure I was not missing anything.  This position looked too good to be true for Black.
I predicted 8.fxg4.  The sacrifice is too tempting for most.  Best was probably 8.e4 Qh4+ 9.Ke2 forced. dxe4 10.Nxe4 Bxe4 11.fxe4 Qf2+ 12.Kd3 Qe3+ 13.Kc2 Qxe4+ and White is in deep serious trouble.
The King is completely blocked in and can not move out of check. No piece can intercede. And no piece can capture the Queen.  <n><n>Yes, games really can end this quickly.
Seldom seen, and good by black.
Wanting to play e4, with a strong center.
...As forseen, defending it.
Again, better than Nc6, since it allows the c pawn to move.
The beginning of the standard attack, following with g4.
Good, black seeks for counterplay on the queenside.
? Not necessary! I should have pressed the kingside more, with Ne5. If black plays the c pawn advancing or taking d4, nothing too dangerous for me happens.
...black has to retire the N and I have to take advantage from this cramped position.
Supporting g5 for my pieces, trying to provoke h6.
I need more support to the N in order to play h5. My attack is far from solid, here.
Defending. I'm on a dead alley, since any pawn push will just cause black to advance another pawn and my attack vanishes.
I regret to play this passive move, but I have to defend my R and prepare another sac.
In a blitz it is very difficult to calculate all the complications, so I had to go on. This was the best I could see at the moment.
Making the king go to a  more vulnerable square if I manage to bring my Q to h6. Still, it has the downside to open a good square (Ng7).
Better was Kg8, so to leave this square for the Ne8.
Not o-o-o, since I'm not sure at all I will prevail on the kingside, and I don't want to wait for the long delayed black's break on the queenside.
The more black exchange pieces, the farther becomes my winning chances, but...
...and black resigns, since there is no defence against the mate. Whew! I didn't deserve this win!
I missed the impact of this move. It holds the central tension and begins the pressure on the advanced f pawn.
Black is trying to preserve equality, but White's edge in development is too hard to meet.
This game played in the Chess coaching club mini-tournament is not so much an analytical annotation of a game in the usual sense but more just my personal (and very brief) thoughts at various points. <n><n>The aim of the tournament (and these 'annotations') is to allow the players taking part to discuss the strategic and tactical factors of the finished games. The stronger players then being able to help those whose weaknesses may become apparent through the annotations (like me and my bad thought processes!) and the weaker players to have a chance to learn from the stronger players thoughts throughout their games.
Damiano variation, from my limited experince this is probably not a wise move to play!
White could also have played:<n>6. exe4 fxe5<n>7. Qh5  g6<n>8. Qxe5 but could not capture the rook yet due to the discovered attack Bb4 .<n><n>Another option was:<n>6. Nf3 and capturing the pinned Knight on e4 with dxe4 later.
The only move. 7...Ng5 trying to save the knight would result in a discovered attack with a more decisive gain of material (R 2P for nothing as opposed to R P for N):<n>7...Ng5<n>8. Nxh8 Kd7 <n>9. h4 Ne6<n>10. Qxd5
Places the Rook on the open file and sets up the discovered check Bg4 .
Exploiting the weakness of the f7 square.
Trying to get mate on g2.
i have to take it.
The exchange is in my favour. Black is slightly ahead in developement, and has both his central pawns. On the counterside, it is delicate for me to develop the lsb.
Making a naive threat on f2, more with the intention to control the game than to actually threat something.
Ah, that's it. Because it doesn't take into account Na5. Now I must act as if I had a plan, after all. Let's see.
Now, my "plan" was...
Planning to redeploy the queen to the kingside, but overlooking...
The idea is Qh3, provoking g3, and go on h5, h4. I know it is too slow, but I can't see anything better. Now, I would suggest Bc7 and Qh5, but this doesn't crush white. I'm down, and in serious danger to lose the game.
Blinding my dsb, but unfolding at last the dsb's power... will it be enough to balance the game? Anyway, white's not - too - energic play the moves before quickly reverted to my advangage. I still have the king in the center, but I can't help it.
Ok, white could defend, an probably his position is stronger than before. I just managed to unravel a little my forces and create threats white has to care for... but not anymore. Furhtermore, I can't castle, and doubling the rooks on the g column won't help. f5, threatening e4, was countered by e4 by white. So I thought my only way to increase pressure was...
Aiming to h2 by Rh6.
Well, this is not the best move now, since I can think about f5, and see what happens after f5 again. My king would be wide open, but my attack would be powered again.
But I had this in mind, so I went for it. Now, the threat BxN, followed by Qxh2+ is not deadly for white, but still I couldn't find the right way to proceed otherwise.
Nice bind over white. I can't really break in, but he is tied. These are dangerous positions. What's the white's weak point? My knight in d4 would be wonderful, but how can I avoid the bishop to take it?
The move is now Ke7, avoiding the check after RxR. But I was too nervous, and wanted to press on.
I challenged untateve to a revenge match after my defeat in the Annotation Project :)
Interesting move. The database recommends 4... Nf6, continuing with development. The move played prevents Nb5 and Bb5 (irrelevant, since I was not planning on making either move) and also prepares for the advance of the queenside phalanx.
Okay, now we give the knight a bolt-hole so it doesn't have to retreat to b1. As well as not blocking the rook, a2 is a better square for it as it hits the b4 pawn, preparing to leap right back into action.
(?) Gives away the pawn, since bad things happen if Black tries to grab the e4 pawn in return. Better is 10... bxc3, as in chescho v jaburr.
And this little tactic is why White was happy to make the usually disadvantageous exchange of a centre pawn for a flank pawn. Both e4 and f7 are attacked.
Black chooses to lose the bishop rather than the f7 pawn, probably since 12... Bb7 13. Bxf7+ Kf8 14. Ng5 with the threat of Ne6+ is nasty for Black. But 12... d5 could have been played, preventing Bxf7+ at the cost of a pawn rather than a piece. Whether the attack White gets is enough to justify 13. Rxe4 in response... I'm not sure.
Black refrains from the fork 13... d5 since the e6 pawn would be pinned. This move threatens the fork in earnest, so I hastily retreat the rook. Not all the way back, since leaving it on the second rank makes doubling easier (when the time comes).
"Passed pawns must be pushed", but White has other things than promotion on his mind. The pawn was three times attacked; the only way to add another defender on this move was 19. Bb5, but after 19... c6 the bishop must move again. The pawn is more easily defended on a6 since I already have three pieces aimed at that square; also, the advance clears space for my pieces to get into action, now that it has become clear the queenside will be the focus of the next phase of the game.
Black increases the pressure on the a6 pawn, but is not yet anywhere near creating a threat of capturing it.
So I have time to bring out another piece, with nothing concrete in mind as yet, but various tactical possibilities may arise from Black's queen and rook on the same diagonal.
One more piece enters the fray, and the path is cleared for the rook to join in. This threatens 23. Nc6, forcing Black to allow an exchange of material.
I had seen Nb6 coming, and decided that the queen was also well-placed on a5. White threatens Nxd5, winning a pawn and forcing two piece exchanges, or Qc5, threatening the queen exchange and driving Black's queen into passivity unless he accepts.
White throws yet another attacker into the fray and Black is forced to accept another exchange, since 26. Nbc6 was threatened.
White finally forces the passive queen retreat I mentioned several moves ago. Now the focus suddenly changes, since Black has exchanged a fianchettoed bishop for a knight, always a dangerous move. It's time to storm the citadel.
Black's next reveals that the intention behind this move was to give his king somewhere to flee. I thought the intention was to play 28... Rb5, quite a good defensive move as it interrupts White's plans. I pondered for some time and decided my best option was to go ahead anyway with the planned 28. g4, robbing Black's knight of the f5 square so that it cannot defend against Bh6.
Black's king sees that the citadel walls are crumbling and tries to run. But a royal robe isn't an easy garment to run in, and he's left the back door unlocked.
All forced so far. Now 31... Kd6? or 31... Ke8? allow mate in one; 31... Nf6 loses the knight, with mate to follow; 31... f6 is the least bad, since I can't see a checkmate and would have taken the queen exchange, but the endgame is a dead loss for Black. The only other option is for the king to return to the ruins and await events.
If 32... Qc8, giving the king d6, he can't get any further: 33. Qg7+ Ke8 34. Qxg8+ Kd7 35. Qxf7+ Kd6 36. Be5#
The last few moves were all conditional, and in my hurry to input them before my opponent moved, I missed 36. Qe8+ Qd8 37. Qxd8#. The move played is, however, almost as forcing. Black can delay mate by sacrificing the queen and rooks, but he chooses the gentlemanly way out.
And the neat little finishing touch is that the pawn I advanced to a6 earlier has a vital role to play in the final checkmate. Untateve is so far the highest-rated player I've won against, but as he's beaten me once as well it's no big deal. I'll just enjoy my victories as they come, one at a time.
triing to play aggressive, not allow horse to go c6 immidiately
developed bishop, ready to castle, defending strong pawn d5
atacking bishop f5
going to catch bishop by g5
as I looked he had no chances to lead his pawn to 1st rank
A strange looking move, merely inviting c4 and forcing the bishop to retreat.<n>But the target remains the same: Bxh7!
How can black neutralise the threat? <n>9. ... g6? is no good as 10.h5 Kg8 11.hxg6 fxg6 12.Rxh7! Kxh7 13.Qh5  Kg7 14.Qxg6  Kh8 15.Qh7 checkmate.<n>Black could try h6 or f5 (as mentioned earlier).
This is the only move black can play.<n>If 10. ... Kxh7 11.Bxe7 Qc7 12.Bd6! and now black must play 12. ... Qxd6, otherwise it's game over. For example: 12. ... Qb6 13.Qh5  Kh8 14.Ng5 and Qh7 checkmate cannot be prevented. <n><n>The queen could also go on a suicide mission, but to no avail: 10. ... Kxh7 11.Bxe7 Qxe7? 12.Qh5  Kg8 13.Ng5 Qxg5 14.hxg5 and once more Qh7 checkmate is inevitable (supported by the rook this time).
Look at this position! Black's entire queenside is undeveloped and his King is naked and alone in the other corner. And that is the point of Bxh7 and the question: when does it work? Without the analysis potential of a chess engine it is impossible to calculate with precision the long-term benefits of playing Bxh7, and even computers sometimes cannot see the full potential until a few moves have been made. <n>Basically, any sacrifice made to open up the opponent's king should be made if (a) the king will end up truly exposed, and (b) pieces can be brought into the attack quicker than those brought in to help the defence.
Not 12. ... gxh5 Qxh5  13.Kg7 Qh7 checkmate. <n>Another possibility is 12. ... Bxg5 which I played through as the following wonderful King-hunt: 13.hxg6  Kg7 14.Rh7  Kxg6 15.Qh5  Kf5 16.g4  Kf4 17.Qh2  Kxg4 18.Qh3  Kf4 19.Ne2  Ke4 20.Qg4  Bf4 21.Ng3 checkmate, and what a beautiful end to an artistic hunt. Never forget that chess is as much art as it is science.
Bringing another piece into the attack. All things considered though, 13.hxg6  is a simpler and more obvious move and also possibly guarantees a quicker end to the game: 13.hxg6  Kg7 14.Rh7 ! (which I didn't see at the time) and if 14. ... Kxg6 15.Qh5  Kf5 16.Nxd4 checkmate... very pretty.
And with the h-file open the King-hunt begins.
kind of a stupid move because the bishop can't really move anywhere.
was bishop take the best move?
this is just amazing. you have to watch this (the games already coming to an end) and that a8 rook is (as good as) dead
now I COULD take the rook and be done with it. OR i could push the king a bit further. this is just awesome: watch this.
was this the best possible move for black? I think so, but it is still mate.
1...e5 often leads to a transposed Sicilean defense, in which white has an extra tempo.
Prepares for a d pawn push to d4.
Opens the long diagonal for the bishop.  This weakens the kingside castle slightly and seems unnecessary since the bishop can be developed via e2.<n><n>Edit:  sicilian_monster pointed out that g3 followed by Bg2 is strong because of the fianchettoed bishop, especially since black has already played c5, weakening his queenside.  He further commented that it should be met by d5 because of the advanced e pawn and weak d3 square.
The fianchettoed bishop puts a lot of pressure on black's queenside and controls the critical central squares e4 and d5.
Preparing to castle.
This may be what White had in mind when he played 4. g3.  If white had played Nf3, then e4 would have forced the knight to move again, though supporting the pawn with d5 or f5 would be problematic.<n><n>The knight supports a d4 push if White were interested in clearing the center and opening the game.
The d5 square is weak due to black's advanced c and e pawns.  Black is forced to defend it with pieces rather than pawns.  I played this move thinking to prevent Nd5, but realized a move later that it encourages white to occupy it since Nxd5, cxd5 forks black's knight and bishop.  <n><n>Bf5 is better.
I had originally planned to play Qd7 further pressuring h3 and preventing white from castling.  After Nd5, I decided against it but believe it would have been the better move since it would have protected both b7 and c6.<n><n>Rb8 supports the b pawn, which I had planned to advance, and removed the rook from the long diagonal.
Once I lose material, I feel I need to resolve things quickly, before my opponent can bring his extra material to bare or we simplify to a lost endgame.<n><n>This opens the b file and prevents Bb2 without preparation.
My opponent was too canny to give up a rook so easily.

Looking back now, I don't think White could have sustained the checks and after an eventual white move of Bd1, Rb1 should have sealed the game.

White has no useful moves at this point and is almost at zugzwang, German for "compelled to move", at which point any possible moves loses.  After 47. a4 a5, he's forced to abandon protection of his e3 or e4, either losing his pawn or allowing the black king to penetrate.<n><n>48. Rf8 Ke3 49. Rf5 Rxc2  (Re2 50. Bd1 Rd2 (Re1? 51.

Black probably doesn't need to worry about his a pawn at this point, but it seemed wise to move it off of white, to prevent capture by white's bishop if things went wrong.
0-1<n><n>White resigned at this point, as black can push his e pawn and should be able to queen one or the other.  <n><n>Please feel free to message me if you have comments, questions, or find any mistakes.
I was very happy with this position: I have to do something dramatic to manage to lose, and playing for a win is fully possible. We are playing for two results, as the Russian chesschool would say.
Okey, so I didn't manage to do anything with the rook, maybe I can try the queen and bishop endgame?
The game will finish in a draw: 50...e2 51.Bxe2 Kxc6 52.f6 Kd7  and the king rushes to block the pawn with a easy draw. In the game I thought black would win the a4-pawn, so maybe I should've played on. As a good rule: Always play to checkmate or only kings left!
Alright. I have played the Sicilian Defence here. This is the alternative move to e5.
Usually my opponent wouldn't play this, they usually go for Bc4 and try and set up for the four move mate or King's Gambit. I will see If I can find an example for you later.
And now for some development (rule #2) As Black, steal the advantage from white.
I would say from here he wants to castle King-side but too early to tell for sure yet. Best to play it cool and keep developing.
This is to stop white from advancing his Knight  to d5 and opens my Bishop and Queen.
Now White has made a mistake here. His Bishop cannot go anywhere, really from this position except back to where he should have gone in the first place g2 (Rule #10 & 11).
Nothing to do but continue to set up my castle.
Now If I take his Knight with mine it will be a straight swap with the possibility of a discovered attack on his Queen. But that means my Knight would have to move to h5 to back up the Bishop (Rule #3), bad for me. Instead I will avoid the confrontation for now and see what white plays
This is a strong castle as long as white castles on this side also. It can get hairy if he castles opposite and starts pushing pawns on my King-side but it is going to take a lot of moves before white can even attempt that.
Ok I said there are some exceptions to the rules. In particular to this case Rule #3. Only as a last resort I play this next move though
This defends my Knight from his Bishop (Rule #5) and attacks his Bishop with my other Knight (also Rule #5)
Defend the Bishop
Finally he castles. and we are even in development but it is my move so I still have the advantage to attack and forcing him to defend
Opening the pathway for my bishop to chase his Rook @ f1.
Eliminate the obstruction.
Invites the exchange; the doubled KBP will help secure the middle.
The position here is a little odd.  Black has the overall advantage with two bishops against two knights, but White's exchanges have freed his position.  Black needs exf6 Bxf6 to get his second bishop really in play.
As it happens, that pawn was too well defended; Black wins a pawn against the ill-conceived attack and with his Rooks now doubled and White's knight sidelined, Black has the advantage.
A mistake; with the Rook on White's back rank the pawns can take care of themselves on the Queen's side.  The King's side is protected only by a backward bishop.
A nicely executed attack from White, if a little too late.
Black is back to a single-pawn - and considerable positional - advantage.
And Black prevents the pawn advance.
I personally think this is the wrong way to recapture, as it allows black to develop the Nb8 with an attack on the white queen, gaining time.
Black advances in the centre, gaining space.
This is a mistake. White has to prevent further advance of the d pawn with e3.
The correct way to recapture, as to not compromise the king side pawns.
Black correctly develops with tempo
White hits the Bishop.
Black correctly continues to develop.
White prepares to fianchetto the white squared bishop.
Which white doesn't meet in the best way. 15. e3 was better threatening to take the pawn on d3 with his bishop.
But now this is too late. Rc1 was needed to save his queen.
Now if the knight moves, Rd8 is mate. Faced with yet more material loss, white wisely resigned.<n>I thought this is extremely well played by black!<n>Many thanks for reading, please rate it on the star system, and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!
Must haarab initsiatiivi.
I give more protection to the e5 pawn.
He protects it some more, so I hold off for a bit.
And a mistake. If I had realized that my move would put my rook in danger, it wouldn't be in danger. Fortunately, my knight is there to protect it.
I already knew the pawns were about to fight.
I'm hoping to get my knight on d3. Not a good idea at this time.
Hoping to drive back the rook some.
And it worked.
Now I attack the d2 rook more, but I overlooked what was about to happen.
The rook and bishop weren't free anymore, so I turned my attention elsewhere.
Now he's in trouble! I plan to bring back the queen.
I was expecting him to use his bishop, not his rook.
I see opportunity to take the rook.
Now my advantage is massive! What surprised me though, is that psilure78 continued to play instead of resign. There's really nothing to gain now. Checkmate is near.
Now there's definitely nothing to gain, but the game continues.
Black opts to castle quickly as white comes forward.
wrong way!!! (even if King had gone to F8 he still would have been in poor situation)
With a fork on the queen to boot!
causing me to think some
this is good.  the doubled pawns made it more difficult for white to realize his advantage.
this allows white to win rapidly.  29 ... Qf5 offered more resistance
intending after 31 ... Qc6 to set up a decisive advance of the pawn with e7 and Rf1
Hi all! This is a game from an ongoing mini-tournament that I just had to annotate. The tactics and complications are simply too good to pass up! Enjoy!
Aha! After a quiet opening, Black fires the first shot, announcing his intention to break into the White King's position by force. This is probably the most common strategy to break a castle with a fianchettoed Bishop, when a Bishop-Queen battery isn't available to force a trade, like here. Another option would be the immediate ...e5 break, followed by shifting the Queen to d7, but I like this better anyway. More style.
It's much more common to block this with h2-h4, but that leaves White's g3 pawn somewhat weak and presents a huge invitation to Black to play ...Ng4. The text frees the f-pawn to move and threatens to trade off Black's LSB--a critical piece for the castle assault.
?! This does not prevent the exchange, so I'm unclear what the point was (not that 10...Bh7 looked particularly promising right away). However, it does force White to weaken his castle to get the trade done...
!? Black wastes no time in pressing the attack! There's suddenly a lot of firepower pointed at g3...
This got complicated awfully fast. Black is threatening to win both White pawns, and lines to the WK are about to open. Look through the main variations: White suddenly has no clear way to maintain material equality! (A) 13.gxh4 Bxh2+ 14.Kh1 hxg4 looks terrible. (B) 13.gxh5 hxg3 [1] 14.hxg3 Rxh5 or [2] 14.Kh1 Rxh5 or [3] 14.Qd3 Rxh5 don't seem to be any better, and at any moment Black will castle long and bring the other Rook into play on g8 or h8. So what is White to do?
!? White's biggest difficulty was the pawn on e2 blocking his Queen and Knight from getting to the kingside. With pawns hanging already, White decides to simply throw another one at the problem to gain some space and activity. What was already a complex situation has gotten even more unstable.
This seems to be indicated. Anything else allows White to win a piece for several (at least 3!) pawns with 14.e5, which, while Black would still have a strong position, diffuses the attack somewhat. Two quick examples in that line (please excuse me for not writing out *all* the variations!): (A) 13...hxg4 14.e5 hxg3!? 15.exd6!? gxh2+ 16.Kh1 Qxd6 seems very strong for Black despite the loss of the Bishop, or (B) 13...hxg3 14.e5 gxh2+ 15.Kh1 (15.Kxg2?! Bxe5+ 16.dxe5 Qxe5+ 17.Kg1 hxg4) 15...Bxe5?! (or 15...hxg4 or 15...Nxg4) 16.dxe5 Qxe5 softens the Black offensive but he will have good endgame chances with his unopposed kingside pawns.
!? The WQ *must* enter the fight if White is to get some counterplay. At this point, there's little White can do about the advanced g-pawn, so he sacrifices h2 in order to put counterpressure on f7 and activate the Queen. Also possible was 16.h3 hxg4 17.Qxg4 f5 (there isn't much better, as 17...O-O-O 18.Rxf7 Rdg8 19.Qxe6 looks very good for White all of a sudden) 18.Qg6+ Kd8. (Black mustn't slip up and play 18...Ke7?? because 19.Qg7+ wins the Rook).
This was the reason for choosing 16.Qf3 over 16.h3. The WK now gets to hide out on a light square behind a Black pawn. The pawn is nasty-looking, but with no Black LSB on the board and his own Bishop on the h1-a8 diagonal, White's King is actually pretty safe here.
There's no good way to save the f7 pawn, so Black gives a pawn back in favor of connecting his remaining kingside passers.
I think a Rook move might have been better here, perhaps 19...Rhg8. It's not like h2 is in any danger, and it would be good to get the Rook off the a1-h8 diagonal, even it it's not in any immediate danger.
White has converted his momentary safety in the shelter of the Black pawns into sheer aggression, trying to force the Black pieces into less consolidated positions and simultaneously free his own Bishops.
Kicking the Rh8 and threatening to push d5-d6, winning the Bf4.
!? Just as White did earlier, Black responds to threats by steadfastly ignoring them in favor of making threats of his own. Note that this doesn't prevent 22.d6 in any way--it just makes the resulting variations that much harder to calculate.
?! White decides he's willing to lose the important LSB in order to win an exchange. By taking the Rh8 off the board, he stands a chance of playing an eventual Kg2 and picking off the advanced Black pawns.
?! Black did actually have a choice about accepting the trade: attempting to get out of it with 22...Rhg8 appears to fail because the Bf4 is hanging, but further examination shows an escape: 22...Rhg8 23.Qxf4 Rxe4 24.Qxe4 g2+ 25.Qxg2 Rxg2 26.Kxg2 cxd5 and the resulting slugfest of an endgame with RRB vs QN is sure to be exciting. Not that the text is boring, of course.
White sees a lot of barely-defended Black pieces in the middle of the board--so he'll try to remove the defenders (here, the Queen and the d5 pawn).
??! The intention here is plain: Black's Rook has precious few places to go where it will be of use, since the Bf4 is hanging and if it falls, so does the pawn chain. So Black sacrifices one of his passers to draw the WK into the open and give the Rook someplace to go with tempo.
Certainly not inviting a trade with 27.Rf2 or marching into the open with 27.Kf3, as straying from h1 too far would tie the White Rooks down to defense. As the endgame approaches, White cannot afford to have passive pieces--the Ra1 is problematic enough!
This is a nice tactical maneuver--it seems as though Black has kept a Knight and Bishop for the Rook, since 28.Rxf4?? Qxa1+ gives Black an easy forced mate. White must continue to play carefully, but despite all the Black pieces on the kingside and no White pawns to deflect them, there's still no obvious way for Black to force his way in!
But the right move for White is easy to find. This Rook was the problem, and was also his least active piece, languishing in the corner all game. Now Black has no satisfactory way to defend both the Knight and the Bishop, and must lose one.
There were many places for the Queen to go, but this seems like the best. After 30...Rxc5 (not 30...Nxc5?? 31.Rf8 winning the BQ) 31.Kxh2 Rc2+ 32.Kg3 Rxa2 Black must be very careful not to get trapped by the heavy White pieces. For example, 33.Rc4+ lays a nasty trap; if Black tries to stay out of the center with 33...Kb8? 34.Rxd7! picks up the Knight for free (if 34...Qxd7?? 35.Qf8+! and mate in one).
Planning 32...Qg6+ to avoid the Rf8 threat and hopefully keep White in check as long as possible.
?? Oh, White makes a horrible mistake that brings a disappointing end to this exciting game. Correct was 34.Kg1, where Black no longer has any checking threats (34...Qh2+ 35.Kf1 seems a bit fruitless, though Black can force a Queen trade if he likes (not that he should)) and now it's White's turn to bring on the hurt. Note that the immediate 34.Kf1?? loses a Rook to 34...Rf5! 35.Rf4 Rxf4! 36.Qxf4 Qxd1+.
In this position, White's two knights prove very strong, especially the d4-knight controlling the centre. Black should play e5 sending back the knight and developing his DSB.
Supporting the bishop and preparing for Queenside castling (O-O-O)
We have now reached a point where we can fruitfully inquire into the logic behind White's Queen-side castling. As we have seen earlier, the possibility of Pawn captures and recaptures is a very important factor in planning the course of a game. These captures and recaptures result in  line-opening. And this line-opening in turn creates highways for the movements of our forces in an aggressive mood. In this case, White's basic tactical idea is to play h4, followed by h5, then PXP, taking advantage of the fact that Black's King pawn is at g6. Once white has playe h5, he is certain of opening the h-file, and having Black's address he will muster his heavy artukkery ib the newly-opened King Rook file to operate agianst Black's King.
This is the usual move made by White to avoid any tactical tricks due to the fact that White's knight at d4 was directly attacked by Black's Knight at c6 and indirectly attacked by the "Dragon Bishop" at g7.
But White is inexact too. Expoliting Black's last move, he should play 10....Bh6!!!! forcing the removal of Black's precious Dragon Bishop (Obviously, 10......Bh8? is answered by 11.BxR winning the exchange) The text has its points though. By playing Kb1, the white king protects the a2 pawn with another piece.
Again Black is wrong. Intent on prosecuting his counterattack, he neglects to preserve his Dragon Bishop by playing Re8.
Preparing to begin the Pawn-stroming attack with g4 followed by h4 and h5. But again White has negelected to remove the Dragon Bishop by Bh6.
!! Now Black is certain of being able to retain the Dragon Bishop as 12.Bh6 is answered by 12......Bh8 With the vital point established once for all, Black's counterattack can flourish
! Preparing for the powerful infiltration.....Nc4; as we know, occupying the aggresive outpost is one of the key features if Black's policy.
Now, it has become clear that Black's threats are maturing more rapidily than White's. Yes, what use is this move? Where's h4? If White has not begun to play h4, then what use is g4? Well, we'll see as the game gets on. Anyhow, Black can now play 13....Nc4, but instead he hints in a much more effective move.....
Too Late! The Dragon Bishop can now reatreat to two squares (h8 or f6, and not f8!)
Now that Black's Rook is at e8, he can simpily avoid the exchange of Bishops.
Another little case of "too little and too late". Black simply continues with his own attack. (We no longer call it counterattack as it is obvouis that it is Black which is the real aggresor)
Going ahead with the knight plan (as I explained about).
White seems almost on the pont of reaching his objective. His Queen and Rook are on the h-file, which is about to open after PxP. But meanwhile, Black has placed his forces in menacing postions and even at this stage he can shatter his opponet's postion with......Well, can you guess?
!!!!! Beautiful play! Black has paused in his attacking maneuvers to sacrifice in order to avoid the opening of the a-file. (note that hxg6 e.p is not possible).
Even though Black's kingside is a little weak, his pieces are working to form action. White cannot attack with only one Bishop, and now Black has a outstanding move (could you guess what it was on move 17?)
!! Black does not bother with the gain of a Pawn (21....Rxf3) as he wants to win in the quickest manner.
Taking advantage that the knight on d3 is pinned! Also, have you noticed that the White King and the Dragon Bishop are on the same diagonal?
Closing up the diagonal and protecting the knight.
Black chief threat is now 30.....Qb3+; 31.Ka1, Rc2!. Note that white's knight, being pinned by the Dragon Bishop, cannot capture either queen or rook, and is helpless in the game.
This is one of the ways to stop mate, but has its own faults.
Yes, and if Black sees, its mate in one.
Well, we are near the end, so.... This tournament was played in High Barnet, White (Clareus) vs. Black ( G. Lynn). The maximum was 35 moves, and Black wins in 34 moves. Lynn won with glee, of course. Now let's get on to the next and final moves and see this marvellous game come to an end.
Here I started to press , but always he was awake
now , I started to play
now he made the fatal error & it is my time to win the game<n>watch & enjoy my finish
Out of book. I had never seen this move before. Black attacks White's weak point (f2) just as he would attack Black's weak point (f7). The real choice is whether to ignore the move and develop, or to attack the bishop with the next played move.
The bishop seems to be more active in this position then at d2.
Spite check with development. My whole plan at this point was to castle as soon as possible and attack the king. Much too generic.
This was an error. Bg3 was in order with control of that diagonal. This move just begs for the advancement of the pawn. I was hoping that Black would take my bishop and I would take with the pawn establishing a blockading, isolated pawn on the e file. Notice how Black has established control over the center of the board with an advanced isolated pawn. This error was the critical turning point in the game.
I would lose a piece if I tried to do the exchange.
At last a logical move by White. It blocks the advancement of the pawn and exchanges off the recently developed bishop. Too bad I could not exchange off Black's dark squared bishop.
I was not about to exchange the bishops allowing for Black to open up the file against my f pawn. I began thinking of the ideas of Steinitz who suggested taking away the advanced posts for the enemy knights. Unfortunately Black had no intention of taking his knight off of the excellent post at c6.
I wanted for the exchange on the file of the rooks. I would end up with a mate. Of course my opponent was able to see this for what it was, cheap shots.
I wanted to get rid of the queens but at this point I had no real plan. I knew that it would destroy my pawn formation in front of my king but ...
Here I am down a pawn so it would be logical for Black to exchange off pieces. This would make the extra pawn on the queenside passable.
I knew that the bishop being on b4 would be a target for the pawn advance on the A file. Perhaps I should have just advanced my bishop on that diagonal to protect the pawn instead.
My king is out of position to get the A pawn when Black advances it so it was time to gracefully bow out.
Standard exchange though my development is now much better than blacks. I need to try to take advantage of this
We are now out of the gameknot database. This is to cover g5 which is being pressed by my knight and my dsb
Opens the diagonal for blacks dsb and still keeping his castling options open
This seems a much better place for my knight, it's almost impossible to budge at the moment and causes maximum inconvenience for black, his queen now can't move on the d8-h4 diagonal
Trying to budge my knight, black is clearly feeling the pressure here
Pressuring my knight further but I dont want to move it. if he wants it he will have to take it
I'm not sure if this is better than a3. If 15 ...,bxa3 16 Bxa3 then I have a nice diagonal for my bishop, otherwise I am happy with it where it is
At this time I am still considering some sort of knight sacrifice with 16 Nf6#, gxf6. 17 Bxh6 though I can see no clear way to force a win from there as the king still has an escape on the queen's side.
The queen has a number of options here, however I am looking at getting my knight to c7 which will lose black the right to castle and I think give a slight gain in material
This is to put him under even more pressure, he almost has to take with his pawn which will mean doubled pawns restricting the kings mobility. Moving my f3 knight then clears the half open file towards his king
Looking to create a hole in the middle with something like 21 ... exd4, 22 Qxd4 then looking at getting my knight to e5
ignoring the threat and making some of my own
I think this may be a mistake, though it does defend the b pawn. I was looking at pushing the king further back with Qg4  and then bringing my knight and rook into the attack
Looking at e6 which would trap the black king in
trying to tighten the noose on the black king
Another error on my part. Ra8 was surely better
... so that I follow the main line in the DB, waiting for the moment when I can try something.
to enable Ng3 (still in the DB
Protecting d6 and joining the rooks.
To open the d1h5 diagonal for the queen and prepare a further Ng4
Black on attack
The plan is a massive attack on black's kingside
White is one pawn late but I hoped the advance on the kingside would compensate it.
White should create a weakness on the kingside and h6 seems a good spot.
Black défends.
To fire the DSB...
Sacrifying the bishop to get a hole in the castle
At this point, I had the impression to have fair chances.
White has to carry on attacking. With such a late in material, letting the initiatice to black is a suicide...
4...d6 This Blocks off my Bishop, but helps guard the e-pawn. It also lets out my Light Squared Bishop.
Both of My Bishops stare into the corner. Was Kingside the best way to Castle?
Breaking the pin.
Lining up on diagonal, and getting Black closer to Castling Queenside.
! Gets rid of my second attacker. Black's attack fizzles after the trade.
But Black doesn't want to trade -- he wants to give away a Rook and a Pawn.
! This cuts off the Bishop from the corner, and threatens mate.
And here it is. An attack on the stronghold proved disastrous. Please leave comments, and thanks for reading!
Typical French setup. White has grabbed a bit more space, which constricts the movement of the black pieces, but the centre pawns of white are also easily contested, which is what black will try to exploit in order to get to a middle game in which his e- and d-pawn will be free to march onward and create a lot of danger in the white position. I often struggle against this opening, so French experts may find my play rather inaccurate.
Already inaccurate? I noticed in de GK database, that b4 is the conventional move here, after which black takes either pawn and white can gain it back at some point after playing 7. Nb5. The played move quickly leads to some trouble with my centre.
Any exchange at c6 will lead to an extremely powerful centre for black, along with a half open b-file, which I feared would create too much play for black. After 9. Bb5, a6 would follow and I would be forced into the unwanted exchange.
The pawn is lost anyways, since Bf4 would be answered with Ng6. Therefore, I invest my time into positioning my pieces more agressively. Black will most likely castle short some time soon now and at that point I will have all of my pieces eagerly jumping the king side. This knight moce adds to that effect both because the knight becomes more agressive ths way and opens up my position to facilitate Qh5 and f4.
Nxd3 may be better, since black might want to quickly move into an end game, given that he has a pawn advantage at this point and after xd3, the pawn structure of white is suboptimal. Maybe black was not interested in offering up the c-file?
This move is important, as it makes it harder for black to create an escape route for his king... At least that was my thinking during the game. The GK computer analysis strongly disagrees and calls this move a blunder. The proper defense against this move will be outlined later in this annotation. I myself considered the strong defense a sign that the initial sacrifice of the knight was wrong, but the GK computer considers THIS to be the blunder giving white an advantage of 0.41 after the following line (I do not fully understand it myself, but it's posted here so it may be discussed): 17. Ng5 Re8 18. g4 Ba5 19. f5 exf5 20. gxf5 Bxf5 21. Nxf7 Bxd2 22. Nxd8 Bxd3 23. cxd3 Raxd8 24. Qg4 Kh8 25. Qh5+ Bh6
Not the right defense. As we will see, white's active pieces will make quick work of blacks position. While black's position was not particularly easy to defend, there seems to be a solution to it. Since the lines are not forced, there are a lot of options, so I guess we might first consider the less reasonable ones before coming to the one that appears the strongest and was suggested by the GK computer. The knight on g6 can not move, because of Nf6 xf6, Qh7#For this reason neither Bxf4 nor Nxf4 is an option. Removing the pin on the knight by playing 17....Re8 seems to be too slow because of 18. f5 leading to for example A) 18....Nxf5 19. g4 Nh6 20. Rxf7 Nxf7 21. Qxg6 Bd6 22. Nxd6 Nxd6 23. Qh7 Kf7 24.

Qf7 Kh8 23. Rf3 Ng8 24. Qh5 Nh6 25. Nh7. While none of these lines are forced and I may have missed something, it seems like it is very hard to defend after 17....Re8. The correct defense is therefore to immediately move the knight on e7 to a better defensive position. From the GK computer: 17....Nd5 18. Ng5 Nf6 19. Qh3 Bd6 20. Bxg6 fxg6 21. Bxd6 Qxd6 and white basically simply stays a full piece behind. I may myself have opted for 17....Nd5 18. Bxf8, but at that point the attack will also

mostly have died down and two pieces for a rook is generally not a very favourable trade.
And black resigns, as he can't deal with both Bxf7 and Qh7-h8. I am sorry for the giant walls of text and (most likely) the need for a chess board to follow all the lines. I hope you still enjoyed the annotation and found the game interesting. If someone could tell me if there is a way to better edit the text, so I can make paragraphs, rather than big walls of text, I could maybe make this even a bit more readable.
If played a move earlier, White can't take this knight of course. This move is not on the database, Nc6 is the only move which is. After the game I compared my moves with the computer recommendation. Computer does like Na6 and assesses the position as equal.
With the Bishop on g3 I can afford to keep my Bishop a bit longer. Computer agrees with me.
I was beginning to like my position. How is he going to contest c file? The White queen can only go to e2 otherwise he loses a pawn on f3. He can't move his Ra1 without the pawn on a2 going. Computer agrees with my move, but thinks White is slightly better.
I wanted to keep up the pressure on the d pawn. I did consider Qa5 too. The computer likes Qb5 and considers the resulting position equal.
Of course! Now if I had played Rc2 after Bc3 my rook is trapped. Computer agrees with my move, and thinks White is +1.57. I have to agree!
But now I felt that I wanted to close up the position. I can't allow a central file to open, and for him to check on my back rank, as if I play Bf8 he has Bb4 - the point of a3.
I can't avoid at least one rook exchange on the c file, so I advance on the king side. Maybe I can exchange a pawn or two or open up his king side. Computer prefers Qc8
He secure the king side and I push on with tempo. Computer likes this move.
Computer likes this move and assesses the position as +2.94 for White. I have to agree. I thought I was going to lose.
Of course if he takes it, I take the b pawn, my queen is active and I have exchanged my doubled pawn. I was dreaming of 31. Bxa5 Qxb2 <n>32. Rb1 Rc1+ 33. Rxc1 Qxc1+ 34. Kh2 Bh4 and I am threatening mate! 31. Bxa5 Qxb2 32. d6, as the computer pointed out afterwards, seems to win for White!
So preparing to use my King if necessary, to help block and/or round up the passed d pawn.
I wanted to give extra protection to my pawn on e5.
22.  Qc1! - Eschews exchanging queens on d8.  White has a clear advantage owing to the beautiful diagonal of his lsb.  Glenda moves off d8 to avoid fronting up to a possible Rd1.
25. .............. Nc6 - preparing to play Nb4 to steer the white lsb off d5 and to exchange off one or not both pairs of rooks.  But white scotches that idea with moving his dsb to a3.
28. ..................... Rd7 - black can do little to prevent the gathering storm.
32. ........... Kh8 - I am now a clear pawn down, but I soldier on and because my f pawn is only attacked by the lsb I take the opportunity to move my king to h8 out of the pin.  There now comes a doubling up on the d file.
37. ........... Qb1  - over the past few moves there have been a plethora of exchanges resulting in me being two pawns down.  I think of throwing in the sponge here but consider what type of ending I am in.  Firstly, if you are one or two pawns down then the endgame you want to be in is either a Q P ending or an opposite coloured bishops ending.  At the moment I have both.  If you have an active queen in these types of ending then you have the chance of landing some useful checks.  Glenda does just that by landing on b1 at the first opportunity.
39. ......... Bf2 - no checks are available at the moment.  The a pawn cannot be taken because the Wicked Witch of the West will land on d8 giving a nasty check on me pore ole 'enry stuck in the corner.  In fact, come to think of it, she could land on that square now, but my Good Witch of the North, Glenda can start checking again.
40. h4?? - I think this move throws away the win.  My dsb can now help Glenda in harassing the white king.
42. ............ Qxg3  - I reclaim one of my pawns.  I decide against taking the h pawn because it is a non checking move and I do not want to allow the Wicked Witch of the West to hassle Henry so I keep Glenda on checking my opponent's king instead.
44. ........... Qf2.  Glenda pins the Wicked Witch of the West to the White King.  The exchange of queens would leave me a pawn down but in an ending with bishops of opposite colour.  I think I will be able to hold of the passer on e5 and protect my remote a pawn with the dsb.  I therefore decide to offer a draw.  My opponent decided to accept and I had to hand back 4.7 rating points I obtained from him in Stealth & Wealth.  But at least I did not lose 14.7, so my rating remained in the 1680s.
Stupid- this should just go to c7, and avoid giving White a tempo.
Not achieved without a cost- the black Nf6 will spend some time returning to anywhere useful, I think.
Hmm, this can't be right. After 24...Nh7, Black is suddenly looking pretty good. Black currently can't castle and once the Rh8 is exchanged off, this kingside looks a little exposed. It's difficult to see quite how White should procede, however, since the tempting Rdg1 starts to look a little uncomfortable after moves like Qb6 and Nf5. Maybe the simple 24.hg followed by swapping rooks and Rh1 will suffice.
Hi everyone!  I know my star was NOT shining brightly in my latest loss against Master Freddy (Easy19) but this afternoon I logged on to my PC and was given a welcome message by Gameknot - Game Won (Checkmate) Congratulations!  A welcome end to a losing run of 5 games.  How did I do this, well, read on ........
12. Qxc3 - after developing Fou Leblanc to one of his best squares in the opening there is an exchange of knights.  My opponent now needs to do something about that cannon on h8 or it will be fodder for Glenda!  Black chooses to close off that diagonal with f6, but this move is about to allow a tactical shot as you will see.
13. .......... Kf8 - I could now go a pawn up with Q or B x b6 but aha, the opposing king has moved onto the h6-f8 diagonal!  Aha, there is a black steed on g8 which is defended by both black king and rook, but I see a way to win at least the exchange.  First comes a removal of the guard with Bxg8.
14. ........ Rxg8, forced unless black wishes to drop a whole piece, but look, nothing now guards h6 so Fou Lenoir gleefully goes there.  Now if black moves his king to e8 then Qxg8  wins hands down as I will immediately exchange queens after nabbing that rook!
15. .......... Rg7 limits the damage to the exchange.
18. h4 - I start a vague plan of trying to prise open the black kingside and use my extra rook to then exploit this along with Glenda and the other rook.
23. Qe3 - Glenda moves out of the pin by the enemy lsb but keeps a careful eye on the pawn on b4 and the Wicked Witch of the West.  She is fully prepared to come on to the a file if necessary to neutralise the Witch's power on that file.
25. ......... Kxf6?? Suicide, Suicide and double suicide!  Glenda is as pleased as punch to be relieved from defensive duties.  As the enemy bishop is only protected by the Witch then Glenda moving onto d4 is a double attack or fork.  As the king is in check, black must deal with that and the lsb must be abandoned to his fate leaving my opponent a whole rook down.
29. ......... bxa3 - black tries some counterplay but to no avail as I now turn on my usual jstevens1 simplifying trick - forcing an exchange of queens as follows ......
32. Kxb2 - I am now a whole rook up in a rook and pawn ending.  Beginners - here is how you clean up your opponent who opts not to wave the white flag!
34. ......... Kf7 - the final pair of rooks have been exchanged.  The black king tries to stop Glenda from making an appearance on e8 and indeed he does block it.  But never you fear, he will soon be in a zugzswang .....
39. ........a3  - Henry gleefully munches his prawn on toast as he surveys the squares c8 and e8.  Who knows, he may end up with two wives!  Don't forget that Henry the Eighth had 6 the greedy so and so!  The black king must now move after Kxa3 and then ..............
42. Re6 - thanks to her castle the deadly game of kiss chase does not last long.  The black king has only one legal move and that is to h7.  It is the castle that delivers the coup de grace on e8 and not Glenda though!  A happy ending for jstevens1!

Hi everyone!  Just to let you know that this is round 2 against dynamic_dv, the guy who skewered Glenda to one of my castles in "An Expert Lesson in Tactics".  This game was a classic Sicilian game in which both sides castled on opposite sides and when that happens this means a race involving pawn storms and heavies behind them.  Whoever gets behind in tempo here usually cops Old Matey.  I thought I had a strong attack, indeed it seemed that I had won a pawn.  But, a strong move by the Wicked Witch of the West put paid to all that and I ended up being a pawn down, and in the final position having to give up a second pawn to a knockout combo.  Ah well, at least I felt that I wasn't quite such a doormat in this game, but you the jury may feel something different.  Here we go .......
8. 0-0-0.  The sequence of moves between 1. e4 and now is called the Richter Rauzer Variation of the Sicilian.  It seems like the Sicilian Dragon in that both players castle on opposite sides, etc...  As you can see, all my pieces bar Frere Leblanc are off the back rank and even he flies the coup on move 12.
11. ........ Bxc6 - this bishop's control over the a8-h1 diagonal will prove decisive in my opponent's favour later on.  Black is mounting a pawn storm already and I think the knight exchange was to try and take some of the sting out of black's attack.
18. Rxd3 - my rook ends up on a rather unfortunate square.  I decide to keep on with my plan of a kingside mating attack with moving Glenda onto the g file next move and push my g pawn further up the board making contact with the black h pawn.  I miscalculate black's threat big time.
21. gxh6.  If black captures either my rook or my f pawn forking queen and knight he will lose his king to Glenda's kiss of death on g7!
26. Kb1 - I just had to get Henry out of the threatened discovery else he would become a widower because that light squared bishop that I talked about in a previous note woud play Bxf3  and I would have to get Henry off the c file and abandon Glenda to her fate.  Moving Henry onto the d file was probably no better as the Wicked Witch would simply snap off my b pawn.
26. .......... Qf5!! - this is the move I overlooked in my calcs, I simply didn't analyse far enough.  Both d and f isolanis are attacked by the Wicked Witch of the West, one is defended by Glenda but also attacked by that pesky lsb and my d pawn is not protected at all.  I try pinning that wretched lsb but it doesn't come off.
28. ....... Kd7.  It is a real pity that Glenda was on f1 and not g2 because I could have pinned that witch to her other half with great pleasure but this is not possible.  My knight drops back to defend the f pawn but now my h pawn will drop to a skewer by the enemy rook on h8.
31. Bxd2 - the queen swap momentarily reduced black's pressure on my position but this does not cut the mustard as my h pawn now falls.  Shame as it could have been a lovely passer.
33. Kb1 - Henry moves back to try and protect his rook and Frere Lenoir.
35. ......... Ba4 - the b pawn was captured by black's dsb to enable black to move his lsb to this square.  If the b pawn had still been on the board I could have blocked this bishop move.  My rook must move away allowing Frere Lenoir to be taken.  If Henry moves to c1 to try and get two pieces for the rook then Rc5 simply drives Henry back to b1 and the rook falls next move.  Any rook move will result in Frere Lenoir being taken with check and I could well lose a third pawn and his rook will be a bone in the throat.  I therefore decided to wave the white flag on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  A sad end to a game of which I had high hopes.
????? This was the losing move - he had the draw!!  Suddenly with his king on c8, there is not enough defence on c5, so like the GPS system says - RE-Calculating!!!!  I saw he handed me the win on a platter even though he possibly thought he would run over and queen on the g or h file.
So I pushed the pawn to open the way
Still under control as he forces me to block his king away from the action
Pushing to get the Queen - I saw the next moves and new It was all winning for me
His way back in, but it is to late
Now we are at the start again equel pawns - I am closer to the action though as he has to run George over to g6 - he cant stop the d pawn falling
Planned - here I could also play 53. Kf3 Kxg6 54. Kxg3 Kxh5 then push the pawn and he has to waiste Kg5 for instance to open the way -  I chose not to waiste the time as he had to take both pawns before moving
Planned and here I knew it was mine to through away - it is hard to queen 2 pawns with constant checks, I knew there would be a way to get his king away from the pawns and I had 4 ranks to do so
Only move - but if 56. Kg5 then he could now play either g4 or h5
Preparing for the end - I knew he would not leave the pawn and had only Kh5 or h5<n><n>Kh5 would lead to Qf7+ and would also drive the king away from the pawns eventually
Big blunder that I dint even count on.Second mistake after the BishopB5.
Here something flashed. My advanced Knights with the upcoming fork Nf3. I looked deeper for a chance. :D<n>I jumped to the analyze tool and it was there. All of whites turns become forced for the next 11 moves or so. Mate in 11. See the post game analysis.
I talked to him about it and he seem to have give up on the next move.
Having said that old people do tend to make silly mistakes. Like my dad for instance. He kept forgetting to take his keys when he left his house and ended up having to smash the front door down like 3 times in a week or something
There's no use trying unorthodox fancy moves against someone with as much experience as volhouder. The guys probably seen just about every chess move there is. I'm going to play it nice and safe for the mean time.
Ok i think this was my first mistake... i've broken my back line and started to develop as well. Before i had all my major pieces in a nice straight line. Seriously though... moving my bishop to b7 is a good move against the less experienced chess players like children or drunk people. They often forget about pieces in the corners so try to cram as many pieces in there for a surprise attack. This is a good move against anyone with a rating of 1100 or lower.
Unfortunately for me though, my opponent is of a much higher standard. Asking the obvious question... why did i bother making this move?<n>Ok, anyway, he has now moved his pawn up to d3. This provides further support to his pawn on e4 that my bishop was attacking. It also allows his black bishop to come out and develop/attack if he wants
I'm now building a safe area to castle into. If i choose to castle that side my king will be well protected...  Apparently it's important to castle in the first 12 moves. I'd like to disagree with this statement but i've lost track of the number of games i've messed up through NOT castling early enough
Ok so he now has both horses and bishops out and in play. In good attacking positions. One of my horses is blocking in my bishop. Can't really go anywhere either. I'll have to move a pawn to free the bishop up. g6
i think he wants to get rid of my central pawns. I'm currently in no position to castle and do not want to lose my middle pawns as it will leave my king vulnerable. time to bring in some extra support
Ok now i'm feeling really uncomfortable. Not a good position to be in at all. I don't have any pawns to force his bishop to retreat as i moved them all up like a crazy person. He has now supported it with a pawn and gained total control of the middle of the board.
That last comment about gaining total control of the middle of the board might well be rubbish. I once heard someone say that in reference to a game of chess and i think it kind of fits this game??? Yeah so i just threw it in there to try and sound clever. Anyway, i've moved my horse to d7. I now remember why i moved my black bishop to g7. It means my knight can move back to f8 and get rid of that bishop
Looks like he decided to swap sooner than i had expected. It was a good move actually. Otherwise I would have moved my knight back to f8 attacking his bishop. His white bishop would have been unable to retreat safely due to my solid line of pawns on the right. If i had then swapped my knight for his bishop on e6 he would have found it very difficult to get any support up to his loan pawn sitting on e6. Not sure if any of that makes sense? I think i've just very badly over explained a move which never happened....
obvious swap. I've managed to get rid of the bishop at the expense of one of my knights. I also now have the option to castle on either side. Both sides are well protected with my bishops and pawns. I can wait to see which side is safer as the game develops later on.
Actually i made that all up. I didn't post any comments to him all game. Wish i had though. Maybe i can use that tactic at a later date though. i can also see why he moved his knight back. He obviously wanted to advance his pawn on c2 to give more support to his pawn on d5. My white bishop is attacking this piece and i want to try and remove his support in the centre. Hence my move to f5
..... i was pretty sure i didn't use the pawn... Oh well, another fine example demonstrating how much of a rubbish chess player i am... I honestly don't know how i ever bloody win a game? Maybe i had a good reason for it. If i did i certainly can't think of it now. Oh yeah but wait... His pawn on d5 is now ready for the taking. He's going to have to get some extra support up to that.
ok... now given my current chess ability i don't like to criticise other players too much. The phrase "Don't throw stones in glass houses" springs to mind. But that last move of his wasn't the best. For a start he just moved that away from there. So he's wasted two moves at a pretty crucial stage in the game. I can also push my pawn up to e4 threatening his other knight and also freeing up my black bishop
yeap. I can start to see why i used that pawn to take f5 rather than the queen or knight. he's going to have to move his knight. I can then take his other knight with my bishop destroying his pawn formation on the left and leaving his pawn on d5 for the taking
never the best idea to move knights to the edge of the board. He can now only move that piece to one space.
i will now go  1 up. Not a major advantage but ever piece counts kids. Pawns are crucial at the end game. Because if you get them to the other side you can change them into a bishop of a horse or another pawn
Yeah i don't think you can change them into another pawn actually. It would be good if you could though. A reverse pawn that goes the opposite way. That way you could try to get it all the way back again to your own back line. Ok, enough of that nonsense, i could have taken the pawn with my white bishop, but by using the knight i am threatening his other pawn on c3
My biggest trouble with chess is thinking forward to future moves and anticipating peoples next moves. You could say that it's the core to being good at chess. Either way... i'm sh*t at it. That's why i would have made the same move he just did
probably for the best. That piece was doing nothing there
Ok now i really should have done this move before castling. As it happens it hasn't really made any difference but i gave him the chance to stop it had he seen it. My queen is now attacking his pawn on g2 which he will not want to let me take, but it is also attacking his pawn along with my knight on c3. I'm going to go  2 up either way
obviously he won't take my knight as i would then come down and check him with my queen. He'd then have to move his king. Although having said that he can't really castle anymore anyway
yeah i know i said you shouldn't put your knight on the edge of the board but i must have had a good reason for it at the time... surely?
I've managed to save my castle and i'm still in better shape than him on the board. It's all even but my king is well protected and my castles are linked up on the back line.  His king is stuck in the middle  and pretty exposed
ok now i can't actually remember what i was trying to do here but i'm sure it was something pretty tasty
oh yeah i wanted to move my knight into c3 ready for the checkmate with my queen. Looks like he read my thoughts and put a stop to that move though
looking to move my bishop in behind the queen... for the checkmate
not a lot has happened has it.... lots of moving my castles with no real change to the board
ok, i realise i probably should have moved my other castle to c6 rather than exchanging on b3. This would have made it easier to take his pawns on the left. Certainly the one on a3
at this stage i thought i was easily going to win
there.... Ok so it's not that clever, but it still does the trick. If i had pushed my pawn on e2 forward, he would have queen'd up on h8 putting me in check and gaining the advantage. By moving my castle to h2 i'm forcing his castle off the back line. Allowing me to get a queen and put him in check at the same time.
now i guess he could have pushed his pawn up putting me in check first and then swapped castles... but that would have just delayed the out come. So to would have moving his castle to another square on the back line.
now if i'd have had any style i would have promoted that pawn to a bishop. But i don't. And i like to make sure i win. After all, winning is the most important part of chess (see 'golden rule'). It also would have been a little insulting and cheeky to my very talented opponent who probably deserved to win this game.
As before, the grades shown are converted from our ECF OTB grades.  This was quite a hairy game for me but ultimately very satisfying.  Unfortunately our team lost, again outgraded on most, if not all, boards.  White started with his d-pawn, which immediately had me planning my favourite King's Indian Defence, though given my recent trouble in a thematic mini-tournament here on Gameknot, I may have to change my habit.
?! but this was a surprise.  It struck me as premature.  Bg5 is frequently played to provoke Black into playing ...h6 so that after the B retreats to e3 and the Q lines up behind it, the pawn becomes a target for White's attack.  But I worked out that without a preparatory 6. h3, to prevent ...Ng4, White could be prevented from pursuing this line of attack, so I immediately prodded the B away with ...
!? The soundness of this move depends on the overall soundness of Black's idea.
!?  As in the early stages of an attempted English Attack against the Najdorf, this early second move with the knight, which defies opening principles, is justified, I think, by practical, tactical considerations.  I think that the way I was thinking owes a lot to playing here against Freddy (id=easy19)
! A standard advance in the King's Indian, even more powerful than usual because of the unimpeded support of the fianchettoed bishop and the Ng4.
!  Normally, Black has to use several tempi, often manoeuvring his N to sub-optimal squares like e8, h7 or d7 (where it gets in the way of his other pieces) to get this move in.  Now I get it in nice and early and have the luxury of considering how to prosecute my attack quickly, before White has even castled.
Too late.  The N is happy to retreat behind the pawn now.
!?  Books on the King's Indian have statements like "Always take back with the pawn" but of course there are exceptions based on concrete considerations of tactics.  Unable to find a strong justification for breaking the "rule" (ie some tactical triumph after playing 11...Bxf5), I went along with it.  The advantage of this is that the pawn retains a strong hold on e4 and Black has the options of advancing either pawn when it suits.  As usual, the QB stays at home as long as possible, ready to leap into action when the board clears a bit.  The disadvantage of this recapture is that it leaves the king feeling somewhat draughty.  You have to be brave to play th King's Indian!
White develops his Bishop as if he is planning to castle kingside.  With Black's pawns poised on e5 and f5, he daren't post the B on d3 because of the fork on e4.
!?  Another thematic King's Indian move, played to discourage White expansion on the Queenside.  It's disadvantage is that the pawn can become loose when Black completes his Queenside development and that it leaves a nice square at b5 for White's Nc3 to occupy and harass Black's c7 and d6 pawns.  I planned at this stage to follow this up with ...Na6 and ...Nc4
but now I thought it would be useful to create an open file on which to attack this queen, so I played ...
?!  This, and its follow-up make Black's position very loose, which gave me a lot of heartache for most of the rest of the game.  I think it was unwise to change plans in mid-course.
?! Finally I decided where to put this N, having spent several minutes on several moves pondering its future deployment.  It looks a strong square for the N but my pawn structure is poor.  The pawn on d6 becomes very vulnerable and gets no support for a future advance to d5.
!?  An interesting choice with Black's lines already opening for the attack and Black's fianchettoed bishop aimed at the king's position.  The advantage is that it leaves White free to develop a kingside attack if he can.
Taking aim at White's c4 pawn and through it at the a2 pawn.  Also blocking White's Queen's potential attack along the diagonal to my King.  The main purpose was to make way for a rook to come to c8 though.
! White opens up the file to attack the weak pawn on d6, tying Black's Queen to its defence
Preparing to reinforce the defence of the pawn on d6 with a rook on d8.  I remember thinking long about which square to post the Queen on but I can't remember why I deemed c7 unsuitable... Sorry!  Getting the Q off the d-file also frees the Nc6 from defending the e-pawn (the d6 pawn gave no protection while pinned against the Q).
Getting the King off the dangerous c-file and making room for the Be3 to retreat to c1 if attacked by Black's f-pawn.
!? Played after a lot of thought.  It encourages White's Queen to move to d2, whence it finally supports the QB's attack on h6 and simultaneously attacks d6.  I hoped that I could get my attack in before these threats mattered but was by no means sure I could.
!? This cuts off the attack on h6 and defers White's attack on d6 by threatening the B, which can only safely go to b6, which isn't a bad square for it, since it controls d8.
! and suddenly I realised the full power of my previous move.  The Bishop on f5 wields devastating power, supporting the N's incursion on c2.  I hadn't planned this when playing 18....f4, so I see this as an example of luck in chess, rather than my own brilliance.
White avoids the Nc2+ followed by discovered check scenario.  Now, if I can divert White's N from c3 and keep every other White piece where it is, ...Nxa2 will be mate!
! Not only does this divert the N from c3 but it also defends d6 from any embarrassing counter-attack.  Furthermore, if White doesn't swap knights, it can take f2, forking White's rooks.
White creates space for his King and guards a2.
Defending d6 and preparing a discovered attack on b6
Trying to push the N away but Yelena Dembo's words ring in my ear: "Never retreat!"
!!  This is the winning move.  In playing the preceding exchanges, I hadn't yet decided whether to play the rook to a1, a2 or a3 but this was the right square.
I accept it to keep the game interesting, curious to see how the cpu plans to compensate.
feeling the pinch on f2 and b2, I take my chance to open up the kingside.
fleeing for safety and trying to get the only mobile rook in play on the kingside.
But black assess' the potential danger mounting and passes up the pawn
knowing the undeveloped pawns are dead weight and that the chances for perpetual check are diminished after ...Qxc2+, I forsake the pawn and continue getting pieces in on the action.<n><n>"i would go rh4! with a mating threat ~ blitzkov (1880) on 19-Apr-12"

A fun game against a friend, I play black and build a crushing pawn advantage on the queenside, then screw it all up and watch it go up in smoke.
3. g3 is known as the Paulsen Variation, and my reply breaks from the main lines - from here I'm exploring new ground (new to me anyway, and not much in the Game DB).
Up by two pawns, with a 3 to 1 advantage on the queenside, the only thing standing between me and an easy win is all the white pieces. Fortunately, white seems willing to trade them off.
Now a 3 to 0 advantage on the queenside, with three supported adjacent passed pawns. There is absolutely no way for black to fail to promote one ore more of these lucky pawns, right?
I think 19. Nd7 would have been strong for white. I wouldn't want him to take my knight on f6 and break up my pawn formation when he has a 4 to 3 advantage and open up my king to all of his pieces on the kingside. Which means I would have played 19. ... Nxd7 which would allow him to get a rook on the 7th rank and create problems for my queenside pawns. White didn't do it, and now I prevent it with 19. ... Be6.
Here I miscalculate. I had a sneaky plan of putting white in check on the back rank and then pinning the white bishop after he blocks, then winning it by attacking the pinned bishop with my own bishop. It was not until after I had committed to this foolhardy plan that I realized there was no way I could complete that plan before white could play Kg2. Fortunately, I had a fallback plan, but I am still doomed to watching most of my queenside advantage go up in smoke.
I was facing a checkmate in 1 and I have no good attacks against white. I make a hole that is the opposite color of the only white bishop and that his knight can never threaten without facing a pawn capture, or blocking his rook on the 8th rank. I am thinking about 24. ... Ng5 which then trades knights and allows me to play Be2 to win the white bishop or which chases the knight away allowing Bc4 to win the white bishop - but I doubt white will allow this.
My careless plan on my 20th move cost me a pawn and decimated my queenside advantage. At least I am well poised for an attack. This move threatens to win the white bishop with Nd2
Threatens to win a pawn. It looks to be fully protected but it is not.
White believed his pawn was safe but I showed him the error in his logic. Now if 28. Nxf3 Bxf3  and black has still won the pawn and has exchanged some of white dwindling material. If 29. Kxf3 Rxf1  and black has still won the pawn and has exchanged even more material.
White realized he didn't want to exchange material, so he chose not to pursue the exchange(s), but then he forgot that his knight was en prise.
I only need to move one space - if white follows, he loses his bishop.
31. h3 was the wrong move for white. His bishop on f1 is now attacked twice and has nowhere to run.
The stall is no threat to black.
He's ready to take my knight with his bishop.
I failed to see that coming, thus castling was no longer an option at this time. Along with that, I'm a piece behind now.
I needed to save my rook.
With his queen deep in my territory, I needed to be careful.
I'm just trying to find a way to get the queen to back up some.
I wasn't willing to give up my rook.
On top of another rook gone, his king is now in danger.
My advantage continues to grow.
I go for his bishop.
His king is in quite a pickle and he doesn't realize it.
I prepare to attack hard.
About to attack hard.
I realized here that he was going to keep putting me in check relentlessly, trying to do anything to prevent checkmate. I realized that if I stayed around the bishop, the game could eventually end in a threefold repetition. I knew I could win this so I was gonna have to leave those pieces and plan a new strategy.
I try to change it up some here.
This is the recommended way of playing the Semi-Slav according to American IM Larry Kaufman in his excellent book 'The Chess Advantage in Black and White' (McKay Chess Library, 2004). Kaufman's repertoire opening book is worth having a look at if you're searching for practical openings that aren't too analysed to death (Najdorf, Sveshnikov etc) or too drawish. The point of 3...c6 instead of 3...Nf6 is to avoid the Queens Gambit Declined exchange variation (4.cxd4) which is supposedly good for white because he hasn't yet committed his kings knight (to f3), so can more easily play f3 and e4 (after e3, Bd3 and Ne2-g3 etc). This move order means that black has to be prepared for the Marshall Gambit (4.e4) which is tricky but, for a clued-up black player, is probably not quite sound (though I have been on the wrong end of this in an over-the-board game!).
Now black has a choice. 5...Be7 is super-solid and can lead to the Lasker Defence, the Classical or the Tartakower; 5...Nbd7 can lead to a Classical or Cambridge Springs set-up (black plays 6...Qa5, which usually gives black the two bishops (after Bxf6) but allows white to keep an edge). Instead, the move I chose is the whole point of the Semi-Slav's c6 and e6 (a plan to take on c4 either to hold onto the pawn with b5 or, after white plays Bxc4, to hit the bishop with b5 and follow up with Bb7, a6 and a later c5). This leads to a razor-sharp position.
Black snags a pawn, but now white can set up a classic pawn centre (pawns on e4 and d4) with an immediate threat of 7.e5
The only move to prevent the loss of a piece.
White's usual move here is 11.exf6, when 11...Nxf6 would leave black's remaining knight stuck in a terribly inconvenient pin and would not be recommended. After 11.exf6 black invariably plays 11...Bb7. Because white delays taking on f6 by one move, black has an interesting alternative to committing the bishop to the b7 square (according to Flear).
This is it, to which Flear attaches an exclamation mark: 11...Qa5! Like most players, I LOVE to play moves with such a suffix.
Flear says: "The bishop on a6 defends the c-pawn and is part of a plan to rapidly mobilise the queenside."
I couldn't understand this move (and still don't). It seems entirely natural to play 14.Bg2 (especially after 11.g3). In the source game of this variation (in which Mikhail Botvinnik beat Arnold Denker in the famous USSR-USA radio match of 1945), Denker put his bishop on e2 and was crushed (and that was with the g-pawn remaining on g2). However, according to Flear, 14.Qf3 is the move to play, presumably to x-ray target the c6 pawn and keep the white bishop on the f1-a6 diagonal for the time being.
A double attack on the c4 pawn, but I'm not sure moving the queen away from the d1-h5 diagonal was a good idea (also, the queen is no longer defending the e2 bishop and the d3 square is weakened).
I figured that this move prevents white from castling (the e2 bishop is then hanging) and if 17.Bxa6 Qxa6, white still can't castle and has waves of weak white squares flooding around his king.
I was expecting 18.e7 when (as mentioned earlier) a white pawn makes its way to the seventh rank with a fork. I'm sure this is weaker. It gives a check and, on the face of it, exposes the black king on the kingside. But the f6 pawn actually acts as a useful shield, and, meanwhile, black has strong central and queenside threats. One interesting variation could be: 18.e7 Bxe2 19.exd8=Q+ Qxd8 20.Qe3 (20.Kxe2?? Qd3+ 21.Ke1 Nf3 mate) 20...cxb2 21.Kxe2 bxa1=Q 22.Rxa1 Rxh2 23.Nxc5 when 23...Qd5 (centralising the queen) looks to be about equal.
White hastens to block the diagonal (even if only for a moment). Why play this move, giving up a pawn? Firstly, 21.Ke1?? allows 21...Nf3 mate! And 21.Ke3?? leads to 21...Qd3+ 22.Kf4 Qf3+ 23.Kxe5 Re8+ 24.Kd5 Qxe4 mate (those white squares again). After 21...Nxc4, white can play 22.Kf3 and try to get the king to g2 (probably the best option). If 22.Kf1, then 22...Nd6+ wins the white knight. And 22.Ke1 invites 22...Ne5 targeting the f3 square and, more crucially, a royal fork on d3.
I really liked this move. Yet again it's a tempo gainer (the obvious threat is 22...Rxe5+). Also, taking with the rook on c4 is now a very nasty threat because a) it gains a tempo by attacking white's queen on c1, and b) a subsequent discovered check with a rook move is brutal. Meanwhile, because the black knight is still on e5 the king plan of f3 and g2 is impossible.
To stop the rook taking the c4 pawn.
Now the black queen comes to the e-file with a gain of tempo. This wasn't a difficult move to find. A check, after all, is a check.
And now a double attack (on the bishop on d2 and the rook on h1). Black's reply is forced.
The rook finally arrives at c4 with tempo, and eyes up the c2 square. I thought this was a strong move, but didn't quite appreciate how strong until I started to examine the white queen's options for retreating from the attack.
An unfortunate necessity. Other queen moves lead to a debacle: 22.Qb1 Rc2+ 23.Kd1 (Ke1 then Qxh1+) Qd3+ followed by mate on e2; 22.Qd1 Rc2+ 23.Kf1 (or e1) Qxh1+. 22.Qd2 or b2 and the black rook going to c2 is decisive.
Fitting, I think, that mate is given on e2, the square on which white's KB should probably have never visited.<n><n>If you're looking for an opening to play against 1.d4 and 2.c4, then the Semi-Slav is rich in possibilities. Obviously, you have to be clued up on the Meran and the Anti-Meran (both covered in Flear's and Kaufman's books), but I've found that the positions you get with black always seem to be nicely unbalanced and offer chances of fighting for the initiative (a bit like playing the Najdorf Sicilian against 1.e4). The Nimzo-Indian also fits the bill against 1.d4 and 2.c4, but white can avoid it by not playing 3.Nc3. personally, I don't much like playing the black side of the Queens Indian (3.Nf3 b7), and the Bogo-Indian (3.Nf3 Bb4+) offers at least one forced variation which gives black a cramped position that, at best, is drawish. So my advice is: MUG UP ON THE SEMI-SLAV: ("there is one defense that does it all – the Semi-Slav" says Kaufman).
In this game, the game was based on a strategic battle based on a central pawn mass vs piece activity. Of course, activity is the whole idea of chess, and therefore black's strategy was more sound. There are very instructive ideas in this game.
White is playing a fianchetto, so black blocks the bishop with a central pawn chain immediately. This is a typical idea. Here, the black's light squared bishop is out of the game for now, but black intends to free it later with ...b6 or better ...e5. Capturing on d5 will also free the bishop.
It's a mistake. Now black can easily attack the knight and force it away, while taking control of the center. Now his pieces are in better position.
This move, really, is another positional inaccuracy. White turns his light squares bishop into a prisoner, and does not have a justification for it. White should simply go 9.Nd2, keeping his position in the center. However, it is not so bad as it allows white to easily get away with having a worse development.
Black wants to play on the queenside, where he has more space. However, an idea of playing on the kingside was also possible. The one with more activity can play on whichever side of the board he wishes to.
All the white pieces are backwards. Certainly black should take and open things up. Now here is an  understanding of when to move pawns that are not for developing pieces or stopping threats.<n>1.You move pawns when your piece activity is greater/equal to opponent's. <n>2.Pawns are great to advance for an attack, but not good to defend yourself. When the opponent has activity advantage, you should keep pawns still. Here, white does not understand this idea, and black quickly starts an attack.
White makes another mistake, trying to advance his queenside agenda. We should not advance pawns when down in activity. Probably 14.Qc2 getting out of the pin is better. Now there are more weaknesses in white's position to be fixed.
Provoking white to advance his pawns again. Certainly white did not want to go backwards with 16.Nb1, so he must push the pawn. As we know, it is bad when you are defending.
Black is tranfering his pieces to the kingside, and will attack there. White has a lot of pawns advanced, and therefore a lot of weaknesses. Not good when defending.
Black is exchanging an important kingside defender. I'm not sure it was best now, but there was definitely an idea there. However, the f4 knight is much stronger than the weak bishop, but the bishop was a defender.
Honestly, an exhanging of bishops at the right moment will greatly favor black. White has numerous dark square weaknesses, so if he can occupy one with the knight, he should trade bishops.
Now if white takes black gets advantage, his rooks will be activated along the center, and will attack the weak pawns directly.
White does not know what to do in the position. There was very little for him to do. Black has a fierce grip on the position, and has gotton his pieces inside of the white's pawn chain, which has left many squares weak. More weak squares=More attacking chances for the attacker, and therefore pawns need to stay where they are when you defend.
White simply resigned. There is not defense, since black takes on f3 with the bishop, then the h3 pawn will fall. A good effort from my opponent.
Hoping to transpose to a Nimzo.
easy to defend
R O O K for the win!
I already had one game played against woody17, a long game that ended in a tough loss. But the first game was so competitive, even though I ended up on the wrong side of the ledger, that we decided to play again. This game shows that if you play mistake-free, you can get a result even against someone ranked 200 points higher...
When I'm not doing unusual openings as White, I'm partial to the Ruy Lopez.
The exchange means Black will have to defend his advanced Pawn at d5. It could easily fall, but if it doesn't, it will cramp White's Queen-side development.
Solidifying the center...for both players. But I felt I had to open the diagonal for my Queen Bishop, and it also blocks a future advance of Black's d-pawn.
Creates a retreat for the Bishop, if necessary. A future advance of the b-pawn to freeze Black's Queen-side ambitions is also set up.
Black weakens his King's defenses, but eliminates the pin on his Knight.
Black is focusing on White's e-pawn, but it's well guarded. Both players need to move their pieces to the King-side if they wish to attack.
White intends Nb3, trying to remove Black's dark-squared Bishop.
Black wins the minor exchange and weakens the defenses of White's King. However, getting pieces over to the h-file to launch an attack will not be easy, given the congestion on that side of the board.
The exchange has opened up an avenue for Black's Queen to attack, but also created more flight squares for White's King and undoubled the Pawns.
Centralizing the Bishop, though with no real threats. It does make Black have to move his Queen Rook out of the line of fire.
As expected. But Black can't get more than his Queen into the attack, rendering it less effective.
A tactical interlude. Black is given the opportunity to exchange Queens.
Black will end up ahead a minor exchange, but in the endgame, that's a difficult advantage to exploit.
With Black having a dark-squared Bishop, White can minimize the effectiveness of the piece by placing his own pieces on white squares.
The Rooks come off, and the maneuvering begins. A long endgame will ensue.
If White can exchange off his a-pawn, he can form an impenetrable barrier on the white squares.
White clearly is content with a draw. Black has no way to force a win, although he could try exchanging his Bishop for White's Knight and attempting to win in the King and Pawn endgame.
? a open f-file is ever good for your king�s defense. also it blocks the 2nd bishop�s diagonal. (at least i think so. if somebody disagree feel free to add a comment.)
! sending his bishop back where he�s coming from.
preparing for the long rochade (castling), what brings his queen�s rook in. and gives white a strong pair of bishops, which hold their position up to the 19th move.
also wants to castle. whithout the pawns on f7 and g7 i would have decided for the long castling.
you dont have to be a GM to predict who is about to win.
not bad, but he forgot that after the exchange there is still the attack on b7 AND c7 is uncovered...
so what? after that he will have to go back to f8 in order to avoid checkmate.that just loses a tempo and helps the king coming out of his hole.
!great. the b8 Rook is only able to leave his 8th reihe giving check, and then has to return again. so he cannot kill b2 and cannot prevent the king attacking.
now, there is a chance to take on b2 but this would lose a rook - or the game.
! fritz calculates a mate in 16 or something (can�t remember how much, maybe 11 or 18..) but it went faster.
At this point I was thinking about supporting my d pawn to play d4 followed by Rxc2.
4 to 1.
I am perplexed. I don't really understand what black was doing with 7. ... Bf8. The bishop seemed well placed, fianchettoed with an attack on d4 supported by the black queen. Maybe he wanted to play to b4? As for my response, I am thinking knights on g5 and e5 are fairly imposing (although I haven't figured out how to save them both from black's simply pushing his f7 pawn to f6 and forking them).
Black's poor bishop must be feeling rather like a yo-yo.
Ahh, but now I do! I might have to give 11. ... f6? a question mark, leaving the e6 pawn to die horribly. And now black is suddenly reeling, faced with 4 white pieces about to exact a heavy price for black's slow development.
OK, attacks are forming. I love that open e-file and the black king with nowhere to castle. Black cannot play 14. ... Qxe6?? for then he loses his queen to 15. Rae1.
I had wanted to play 15. Rfe1 while the black king and queen were still on the e-file, but I was 1 move too late. But here I found the way to gain a tempo and get exactly what I wanted. Black cannot play 15. .. Qf8?? to block for then he loses his queen, so he has to run back to e8, where I wanted him. I am inclined to give this move an exclamation, 15. Qa5 ! for the pure simplistic beauty of its quiet but inexorable threat.
I have to give this move a ! because black cannot get out of all the threats. He cannot stay where he is because white can play 17. Bxg8 which discovers the attack by the white rook on e1 that skewers the black queen to her king. Moving the queen allows white to play the same move with discovered check, gaining a piece. And moving the king allows white to play the same move with a discovered attack against the black queen, also gaining a piece.
As it turns out, black's queen has only one space, 17. ... Qd7 to which she can run, in which case white's bishop escapes, perhaps to e6 with an attack on the harried black queen. Black might try to diffuse the situation with 17. ... Qxe1 , 18. Rxe1 Rxg8, though white would meet that with 19. Qd8  Kg7 20. Qe7  Kh8 21. Qb7 Na6 22. Re7 and mate to follow.
Black chose poorly. As it is, the move played must receive three ???, for white's response is instant victory. It's an odd position. The white bishop on g8 is attacked by 3 pieces and defended by none. And yet, it is perfectly safe and even better, it blocks black's escape to c7, thus allowing the white queen to achieve the mate. Rarely have I seen a piece in such a dire predicament play such an important role in a mating position.
so Mr. bishop you have not attack any more, also i open the path for my dark square bisop and queen
immediate action of white to counter attack with firm control on e4 square for his g1 knight. if i capture he does as well and further development. so i am little bit worried and think 5 min....after thinking i will decide to
decide to attack. I am a queen player. i like to play with queen.......i have plan in my mind will clear in next 6 move
so that 5 minute thinking gone waste and finally i am ready to exchange of pawn.....so now WQ force to take otherwise move his knight ....
as usual....did not want to lose tempo...but i am ready to welcome queen
I always feel pleasure to pin the queen side knight... but best pace for dark bisop is d3 with plan to go to h2 if opponent allow....
queen attack on knight and now i must rethink about my plan .........but i decided to go with my plan.... and in this process overlook the position of my dark bisop.......this is main problem of player at my level.
so my plan is creating weakness in king side camp.....and white is panic and try to save his g2 pawn
oh my unprotected pawn at g7 and i am in trouble now.....if i make Qxh8 then certainly WQ goes for Qxg7and equal the material loss and my king is unprotected ...so i take 10 min to think and then decide to
decide to  go with my plan by evaluating the no real threat on my king
So i decided to go for material loss equalization theory and try to put  WQ on hold
White is giving no chance to me and move to safest place
No not at ...bisop seal this path and go to his perfect place d3  with this move
if there is no  way then go to available path....and i try to create threat on the same time
so now i try to save my knight in g1...but is any hope for his survival ?
So here i am thinking about draw by putting my queen again at h1 ...but i am decided to go for a hard fight and make another blunder of the game
Oh what is that king again move to safest place and no more check....then BQ is just there for knight safety. This is not a good thing at all to put your strongest warrior for knight safety.....but is there other way if some one thinking about Kf1 then think what happen when white move his white dark square bisop move to a3.
easy passent and now a clear check mate for me if i try to save knight any more to make the move f2 .......
The only possible move to save my king as well as queen lose...i move my king to Ke2 then dark bisop come to g5 to force me to take bisop and then white take my queen with his queen
and danger alarm rings, i must move my king to another position otherwise in next move white rook will reach at b5 and force me to lose my queen at the cost of a rook and light square bisop. One of my friend at gameknot tell to make this trade.....but chess player like me did not survive long with enemy queen so i refuse to for this trade and go for another walk
oh little bit surprising to why not c1 why d2...and when i unlock it ...i am thinking about resign......why not i did not go with my friend suggestion...white is planning to his pawn move to c4 giving his queen way to finish the game......and this bisop move is for rook protection so if i want to go with my friend suggestion ....IS IT TOO LATE....MAY BE ........after continues thinking of more than half an hour i made.....
okk i will ready to fight till last move and take his pawn
so before his plan i must do some thing in this only provided move and i made  this another move of the game
so many plan now try to make next move Qb6 and i am ready to give the answer with rook a6 from a8.......but i start thinking this is another chance to to win the game.......and take my rook plan back and throw the black king in check....CHECK NUMBER - 18
another nice move of the game.......one minor mistake causes black sudden death here and he well judged it ...What is that minor mistake? taking bisop with king........Think if he take with king then give another check with my queen at g2 and then only safe place for black king is h5 with no queen loss and then i slide down my rook from a8 to h8 and then subsequent move take his queen....
another well judge move if he try to move his king to g3 position then think about my next move queen at h2 position so he ready to give his queen
so another check and thinking about some other plan of course not like move no. 16 di+
now time to irritate enemy king
27. i do not want to lose from here and game is draw. Feel free to suggest some more solution ...and comment. thanks for reading
Hi everyone!<n><n>After inflicting a pawn stab which stole Steve's knight and 10 rating points off him, I had to hand them back after this game which was the Traxler Mini Tournament.  I drew with Steve with the white pieces - in fact I never got round to annotating that particular game - I really must rectify this - but I was not so lucky here.  I thought my joblock fortress was really watertight but Steve managed to ensure that it sprung a leak somewhere!  So, how did this happen?  Well, after the forced moves, 4. .... Bc5 we pick up the action on move 5.
8. a3 - after an exchange of bishops Steve puts the question to my knight on b4.  Before I move it comes a queen trade.
13. ...... Bh5 - ...... before retreating Fou Leblanc to h5.
15. Nh3 - I try and get some counterplay in by driving back Steve's knight on the kingside.
16. ...... f6 - lending support to my pawn on e5.
22. ...... Nd7 - I attempt to move my knight to a better square before he is completely boxed in on b8.
25. ...... Ne6 - I try and find a better square for my f8 knight.
27. ........ Rxd4 - a knight trade and then an attempt to contest the d column.  This plan did ensure that I held out for a long, long time.
30. ..... Nf8 - Steve doesn't seem to be making much progress and as his rating was close to my own I decided to offer a draw here - no takers however - this decision of Steve's proved to be correct, sigh and double sigh!
40. f4 - this pawn break will spell the beginning of the end for me, this is how Steve managed to find the ammo to dynamite the Joblock.
41. ...... gxf4 and then I reply g5 - this attempt to completely fracture Steve's kingside backfires on me big time.
53. .... Kg8 - was Kg7 an improvement?  - Maybe because I am about to drop another pawn ........
54. Rg3 ..... I now lose another pawn and with a passer on the f column and a potential one on the h column, not to mention white's advanced pawns on the queenside spells a very gloomy outlook - it's just soooo depressing to continue so I decided to write this one off - well played Steve - Joanne!
Logical development so far. I have a yugoslav kinda setup. I planned to castle queenside and pawn storm my opponent kingside if he castled there
And the pawn march begins!
While I attack my opponent's kingside, he begins a central counter attack. This is usually a good idea if one wants to have counterplay whatsoever
It was from here I began to drift a little. This losses a pawn I think
?! Like I said earlier, my play began to dwindle. The queen supports a g-pawn push but the rook would have been better suited for the job
I would need all my pieces in the attack if I want it to be successful
That bishop was just too powerful on that diagonal to ignore. Besides retreating the knight would have lost valuable tempo
White tries to force the rook to leave the defence of the f-pawn. Retreating to e3 only encourages white to play d4 which would win a piece
I had a hard time deciding whether to put this rook on g2 or h2. It turned out this rook would be the brave soldier that would save the black nation
! A pawn sacrifice to fully open the g and h files for me.
It was immediately after I played this move I realised that Rxg6+! Was far better. If he played Kh8 then Qxd4+ puts black in serious trouble. Playing hxg6 fails to Qxg6 Kh8 Rxh6#
The best place for the king as Kf7 losses to (30. Kf7 31. Rxh7+ Ke8 32. Rxe6+ Kd8 33. Qd4+ Qd5 34. Qxd5#
Now black must lose a piece
! Gaining tempo on the queen while threatening Rf8# if black is careless. I was tempted to trade queens but it would have led to Qxf6 Qxf6 Rxf6 d2.... Where I would have been forced to give up my extra rook to prevent black from queening
My opponent finds the best complication on board! Now where would the king go???
The best place for the king as 32. Ka1 leads to (c1=Q+ 33 ka2 Qc4+) where black trades queen while he still has an extra queen on board. 32. Ka2 leads to [c1=N+ (33. Ka1 Nb3+) (33. Kb2 Qd3+ and he is down the exchange but he has a passed pawn on e6 and still has fighting chances.
This move would have put a bind on my two rooks if the e6-pawn wasn't hanging
Now I just have to find a way to double rooks on the d-file and play Rd7 to force an exchange of rooks
Now my opponent resigns as after he recaptures, 42. Rh8 wins the passed pawn. The game was a well fought from both sides but I think black would have won had he payed a little more attention to his kingside...
My opponent plays the Sicilian Defense. This usually leads to an exciting game.
I choose to seize central space rather than exchange.
Now I MUST move the B. I choose not to exchange.
If Black castles K-side, my Bishops are now in position to support an attack.
Black is preparing to do just that. Now I need to activate my QN an connect my Rooks.
If Black captures, I can undouble my Pawns.
Attack the base of the Pawn chain and it will crumble...
Now my Rook, Queen and Bishop are ail aimed at the vulnerable K-side, and the defending Knight has vanished.
Black races his other Knight to the defense.
Remove the Knight... and the King falls. 26...P-R3, 26...P-N3 or 26...R-K1 stop the immediate mate, but then I can play 27 RxQ. Black resigns.
To play Rd8 and open the diagonal for my bishop.
I change my pieces where I can, because the position is closed, so my knight must be better then whites' bishop - what now out on game stands.
With tempo. And I have the open file.
I donot wanted to give up the open file for an exchange.
Better would be Qd2 with winning the b2-pawn. I wanted to play against the King and so I didnot saw this.
This must be still theory, but I can't study any chess nor I have access to the database anymore, so I can't see what was played before. A pity. Now, the normal e6 (the Icelandic gambit itself) doesn't work since after the exchange my e pawn will stand pitifully isolated in the center, against a well developed white open e column... of course not!
It can't be bad. My queen will stand out in the center, but she has a lot of room to fly on, some threat and a well-known plan Qa5-Qc7.
Nf3 is more dangerous because of Bg4 at once, scrambling white's kingside. This is sensible, but I overlooked a fun and dangerous trick based on Bg4!, and if fxB, Qxg2. Now, this fails to Qf3, and I lost my bishop for nothing. So it was better to overlook it! :-)
This deprived my queen from e4+, that must be considered. Even Qg5 (threatening g2 again) was playable, and probably better. But I sensed that the fight for the center was important, and that my dsb was ready to pin the black knight on c3 after (if ever) d3. The Qe4+ is naive and pointless.
The second step for the queen's path to c7. Now, white has to think a little about how to develop, since moving the d pawn pins the knight. White can do well about this, but he will give tempo to black to...
Note that black can't play b4, or Bxb4, since after axB, QxR, devastating white. I can even think about Bb4 now, but it has no point while the knight is defended by the two pawns. White would move the Ra1 and that will mean to retire or exchange (which I didn't want to). So bad plan.
The right time for this move. Even if it seem to slow down my developement, it provides a safe square for the queen (she will be soon effectively kicked away), and stops any white's ideas of jumps with the knight soon after. My pieces, then, will develop in total harmony.
Normally, I have this bishop on f4, but now it was biting on granite, so no point. I'll wait for white to castle or to kick my queen, and fight for the black diagonal.
White choosed for kicking the queen (Ne2 and o-o was the other option, maybe preferable. The bishop's place is e3, making it difficult for black to occupy the black diagonal (g1-a7) with Bc5. Black's pawn in e4, will stay defended at least once at all times, and every black move strenghten black's position (Nd7, Bc5, f6, and black can even castle either sides. BUT maybe this won't sustain an expert opinion. I think white can threaten black on the kingside and try to force black playing defensively based on Qe2 - f4. A very interesting game will spread.
!? This is necessary, since if Bc4 inmediately, b4 forks B and Q. No countertrick. If Qb6 (occupying the diagonal), white had Na5, and my queen must choose Qa6, threatening the knight and avoiding c3 (that makes the N defended by the Q), because of Qxd3. But white can dare to play c4!?, with an interesting position.
? This is a mistake. White must have taken the tempo to occupy the diagonal, with Be3, now that Bb4 is not a threat anymore. This contains black's game. This way, white leaves black free to develop the more annoying way.
White can't castle. Of course, my bishop is not secure, but when it will be exchanged by the white knight, my Queen will take its place, with the same function. White can't play d4, and I can castle on an empty kingside.
I just take the tempo to develop! I don't want to retake the bishop with the kinight. The pressure on the diagonal is most important because it maked difficult for white to develop coherently and attackingly. White has just one very powerful resource... can you see it?
! This leaves d3 unprotected, so I can think about Qd6, Bf3 (defending d3 and preparing d4...), but it didn't convinced me (if I can say so in English). Now, c5 is playable, but after b5!, the diagonal is blocked for me and again, Qd6 seems not strong enough.
! Now! This really stunned me. Very good. Now, I can accept and castle, and become the attacked, or I can be coherent with my plan, and go on fighting for the black diagonal.
That he, sensibly, "throws away". A more aggressive approack would have been d4 at once, before black could bring his rooks in to defend it. But it was a bit risky with a higher - rated opponent.
Not sure about this. Probably, Nc5 would have been better, even if it is pinned. After Ka1, is doubtful black will have an easy game.
! This is really nasty, since white, by unpinning the queen, allows black to play exd4, and the good move became an awful one.
Now, I think that I have to solve the tension, because I don't have a good way to further exploit the double pin. White has now d5!?, and if Rxd5, BxB, threatening my queen in return and solving the pin problem. But if black goes BxB in the first place, white can't take the black B in return due to the pin on the WQ... So I had no real hurry to resolve the tension. This was my first mistake. The second was that I overlooked Bc4! After the exchange, white has lost a defender of d4 and it will fall.
? Thinking that white has no easy way to reinforce d4 (the Q must be the last piece to retake, or white will lose material).
?? The blunder that loses the game. White had to go for f4!, opening some lines on the kingside. It was a "forced" counterattack. Black could only exchange on d4 before, but now he wins a piece.
? ...but it was useless to play Bf2, because of d3, forking Q and N. White lost a piece. But I would have run of the knight, with Bf2 nevertheless. d3, BxB, QxB, WQmoves, black takes the N d3xNe2, and white reatkes the pawn with the queen. I think white is sligtly better placed than in the text, but anyway... In return, it was a pity, but I didn't dare to play RxN instead, betting for the bishop's pair power. It would have been more elegant and sporting.
Controlling the white squares to oppose the bishop, but leaving holes on the dark squares. I'll exploit that  very nicely if I can control the second row. Wiht a bishop plus, it must not be difficult.
Well, I didn't want to think too much at this point, and exchanged all I could before white can make some countergame. I hope you enjoyed the opening and the fight in the midgame. Now, the game is won for black, but it is still of some interest to see HOW I win it, because to have the advantage is not enough if you don't know how to exploit it.
Black can easily fall on a back rank mate, but hey, I'm not a novice! :-)
I regarded as a priority to avoid the back rank mate threat, that means, to free my queen to move away. True, it leave holes on the black squares, ok, but on the other side, if I played h6, I would have left the white diagonal undefended, since Bf5 is unsupported. In order to win this game, I have to exchange the queens and all the pawns I can. If I get a passer on a or c, I'll win for sure. Because see: the other threat I can build is based on Qg3-f2 or g5 and Bf1. This will threat mate. Now, can black reach this position without leaving white 1) possibility to defend g2 with the Q on the second row and 2) without letting her snatch some pawns in the process? No case.
? Making again my queen free to move away, with the king controlling e7 and f8, but overlooking the simple...
My pawn is pinned to the queen. I'm very ashamed. Now I have to get out of a second real trouble. My compliments to white!
White sees that with bxc6, QxC6, the game will lose any interest. And we play blitz to enjoy. So, white choosed for a desperate move, hoping to surprise me. And I could well have lost my nerves... could I lose or draw this? Now, now, now... let's se... wonderful. Caissa didn't betrayed me. White has no pawn to threat the bishop, and all I must care is that he can't queen. He will have to play Qa7 to threaten me, and I must exchange by force, and then, the promotion square will be white, and I will have the tempo to play d5, defending it. White played well, but with correct play from my part, he is doomed.
White goes for it. After the exchange, I will have to lose a lot of tempoes taking the pawn with the king, but guess what: I have a passer.
White spares me. He probably thinks that he can take some revenge with his king while I am going to and from the pawn.
...but look: it is not easy for the white king to reach some target! I have the tempo I need to go for the pawn. And mine will win the game.
The pawns are blocked. On a black square, true, but the white king will fall to the c pawn sooner.
My opponent, sensibly, resigned. A very enjoyable game, where he made me sweep a lot to win. The win is not always the good meter for a good player.
With the goal of going to f3.
The strongest move because e5 is coming.  Black has to make room for his knight to retreat.  If he doesn't then play might go like the following ...
A blunder. White only focuses on the d4 pawn and doesn't notice the b2 pawn (which was my goal). Bc3 was the best move here.
I knew the Bishop would be useless on a4 so I kept it on the b1-h7 diagonal with this move.
In the Caro-Kann, I normally aim for making the c5 pawn move and taking back with my dark-square Bishop. This wasn't an option since White has his Bishop protecting it. Thanks to the capture of the c-and-b pawns, I developed my Bishop here.
I love putting my Knight from e7 to f5 and controlling the Kingside with it...
...but my opponent squashes those ideas by taking my Bishop. Of course I could've moved Bishop to f5 and made the trade that way, but I wanted to develop another piece, rather than worrying about putting my Knight on the exact square I wanted...
And now, White makes me pay for it with an attack on the backward pawn.
Had to put the Knight on its outpost.
I think White must've given me too much credit here not to take the Rook. It's the same conservative strategy we saw in the opening from White.
A blunder, it traps my Rook with nowhere to go.
This was a blunder...f4 should've been the move here. I considered it but wasn't sure of its merit, so I decided to try and check Black as much as possible.
Another blunder, I wanted to make the move, g3, but again wasn't sure of myself. The game gets ugly from here on.
Why would white threaten the black bishop by doubling its pawns?  This trade is black's advantage, and forsakes the pawn/knight trade PxNc6.
?  Maybe white was eying the f7 pawn, which was protected by the black bishop.  But the bishop/rook trade works for black's advantage.
?  I don't see black's strategy.  personally I'm partial to qf5.  PxPg6, Qh5+.  White either trades queens or loses the bishop.  If white answers with QxPc7, QxPh5+ wins white's bishop for free.
White can continue checking into stalemate.  Black must avoid checkmate.  White must either check every move or protect against Pg2.  If I were playing white I would try to settle for a draw.
A gambit, designed to weaken the pawn on d4, but the more conservative 4.g3 is probably better.
You did right not to capture, but this gives up the pawn on d4 for nothing. Both 5...e6 and 5...b3 have yielded good results.
Material is level again, but White has control of the centre and Black can't do much about it due to the absence of his c and d pawns.
White tries to extricate his knight, but it was more important to counter the threat of the pawn.
? Probably not very good, but I was trying to put pressure on him and it was blitz. But this was bad as it allowed him to develop with tempo.
! To this
I pile up on the pinned rook.
personally i dont like having a queen in the middle of the board so early on, however it is a dangerous threat and in this game i ignored it. also look already how black is behind in development! due to not playing kings pawn openings enough myself as white i am a bit of a stranger to the tricks and traps.
a bad move by white surely? it looses a tempo and establishes a strong outpost for my white squared buishop, however it does remove any attacks (for now) on the central queen.
whites strong central attack is sure to claim some victims here but what moves does black have? perhpas quenside castling would be strong, except for the a pawn, a timely h6 may also have done the trick here followed either by g5 or by establishing a bishop on f6 - though blacks attack here is unfocused, there are no two pieces working in conjunction on a single target.
blacks position is now backwards, though he hopes to explot the held up doubled pawns on the f file long enough to pass a pawn on h, though in order to do this- play must be drawn to the other side of the board, and similarly black must not loose too much material in the process
now black must run back home! he cannot move to the D file because of the knight and anything else leads to a loss of material
a good idea from black, if he can trade pawns on g5 then he may be able to sneak one past on the h file which can easily be backed up by the rook...
and the finish is on e6.
Just to free the way for the queen.
Attemting to surprise me...
Threatenind the e4 pawn. I considered to go Bf3, and if NxB, my pawn will land on f3, but white could have castled queenside, so it was not a good plan.
Preparing a daring g5, to win the knight if white don't do something.
True, my bishop is rejected, but he has more squares to go to.
This is the right way to continue the attack... isn't it?
White still tried to surprise me with weird moves. This just causes him to lose a tempo and allow me a good move.
...and now, my knight will jump with check, and then my queen will join the attack, winning even if white threatens mate in three (d5, Bh1, Qg2#).
Rf7 has nothing bad, but I wanted to be brilliant. White is right not to take the g4 pawn, since it allows the queen to penetrate with tempo.
I don't care for my rook, giving the "umbalancing element" a good attack must have; often a sac. This is a strange way to perform it.
This was to avoid the white queen to enter into the defence, but it was a mistake. After Ke1, black wins by sac the knight with Qf1+, KxN, Qe2+, Kc1, Qe1#.
Pressure against the king wins. After Be2, white has to play QxB to avoid mate, without hopes.
It was a mistake, since g3 was lethal to white. But is mate in some more mores  anyway, so my opponent resigned. The key to the win was to give tempoes more importance than material, and surprise my opponent, tempting him with a juicy candy. Thank you for reading and forgive the low game level from both sides.
I thought I'd annotate my loss against this opponent since I annotated the win I think it's pretty interesting, for a while I had the advantage but I blundered it away Actually, for most of the game I was materially ahead, but I took a rook with my queen early on and lost the use of it for the rest of the game.
Stops the mate and chases the queen
pins the knight, and adds another attacker
Looks like it blunders away a bishop but if my opponent plays Bxf6 then I play Qxf6 Qxg4 Qxf2+ Kd1 Qf2b2
And I end up ahead by a rook and two pawns for a knight
If he takes the bishop I take the rook and if not then I can get my queen out
At this point, I think I might have done best to abandon the knight and move the a pawn forward so my king can escape
But now, I try to keep the knight
And I pay the price
Protecting the pawn. At the moment I am quite happy with my dsb on the c1 h6 diagonal
As he is outnumbered in pawns I decide to go for it
Continuing my push, black has limited options for the knight and if I can get in a c5 it could be 3 of my pawns against 2 of his.<n><n>The analysis here suggests this is an inaccuracy and offers b3 as a better move. I had considered that but didn't want to disturb the pawns in front of my king needlessly
Blacks queen is pretty restricted. I had figured that he would want to bring it in to play yet his options are limited at the moment and the line of pawn he has from g6-d6 could become a nice target
This move is pretty much forced as I had the threat of h3, can I take advantage of the bishop pair?<n><n>The analysis however calls this a mistake and suggests Bh6
The analysis suggests that this is an inaccuracy and that g4 is better, however I again was reluctant to disturb the pawns in front of my king and felt that this would weaken the black pawns
lining my rook up against the black queen
Blacks dsb is now pinned (not that he will want to move it)<n><n>The analysis calls this a mistake, recommending Ne4 in preference
Looking to get my queen to h5 to threaten Qxh7
I have serious doubts about this move if only because blacks rooks cannot get into the play just yet to assist an attack, perhaps more importantly I started to look at how I might be able to pin the queen to the king with my rook, however the computer analysis seems to not dislike this
This was really a waiting move to see what black would try
This is a major blunder in my view, black is looking for the queen exchange, he has however forgotten about the pin<n><n>The analysis suggests Qf6
but first I wanted to make sure that the lack rook didn't get in the way. Looking at it now this seems uneccessary, however in the analysis the advantage swings significantly back in my favour
and there it is
Looking at the position now I felt I was in with a chance. Although the material imbalance isn't too great, black has three isolated pawns and his rooks are very limited in mobility, his best chance is to open the h file but he can't force that. I have doubled pawns though I don't feel they are a massive weakness and my queen is nicely placed
Opens the b1-h7 diagonal for my queen to use. This will also limit the mobility of the black king
but before I do anything else I wanted to clear some space around my king to prevent black getting a rook to the h file
I did consider Qg8 here but this move felt better to me as there was little black could do to retaliate immediately
The analysis calls this a blunder and suggests mate in 14!! I will as they say leave that as an excercise for the reader
Blacks king is now totally immobile and there is little defence that can be brought in to play
up until now, I was under the impression I was doing rather nicely against this 2350+ giant... but that would soon change...
Bxb5 leads to mate after Qg3...
This is not the usual move order at which I arrive at the accepted position and I think slightly better for white because it allows development and capture in the same move with the light squared Bishop
The fear here is 9. e5 Ng4 10. h3 Nh6 leaving the black knight in a bad spot and allowing white further development. I'm not sure that simply retreating the Knight to d7 when the threat is made is better using this move as 8. ... Nc6
I wanted to avoid 10. ... Bb4 pinning my Knight for the moment
12. ... Bd6 13. Nxd6 cxd6 avoids the game continuation although trades the black Bishop for the white Knight
Freeing up the light squared Bishop and also setting up to push my light squared Bishop off the long diagonal
My knight has been languishing for far too long and needs to get into the game
Not exactly an early castle here but I liked my Rook lined up on the d column
I'm not sure this was a particularly good move as it further blocks off any potential for black's light square Bishop. I thought better was 24. ... fxe5 25. Bxc4 bxc4 26. dxe5
35. ... Kh8 36. Rh1# or 35. ... Kf8 36. Rg8#. I thought the odd way we got into the Queen's Gambit Accepted was favorable to White and I was able to use my developmental advantage to force the issue on Black for most of the game. The overlooked fork which gave me an exchange advantage plus a Knight was turned into a game winner by the blunder of the Queen.
Good move.  Double threat.  First to capture the  d5 pawn.  Second to penetrate on the dark squares weakness.
To prepare d4 and to clear the c2 square for the Bishop to aim at f5.
I see that my opponent had little surprise for me in this game. I was already prepared to continue with 6.Be2 but I wasnt worried about this move even that with this move white tries to put pressure on queenside later in this game.
In here 8.a5 0-0 is probably even better as a5 tries to fight back against white possible queenside pawn storm but by moving 8...Na6 im looking for possibility to play knight on c7.
Now I was just trying to stop my opponent pawn pushing on queenside and looking for knight to be placed on c7.
Now I am just looking for to play knight on h6 and pawn to f5.
12...Nf6 Re2 would lose the meaning of 11...Ng4.
Good move. This is also quite normal in Kings indian to move bishop this way and there also escaping route to h2 now. 14.Bxh6 Bxh6 is quite useless as it wont give anything to white.
This is natural after moving knight to h6 followed by pawn to f5.
Now I open my bishops way and push pawn on same time which is usually good option if it is available.
Its always good to get knight on center of board as it is tricky one there.
My opponent used about 15min on these move and after the game he offered 23.Bxf3 but he couldnt find any good way to with it. After analysing we came up with example how this game could have continued 23.Bxf3 exf3 24.Nxf3 Nf4 25.Bxf4 Rxf4 26.Qd3 Rxg4  27.hxg4 Qxg4  28.Kh1 Qh3  29.Kg1 Bf5 30.Qd1 Bxc3 31.Rxc3 Kh8 32.Nd4 Rg8  33.Rg3 Rxg3  34.fxg3 Qxg3  35.Kh1 Qh4  36.Kg1 cxd4 with really difficult position to play.
Now this move seemed to be dangerous as by 25.Bxe5 it opens my protection on queenside little bit and on this stage I had really passive pieces even that I was in material lead. I wasnt feeling comfortable at all because this was slow position where white just tries to push his pawns through my defense and I just could find any good kind of counterplay.
This position is really passive for me and I need to play accurately and try to find a good way out. White will even get my c5 pawn and that seemed to be really dangerous.
I was sure that I need to sacrifice material to stop this pawn storm, it is amazing how dangerous whites pawns are and this is good example of effective pawn pushing on queenside in Kings indian.
I was looking just 31.d6 and trying to think what I do after it and that is why this move became as a surprise. This moved seemed to be even more effective at the time but in my after analysis I think this move to be equal with 31.d6.
I need to protect c6 and try to get more help by opening a8 rook.
Its good to get rook to join pawn pushing too.
Pawn must be taken. 36...Rd6 is good try but after 37.cxb7 Qxb7 38.Rxe5 Qg7 39.Re6 Rxe6 40.dxe6 Qf6 41.Re3 Bc6 42.Qe2 Bb7 43.e7 Re8 44.Re6 Qg7 45.Qd3 Kh8 46.f4 and black would have fallen to deep trouble. In this game I didnt calculate that far as after analysing that option few moves it just felt to be too dangerous and I left that idea.
I need to put some kind of stop to this pawn.
And now the pawn isint going to become queen right away.
My opponent had 1min in his clock right now and he was one move away from 40th move increasement and I had about 8min. My opponent had played really well even that he didnt have so much time to spend on his moves, it needs skill to use time in the most effective way and so that you wont make hestitated move because of time.
I didnt want to change our rooks by playing 39...Rxc5 40.Qxc5 41.f4 which I think to be more effective.
White had position where he can make this kind of move that you dont have to think much so it was easy for him to get increasement. Thinking of options like 40.Rexe5? or 40.Rcxe5?! arent so good as this option and by looking at my opponents time these kind of moves needs more time to think. 40.Rexe5? would continue by 40...Bxg4 41.Re7 Qxe7 42.Qg6  Qg7 43.Qxg7  Kxg7 44.hxg4 Rxg4  45.Kh2 Rc8 and option 40.Rcxe5?! Rxg4  41.hxg4 Qxg4  42.Kf1 Qh3  43.Kg1 Qg4  44.Kh2 Qh3  45.Kg1 Qg4  isint good as white is playing for win.
White has strong queenside pawns and now he has even strong kingside pawns that are free to advance, nobody would want to be me right now.
Im just moving as I had lost my intrest in this game already or I was living in somekind of fairy tale that white echanges his rook to my bishop and I go for draw.
Now I resigned and I have probably been irritating for my opponent as I kept moving so I felt it was right to say sorry that I kept continuing and so I did. It looks like I need to go back to learn basics as material doesnt win against mighty pawn arsenal. Somebody might wonder why I didnt try to go for draw by someway and truth is I didnt find one and other reason is that I hate draws as I want only to win but in lost position I will go for draw if I find it even that I hate it.
This is considered dubious because the bishop can be driven away.
Leave, bishop.  Probably preparing b5 to drive the bishop away is better, since the bishop can be totally trapped with c4, similar to the Noah's Ark trap in the Ruy Lopez.
Forking the king and bishop.
The only way to save the bishop.
I chose this blocking move because the bishop is not really more useful on d6, while the light bishop and knight have more useful moves.  This also orients my bishops towards the kingside.
The knight could have been saved with Bd2, where dxc3 leads to 11. Bxc3 Qwhatever 12. Bxg7, with Bxh8 unavoidable. A defense such as Nf6 or Kf8 lets the knight escape with tempo.
Why not move it there in the first place?
Hopefully the king can castle soon.
Protecting the knight to restore the balance.
If the bishop moves, Rxg7  Kh8 Rxh7  Kg8 Rag7#<n>If the rook moves (other than threatening mate, I later noticed), Rxf7
Stopping the c pawn, so it can't reach bishop protection.
Trying to open an escape for the king.
Threatens Rd1 , followed by Rxe1#.  This also allows me to move the bishop, e.g. 31. h3 Bxc4 32. Rxg7  Kf8 and the checking cannot continue.
Distracting him with some checks?  This also allows Bf5 to threaten Bxh3, as the king can head to d8 if checked.
Rf8 fails to g4, losing the g pawn anyways. Rb1  doesn't accomplish anything; the king can move Kf2-e1-d2-c1, and the rook has to move back to the 8th rank to avoid checkmate, so the bishop is lost.
Moving the king to prevent Rh8, allowing the bishop to move perhaps to f7.  An immediate Bf7 would have lost to Rf5.<n>This does allow the fork Rg5  if the bishop moves to the g file.
Preparing Bd7 to block the rook.
Bd7 falls to Rh7, where Bf5 (trying to win pawn or rook) loses to Rg7 , etc. to mate since the king can't get to the d file.<n>I'm thinking that after Rxd7 Bxd7, it's hard to protect the pawn and the rook. Apparently white could have kept the pawn with this move, while Rd6 would have won it.  I keep failing to notice the potential pins.
If Rxd7 Bxd7, White can't safely prevent Kg7, where the bishop can take the pawn. I think Rc6 was the only move that protected against Kg7, as that leads to Rh7  Kg(f)8 Rc8 , with mate to follow.
White tries to fool black- 2. Qh5 g6 - and get his rook but black realises and protects the pawn.

The Two Knights Defense in Italian. Me and my opponent had some blitz quarrels over this, so we decided to settle the score in a regular game... Modern theory continues with 3. ... Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+... Might follow 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8.Nbxd2 d5 9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Qb3, with a slight edge for white, however 7. ... Nxe4 8. Bxb4 Nxb4, poses white more problems... After 7. Nbd2 Nxe4 8. d5 Bxd2 9. Bxd2 Ne7 black is slightly better...
After 5. ... Nxd5, black gets in trouble... The so called Fried Liver Attack (Fischer) continues with the temporary sacrifice 6. Nxf7!? Kxf7 7. Qf3+ Ke6 8. Nc3 Ncb4 (Nce7, d4) 9. Bb3 (stronger then Qe4, c6, a3, Na6, d4, Nac7, and black is better)... Much stronger is directly 6. d4 (Fischer), postponing Nxf7...
Ties black up, threatening Be3, alongside Nb1-d2-c4... After directly 16. Be3 Qa6, Bxb4! becomes a threat, after 16. Nd2 f5 17. Nc4 Qc7 18. Bf3 e4 19. Nxd6 Nxd6 white might lose control...
? The Queen defends f7, which was not really in serious danger, but it blocks in Black's King's Bishop, forcing him to either fianchetto it or move the Queen again. It's good to remember, as well, that in general terms, bringing the Queen out so early tends to be a dangerous play.
Black finally gets a Bishop out, though his kingside is still very restricted--his position is somewhat artificially cramped just because of the Queen sitting in the way of everything on e7. With Qd8 and Be7 instead, with Nf6 to come next move, Black's position would look worlds better.
White forces Black to respond to his actions instead of developing--the Queen has not done anything useful, but it now becomes a liability.
? This is an interesting idea, but the Knight has no real prospects out here! The only place it can actually move is back to c6, and it doesn't threaten anything on a5. Black seems to be worried about the White Bd5, but a more direct way to deal with that is the simple, clean way with 9...Nf6.
Black's awkward Knight gives white a chance to start a queenside pawn push with tempo. After 10...Nc6 11.b5! Black must retreat the Knight to d7 (or somewhere even more awkward), allowing White to win a pawn and prepare a formidable attack on the queenside: 11...Nce7 12.Bxb7 Rb8 13.Ba6, with pressure on a7 and Rb1 coming soon. Alternately, Black can hold the b-pawn at the cost of further cramping his position with 11...Nd8, after which White can play 12.a4 or something else similarly dangerous.
?! This seems at first glance to solve Black's problem, allowing him to exchange his Knight for the powerful White Bishop, but White has a resource to get the better of the exchange...
White intends to make use of his advanced a-pawn to blast a hole through Black's queenside defenses. Between White's Rook and Bishop, the only defense is 13...Qf7, after which Black can play ...a6 and block White's advances while he gets his pieces developed.
? This is probably an oversight--presumably meaning to lock out the a-pawn, but this allows Black to capture on b6 en passant, the strongest possible place for that pawn to go. Black's saving grace here is that White isn't very mobile on the queenside yet.
?? This is the critical mistake in Black's game, I think. It was looking bad, but allowing White to roll his pawn unopposed down to the seventh rank means Black can no longer stop White from Queening with huge advantage: 15.b7 Rb8 16.Ba7 Rd8 17.b8=Q Rxb8 18.Rxb8+ etc. Black needed to play 14...axb6 here to stop the White attack from breaking through completely.
It's sort of a moot point now, but this loses more material than Black needs to after 17.Bxb8 followed by Bxd6 and b8=Q. 16...Rd8 was better.
As White doesn't have a clear mate yet, he needs to trade down and let his other pieces get into the fight, by threatening the BQ and preparing f2-f4.
1-0. Black has had enough. I hope you found something constructive about development and awareness to take from this game--more will be forthcoming! Thanks to chicoboy for the game and thank you for reading!
Alternative variation: 5... g6 [is preferable, to avoid] 6. b3 [But Bxa6 has to be played as soon as White plays Nc3, otherwise e4 will be hard to stop. Bxa6 prevents e4 because it threatens ...Bxf1 Kxf1 and the King walks to g2 which is slow.]
Black's bishop move allows white to insist on the weak exchange of bishop for knight, if Black plays 4 ... Pxe5, 5 Qxd8 Kxd8, 6 Nxe5 wins a pawn for white.
Keep pressure on f7 and add new pressure on b7
Sweet move, if I do say so myself. 8 ... Qxg5 loses after 9 Bxf7  as follows:<n>If 9. ... Ke7 then 10. Qe6  Kd8, 11. Qe8  <n>If 9. ... Kd7 then 10. Qd5  Nd7, 11. Qxa8  Ke7, 12. Qe8  Kd6, 13. Qe6  Kc5, 14. Qd5  Kb4, 15. a3  Ka4, 16 Nc3  . Not 12. ... Kf6 for then 13. Qe6  . If 10. ...Bd6, 11 Qxa8 Qc1 ?, 12. Ke2 Qxa1??, 13. Qxb8  Ke7, 14. Qe8  Kf6, 15. Qe6  Kg5, 16. Qf5  K moves 17. Qh5  .<n>If 9. ... Kd7 then 10. Qd5  Bd6, 11. Qxa8 Ke7! saves black's life, but now 12. Qxb8 threatens the previous checkmates so 12. ... Kxf7, 13. 0-0 and white is ahead in material and threatens to munch on black's pawns.
Expecting Rc8 to save the pawn. Then white brings out his rook with 12. Rd1 followed by 13. Bxf6 and 14. Qxd7  . No, none of that is forced, but at this point white is just mounting attacks and bottling black up on the defence while I deploy more pieces.
Now, White is going too far. His Queen is in a rotten place, and there is no other way to attack my Knight. I call this a mistake.
After going down 11 points, White is forced to defend to the bitter end.
I now tease White with my Bishop, which he could trade, but he chose not to.
I now take things seriously after that and castle to invade the 8th rank.
I decide to prevent f4.
Instead, I quickly decide to finish off his weak Kingside.
After this move, my opponent said that he was finished with this game by resigning. That being said, White played the Ruy Lopez as if he had little experience with it. It is one of the very few openings that require a lot of study time before you perform it. Also, look everywhere. Sometimes, I sit there looking at and studying a position for more than ten minutes to examine what I would need to do. If you're behind in points, start defending; if you're ahead in points, you can do more attacking. No matter where you stand in your games, you need to act as if no one is winning so that you don't hurry and mess up on your tactics.
The Ruy Lopez is my default play in this sequence.  Though I admit my knowledge of its theory is a little weak, I've played it a number of times.  It tends to produce a ragged queenside pawn structure at this level which helps to compensate for the tempi White loses while his bishop is hunted by Black pawns.  It usually ends up on b3, which isn't a bad spot for it anyway.
Black moves to drive the White bishop away.
However, the white knight is reasonably comfortable here for the time being.  He may not stay that way long, however, if Black opts to develop the queenside pawns.
The bishop is basically stuck.  Bc4 Na5 and White is in much the same position, facing a trade that leaves his pawns doubled, and so gives up on the bishop in favour of protecting his king.
Appears to be setting up attacks on both the knights, especially the hard to defend (thanks to the b4 pawn and en passant) d5 knight.
?  Not sure about this.  Perhaps threatening the pawn in case the c6 knight moves to allow the Black lsb to attack, perhaps threatening to play Qe1 and kick off a fight on b4 before Black wants it.  It's tough to find a good home for this bishop here (a fianchetto would have been nice, given the opportunity).  Perhaps Re1 or Qe1 then Bf4 would be better.
Brings the queen into the fight, and that lonely pawn needs friends soon.  e2 over e1 as it allows a rook to develop.  e2 also might allow something else, if White spots the danger.
White now threatens Nxc7+ with more danger for black.  White's threats are coming one at a time.  Ideally, he would like to build more danger up before unleashing multiple threats at once, but he has very low piece activity here: his f3 knight would need to go via h4 to get anywhere and even then he wouldn't be able to do a lot unless the black knight is moved or removed.  Black's pawns dominate White's bishop and White's remaining rook is in a very defensive position.  Although Black has limited activity himself, he looks defensively sound.  Overall, to me, the position looks quite drawish, though of course at this level either side could blunder easily.
This exchange forces off one of White's better pieces and lessens the massive cramp around Black's dsb.
? Opening up the file on the king, who cannot castle unless/until the White queen is dislodged, for a pawn that will be easily reclaimed, also allowing White to claim a better position for his knight.  Perhaps Ra6 to prepare c6 was better.
The rook has an unexpected opportunity to get involved.
?? This can only be an oversight.  Black's sturdy defense is at the expense of mobility, and perhaps the desperate search for activity has caused him to mistakenly advance his queen.  As before, I prefer Ra6 to prepare c6.
There may have been other choices here - 21. Nf5 looks good.<n>A: Black moved neither King nor Queen: 22. Rxe7 Qxe7+ 23. Nxe7 Kxe7, and White is left with a +1 material advantage that should work out ok.<n>B: 21. ... Qxf5 22. Qxf5  White has a Queen where Black has a pawn and a rook.  Both sides have some material, but again White should do ok.<n>C: 21. ... Kf8 22. Rxe7 Qxe7 23. Nxe7 Kxe7, and again White has a +1 material advantage he would try to turn into something more concrete.<n>D: 21. ... Kd8 22. Qxa8 Qc8 23. Qxc8+ Kxc8 24. Rxe7 White finishes here with +5 material, his knight and bishop against one black pawn, and he can pick up that pawn at g7 immediately.  White has a decisive advantage here.<n>E: 21. ... 0-0-0 A tempting option that protects the rook - at the expense of 22 Qa8#<n><n>The disadvantages of these moves are not that great, but they are better hidden than the biggest disadvantages of the text move.  Overall, the immediate material grab is probably just as valuable if not more so, making this both the most obvious and best move.
White declines a Queen trade in favour of a retun to the pressure attack of before.  22. Qxd8 Kxd8 23. Nc6 - 24. Nxe7 offers a material advantage to White, although not quite as much as the best defence against the moves that follow.  It doesn't really seem to matter what White does here: the dropped rook has robbed Black of a vital defender and it matters only if he will force White to push his advantage to the end or will instead break early.
Nc6 was also an option, and plays out very similarly to this move.  The point is of course to pressure the bishop.
Qxe7 was slightly better, though Black's rook seems unlikely to triumph over the Bishop and Queen.
I've been playing the Caro-Kann for more than thirty years. Wow.<n>It's mostly a conservative defense to e4, though I often try to spice it up a little.
And Black says no way, you can't have the whole center like that.<n>But the reason I like the Caro-Kann more than the French (which would look the same except the back pawn is on e6 instead of c6) is that it doesn't block Black's bishops as badly.
I get my bishop developed before I play e6 and block it.
There's a new and unexpected move. I really don't mind trading away that bishop -- it's kind of in the way, but I don't want to have to capture back exf5 and mess up my pawn center. So my choices seem to be Ne7, Bg6, and Be4. <n>I like that Ne7 develops a piece, but I'm not ready to block in my bishop yet and get in the way of my c5 plans.
Well, I can see I'm going to have to move my bishop back to g6, but I won't do it with his knight sitting on h4. Once it goes back home, then I can retreat my bishop.
I'm threatening to mess up his pawns. I had to get the bishop off of e7 so I can develop my knight. It doesn't have any hope of getting out on f6.
Now I can castle either direction. <n>If he plays Na2, I'm happy to trade bishops. I'm curious if he'll threaten my other bishop with Nh4 again. I don't think he would, because I'll just recapture with the knight. In this closed position, the knights are probably stronger than the bishops. But I'm not sure what other threat he's going to work on.<n>Maybe I can start looking at some counter-attacks. I'd like to play c5. It's guarded three times. I'd probably recapture with the bishop so it is attacking f2 and so my knight on d7 then attacks the pawn on e5. That's if he trades. But before I can do that I'll want to play a6 so his knight can't come up to b5. I like it that his knight doesn't have any strong squares to move to right now.
I sure didn't expect this. No use doing lots of analysis to see what's up, because I really only have move I can make.<n>He's attacking the queen and the knight. The only place i can put the queen without losting the bishop is a5, but after he takes the bishop and I play Qxb4, he gets to play Nc7+ and wins the rook. <n> <n>So I have to take the knight. When you play, don't get caught up trying to always figure out what your opponent's plan is -- what you need to do is find your best move.
A hard decision for me. I feel that I want to move Qd8 or Qd7 so my Q can keep an attack on d6 (after I play Nc4 at some point). The problem with Qd7 is my knight remains pinned. The problem with Qd8 is if he plays Bxc6, I don't want to have to recapture with the b-pawn, I feel.
Good riddance to one of those bishops.<n>I imagine the Q will recapture and take its place, but at least my knight won't be pinned then.
I'm thinking that there absolutely nothing for me on the queenside. Maybe I can swing my knight around and start up something on the kingside. I don't see how to get my rooks into the game with his bishop on c5. Even after this move, though, I still can't castle because he's attacking the knight twice, and it would only be guarded once.
Looks like White is getting ready in case I play f6.<n>No, I'm not comfortable opening this up. I'm just trying to find ways to improve my pieces. Do I see any threats on the horizon? Maybe b4 and b5 would be difficult to deal with. <n>Now that I've made the move, I'm wondering if I need to take a look at h5 -- but I don't see it leading anywhere unless I put both rooks over there, and I'm not thrilled with castling queenside.
Well, in a way, that's a scary move. I figured that White couldn't make that move because I had the square covered twice. Now I need to look deeper and see what I missed.<n>After I trade on c5, I'm expecting Rc3.<n>Or, maybe he'll let me capture on c4 and then on b3 and play Rxb3, aiming at my pawn on b7. It's not like my king can get out of the center.<n>I gotta think about this. My other choice is to retreat the queen, like to c6 so he can't use the b-file for his attack. I think/hope I'll be playing Kd7 eventually to link my rooks.
Threatening to win the knight after dxc4. The problem is that the threat's easily thwarted.
This game features a very critical line against the Reti move order, 1. Nf3 d5 2. c4.  By responding 2...d4, Black enters a Benoni reversed, but with an extra tempo for White.  White can counter 3. b4, or as in this game, 3. g3, intending to undermine the center with Re1 and e3.
Black has given up the light squares in the center with his 2nd move.  White intends to exploit this.
Entering a Schmidt-Benoni, where White has an easier time breaking up the Black center.  3...c5 is not only the most popular, but probably the most critical line.
Offering the b-pawn in exchange for the e-pawn.
Sjoberg-Adler continued: 7...Bxb4 8. Nxe5 Nxe5 9. Qa4  Bd7 10. Qxb4 b6!? 11. c5, rejecting the win of the exchange to keep the light-squares around his castled position intact.  Nigel Davies in his book on the Reti, believes that 7...Bxb4 is Black's best option.
Now White is slightly better due to his strong light-squared bishop and extra center pawn.  However, this is not so easy against a 2100 player.
Kaidanov-Khmelnitsky, Philadelphia 1993 continued 9...Ng4 10. Nxg4 Bxg4 11. Bxb7 Rb8 12. Be4 Nxd3 13. Bxh7  Kh8 14. Bxd3 Rxb2 15 Nd2 and White was better.<n><n>Here Black forces the knight to move without the option of exchanging itself for the f6 knight.  Black has a space advantage, and any exchanges will only favor the cramped player.
Black secures his center, and with it, his space advantage.  White has to play very energetically to avoid being smothered.
Here I planned to double on the b-file and play against the b7 pawn, using the a-pawn as a lever if necessary.  This plan was too slow, however, I should have attempted to break apart the center with Re1 and e3.
Black clears the way for the attack on the e2-pawn.
14...Bg4 might have been better, as 15. h3 would provoke Black to reroute the bishop to g6, where it's optimally placed.
Once a plan is chosen, It is imperative to stick to it, unless you face immediate material or positional ruin.
A useful pin.  I now have to do some rearranging to free myself.
Now Black's dark-squared bishop is blockading my a-pawn advance!  My queenside counterplay is stifled and I am getting a little worried.
I decide to attempt to either exchange the light-sqared bishop for a knight, or at least drive away the bishop from the b1-h7 diagonal.  19. Qd1 seemed like a waste of time.
Preparing to double against the weakness on e2.
Accepting some kingside weakness as the dark-squared bishop wont be able to participate in any attack.
Step three, prepare to transfer the rook to either f1 or h1 and get that counterplay rolling!!!
Not sure about this plan, however, I really don't see a way for Black to break through.  This will get rid of the bishop pair after the obligatory Bxf4, however, my pieces are getting active, while that dark-squared bishop looks offsides.
My iron grip on the light-squares means Black's attack is at an end.
Overestimating his chances, Black had the opportunity for a three-fold repetition with 38...Qe3.
The Black rook is locked out.  and the White king has an invasion route on the light-squares.  Unfortunately, this is where Black timed out, just when the endgame was looking interesting.
Ok. I don't know if this has a name or if it's just plain silly. I thought to give a pawn away to see if I could get an edge in the center.
ok. He refuses the pawn, so I take his d pawn. he has to take it with his knight which lets me push e5 with tempo.
This is the blunder. All is lost from this point on. I should have taken the knight and the position should have been almost even, white is better but there is at least some chance for black. <n>[in actuality white has a forced mate from here. if you like puzzles you can try to figure it out. Its not THAT hard. Mate in 10. I added it as a puzzle. #4035]
Taking that rook is a relative blunder. he has forced mate:<n>13. Ne7  Kf8 14. Nf5  Kg8 15. Nh6  Bxh6 16. Bxh6 <n>Now if black doesnt cover his back rank (moving Knight or Queen) Qf1#.<n>16. ... Qc8 17. Qxf6 Qf8 18. Qg5  Qg7 19. Qxg7#
I move my king's pawn to give his bishop and queen some freedom...
...and I move my queen's pawn to give her bishop freedom...
...then he moves his queen's pawn one space to free her bishop and to keep the pawn...
...and I trade my knight for his bishop, but maintain a reasonable pawn structure.
...and he castles queenside to remove some of the protection on the castling rook's pawn...
...forcing it to move...
...so my knight advances to the 7th rank to fork the king and knight...
...but he declines to take my knight with his...
...to force the king to his starting file...
...in exchange for mine, distorting his pawn structure, doubling on the c-file...
...so my queen advances to the 7th rank to target the isolated pawn on a6, and the doubled pawns on c6 and c7...
...and removes the c7-pawn...
...forcing the knight out to cover the one on c6...
...so I castle kingside to bring my kingside rook into play...
...and he lines my bishop up with his queen...
...forcing my bishop to one of the only safe places, keeping it as close to the centre as possible.
...and he moves out his bishop to defend.
I attack his rook...
...which is now covered by my kingside bishop...
...and he moves his king to unpin his bishop...
..and I now capture the isolated rook's pawn...
...so my bishop pressures the rook...
...so his rook sees to that...
...so my rook moves up to the 4th rank...
...and the knight moves to prevent an in-between checking move that would allow me to sacrifice my bishop for it...
...and his bishop moves in front to prevent it from happening...
...so I attack it with mine, hoping he'll play Bxd6, so I can play Re8+, forcing him to capture, so I can recapture and mate (30... Bxd6 31. Re8+ Rxe8 32. Rxe8#)...
...so I capture his remaining bishop, unaware that mine is also under attack from the knight...
...and he captures my bishop, leaving me in a little disarray, as on both occasions, I failed to spot my bishops being under attack...
...so I move my lower rook up to attack his knight...
...and, with both my rooks under attack, after five consecutive knight moves by my opponent, I push my higher rook to the top rank to check, to ensure, I'll take a rook with one of mine...
...and he moves his king off his bottom rank, as capturing with his rook on a8 would lose both (35 ...Rxd8 36. Rxd8+ Ke7 37. Rxh8)...
...and I now capture the kingside rook, as it could only move in one direction...
...so I can now complete the obliteration of his queenside pawns and move my rook out of harm's way...
...and he contests the open d-file...
...so I decide to capture his rook as it was the only thing I could have really done, my eighth consecutive rook move...
I move up my QNP to cover the squares on the 4th rank his knight could have moved to, to restrain it...
...and he advances his knight's pawn two spaces to cover the f4 and h4 squares...
...and I pressure the knight with my QBP...
...forcing it to move to cover from its pawn...
...and I now attack his knight's pawn...
...so he moves his rook's pawn to cover...
...and I lose my KBP to his knight...
...forcing his knight's pawn to move down for cover by the piece it started in front of.
So my king hunts down the bishop's pawn...
...so his king moves closer to my queenside pawns...
...and my king removes his kingside bishop's pawn.
...allowing my king to complete the obliteration of my opponent's pawns.
...so I advance my KRP two spaces, as it was the furthest away from his king and knight...
...and I lose my QNP to the knight...
...allowing my KRP to advance to the 5th rank...
...so the knight moves to cut it down...
...so I advance my pawn to the 6th rank, four knight moves away from the knight...
...and as the knight advances to the d7 square...
...I move my king, as advancing my pawn again would result in a fork: (57. h7?? Nf6!!+ 58. any king move other than Kh5 Nxh7, with my king too far away to threaten the knight). The knight is four moves away from my king, and three away from my pawn...
...and the knight advances to the f8 square to prevent my king from getting as close as possible to my pawn...
...my king can now get as close as possible to my pawn, and pressure the knight at the same time.
The knight vacates the square...
...and I capture the knight with my king, and my KNP now has a clear run.
...my KNP makes it to the top rank to queen...
...and as my opponent's king moves onto my bottom rank...
...allowing my king to close in on him. I used the conditional move to see which mated faster: moving the queen with the king until she reached d2, then moving the king, before mating with the queen v moving the king then the queen with the final move, and the latter mated faster. My opponent let this game time out as the next move would have been checkmate: 72... Ka1 73. Qb2# or 72... Kc1 73. Qc2/Qf1/Qg1/Qh1#.
Annotating for the first time. All comments welcomed.<n><n>1. d4    I grew up/learned playing e4. Since joining GameKnot have been playing d4. The following moves are in the database. I do not have the knowledge to talk about the good and bad points of openings. Suffice it to say, if the database likes it, I love it.
4. e4     This move is a first for white. Usually play e3 (twice) and the results were 1 win and 1 loss. This time round white played e4 because the database showed a higher winning percentage for white and this seems to be an aggressive move, I think another way of saying that is that this is a move with tempo. Moves with tempo are something I have learned about recently, I look for them now. It seems to help
Black plays 4. ...  Bd6    Looking at the databases, this move is not in the "World" database but is in the "GameKnot" database and has been played 6 times. Going by the database black has made the best statistical move for a black victory.
The database has black moving Qe8 or dxc4 next. Black decides to travel down a different path. Neither good nor bad, just different.<n><n>Blacks Knight is pinned and black is cramped for space. White thinks the h6 move is to unpin the Knight. Maybe h6 is a good move, maybe not so good a move. A chess player better than white might have an opinion one way or the other. White now have a choice to make.<n><n>Whites thought process here is between two choices. Take the Knight or retreat.<n><n>If white takes the Knight tempo is lost, whites "projected power" decreases and creates a crack in whites King side.<n><n>If white retreats tempo is still lost but the Knight is stilled pinned. After looking what the board would look like after retreating to h4 white moves there. White can not see a move black could make next to stop white from castling next time around.<n><n>Bottom line is white retreats and retreats to a square that keeps the Knight pinned.
After retreating white is expecting black to develop another piece, maybe the Knight or Bishop to d7 and if not develop then try to create some room to maneuver, like dxc4. Blacks position is cramped. White thinks black does have a few good moves to make, the defense looks solid and white just gave away tempo. All in all it seems to be an even game right now. Looks like the middle game is going to be slow and long.
¿What? Chasing away the Bishop does nothing but weaken the blacks king side defense. White clicked on analyze to see what the game would looked like if it went 10. Nxg5 hxg5 11.Bxg5. White liked what was seen and so sacrificed the Knight for position. It took about 30 seconds to analyze, move and hit the submit button.<n><n>White is close to castling and complete developing. Black has castled, is behind in development, is cramped and needs to move precisely to stay in the game.<n><n>¿Could chasing the Bishop away be a fatal mistake?
Wow, white likes it. Whites projected power on the king side is impressive. Whites Bishops and Queen have a clear look at blacks King. Black needs to open the position up to move in re-enforcements. White sees the beginning of the end for black. If the Queen could hurry up and get to the h file this game is history.<n><n>White is down a point but has excellent position.
Alrighty then. Black does not complicate the position, does not apply any pressure, does not open up and gives the tempo back to white. Black has moved the Queen with thoughts of moving the Knight to g6. This does put a piece in front of blacks King but black is still cramped for space and more than a Knight is needed. It will soon be Blacks King, Knight and Pawn against whites two Bishops and Queen.<n><n>White clicks on the analyze button once again, this time spends 30 minutes going through the different combinations thinking surely there is a forced checkmate somewhere in here. There is. Unfortunately white did not see it and let black off the hook.<n><n>White played 12. Qh5 then 13. Bf6. Should have moved the Bishop first then the Queen, white did not see this until after moving the Queen.
Whites thought process is the Queen will need to be on the h file sooner or later. White is looking at getting the Queen to h7 or h8 in combination with a Bishop and the party is over. Moving the white Queen that close to the unprotected black King and taking over the h file has to be THE move. ¿Right?<n><n>!Wrong! Black Pawn to f5 would end the forced checkmate and prolong the game. This was seen after the submit button was hit for the Qh5 move.<n><n>If white was any good at chess people would pay money to watch. Instead, white has to pay money to play chess.  ¿What is wrong with this picture?
After black is a little slow in development, white opens up the position.board.<n>Then after black does not find the correct defense, he gets is blown from the board.<n>White is able to launch a king-side attack in which he succeedes using a few nice sacrifices.
This may be a premature attempt to punish black for his indiscretion.<n>Still black will need to tread a little carefull, or things could go bad for him.
Castling with 0-0 seems better, black is be ok after that.<n>After this move white tries to profit, by looking for complications.<n>In reality black position is solid, and he should be able to stand the storm.
No need to withdraw the Bisshop, its to dangerous for black to open the h-line.
I would not have played that, but you cannot blame black for trying to get back into the game.
Indiretly protecting the Bisshop
This rook cannot be taken. Also the h-line is now open.<n>If we count material, then we can see black is being overwhelmed on the kings side already.
forking the king and pawn
planning d4 to control the center
pins knight and hopes to double up black's pawns
I try to prevent castling
taking more of the center and guarding the bishop.
forced to take the bishop
i plan to play Rf6 , then when he plays Ke7, e6.
tries to stop my pawn
The natural square for the knight.
The logical follow-up to my last move, but probably a mistake. My computer likes the bizarre looking 7....Rh7 here.
The king stays on the g pawn. Find white's best now!
Did you find it? if Kxg6 13. Qh5+ and white mates black with 14. Qf7.
And his knight retreats.
I try to open up the position for my two bishops, and also complete by queen side development.
I open up the d file, so now the knight on d4 is protected twice - by both the pawn on c5 and my queen on d8.
I want him to exchange on b6 for two reasons. I will take back with the a pawn, to open the a file for my rook on a8 and also I hope to play c7-c5 to protect d4.
But now he threatens Qxh6 mate! My computer prefers 27.Nc3xe4! instead, which seems to win back the pawn, although it is extraordinarily complicated and there are some lovely lines, for instance 22. Nxe4 Rxg2 23. Rxh6+! Kxh6 24. Bg7+ followed by 25. Qxd8 I think then black can pick up the other white rook with Rg8+ and Rxa1, but then the white queen can force perpetual check - but I am not sure at all, there may be improvements for either side.
Played after a long think. I want to force his king to f8, so I can check on a6 with my bishop and then maybe block the d file with my bishop to d3 if necessary.
And my queen protects h6 and f5.
And I get my pawn back and attack his bishop.
He moves his bishop to a safer square. OK, stop and work out black's best move.
Did you get it? Of course, if he takes my rook, my other rook goes to g2 with mate again.
and now I am about to win his queen with Rf3+
And, with two clear pawns down, and all by pieces still on active squares, my opponent throws in the towel. We won the match 3-2, winning the top three boards, and losing the bottom three, as expected.<n><n>Many thanks for reading, please comment and rate this on the star system. Until next time dear reader!
This was my opening game in a minitournament consisting of teammates from Waskally Wabbits and Morose Mooses. I decided to annotate all my games from the competition, as this would also help me to focus more on my games and hopefully cut out most blunders. I can't promise scintillating play, as I'm not that kind of a player. :) <n><n>My opponent, Blackbaron, is my most frequent opponent on Gameknot, and I played against him in my very first minitournament in this site. We usually have very exciting games with a lot of exchanges early on, so let's see how this one goes. <n><n>He starts with 1.e4. My personal favourite, pawn moves to the centre, and frees two pieces, the light squared bishop and the queen. My usual defence against 1.e4 is the French Defence.
1.... c5. The Sicilian, my current preferred opening against 1. e4. I had a pretty good run with the French, and will return to it soon. Tried the Pirc for a while, with horrible results. Record with the French : 50%, Record with the Pirc : 35%.  Have recently ordered the book Play the French by John Watson (just arrived today, in fact. Takes 12 days for Amazon.com to deliver to Bangladesh, for anyone who might be interested) :) . Will switch back to the French after I study the book for a while.
Normal development, moves the Knight to its best square, and follows the rule : Knights before Bishops, as we know what the best squares are for the knights, whereas it is better to wait a bit before developing the bishop.
This move frees my light squared bishop. I plan to play the Sicilian Dragon, so while my king side bishop looks horribly locked in, I 'm not too worried.  I plan to fianchetto the bishop. The fianchettoed bishop failed miserably for me in the Pirc Defence, let's see how the Dragon suits my style.
Unorthodox move, no idea if this move is in the book, will have to check later after the game what the best response is. For now, will have to follow my instincts. Perhaps he is planning to fianchetto his own bishop, to prevent me from playing g6 for the Dragon formation.
Normal development, Knight to its best square. If he fianchettoes his bishop to counter my Dragon, I'll still continue with my plan, I fancy the early exchange which wins his bishop for my knight.
4. e5. Typically aggressive play by the Baron, but has he overlooked something? I can play 4.... dxe5, which wins a pawn, because if 5. Nxe5?, I can play 5..... Qd4! which forks the knight and rook. Let's wait and see though.
How will he defend this? Give away the rook, as a sort of poisoned rook, if there is such a thing, and attempt to trap my queen? For example, 6. Nc4  Qxa1, 7. Bb2  Qxa2, 8. Nc3 Qa6 and so on. Or even 7. Nc3 which looks better. Let's wait and see. Of course, trapping my queen is one thing, capturing it with no further loss of material is something else entirely :)
Possible responses from the Baron? Bc4 looks plausible. Note the placement of my knight, by choosing to develop it early to it's best square, it prevents my opponent's queen from playing threatening queen moves such as Qa5 or Qg4. The Knight defends beautifully from there.
As predicted. Too late for me to react to this now, as it's way past midnight, and I have to get up early for work tomorrow. To be continued.
Protecting the King with the e pawn. White could castle and bring his rook into play on the half open file, but my pawn is backed by the bishop, and I could bring a piece or two out myself by then. I wanted to avoid a move like Ke1 because it would leave my king too exposed
Protects the rook, and develops a piece.
Reasons for this move : Develops a piece; the game is very open, and the player with better development should have the advantage. Also, it takes me a step closer to 'castling by hand' and takes my King to safety.<n>I would have loved to have been able to play Ng4, but there's a time and a place for everything.<n>Possible threats now : Nb5 I can deal with, Qf3 gives me time to bring out my h1 rook, Qe2 could have been a worry, but my bishop at c1 is nicely placed to deal with that.
9. Qf3. Let's see, pins the knight, and prevents my light squared bishop from moving, with an eye on my b7 pawn. That's always a thing to remember when your opponent plays a queen move, it can threaten multiple pieces or squares simultaneously, and it's easy to miss out sometimes. The knight is well protected for the moment, and I could play Nbd2 if necessary, developing my Qside knight in the process. I could try Qe5 , to ease the pressure a bit, and see how my opponent reacts. He would most likely block the check with his bishop, giving me time to bring out my rook and continue with my original plan of castling by hand.
10. Be2, as expected. My queen move also prevents White from castling, as O-O would be followed by Qxh2 . Time to bring my rook into play, but where? One of the two half open files (f and d), or Re8?
I need to watch out for any discovered attacks on my queen now. But how soon do I need to respond to this threat? Do I have time to tuck away my King? What's the worst the Knight can do? And most importantly, the Bishop itself is unprotected, so a discovered attack may not be on the cards just yet. Another motive could be that my opponent plans to castle queenside, and use a pawn storm to tear up whatever protection I have left for my King. I don't like this at all.
Safety first, the King looks better protected, and I manage to unpin my Knight. Must start preparing my response to O-O-O.
12.O-O-O. Let's see how this changes things. White's fianchettoed bishop is now protected, and can threaten my queen. Let's see what my options are. I have three pieces that I haven't developed at all, not a good idea in such an open game. The bishop and rook can't really move, and are running out of oxygen. Nc6 looks like the only developing move. But what if 12%u2026 Nc6?  13. Nb5. Among other options, an exchange of queens would suit me fine, will have to find ways to force it. Something like Qf4 would be a step in that direction, and would also take my queen out of the range of White's annoying darksquared bishop. But should I go for that now, with so many pieces still undeveloped?
In the end, I settle for Qf4. Getting White's queen out of the game, or even forcing it to move away from the h1-a8 diagonal would allow me to develop my pieces. Of course, White still has the option of replacing the queen on that diagonal with his lightsquared bishop.
Exchange of queens suits me fine, as I am a piece ahead. Also reduces the pressure that was being exerted on my queen side pieces.
Now let's see if the bishop replaces the queen on the long diagonal.
Bishop must move, but what is the best square? Keeping it on this diagonal would be useful, as it prevents White from pushing the d-pawn. However, Bg5 or Bh6 could easily be blocked off with f4. In response, I could try Nbd2 followed by e5. Worth a try.
I was afraid of that. Well, time to open things up a bit more, something along the lines of 16...e5  17 fxe5 Nxe5 which gives me some breathing space and gets rid of my isolated e-pawn.
I'm not too happy with my position, my extra piece hasn't meant anything so far, must get to the endgame quickly.
I chose to exchange knights, as :<n>It takes me closer to the endgame with two more pieces off the board, and<n>I can now use my other knight as the blockader at f6.
Where should I move my King? I chose Kf8, as I was worried about the possibility of being cornered by the two bishops.
Now my knight move Nf6 looks nice, forks White's bishop and pawn, and blocks the f pawn. One thing to keep in mind is a future g5 by Baron, which will fork my bishop and knight.
So that when I play e4, if Baron tries Bxf6, I can retake with my bishop and replace one blockader with another.
Makes it possible to advance the d pawn, my bishops are beginning to look less useful, I really haven't taken advantage of my extra piece. Baron's Knight sacrifice brought my King out, and I've been under pressure since.
Looks like a clumsy and awkward move, but I can't think of anything better at the moment. Advance the b pawn next, and try to exchange the light squared bishops.
Protect my own hanging pawn. It seems to me as though I've been reacting to Baron's moves for a long time, rather then setting up some threats of my own. Hopefully things will change when my queenside pieces enter the play.
New plan, will attack the lightly protected f pawn with a discovered attack, next move Rf8
Continuing with my plan, but I'm expecting Baron to play f6. Exchange of pawns, my King's exposed, not good.
Return the knight to d7, and then start advancing my queenside pawns?
The knight does provide added protection to my isolated e pawn though.
I'm seriously thinking about sacrificing a piece here, the knight, if it eases the pressure on my King. For example, 29... Nf6. 30. gxf6   Rxf6. This could win White's f pawn for me as well, so I'd be a pawn ahead, with a Kingside pawn majority, and closer to the end game. But what are my opponent's options? If he decides to advance his pawn rather than take my knight, that suits me too, as I can exchange my knight for his bishop and retain my piece advantage. I'll go for it.
I notice the chance for the stalemate, and go for it. I apologise for the anticlimax. My endgame is my weakest point, it would have been good practice to continue, on the other hand, I was under a lot of pressure for a very long period, and was relieved with the draw.
Draw, we share the points. I had an extra pawn, with a kingside pawn advantage, but I was under pressure from my opponent from a very early stage, and was relieved to get the 1/2.
whether the bishop move inhibits the g3-Rook remains unanalyzed. I actually like the Bishop on d3 for reasons to follow. Yes I analyzed Rook-d3 but didn't like it.
Ok so reassessing the board this game turned into an endgame to casting the net for checkmate.
Instead of swapping on c3, the N retreats to a not particularly useful square.  The computer gives me the slightest edge after this.
Identified by the computer as an inaccuracy.  It prefers "… Nc6 9.  Be3  Bf6  10. e5 Be7  11. Qb3 Qd7  12. Rac1 Bf5  13. Rfd1 Rad8  14. Bd3 Bxd3  15. Rxd3. +0.23"  Odd that it gets the move-numbering wrong.  Black's pawn structure is typical of the Slav defence, which is very sound, so I think Sheridan can be forgiven this :-)
Now the computer gives me a whole pawn advantage!... but it doesn't last long :-(  This is the start of a sustained attack on Black's kingside which, I feel, should have been more successful than it ultimately was, whether due to Sheridan's defensive skills or my attacking errors remains to be seen.
Curiously, my advantage drops to +0.49 with this move, though the computer suggests no alternative.
Black continues to try to catch up on development.
It would be standard policy to park this R on c1, controlling the half-open file but it bites on granite at c6.  On d1, the R supports a potential later central thrust and opposes Black's Q.
Now Black starts to try to undermine White's impressive looking centre by pinning the QN against White's Q and thus threatening to capture the e4 pawn.  I had to think quite hard about how to deal with this threat, eventually opting to bolster e4 with my LSB.
Black renews the threat to e4 and establishes even tighter control over d5.  If White is tempted to play e5, Black will have a lovely outpost for the rest of the game.  Nevertheless, the computer doubles White's advantage again!
Black swaps.  The computer doesn't like this, again doubling White's advantage to +0.98, but in this sort of position, Black's Ns are likely to more than match White's Bs.
Black gets his Q off the d-file, allowing a R to occupy d8 and apply further pressure to White's centre.
Black creates a hole for his K (or B if it is attacked) but also provides a target for White.
White's N seizes a key central square from which to dominate Black's position.  I was in two minds whether to follow this up with Nxg6 if Black allowed.  I generally like to swap Ns for Bs but in this position White's N looks much stronger than Black's B, so it would be an odd swap unless there were some concrete tactical advantage to be gained.
Black retreats anyway, so I don't need to choose.
This is a double edged move: if Black swaps pawns I get a nice pin on his Nf6 and can follow up with a full-scale kingside attack with minor and major pieces.  On the other hand, White's king is looking exposed, so, if the attack fails, Black will probably mate White quickly (but such possibilities are a long way down the line at this stage).
I was quite pleased with this position, though unsure how to proceed.  The computer has dropped bmy advantage by 0.1 to +0.90 now.
!??  I had my heart in my mouth as I played this picturesque move, apparently putting the Q en prise but exploiting the pin on the Nf6 against the Qe7.  It's the kind of move that would cause a lesser opponent to panic but Sheridan reacted calmly.  Of course the prosaic computer sees none of the beauty in my concept and has Black launching a Queenside frolic with his own Q:<n><n>Blunder: +0.62 » 21.  Qh5  Nbd7  22. Qf3 Qa3  23. Bb1 Qb2  24. Ng4 Rc8  25. c4 Nxg4  26. hxg4 c5  27. Re2<n>Best: +4.20 » 21. Ng4 Qa3 22. Bxf6 Rc8 23. Qd2 gxf6 24. Nxf6+ Kh8 25. e5 Rg8+ 26. Kh2 Nd5 27. Nxh7 Nxc3 28. Ra1
Now, even though Black plays the computer's preferred move, White's advantage has apparently climbed to +1.47, so even after my "blunder" I have still improved my advantage.
Played with the objective of maintaining the pressure on the h4-d8 diagonal by removing one of the Nf6's defenders.  The computer, of course, identifies this as another mistake, though now its preferred move is 22. Qh4 rather than 22. Qf3 as in the earlier note.
Now this is identified as an inaccuracy: I guess because, in human chess terms, it releases the tension too early.  By delaying the exchange a couple of moves, White could have gained another point advantage, according to the computer:<n><n>"Inaccuracy: +1.18 » 23.  Bxf6  gxf6  24. Qh4 Kg7  25. Re3 Bg6  26. Rg3 e5  27. dxe5 fxe5  28. Qg5 Qc7  29. h4 Kg8  30. h5 Rxd3<n>Best: +2.16 » 23. Qh4 Bg6 24. e5 Nd5 25. Bxg6 fxg6 26. Bxd8 Qxd8 27. Qxd8 Rxd8 28. Rd3 g5 29. c4 Nf4 30. Rb3 b6"
This move threatens mate in one, so Black has to do something about it.  I expected ...Bxd3, when I could lift my R to d3 and then deliver mate from g3 but the computer recommends the much better ...Bg6.
White prepares to either double rooks on the g-file or get behind the pawn on h3.  By now the computer has reduced White's advantage to a mere +0.25 so the attack is fizzling out without a concrete advantage gained.
Black offers to swap rooks.  The sting gone from the attack, Black's superior endgame skills make him favourite from now on.
I reasoned that the swapping would be less wholesale on this square than on g8 and that I could apply some pressure to f7 and along the 7th rank.  Again, the computer doesn't seem to like it, as my advantage drops from +0.44 to +0.14 but no analysis to back this up.
Now my advantage has frittered away to +0.02 :-(
and now I'm back to the heady heights of +0.76, so I think this must be a good move! (though it's pretty obvious so hardly worthy of an exclamation mark)
This was a bit mysterious and had me worried for a while.  It's not clear what Black plans to do with this B.  Perhaps it's a question of putting it somewhere safe where White won't bother to molest it.  If he'd just played it to g6, I'd have harassed it with the h-pawn.  If he'd played it to g4, we might have settled for a draw by repetition if I'd gone 36. Rg7 Bh5 37. Rg5 etc
Now I had visions (hallucinations?) of marching the king via the dark squares to c7 or e7 and harassing Black's pawns but this was never to be.
?! and the computer would have preferred me to continue at least part-way with my plan:<n><n>"Inaccuracy: +0.25 » 37.  f4  Bh5  38. Kf2 Bg4  39. Bc2 Kh7  40. c4 Rg6  41. d5 cxd5  42. cxd5 exd5  43. Bxf5 Bxf5  44. Rxf5 d4  45. Rd5 Rh6  46. h5<n>Best: +0.85 » 37. Kf4 Kh7 38. Rxg8 Kxg8 39. Kg5 Kh7 40. h5 Bf3 41. Bc2 b6 42. Bd3 Bd5 43. c4 Bf3 44. a3 a5"<n><n>Now my K is doomed to lurk at the back so long as Black's B occupies d1.
?? Arguably the losing move.  We don't often describe failures to win material as "blunders" in the way that we describe moves that lose material; but this move surely qualifies as such.  I completely failed to see the weakling at e6 and was still obsessed with my King's scope for activity (a worthy obsession in the endgame but unforgivable when it blinds one to match-winning opportunities):<n><n>"Blunder: -1.36 » 39.  Kf2  Kg8  40. Be2 Bxe2  41. Kxe2 Kf7  42. a4 Kxf6  43. c4 b6  44. Kd3 c5  45. Kc3 a6  46. d5 Ke7  47. Kd3 Kd6<n>Best: +2.34 » 39. Bc4 Bc2 40. Bxe6 Bd3 41. c4 b6 42. Kf3 Bb1 43. a3 Bd3 44. Ke3 Be4 45. Bf7 Kh7 46. h5 gxh5 47. Bxh5 Kg8"
?? but White is now determined to give the game away, it seems.  I thought my best chance lay in giving Black an isolated d-pawn but of course I was soon to run out of waiting moves that would give me the opposition usefully.  The computer shows how I could at least have made Black fight for a win:<n><n>"Blunder: -5.02 » 44.  d5  exd5  45. cxd5 c5  46. a4 Kd6  47. Kd3 Kxd5  48. Kc3 b6  49. Kd3 a6  50. Kc3 b5  51. Kb3 Ke4  52. a5 Kxf4  53. Kc3 Ke4  54. Kb3<n>Best: -1.72 » 44. c5 b6 45. cxb6 axb6 46. Ke2 Kd6 47. Ke3 Kd5 48. Kd3 c5 49. dxc5 Kxc5 50. Kc3 Kd5 51. Kd3 b5 52. a3 e5 53. fxe5 f4 54. h5"
?! If I wanted to gain the opposition, I might have done better to delay my arrival on this square by first playing 46. d3, as now I am forced to play the first waiting move.
! (-9.27)  At a stroke, Black renders White powerless as he is in zugzwang.  Every moves enables Black to increase his advantage.  I resigned.
Following a suggestion by Leonard Barden and Tim Harding. Also partly as a result of being beaten too many times on the black side of this at Sheffield University by Peter Large. It is quite acceptable to take to pawn however, if black follows it up correctly.
And so too for black
The queen takes up a central location. For the first time in the game I had a good think. I remembered a game from my university days where I continued with f5, but it seemed to me that f5 left my d pawn backwards, and if I later played d6 or d5 to stop it bein backward, he could just play e5xd6 and my e pawn was backward. I didn't want to leave his e5 pawn unmolested, it could form the basis of a king side attack. Why not play d6 now? Yes that's what I'll play. Now according to Harding and Barden, "Black can equalise with Taimanov's 7....f5". I did find out later that f5 does score better for black, and is more popular, although d6 also scores well for black.
He develops. Now in nemours (1706) vs. riva77 (1712), black continued with 13....a6 and lost. Maybe my move I played is an improvement? This position also came up in Stein, Bernd (2380) vs. Kovalev, Andrei (2500), where black continued with Be8 and won, although Be8 seems to me to be undeveloping, and breaking the rule of not retreating a piece to the back rank to break the connection of your rooks. What do you think dear reader?
I hit his queen. The idea is to take the initiative on the king side with e5 and e4. Unfortunately he stops this, so maybe e5 was better, but that does leave my d5 square weak, and he can play Nc3-d5
Now I am threatening e5 and my Bc8 suddenly has a great square on b7. I was rather expecting Ne5 now, but he played....
He hits Rf8 and e5
Why not c4 here? It would stake claim to some of the center immediately.
Similar to the Bogo-Indian but made with the Samisch variation in mind. 3. e3 allows for the exchange of bishops without the doubling of pawns commonly associated with the Samisch.
Exchanging the bishops made me very happy. It makes it a little harder to attack the kingside with bishop-queen barrage.
Why did White not take with the Queen and just simply develop on the next move with Nc3? I suspect he was expecting me to take the c pawn, and after taking with the bishop to follow up with e4 posting control over the center.
Immediately challenging the d4. I think this move was better then dxc4 in that it at least develops a piece and gains space.
I suppose this move was a matter of taste. Nbxd4 would have been acceptable as well I suspect. At least with Nbxd4 White would cover the e5 square in preparation to the eventual pawn push.
This move violates one of those addressed in My System. It allows for White to exchange while developing a piece. Perhaps Nc6 would have been in order to challenge the knight and possibly building a pawn chain after the exchanges of the knights.
A development move was in order at this point. By playing e5 would have lead to the exchange of the queens but since White is more developed, he would have been in better shape come the endgame ruling out this move. Interesting was Nbd7, however it blocks in the bishop.
This move makes it impossible to play Nc6 right away since White would win the pawn after the exchange. The move also prevents Bd7 with the hope of playing Nc6 under more favorable conditions.
Black resigns here with the idea that he will not be allowed to advance his pawn while White promotes to queen and wins easily.
Met with e5, I begin the lines for the King's Gambit; a line I've been experimenting with, primarily in Blitz games. The King's Gambit involves the initial sacrifice of the white f pawn. The concept behind it being that off centering black's e pawn will give white an advantage in the game through center control and initiative. Black's best hope is to slow the pace of the game down and lock up the board as much as possible, so as to stave off the early offensive and retain the advantage in material.
I develop my knight, the most common third move for white in the King's Gambit lines. Trying to take immediate control of the center so that strong opening offensive can give me a positional advantage greater than or equal to my sacrificed pawn.
I respond with d4, a nice move that I tend to favor given the opportunity. It takes a fairly dominating control of the center while forcing the opponent to attend to his erstwhile soldier being threatened by the now discovered dark squared bishop.
My opponent responds with the common and quite effective g5. Here I make an interesting attempt to peal off that defense. Admittedly I do not know the theory behind this move at all, it was simply a move I thought of and utilized. At this point I am rather intent on securing my the pawn on f4, I have a significant advantage in development and control of the center, if I could equalize the material I should have the game fairly securely in my favor. My only concern is g4, in which case I would have sacrificed my knight as opposed to moving it to either h2 or d2. I would have attempted to take advantage of the additional tempi and launch a whirlwind tactical assault upon the opponents center. For example Zimmer vs. Hans Mueller in 1918. In that particular case white sacrifices two pawns and a knight, similar to this game, in order to gain the initiative to win the game.
My opponent chooses to defend his defense, but in doing so exposes a fairly huge weakness on his kingside. He follows up with a weak Bd7, a move I cannot even hope to explain. The only other square he could have moved his light squared bishop to was g4, pinning my knight to my queen (finally). Retrospectively the better of the two moves for the bishop.
That move proves to be my opponents undoing, because the only two moves prevent checkmate, Qe7 and Nh6; Qe7 losing the rook after 8. Nf7. Even with the best move, the material has been evened, and the position is strongly in my favor.
Unfortunately for black, he does not see the looming checkmate. He accepts the "poison knight" and allows for Qh5+. My opponent then resigns, seeing 8... Ke7 9.Qf7#. This is my first annotation, I chose (obviously) a short and tactical game for simplicities sake. This game is an excellent example of the strength in the King's Gambit, especially against opponents not entirely familiar with the lines. Forcing your opponent into a sharp, tactical game creates a very small margin for error, and that can be capitalized on by a clever tactician, particularly in Blitz games. Please comment and let me know what you think.
Preparing the fianchetto.
Normal response.  I am happy to build a strong center.
Preparing to castle kingside.
Preparing the develop his bishop.
Looking to dislodge the knight and bishop protecting his king.
He saw it and decided the best defense is to attack.
Would like to avoid this exchange,
Now I am in trouble.  I dont like his queen this close to my king.  I cannot push her away .
Cant allow his d pawn to move.
Be carefull. :-)  I thought long and hard about this move.  I had to think about safety and also counter attack.  I cant afford to lose another one.
Now removal of his bishop will give me more chances.
When under so much pressure I think it best to sacrifice my pieces for his attacking pieces and relieve some pressure.
He must have had the same thoughts so he backed off the exchange.
A slight mis-calculation on my part.  I was hoping to trap the rook.
I would have been happy to sacrifice my rook.  Ease some tension.  Graham keeping it tight and keeping the pressure.
I wasn't realy sure what he was doing here except from maybe trying to put more pressure on the e4 square.  He would have been down on exchanges so this didn't really make much sense to me.  Maybe he had something up his sleeve.
Double up pressure on the bishop.
Giving up a pawn to move the queen from the d file.
offer on the table.  double threat on the rook and he would come off second best.
My usual Petroff, though earlier in my career I preferred 2...Nc6 and I have also played the Marshall Gambit of the Scandinavian (1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Nf6) and even some Sicilian dragons.
The critical test of the line, but I was happy to see it. There are some alternatives: the quiet 4.d3, 4.d4 (about which I know little, I should study that) and 4.Nc3?! but that runs into the fork trick: 4...Nxe4! 5.Nxe4 d5 winning back the piece with good play for Black.
Another developing move with tempo. You can see now that the plan for Black will be to attack on the kingside and/or in the center.
?! This is a deviation from the main line. I don't think it's a good move, because Black can exchange his only weak piece (the knight on a5) for a knight which was controlling quite a lot of the central squares. In the 365chess.com database it has good stats for Black.
Although you usually don't want to exchange pieces when you're a pawn down, I thought that this move was justified because I exchange off a passive piece for an active one. Most people who had been in this position before me agreed with this assessment, this is the most played move in the position.
More common is 12...O-O but this is fine as well. The h2 pawn is not attacked yet, because after (say) 13.Nc3 Bxh2? runs into 14.g3 winning the bishop, but if White wants to castle short he has to remove the attack on the h2 pawn first.
?! this blocks the attack on the h2 pawn, but it turns out to be a bad move, since I exploit the weakness of the light squares on the kingside later on in the game. 13.h3 is preferable.
White develops, but the Black pieces are better coordinated for attack and he is ahead in development. Whitestill has to make three moves to achieve the opening goals (castling, playing the b or d pawn and then developing the c1 bishop) while Black only needs one move (a developing move of the c8 bishop). Black has a good game.
Note that 16.Qe1? is impossible due to 16...Bh3 winning the exchange, so it was either this or 16.Ne2.
As said before, this was the square I wanted to place my bishop on. It takes advantage of the weakness of the light squares around the White king.
?! Now that the rook has moved, f2 becomes weak. However, 17...Qb6 was probably a more accurate way to take advantage of that. After 18.Na4 (necessary to prevent 18...Bc5 when White cannot defend f2 anymore) I could play 18...Qd4 and then 19.c3 would weaken the d3 square and I could follow up with 19...Qd5 which would give me a strong attack on the kingside. I think this is a typical mistake for a rapid game: I was also thinking of 17...Qb6 but I was not sure which of the two was more accurate. After analyzing at home with my computer I saw 17...Qb6 was better.
? This move loses. 18.Na4 was necessary to prevent the coming attack on f2. I would probably have played 18...Bd4 and after 19.c3 you can see why 17...Qb6 was more accurate last move. In this variation I have to play 19...Bb6 after which White can gain the bishop pair with 20.Nxb6 Qxb6 or 20...axb6. Moreover, I can't take advantage of the d3 square so easily because my queen is not on the d file yet.
Probably this was the moment when my opponent realized how weak f2 was. He can't do anything to defend it except for giving up the exchange with 19.Rf1 Bxf1 20.Qxf1 (which is probably relatively best in this position).
! Obviously I couldn't take on e1 yet (probably what my opponent was hoping for?), since the queen was attacked, but with this tempo attack on the knight I win the exchange anyway.
Opening more attack lines and pinning the bishop. White is completely lost here: all his pieces are pinned, undeveloped or tied down to defence, not to mention he's an exchange down.
Wanting to force an exchange of knights so I can play ...Qd5+ with inevitable mate. Now we can see how the weakness of the light squares around White's king plays a role.
? White had to sacrifice a pawn with 24.b4 if he wanted to prolong the game, but the end result is already clear. I also had some 7 minutes left on my clock, so time was not an issue.
? A blunder in the absolute sense of the word, since it runs into a mate in three, but there was no alternative but to resign, really.
Mate on g2 is inevitable and can only be prolonged by interposing with the bishop on f3 (25...Qd5+26.Bf3 Qxf3+ 27.Kg1 Qg2#), so White resigned. I think this game shows how quickly it can go wrong for White in the Two knights. All his problems were mainly caused by one bad move, 18.d3?. I think the Two knights is a fun opening to play for Black and I enjoy to play it from time to time, especially this line. By the way, I finished on 4/7 in the rapid tournament (under 1650 section) after a 0/2 start, so I was pretty satisfied with the end result. I hope you enjoyed the annotation. As always, feel free to leave some comments.
Hi all. I have decided to annotate this game, as the end of an era for me. This is - was - the last chess game in which I ever played the Stonewall Attack as White. I know that readers may have different opinions, but I have finally become convinced of how difficult it is to crash home with this attack against an experienced player. Several bad experiences with the Stonewall Attack, both OTB and online, have caused the decision to give it up. Have a look at this game to see why.
This move characterises White's aim at playing the Stonewall Attack, although there is still the option of transposing to a Colle System with 3.Nf3. White will place his central pawns to dominate the dark squares, on d4, e3 and f4.
This tends to be the response that White is hoping for, to facilitate his kingside attack. It tends to be harder to attack if Black plays ...g6 and ...Bg7, as Black's g-pawn is then a strong buffer, and also rules out any possible Greek Gift sacrifices - although these are rare in the Stonewall. Another good option for Black is 3...Nc6! threatening both 4...e5 and 4...Nb4, either of which disrupts White's Stonewall formation.
Characterising this fully as a Stonewall Attack. White closes the centre, dominates the dark squares, and prepares for a powerful kingside attack.
Solidifying the structure, and preventing any future problems from ...Nb4. If Black tries ...cxd4, White replies exd4 and opens up the centre for his dark-squared bishop.
In hindsight, I should probably have played 6.Nb2, to prevent Black's next move - the last trick he has up his sleeve against my Stonewall formation. I would then have continued 7.Nf3.
Owch. Suddenly there is a major stumbling block to my attack. I considered 7.Nbd2, but then Black plays 7...f5! solidifying the powerful grip on the centre that his 6th move has brought him.
Instead, I played a normal developing move, bringing my king to safety, while placing the rook on the f-file, from where it can become active via f3 in a future attack.
Unfortunately for me, Black's plans to not seem to allow White to play any kind of "future attack". Black is trying to lock down on my position and cramp my centre, so that the attacking pieces...simply cannot get out. Ordinarily, ...c4 is a weak choice for Black, as it removes all his possible counterplay on the queenside. Under the circumstances, however, and accompanied with his powerful grip on the centre, it is a strong option.
In hindsight, maybe the bishop would have been better on e2. I at the time wanted to keep my bishop on the powerful c2-h7 diagonal - but, of course, Black will soon close that.
My last resort to try to shift Black's powerful knight.
Consolidating Black's powerful centre. Black is now dominating the centre and the queenside, while White's attacking pieces have barely any room to breathe. Black's backward pawn on e6 is in no way weak. The good thing for White is that Black has no way to break through and convert his positional advantage into a win - his pieces cannot get past my pawns on the queenside, while the centre is locked.
I exchange off that irritatingly powerful knight outpost on e4, and return the favour: I shove my knight on e5. Black has the slightly better position, because his dark-squared bishop is well placed, while both my bishops are banging their heads on granite. However, at this point, I felt that neither side had any tangible advantage that could bring a win.
I had been hoping that Black would allow me to try out my one trap: 12.Qh5+!, which would have won material after 12...g6 13.Nxg6 (12...Kf8?? 13.Qf7#) but then again, it was unlikely that he would miss it.
I tried to generate activity by bringing my queen out, and putting some pressure on Black's backward e-pawn. Of course, with no other White pieces able to reach it, that pawn was not going to fall.
Black goes for some exchanges, and locks the pawn-structure in the centre. I was hoping that he would try 15...Qxf4 16.exf4, in which I would have been able to hope for a breakthrough with my e- and f-pawns. I believed that my bishops would be able to control Black's passed e-pawn.
I exchanged queens, and offered a draw, which Black accepted. Objectively, Black's position is superior, with his bishops far better-placed. However, it is only a matter of time before White's bishops can scramble out of their hole onto the kingside, and in the meantime Black has no way of breaking through. So, I felt that a draw was a fair result for this game - but I will leave that to the viewers to decide! I was happy with the high-rated draw I had reached; however, the stagnant, cramped game had taught me a harsh lesson. I was no longer going to play the Stonewall.
I'm Black in this game where I mistakenly took material and ended up having to fight for a draw, but then miraculously I got lucky at the end and won.
So far both sides have castled kingside, but White has a lot more control of the center. I personally don't like putting many pawns in the center, and instead I play flexible setups that will contest the center later. Even though I don't have much space, I am more flexible and I can play to break in the center with e5 or c5.
At first glance this move seems strange and unorthodox. I couldn't really think of a better move to do. I mainly wanted to stop b4. My plan was to play for a c5 boost with b6-c5, but after b6, b4 is annoying. This stops the annoying b4, and I can follow up with b6 and c5.
I'm not sure if playing for b4 should be White's best plan, he already played Bh6, so it seems like White would want to trade bishops and think about starting a kingside pawnstorm
Now the position has turned into a variation of Sicilian Dragon where Black hasn't played Nc6, and has made a lot of odd moves. White can play b4 here, but after axb4 axb4 Na6 I can put pressure on the b-pawn, and if Black advances the b-pawn then my knight gets an outpost on c5.
White moves his bishop to a more agressive square, but I think it's better if White trades bishops and starts an attack f4-f5
This stops b4 and makes way for Rc8, and also there are ideas of putting a knight on c5.
Maybe White wants to trade bishops and play f4-e5 gaining space in the center.
Since I blocked my rook's path, White decides the pawn isn't needed to defend the bishop anymore, and plays the b4 advance, but like I mentioned before, I can put pressure on the b-pawn and play Nc5 if White ever plays b5
White has given my knight the c5-square, but he can remove my other knight with Bxg7 and f4. My knights aren't really dangerous, so I need to find some kind of play quick before White generates some activity.
White delayed trading dark bishops for too long, so now I can gain some tempo
Here I get two minor pieces for a rook, which can be a crushing advantage in a lot of positions, but White's rooks get active and my minor pieces take awhile to coordinate, so White was able to get a lot of play and almost won.
I decided to play the riskier variation where I threaten to play Ng4, but it is too greedy to grab more material and stall the coordination of my minor pieces.
This move shocked me I thought Rf1 was probably the best move. Here I should just play Bxf2 and have a comfortable advantage of two minor pieces and a pawn for a rook, but I played to win more material which gave White some tempo
The most I can get out of this is an exchange,
because of my greediness, White gets this tempo move in and my material advantage drops. This caused me to make a horrible move and give White winning chances, in what should've been an easy win for me.
White can afford to sacrifice the exchange because of the very strong passed pawn. After the trade, White's queen on a7 can go to c8 and White will promote.
My best bet is to get my king off the back rank so that I can play Qa6  if White plays Qb8, and manage a draw by perpetual check. I also thought about saving my minor pieces and going into an ending where I have two minors and three pawns (9 points) vs. a queen (9 points) but the queen will just dominate on the open board and win some pawns.
White removes my attacker of the g1-a7 diagonal so now White can probably escape the perpetual. My best chance to draw is to take a pawn to clear more space for my queen to find checks.
Qxe4 is more risky because it gives White's king more space to roam and a better chance of escaping the checks. It doesn't matter how many pawns I win, because White is going to queen if I stop checking, and none of my pawns are close to promoting. White declined the draw, and just when I thought there was no possible way I could win this, he made a horrible blunder that loses the game immediately.
This is the only way to stop the mating threat, and after the queen trade, I have an easy win because of my advantage in pawns.
Probably more accurate to push the passed pawn immediately, but that doesn't really matter in an easily winning position
taking space. I did at one time envision the dark-squared bishop going to b2.
If you were thinking of castling, the Queen is already protecting the bishop.  But the bishop move does add more defense to Pe5.
Im playing as white and i open with my Queens Pawn. He decides to open with the queens defense. As you can see by my games I am a very aggresive player even when playing the queens gambit. I am happy with where I am right now.
Were now playing a standard knights game and im just going to wait for my opponent to make a mistake. He is a good player and i never underestimate my opponents.
This is where I take control of the game. I know that he has his light sqaured bishop pinning down my knight and i also realize that he will want to put an extra defender on the e5 pawn, so i decide to pin his knight to his king.
He now decides to put more protection on his e5 pawn.
His only option is capture bishop. Had he not captured and moved king i would check with bishop to g5 the he would bring pawn to f6 and then i would be bring C line knight to d5 Check Mate!
But hes not an idiot and we exchange off pieces
I decided to exchange pieces
15 moves later i stopped his pawn from advancing and now im basically going to try and exchange rooks for the next few moves.
Tried to take pawn on g7
White has two pawns and a rook for the bishop and knight. Black retakes with the knight - it can now reach the inviting d4 square via e6.
Black chooses not to swap knight for bishop, and instead continues with development.
Black is not worried about the pinned knight on f6.
White decides to swap knights on d4, and can now play c3.
White decides against snatching the pawn on d6 - black has a potentially nasty discovered attack on f2 when he moves the knight.
Black is down material and doesn't want to swap queens.
White wants to deprive Black of the bishop pair, so decides to swap dark-square bishops.
Black keeps the centre closed at the cost of cutting off his bishop's queenside activity -  in any case the bishop will be stuck blockading the passed e-pawn.
Black's knight obtains an outpost on f4.
Black must get on with his attack.
An advantage of the queen on g5 is that the rook is not tied to maintaining the knight outpost. Now the pawn on g4 looks wobbily.
White doubles up on the g-file, putting more pressure on the pinned bishop.
h3 falls, but at the cost of allowing white to exchange queens.
After the queens are off, white will hope to bring home one of the passed pawns.
Qe7 would have added potency to Re1. Besides, I get to form a battery with my next move.
Fritz says White is won here, regardless of what I play. I did not take with the B because I wanted to keep the N out of f5 and d5, and I thought I would need to B on c6.
This was the plan. Now the K protects the Q in the event of a big tradeoff. Yes, I know it's a big risk.
One quick victory after my opponent get greedy. I gave him a bishop to remove his defense and then he started taking my pawns.
Now pawn on b7 was attacked with rook on a8 vulnerable
White develops with tempo. Black will move to the a-file setting up a future pin on whites King.
Grabbing the center. Mental note: "Must have plan to defend it later..." <n><n>(Which failed... you will see soon.)
Creating a retreat option for the Queen expecting white to set up a discovered attack with Bd2...
Three developed pieces. White wants to castle quick and open up the board.
Developing the Bishop and setting up a pin.
White develops preparing to castle instead of threatening the Bishop with h3. I am calculating to loose the pawn on d4 with BxN BxB QxP. But I see that as a gambit as I will have all my pieces developed compared the blacks single Queen, and I will own the two Bishops in an open game.
And the Queen eats the pawn and black is a pawn up...
Castle or attack? Attack of course! If black accepts trade of queens, white will have a rook on d-file.
Opening up for black Bishop and grabbing a piece of the center.
Castled and fully developed. Now white have to figure out how to exploit the lead in development.
Developing Knight and black is one move closer to castle.
Preparing to double up on the d-file.
Develops black Bishop to a defensive position and black is now ready to castle.
Attacking the defender of the Knight on d7 (i.e. if white takes Nf6, the other black Knight is free lunch for the Rook). The text will create a pin on the Knight on f6 when black castles.
Black castles and is nicely tucked in behind his pawns and has defendable position. The text enhances the pin on the Knight at f6.<n><n>(This is the position where white has a winning combination... Can you see it? I didn't...  Scroll down for a small hint.<n><n>Hint: One black piece is attacked twice but only defended once...)
Bring another attacker in. Attacking the pinned piece.<n><n>(My good friend ChessMaster 10th Edition ;-) helped me with this winning combination: RxN, NxR, BxB. Now Nd7 is attacked by Rd1 and Rf8 is attacked by Be7. Black Rook can't move to defend the Knight so black has to give up either Knight for nothing or Rook for Bishop.)
Black wants to simplify...
White doesn't. (The threat to take is often more effective than the execution.) White is opting to keep the tension up.
Black challenges the d-file and brings in another defender for the Knight on d7. Analysis: White own more space. Black has a solid defense. How can white improve the position or attack? <n>Plan: I'll try to create an outpost on d6 for my Knight. Grabbing space at the same time...
Space grabbing... with the target square of c5. Where the pawn will park and give support for a Knight outpost on d6.<n><n>(This is where white looses the initiative and lets black run the game...)
Space grabbing with threat. It also breaks the pin on f6. Bravo! But it also opens up the kings defense...
Retreating, giving black the initiative... White did have the choice to trade a Bishop or Knight for two pawns, but didn't think it was a good trade. I expect another space grabbing pawn stab: g4.
But the pawn stab didn't come. That would have weakened the defense to much. Instead black opens up for some reduction in material and attacks the undefended pawn at c4. How can I exploit the fact that Be4 looks overworked? (I.e. it's pinned to the defense of both Nf6 and Rd8.)<n><n>(Blacks bishop is in fact not overworked, as the two guarded pieces are on the same diagonal)
White takes the Knight, but sees a pawn storm on the king side. Black can play d5! before or after trading rooks.<n><n>(This is the position where black misses a winning combination.<n><n>Scroll down for a hint...<n>Hint 1: Whites black Bishop is almost trapped. How can you get to it? You need two moves, and the first needs to be forcing. Scroll down for another hint<n>Hint 2: Push a pawn...)
Black simplifies still with one pawn up.<n><n>("ChessMaster recommends d5" (you know how it sounds ;-) threatening white Bishop and when the Bishop retreats. d6 and the black Bishop is trapped... I saw the threatening d5, but didn't stop to calculate the effects as can be seen on my previous note.)
Black wants to simplify even more.
White needs to activate the King very soon and start trading down pawns so that the two Bishops get room to maneuver.<n><n>(White is complying to blacks plan to reduce material while being a pawn up)
Analysis: White has two Bishops, black is on an active diagonal h2-b8, white on b1-h7. Black has a black Bishop and a Knight, has some space advantage and is one pawn up. <n>Plan: Activate the King and clear some space (i.e. remove some pawns) to be able to utilize the Bishop pair more effectively?
Open up for the King and offer a trade of pawns.<n><n>([?] The text turns out to be a blunder and the loosing move.)
White has to comply. The other options are not any better. White hopes to get a more active king than black.
Centralizing the king
Moving the Knight to an active position and stopping the white king from entering the queen side.
Centralizing the King.
Forcing my King even further away from the center but it can support my queen side attack.
Retakes the pawn and the King is way off from the passed black pawns...
A terrible mistake. The crucial h2-b8 diagonal becomes under heavy, undefendable fire now, because of the lack of pawns and pieces (dark bishop sitting on b2, remember that?) around it!
Nothing wrong, but I expected d4. @slywing the realms of the sicilian defense are huge, and Bc4 is a extreemely common move in many open and closed sicilians. the move e6, in many cases, can be broken down by some pawn thrusts, or with a piece sac. Also, e6 restricts piece mobility, with the light bishop. If white wants to , he can go into a open siclian, and the d6 pawn will be left weak and unable to advance in many cases.
It would be wrong to label this move as just 'bad', but I would never play it because it just wastes time.@slywing but this is not nearly enough to lose a game, even at the grandmasters level. White could probably get a edge in a masters game. I would like to see some of the strongest players on this site get a real advantage from this small move agianst good play. It is not too critical.
Supporting the pawn. White's other option was Nc3, where the move d4 could be played quickly. Would anyone consider advancing or sacrificing the pawn with a move like 0-0?@slywing yes, I would probably choose Nc3 personally, and head for an open position. The knight is probably going there anyways if d4 is played. However, if white intended a closed game, which I would prefer not to go to, then d3 is fine. The knight ma head to d2 anytime, or c3.
This square is not optimal for the bishop. The bishop neither looks good nor has an active role at this square. White was probably unsure about where to put the bishop. If he wanted to, he could have pllayed Nc3, and waited for 'signs' of where to put the bishop.
The advance is awkward, resembling a BOT setup. However, here it is not as good as if the white dark square bishop were fianchettoed. Now the d5 square is a target, and black has no outposts or weak squares to target himself.
Nc3 was better. My strong point in chess are tactics and attack strategy, but closed positions and manuevering give me headaches. this move a3 might have been intended to play b4, getting a little open play and potentially activating the rook. a simple a5 would stop it. All together, b4 idea is not very hopeful.
The first real mistake of the game. Black was doing fine up til now. This is the kind of move to play in general when the position is open, you have a majority of your forces at the kingside, and they are all at their optimal positions. Preferably, the opponent has very few pieces for defense. It can rarely even be played to just gain an initiative. In those positions, this move often gains a decisive ad, even when no tactical finishes are found, these moves force a win. Instead, in closed positions, with no force to back up the sacrifice, and no way to take the initiative, this is the kind of move weak players make, in attempt to 'open the king'. What they are doing is really 'losing a piece'. As the game continues, white's advantage gets bigger. Black probably could have just castled and had a good game. Be6 is even considerable. Anything but this.
Black tries to justify his previous mistake with another attacking move. This weakens his kingside more than it does to white, and he only has 3 pieces out, when none of them can make any immediate action.
Outposts are not only for knights. The bishop is powerful here, and hits f7.
Now white plays a good move to hold the pawn. Is the c pawn weak? Probably not. If black concentrates his force on the c pawn, he will be invaded on the light squares. 14...Rc8 15.Qf3(h5) Rxc2 16.Qxf7+ Kd8 17.Ra2 and white will mop up the K side pawns after dealing with some minor nuisances on the Q side. This is just one line. 15.Bc4 is already good enough, with Qh5 coming up.
Black knows he is losing. He has given up on his 'attack' and starts to move on the Q side. It fails.
white invades. Qf3 worked as well. The goal is not really to checkmate right now, but to sweep up the loose pawns and cause difficult threats. Trading pieces into a won endgame is easy.
White can now activate his dark squared bishop now with 16.f4 gxf4 17.B/Rxf4. This is just as good, preping Rg1 with h4, penetrating the black position.
????The true meaning of a blunder! White plays carelessly, not wanting to repeat the position. However, the side effects of the cure are worse than the disease after black's next move. White assumed that Black merely wanted to repeat positions. What he failed tp notice was that Qd7 carried the dealy threat of Qxh3 checkmate! The Qh5 was the only thing preventing that.
Sure enough, black plays the checkmate and lets out a sigh of relief while white tears his hair in frustration. White had a massive positional and material ad, while black was completely lost. <n>Going back a few moves, white could have proceeded with Kh2 to safety the pawn and then continue with Qh5 back. Black's position is devoid of plan. The lesson is, whenever you make a move, always check IS IT SAFE TACTCIALLY? <n>The vast majority of players under 1500 USCF/ 1400FIDE rating do not consistently check for tactics, and if the position is tactical, they just might blunder the game in one move. If you are like that, then checking for tactics every move will bring you up a lot. REal positional chess matters little until you are an expert. If someone had the tactical skill of a world champion, but the positional knowledge of a weak club player, they could make it to top 1000 in the nation, probably much better. Once I did this, my rating went up a few hundred points in a few weeks.
?<n>The knight is too far forward to receive enough support to compensate for the attacks that can be brought to bear on it.
White cannot back down now as the knight is pinned to the bishop and the bishop is undefended.
Trying to build a discovered attack on the black queen.
Unwise as the pawn can be advanced to force the knight to move, or perhaps black is hoping for that to allow the diagonal containing to white king to become more open.
The f pawn will now become very difficult to defend.

A pin on the f6 knight...
and now Keller accepts the gambit pawn - but it seems risky when played against Tal! :P Accepting the gambit pawn in the Queen's Gambit will most often lead to White getting a significant spatial advantage over Black, and White gets more opportunities for an attack. Add Tal's sacrificial nature to that and Black has reason to be afraid. Very, very afraid...
The natural follow-up - Tal grabs the lion's share of the centre while discovering an attack on the c4 pawn.
?! From what I've heard, trying to hold on to the gambitted pawn is generally considered inferior in Queen's Gambit Accepted lines, so it's interesting to see a strong player like Keller try it... but then again, those b and c pawns do have their say later on
Pressurising the b5 pawn, but Keller need not worry about that due to his fourth move. Tal threatens to get back his pawn...
Well, it doesn't look like Keller can castle kingside or queenside because of his pawn structure... which will, in turn, make his king more of a target. Given who he's playing against, Keller needs to tread very lightly at this point...
!? Tal wants to open up the game, or at least the d-file, with this move. However...
...Keller has this resource. By driving the knight away from the protection of the d5 square, Keller can now win an additional pawn. In addition, he will be able to create a formidable queenside pawn structure after exd5 [though perhaps Bxd5 might be preferred to prevent the opening of the e-file... reader comments are welcome :)]
and now Tal moves the knight away...
Nope - you all knew this was coming! :) Tal is more interested in the initiative than he is material, so he hangs his own knight out to dry in order to gain a successful attack on Keller's king.
! The pawn on e6 is the focal point right now, and this move indirectly prevents the e6 pawn from being captured. If 15...fxe6? 16.Bh5+ Ke7 [else Nb5+ wins] 17.Nxe6! [...Kxe6 18.Re1+ Kf5 19.Qg4#, so Black will have to interpose with the queen] with 18.Re1 coming up, and there's crazy pressure on the Black position. There are other variants [17.Nf5+ or 17.Re1] but I can't see any success with these two lines
Ignoring the e6 pawn, Keller creates a mating threat of his own - Qxg2#
! However, this allows this intermediate check from White, and the king is forced to move - interposing with a piece won't work; 16...Bc6?? 17.exf7+! Kxf7 18.Qxc4+ and Tal wins the rook on g8, as Kg7?? is met by the simple fork Ne6+!
The reason for not taking the e6 pawn should be more obvious now at this point [Nxe6+]
The only way that Tal can prevent checkmate, and Keller is allowed a tempo to so something about the pressure on his position
! Both a defensive and offensive move; defensive in that the bishop blocks the open diagonal, which Tal's rooks will be itching to exploit, and offensive in that it attacks the e6 pawn
! A natural move in Tal's position, fortunately, preserves the e6 pawn once again - should the bishop ever capture it, then the double check that results from the knight recapture still loses the queen
Keller is quick to get his king off the open file as soon as possible... but how about cxb2? The end result is similar to what transpires in the game - 18...cxb2 19.Rab1 Kc8 20.Rxb2 - but Keller keeps the extra pawn... but would the threat of doubling up on the b-file not be worth it? Perhaps Keller thought about that possibility, or perhaps he was much more concerned about his king... but this was what made Tal's play so formidable. Quite a few of his sacrifices were, in fact, unsound, but for his opponent, it would become extremely hard to find the correct refutation, especially under tournament conditions.
As it was, Tal opens the b-file under his own terms by capturing the c3 pawn
Was the e6 pawn still poison? Keller has big enough back rank concerns to make it so; 19...fxe6 20.Nxe6! Bxe6 21.Bf3!! and the huge threat of Qe8+ [with mate coming soon] means that Keller has to drop the rook. Material is equalised, but Tal's space advantage would be the deciding factor. As far as development is concerned however, Keller is catching up fast, and the e6 pawn is once again on death row!
The fact that this pawn has survived for this long is remarkable, and the reason why it can't be taken now is... well, I don't know. I can't even find the move after the capturing of the pawn; the game continuation [Bg4+] doesn't work, because from what I can see, it can be safely taken. I can't see how Tal can get an advantage out of the pawn capture - and that's just for the bishop capture! It's all over my head!
Either Keller missed the best move here [taking the pawn] or Tal had a threat that he was extremely concerned about [it must have something to do with the long light-squared diagonal, judging from this move, or he was simply looking to trade down]
! While this leaves the bishop en prise, it cannot be taken - take the bishop and put up with a promoted queen? No thanks!
Although the king is forced to move right onto the open file, he has sufficient protection to be okay for the moment - he has the a7 square to hide, and there doesn't seem to be any breakthrough possible. Furthermore, the g4 bishop is still hanging, and these are two factors that can help Keller wrest the initiative from Tal, and if he can do that then his material advantage should be sufficient for the win. That is assuming that Tal played Rab1+...
!!? But what about this move? It's incredible - Tal's bishop is already hanging, and now Tal nonchalantly throws in his knight as well, while at the same time opening up an attack on the queen and bishop. Taking the knight in this position gives back the pawn - 22...axb5 23.Qxb5+, and Tal captures a bishop next move - he has free choice between the bishop on c5 and d5.
! ...so Keller interposes with the bishop. This is a strong move that doesn't give Tal the chance to save both of his pieces, as the queen now protects the c5 bishop and of course the rook is still attacking the g4 bishop. When down in material, having to drop another piece isn't good...
...if you don't have a quick attack on the enemy king - Tal is not willing to give up just yet! Once again the knight is immune, this time because the king gets mated very quickly [24...axb5?? 25.Qxb5+ Kc7 26.Qb7+ Kd6 27.Qd7#]
Huh?!?! Tal doesn't seem to know the meaning of 'material' in chess, does he? Actually, Tal has just destroyed the one defender of the c6 knight, and will have plans to be regaining the material that he has just sacrificed...
?? The wrong recapture for Keller! The alternate capture with the rook leads to this crazy line; 25...Rxe4! 26. Nd4+ Nb4 27. Qd7+! Qc7 28. Rxb4+! Bxb4 29. Qd5+! Kb8 30. Qxe4 Bxe7 31. Nc6+ Kb7 32. Nxe7+ Ka7 33. Nc6+ Kb7 34. Nb4+ Kb8 35. Qxh7 [this is not my analysis, by the way - another user on chessgames.com, where I found this game, had displayed this line.] From this line, I cannot tell who has chances of winning - perhaps it's a draw? With the move played in-game, Keller thinks that this move, which attacks b1 and defends c6, is strong... [the fen notation of the final position in the analysis above can be found in the comments]
Keller resigns; after the bishop moves, Tal can capture the pawn on c4, and will soon be able to capture another pawn queenside thanks to the mobility of his queen. It is these types of games that made Tal so famous; with a total disregard for material, he would constantly be on the attack, and his opponents found it extremely difficult to counter all of his threats - great stuff! Thanks for reading!
Black attacks at the edge of the pawn chain.
Black has a light advantage. The king castle is solid, the rook can get the b file with 9. ... Rb8 and the Queen can look into the white Kings's castle by 10. ... Qb6
Black prepares an attack on the white King's wing.
The black pawn h3 will be decisive. It reaches far into the white space and is close to the white King.
Both white and black play a balanced game. The pawn structure gives the bishops and the queens much power on the diagonals.
White is more and more in a bad situation. The pawn center is destroyed and the black d pawn can break through.
Black starts an exchange sequence, winning a pawn by a discovered attack on the queen.
Black has a lone pawn at the c file and will try everything to get through to c1.
The King appeared in the center. Can white force black to lose the b pawn?
Black is now turning the game and can force White to defend at the h file, while the a pawn is marching, supported by the black King.
White has defended the h file successfully, but for what a price. The black King and knight are bothcloser to the a file than White. A fierce fight begins. Black can check.
Now black has two pawns more. The last phase of the fight begins.
By taking the knight, the white king is one step too far away from the last black pawn and black wins.
to many pawn moves
at this moment i saw the discover attack and was kicking myself for not seeing it
An unusual response to the Ruy Lopez. It opens the knight to be pinned, but provides some support to e5. My personal opinion is that it is weak for Black.
I grab at the centre with d4 and he exchanges pawns. I really wasn't sure which piece to take with here - I chose to leave my knight where it is and develop my queen.
Rather expected - protects his knight but also releases the pin to attack my queen in the centre of the board.
I thought he might take with the bishop after developing it to d7. I really didn't expect my opponent to double his pawns after our previous game, which involved a lot of exchanges and was quickly at a knight and pawn ending. GK analysis pits this as 'Inaccuracy'.
Standard development of the knights followed by a castle - I do think I probably should have played 10. Bg5 here though. I think the reason I didn't was not to give him a reason to play Be7 yet.
Doesn't appear to be any immediate threat to the queen on d3, it keeps the DSB diagonal open and it is more actively placed than d1. The rooks will also connect once that bishop moves...
Developing the bishop and preparing to castle, one would assume - I thought he'd attack the half-open b-file first.
I'm not sure if 10... Ng4 is more favourable for Black? In fact, looking back now it seems as if 10. e5 might have been a mistake. Anyway, Black has let my knight move in to a centre square.
White moves his attacked bishop, I presumed to save his bishop pair and make use of them later. However, he gave up a very attack square for my knight on c6.
Making use of c6 to fork the rook, bishop and pawn.
I've forced the Black rook back into the corner in it's attempt to save a pawn (and the knight-rook exchange).
I saw Nb5 and it looked good until I saw the line 14. Nb5 Bc4 15. Nxc7+ Kd7 16. Nxa8 Bxf1 17. Kxf1 Kxc6... with me losing my other knight shortly after. If there is a better alternative, I'd like to hear it. So instead I decide to rid my opponent of his bishop pair, as I'm sure he was trying to keep them and they can be very dangerous!
Pinning the knight but also prevents the king from moving unless Black would like another set of doubled pawns. Here, even though the material is even, I believe I am in a very strong position. Oh, how quickly that changed...
Threatening to use both pins with a very subtle 18. Nd5+ and winning a pawn in the ensuing exchange.
Challenging the open d-file - I wanted to keep my rook on a1 (to threaten an attack on a7) but couldn't really give over control of this file, I didn't think.
Threatening to win a pawn from Black and forcing him to whittle it down to a Rook and pawn ending, while developing my rook actively.
I'm not in the business of being caught by those checkmates anymore! And 24... Re2 is countered by Rc5. I chose f3 over Kf1 because it gives my king squares to move to (f2-g3, if need be) and Re2 isn't a threat with either move.
Attacking the a-pawn and forcing c6 from Black.
Now I'm forcing Black to tie up his rook in defending and releasing his grip on the e-file.
Releasing the pin on the c-pawn and coming across to defend the pawn.... or so I think.
I wasn't sure about this move, but I suppose it releases the rook from the c-file. But it means my rook looks over the 6th rank...
... which I immediately force him onto. As with our other annotated game, I've managed to force an advantage in the endgame that has given me an advantage. This time, I've forced his black king away from the action and have got my king very active itself. I must concede though, it is still very much heading for a draw at the minute.
I 'settled' on this move here - I really couldn't decide what my best move was and lumped with this to try and make it tough for Black's king to get out of the corner. Maybe Kd3 was a slightly better alternative?
I didn't think taking it and allowing the rook in behind was a great idea... it would definitely yield a draw then.
It was a complete oversight that I allowed Black to attack me and threaten d3 - I was so busy trying to think how I was going to attack Black and try to promote a pawn. Upon analysis, it is quickly obvious that Black is giving up a passed pawn to White for several of his pawns.
I decide to use this check now. If Black intends to come down to d3 with his rook, then the king cannot go to f7 as it would give up a tempo with Rxa7+ later.
A pawn each, but I can't stop there - my rook and king are both active, so I give up my king-side pawns to get that b-pawn further up the board.
The first and only move highlighted by GK's computer as yellow - an inaccuracy. An instant 39. b5 Rxg4 40. b6 Rxf4+ 41. Kc3 Rf5 42. b7 Rb5 43. Kxc4 Rb1, means I save the h-pawn. However, the line given seems to whittle to a perpetual check draw (as White cannot defend the pawn and avoid the check). I'm not saying my way was correct because it should have played to a draw, but I certainly believe my line forces the rook to exchange for the passed pawn, leaving the rook to do battle with the three pawns.
Again, it doesn't look great but there was reasoning (it could be bad reasoning!!). The king has to move up later to defend the pawn which makes Kc5 more attractive. Once the Black rook gets rid of my h-pawn, I can move the king up and force the Rook around via h1 or h2. Then I plan to bring my rook down to the 4th rank as defense to both the rook and the later advancing pawns. It is also worth noting that I think I incorrectly analysed that following Kc5, the rook could take the pawn and travel via e5-e8-b8 to stop the pawn - obviously it cannot.
Stopping Rb5 and forcing it around the board to defend the threat.
I want my rook here for later - I feel it restrains Black's later charge with those three pawns as he cannot push one of his pawns then look to catch-up to it... Black will need his king.
45... Rb1+ is clearly a blunder due to 46. Rb4 and the Black rook can no longer stop the pawn from queening.
Black's rook has made it to the square it wants and it is now up to my king to catch up to it before it can come back to prevent this mass run of pawns.
Okay, so here it is. Three pawns and a king vs a rook and a king. Who wins? I'm a fairly nervous at this point; I don't know if three pawns can push past a rook but I'm confident if I can get my king back to the action that I can at least force a draw. Worse case scenario, I'm going to sacrifice my rook for the f and g-pawns knowing that with two kings and a rook pawn in the corner... it is only likely to be a draw.
This is the first mistake from my opponent in the endgame. I have to commend my opponent as by saving his f-pawn, he is clearly showing that he is trying to win the game. However, it is in vain and 54. h4 would have given him an easy draw.
The king is now forced onto the 4th rank to protect it's pawns, and allows my king into e2.
From this position, I am very confident I will get a draw minimum. Black's pawns are lined up, his king placed in front of them and my king has arrived on the scene.
Another mistake - I knew here that I was winning a pawn... and without giving Black the compensation of time to threaten with pawn pushes.
Black's options - 1) 57... Kh3 58. Rxg5, the f-pawn is easily targeted and White can mop up the h-pawn easily enough. 2) 57... Kh4 58. Kf3 g4+ 59. Kxf4 g3 60. Kf3 g2 61. Kxg2 or 60... Kh3 61. Rxh5#. 3) 57... f3, I didn't analyse this much at the time, but the f-pawn is lost to either Ra4+ or Ra3 (alternatively, Rb5 wastes a tempo and forces to Black to move a pawn). I'd like to think I could take the two pawns apart with my rook though. The last possible move is 57... h4, which my opponent plays.
My opponent resigned here... it was an interesting game that I don't feel I played great in, but I enjoyed playing the endgame... it was only two errors in judgment of position, that led to Black trying to force a win that helped me to get the win in this game. I hope you all enjoy analysing another game with an interesting endgame and I look forward to your comments.
This allows the move Nd4, and better would have been Nf3 followed by developing the bishop to e2 and castling.
Misses the threat to the bishop. Bd3 was necessary.
As I said before black was hoping for f6, but I've mentioned how to parry the threat.
Black is clearly better after sidestepping the tactic. I must point out that it demonstrated excellent tactical vision to have seen that tactic which was a whole 6 moves deep. Just to show how it could have turned out, heres a pretty line(from move 11); f6,exf6 gxf6,Rxg6! fxg5,Rg7  Kf8,Qf7 and checkmate.
Beginning to free the bishop by dismantling the white pawn centre.
Now compare the Bishop from move 18 with the bishop now.This goes to show that you should always try to improve the position of your pieces. The fact that the bishop will enter the game was enough of a reason for white to resign. Black will place the bishop on f5, begin pushing the centre pawns and back them up with the rook. White will not be able to stop the pawns.
I gain a tempo on blacks queen.. The queen might end up trapped if black isn't careful
? Black needs to develop his other pieces instead of making cheap threats that could be easily parried. I considered playing 6. e5 Qxg2 7. Rg1 and white would lose a piece as he won't be able to save both knight and queen
The only square for the queen. Qg6 runs into e5 where I win the knight
Now I can get in c3
Oh dear, white's king must be sweaty right now, I have no option but to give up my queen in other to avoid mate on h1
Retreating with tempo and covering the g4 square
With this move I set a trap. If Bxd6 then I play Bg4+ capturing the black queen
Blacks h-pawn might become dangerous if not watched carefully. Note that Bxg7 leads to Rg8 where I will lose the bishop due to the pin
Now the pawn on g7 is safe to capture
? This wasn't a good way to protect the g7 pawn. Nf6 was probably best as it gets a piece closer to my weak king
! Now black must give up his queen to prevent mate on g6 but instead, the black queen goes pawn hunting
In the Be2 the more aggressive move for black is e5.
Preparing to attack the kingside with pawns.
This move prevents blacks knight forking the bishop and rook by moving to g3.
Protecting the strong central knight but closing off the light squared bishop. However white seems to have no piece that matches the knight.
Threatening to take the knight.
The knight retreats since Bxe4 wins the knight for nothing. Bxe4 dxe4 Rxd8 Ra8(Rf8)xd8 black would then lose the queen for a rook.
Continuing to attack on the kingside with pawns. Perhaps Qg3 would be a better move. Maybe even Qd2 in order to move the dark squared bishop to h6 to aid in the attack.
Unpinning the knight from the king.
Strengthening the bishops outpost. But the bishop would be better placed elsewhere.
The knight no longer on the edge of the board finally has something to attack. My pieces are now a bit more coordinated towards a kingside attack.
I chose this pawn since I didn't want to give black the a-file to achieve checkmate at some point.
Attempting to trick black into capturing the bishop. I really should have played Nxd3. I thought I could get away with letting black take the a-pawn. <n><n>If black captured the bishop 26. Bg6 fxg6 27.Nxe6 Qf6 28. Nfxg5 hxg5 29.Nxf8 Qxf8 30. hxg6. I end up 2 pawns ahead.<n>I also get the h-file for my queen and rooks. But this was just wishful thinking.
Instead of the bishop retreat I should have played Nxg5. If black then played hxg5 then I would play h6.
Advancing the pawn to open blacks kingside.
Big blunder now black forks me and I lose my knight. The better move was hxg7 threatening checkmate.<n><n>32.hxg7 gxf3 33.Rh7+ Kxg7 34.Rh7+ Kg8 35.Qg1+ followed by mate two moves later.<n><n>Black is more likely to reply 32...Bxg7 however. After Qh4 threatening mate again and black replying Re8 to give his king space to retreat white can find a place for the knight.
Black is on the counter attack and will soon win the game.
The fork only works to blacks advantage. Nb3 was probably better. Black may have the fork Bf3 but this doesn't increase his material lead.
Started annotating this around move 25.<n>Started out trying to play the Stonewall Dutch against the d4 opening<n>Never got to play a standard Stonewall <n>Has been an interesting game - some blunders on my part.
want to trade off that White Knight on e5
was planning Ne4 at some point anyway
some protection for the N
didnot expect White to trade a bishop for a knight,  If I was playing white and wanted to chase the knight, would have considered b4.  bxc5 gives me connected pawns in the center
White Qg3 -This is a problem - will be hard to castle kingside and queenside is not appealing
Really in trouble now - about to try a hail mary - will trade the remaining rook for a shot at checkmate - Bb7 Qxh8, Qxe4  followed by Qh1# .  If he sees it and does Kf1, will get the rook back
back to -2 - could be a wild game<n>Think I have a shot if I keep up a series of checks with the Queen and the Bishops<n>Have to be careful to avoid another blunder<n>I anticipate Kd3 so that the Rook will defend the b pawn.  Response would be Qd1+
got to keep checking - could lose the black square bishop otherwise
get the black square bishop involved - however will lose it as soon as I don't check.  Think I can win both the rook and the bishop for the black square bishop
Kc2 will cause problems for me long term - still think I can win - have to avoid taking the Rook since it is guarded by the bishop - will have to take the bishp first<n><n>if Kc2, I will lose the ability to continue the checks at some point - one sceanrio even had black being checkmated - Kc2  Qc1, Kb3 Qd1, Ka3  now what - Bc6 threating mate with Qa4.  That would allow White  Qxg7+ with Q attack on g5
Will give up the Black square bishop for a shot at checkmate
I usually like this because it gives me (black) the option to open up a hole in white's line.
Which I exercise immediately.  Obviously, white can respond with cxd4 to balance out the trade or place the queen in the middle of the board.  Some like this for white, but I think it can be a weakness as it gives black a big target and an opportunity to chase the queen and develop at the same time.
If white elected to capture, my responses would have been ...<n>10.	exd5 	Nxd5<n>11.	Nxd5 	Qxd5<n>12.	Bh6 	Bxh6<n>13.	Qxh6 	Nxd4<n>14.	Nxd4 	Qxd4
White doesn't like the look things and sets up the possibility of a bishop-knight trade, one way or the other.
Black opts to trade.
Na5 might have been interesting, but I think white was probably looking to force the Nc6 to act.
Black is even happier.  Stacked bishop and queen on f2.  Trouble for white.
On the one hand, this puts pressure on the king and sets up some late-game possibilities (which, in this game, actually worked), but I wonder if this was too rash of a response to the impending black attack.  Qe2 would have been sufficient.
White appears to be eying a quick mate if he can get his knight into position.  Black eventually forgets about this knight to his own detriment.
Building pressure in the middle of the board.
An interesting sacrifice.  White seeks to pressure the king.
Obviously, I need to defend against the possibility of Qf8  .
Now, black's in a world of hurt with triple pressure on f8.
Keeping the pressure on.
Moving to the center.
My note to myself at this point:  "---DO NOT LINE UP KING AND ROOK---."  Black is desperate.
Trying to get over to the right side of the board to help stop pawn promotion.
Not much to be gained here, but it's an attempt to move things around.
Why not get the king over to the a file?
Black makes succinct moves to isolate the pawn.
Forking the king and rook.
I like a ! for this move. Sure, it threatens the obvious capture on a6, but white would have gotten that pawn eventually. It also gives up the pawn on c2. The trade seems to favor black (trading a supported white pawn for an isolated black pawn). But the threat on a6 is only the obvious threat.
A nice little sacrifice. White attacked the bishop twice, but it was defended twice. While the black queen stood at g6, she defended e8, and this sacrifice would have failed. But she went gallivanting off to the far side of the board, and now e8 is weak, and the sacrifice works.
A loss of tempo, but it is true that g5 can eventually become a target.
Taking space inmediately. I have to attack the kingside. That's the plan in this opening.
...and this knight is not easy to remove, since after f6, Qh5+. Instead,after...
Not with the bishop, that can be easily harassed with f6 (Qh5+ is not so dangerous, now, without the white knight), or simply allows black to develop Nf6, then Nc6 will kick or exchange the bishop.
Not Qf7+, that just leads to queen's exchange. I am looking to activate the lsb in h3.
...and here, the obvious QxQ, then the bishop can be saved... leads to a good but boring game.
Black should have tried to exchange the queens with Qh5, but white has g4. Interesting to look deeper.
Against logic, but I have to act quickly if I want to get something for my bishop. The uneasy black king position must help me and should make possible this "unwise" opening of the queenside.
Black defends.
Ok, now, who will take advantage of the white squares? Black... if white allows him to.
I threaten Nxc4, since the d5 pawn is pinned to the rook.
I must defend e5, period.
!???. I am threatening again Nxc4. I have just a tempo before the black queen gets to my king, but doing otherwise would have meant not to connect the rooks (remember that my bishop is pinned, unless he goes to g2).
Catching up in developement, but allowing me to complete my plan. Kc7 was needed.
If black covers with a knight, Qb7+... look scary.
Now, not Qc5+ (Qc6!), but use the tempo to bring the reinforces...
I liked it. If RxR, Ba6+ will recover the rook (the least). This is the nice moment I wanted to save. Sadly, my opponent went for that line. But what else? If Nc4, BxN seems deadly. After dxB, white surely wins.
Trying to distract my rook from the king's column, but it gives me another very nice one...
...that now black has to control. But I have to control black's Nd3+, since it is not possible for me to take it with the bishop because of the hanging queen, so I can't enjoy the pin coverage anymore.
I recover the piece and I win the game. Note the knight can't check me.
Black is trying hard to catch up with development now.
I hope you plan to castle Queenside, because moving your rook means you can't castle Kingside now. I know that too now, which makes it easier to plan attacks on the Queenside.
Keepin' up the heat.
His pieces are still very far away. Time to set up my attack. Here not only do I defend the Bishop but I move my Rook in line with the King.
I'm sure he's trying to set up some kind of attack.
Sexcellent. I hope it captures the rook, it leads to a forced mate.
The choice between the queen and the bishop was a tough one. Bishops don't get enough action.
Not sure why Rxe6 was skipped.  But promoting a pawn must top white's agenda to ensure victory.
We move our king's pawns to open our queens and kingside bishops...
...then we develop our knights, mine to defend my pawn.
...and I pressure his king's pawn with my queen's...
...allowing me to pin his knight down with my bishop...
...so I move my bishop back to cover the f7 square.
I now move up my bishop to give my kingside rook more freedom, and to eye up his f-pawn...
...and his light-square bishop attacks mine...
...and I move my castling rook behind my f-pawn to cover, leaving my rooks in passive positions.
...and I attack the knight...
...forcing it to the only safe place.
...I eye it up, along with the bishop, using mine...
...but as the rook attacks my bishop...
...but lose my bishop...
...but he covers with his bishop...
WHAT was I thinking here, putting my knight there to attack the pawn...
...then with one of my knights...
He brings his other rook to cover the pawn...
...so I advance a pawn to attack one of his...
...as the knight can remove it...
He moves his bishop to attack my knight, no doubt hoping to win it, and make a net gain...
...but my knight forks his king and bishop...
...and he checks with his rook...
...and although moving the king off the bottom rank exposes a rook...
...it was connected to its twin, which removes the checking rook.
...and my rook covers it...
...and as it is removed by the knight...
...the rook can capture the knight...
...and although I lose my rook...
Hi everyone!<n><n>After a two week holiday in sunny Weymouth (including a day trip to Jersey) I have now returned back to Cambridge and Gameknotland.  Time to catch up on some annotating.  I have a series of victories to annotate and this is the first of them.  Gameknot analysis is provided here. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16113581&fb=1&rnd=0.44279073601021224.  The game starts as a Sicilian Defense and comes to a sudden, violent, end.
5. 0-0 - and Henry now tucks himself away on the kingside.
8. Nbd2 - develops another piece and gives support to the knight on f3.  This also allows Glenda to move out of the pin to a square such as c2.
13. Nxe5 - my knight moves away from f3 and to a more commanding square.  Of course, a future f6 could drive it away but the f6 knight must move away first.
14. Qxc5 - that juicy p(r)awn on c5 was just too tempting for Glenda so she wastes no time in devouring it.  Please note that if black now plays BxP then Rd1 pins the bishop against the Wicked Witch of the West on d8.  The bishop will then be removed by my e5 knight on the next turn and black will be a whole piece down.  My opponent spots this, however, and decided to harass Glenda with b6.
16. ..... Bxg4 - knight trade.  I am very happy with this trade because I am a pawn up and trading pieces will increase my advantage in the endgame.
21. Bd2 - at last, I complete my development on move 21.  The downside of pawn grabbing in the opening or early middle game means that you waste a tempo in getting your pieces out which can in some cases prove very costly to the grabber.  Thankfully it did not do this in this case.
22. ..... Bxe5 - pawn trade and black threatens to win back a pawn with Bxh2+.  He can check Henry if he wants to, but he ain't gonna have the pawn, so he moves to h3.
24. Rad1 - black piles up on Fou Lenoir but I decided to defend by centralising my QR.  This move threatens Bh6 winning the exchange as it discovers an attack on the Wicked Witch.
26. ...... Rxd8 - rook trade.  Now I offer another one but black declines the trade.
28. Qb3+ - aha, just when it looks as though the BR and the Witch could do menacing things to Henry, Glenda decides it's time the BK was made to feel the white heat.  Black moves his king to h8, nacht and now Glenda hops on her broomstick right into the enemy camp on f7, that's right, f7.  Not quite so defensive, eh!?
29. ..... Rg8 - this naturally defensive move leads spectacularly to a back row mate.  A few moves back you would not think this at all possible, would you with the black pawns in a chain from h7 to f5, but here it comes .....
31. Rd8 MATE!! - .... NOW!!!  So black has copped Old Matey giving me two handy rating points.  It is checkmate because the rook on g7 is pinned to the BK and cannot block the check on d8 and the king is tied to the black row and cannot escape.  This is just a taster of what is to come, so keep watching this space ......
The bishop doesn't really have a future on b2. Better to leave it on c1 until you've played e3-e4. Qc2 was the best move.
I get the impression that you are playing to a formula here. 13.b4 followed by 14.e4 was the best plan.
A good but not very frequently seen answer. I like it, since it makes more difficult my favorite London attack.
I can advance inmediately this pawn because if Nh5, Be5. If Bg7, I exchange bishops and the game can go on. If Ng7, my bishop will be pushed away eventually with d6, but black development will also resent. Interesting but I think it is playable. If Rg8, I made him loose the castilng rights for the kingside.
Aiming to sacrifice the h pawn in order to disrupt black pawn chain, or at least to open the h column. Better would have been Bc4, I realized later. But, in black's shoes, I would have played d5. He loses a tempo, but I will, also, so it is playable. I thought my Bc4 plan will go nowhere unless I have much more attacking power.
Aiming to fiachetto the lsb on b7.
It looked interesting. Now I regretted not to have placed my bishop in c4, but I am also opening the white diagonal, aiming to h5.
If I don't play this one, and retire the bishop, I lose the initiative.
I thought a lot about Nxc7 , Kd8, but after this... what? If NxRa8, e5xBf4 is dangerous for me, and I am not sure I can hold the knight without major problems against my king. Maybe o-o is enough to hold the position, but who wants a king's castling with the pawn in h5? And, after f4xe3... I was very doubious about white's position. So I preferred the "clean"...
The strong bishop is gone. Now, the other can go to b7, and I have to make room for my own dsb.
Incredible... wasn't it better to try to castle queenside in few moves, instead? b6 was the move!
It seems an useless pawn on h6, but it is not, as you will see...<n>At this point, it was tempting Bh5, but... he wouldn't be so naive as to play NxB, so...
I think he should have taken care of his developement, with Be6. But he was looking for "something" about the e column and my king... and maybe he has. But...
NOw I have to give back the dsb for a knight, but it's ok.
Why this retirement? It "saves" me from defending. After f4xe3, Bxe3, Nf4 would have put me in troubles. now he can play Bf5, placing it in a very good square...
Ahhhh... I am not attacking anymore, but my king is protected. Now, can I take advantage of the h column in some way?
Almost forced, since otherwise my bishop would be released to the sad g1 square! But it is very strong, there!
Now, if g4xf3, I take back the pawn and then, with o-o-o and the open g column, is good for me... all because he didn't play the c8 bishop before!
Now, I need to "justify" my h6 pawn, but I cannot without having room on the h column... note that my own bishop is on the only safe square... if I play it to g5, I would not be able to defend it, so...
I found a way to have pieces on the h column, making my rook penetrate. Unfortunately, this means to exchange a bishop for a knight, but it gives me the h5 square for my rook. And I calculated I could defend my h6 pawn.
As foreseen, leaving h5 to my rook.
Maybe I should have played d4xe5 inmediately, and then rook on h5. If a4, Ba2 and hold tight. Anyway... I choosed to be prudent...
I was aware I was opening for him the d column, but the queen should go to c3, after the knight exchange on a4. But... I saw something, and I took the risk.
First tactical interesting situation. <n>It seems a mistake, because of Rd6. But, after Nxc7, RxQ, NxQ, BxN, Rg4! threatening mate in g8! He must move the bishop, and NxR, winning a quality. After Kxb2, Kc3 and the only way not to lose the knight is a4. NxN, a4xBb3, Nxb3 and he must defend the e4 pawn. If this is a winning position for me, is to be decided, but I think yes. <n>Of course, this is not the only line here...
Anyway, I must think about the other possible moves after Nxc7, like Qe7. I was not satisfied with Bd5, or Nd5, so I thought that it was better to let c3 free for my queen.
Second minor interesting tactical position. I recover my pawn, and it looks not a bad idea to have a free passed pawn in the center. But the black a pawn will prove to be very strong, too.
The good part of this position is that the black's lsb has very few things to do here. Unfortunately, I have to take the rook back with my knight, which allows...
Now is my knight that is misplaced. But he will lose a second pawn anyway, f4 is definitely dead. I didn't play Ne2 because I was "smelling" something bad with the black pawn's majority on the queenside, but I wasn't able to calculate such a large number of variations. And I wanted to activate my rook. <n>Anyway, a more deep look shows that the white position is not as good as it looks. I was unable to see it, and I got in serious troubles.
Aha. It looks darker and darker on the queenside. Anyway, my h6 pawn is starting to play right here.
Probably Rf6 is better, preventing the bishop to run to the good diagonal a2-g8. I wanted to access with my rook the darker pawns...
I planned to play Rc8 here, pinning the bishop, but I didn't see that with c5 he would have taken my h6 pawn... with a mate threat if I move my knight. And with b5 he makes me move it very easily...
Now, to take g3 is not the great idea here, but to block black's rook after it takes the h6 pawn.
Another VERY interesting tactical position. <n>If I play Rxg3, b4, Nb1?, a3! and I am lost! Do you see it? If I play<n>Nb1 at once, b4, and then I cannot avoid to lose the knight for the a3 pawn, to say the less. <n>If Rxg3, b4, Ne2 is slightly better, since I have room for my King to go to b1-a1 to stop the a pawn. But who wants to play with a pinned king?<n>(Rxg3, b4, Ne2, a3, b2xa3, b4xa3, Kb1, a2, Ka1... ok, I can probably came out of this one, but it looks weird). <n>Ok, so look to Kb1. It looks good, since it gives the king a precious time to stop the a pawn. But: <n>Kb1, c5!, now if I go Rxg3, Rxh6... threatening mate in 1! After Rh3, I can stop it, but does it look good?<n>Ok, so let's take a look against the other black's attack line: <n>Kb1, b4. Na2, and then apparently everything is under control, except that black can play c5, I lose h6 AND I have a delicate situation for the control of the 1 line and the weak g2 pawn. <n>Interesting for a greater mind than mine... :-D
An ugly move, but necessary. I won the fool's medals for my way to move the rook in the last moves.
In order to avoid any mate threat, then making the bishop free. <n>The alternative was c5, Rxb5, Rxh6, Rxc5, but probably black had more moves to play. For instance, Bc4 threats Bf1, winning the g2 pawn... <n>Later, I realized he could play Bh3!, scarifiying the bishop to crown his g3 pawn! I completely missed the point, and that proves I completely misunderstood the position. Good lesson for me!
"I retired the knight to b1 in order to answer Nd2 to Bc4. I didn't see this brilliant sacrifice. <n>If I go direcly for the g3 pawn, with Nd2, you will play c5, and I cannot take because of Bc4, winning a piece. Very nice. "
Unconventionally stopping the white pawn advancing and keeping the e5 for later on
Protecting the f5 pawn and opening the queen & bishop's diagonals for attack on the black squares
Not really sure where this leads to...
G Pawn advances strongly putting some pressure on the f pawn and weekening further the K side.
Rook hast to lift up and I do not really mind it.
Quite useless attack in my oppinion at that point, but ok it oppens a diagonal for attack to the white King...
White opens his black diagonal and trys to put pressure on my Knight.
I decide to put pressure on white's e-pawn and get the centre...
Strong move by the black having the Q ruling the centre and endangering this notorious black diagonal.
I'm trying to loose it a bit and starting a nice attack at the same time.
Let's put some pressure on the Queen first. I need her out of there to develop my attack on the K's side.
I need my Queen and at the same time here comes the second rook too.
Now I have to take care of whites attack on the weakend black King's side and support the centre.
Trying to cover up?
This is the Evans Gambit. This romantic gambit has proven to be greatly resilient to modern technology, while it is not generally thought of as a path to advantage it hasn't been refuted(correct me if I'm wrong).The idea of this opening is to gain momentum while opening the centre., this is often at the expense of a pawn or two.For this reason this line of the Guoco Piano has often attracted attention from more aggressive players and and will probably continue to do so in the future. Even Garry Kasparov found the opening worth playing a few times.  He even used it to beat none other than ANAND! Pretty good surprise weapon,no?
It is often said that the way to refute a gambit is to accept it. Black grabs a pawn so as to have the option of uploading it in a later stage in the game in order to neutralize whites resulting initiative.
This is the plan of giving away the b4 pawn to gain tempo by forcing black to move his bishop repetitively while he gains  momentum in the centre..
This retreat is probably the most natural responce to the Evans Gambit.The e1-a5 diagonal, pinning the c3 and d2 pawns for the momentand, more importantly is not in any kind of trouble on a5. or instance it would be in danger on c5 because of d4. Or 5.Be7 which is solid yet deemed passive. On the other side though white will be able to put pressure on blacks position with Ba3 later on. Black's plan to meet this is with d2-d3.
White seizes space in the centre. Alternatives here are the imediate 6.0-0 which is not so popular or 6.Qb3!? which starts an immediate atack. These moves are interchangeable though and are normally played at some stage of the game. I recommend my chosen move.
As I said. Again logical solidifying the e5 pawn and also stopping the danger of Ba3. An adequate and more common alternative is 6...exd4.
I castle to get my king into safety before  start my attack. This move also breaks the pin on the c3 pawn.
I recapture building up my space advantage in the centre.
! I decide Morphy's dynamic logical approach. It is often thought by beginners that when you have gambited a pawn you need to attack and mate as soon as possible with out developing there pieces, this often results in a failed attack. Morphy believed that all pieces should be involved in an attack. This seems subtle and lets Black off the hook because it is too quiet but it builds up my forces for my attack.
! Immediately putting pressure on Black's position and attacking the Black Knight.
Black does exactly whatI wanted him to do. he opens the a3-f8 diagonal for my bishop to attack.
! This builds up pressure on the Kingside and prevents castling.
I' keep the attack going. You'd think I did this so the pawn couldn't take my knight on c3 but I'm gonna sac it so I don't really care about that!
! I build up the pressure!
? think this was a poor attemt at an interference move. As you will see it doesn't interfere with my invisible attack for long!
Well if this was the whole point of 16...Bxf2  then i'm really scared! Lol!
I retreat the King.
Checkmate! This game shows the effectiveness of gambits especiaklly in Blitz games where Black often seems to get disorientated in the wild position and goes pawn grabbing. The answer to my question 'Do Pesky Pawngrabbers Prosper?' Answer: 'No!!!!!!!!!!' I hope you liked this game. I'm happy for positive and negative feedback aslong as its constructive criticism! and feel free to leave comments. Thanks to the player i played this game, i couldn't  of done it without you! One thing I would like you to do is before you rate this game please think honestly and think how I can improve on it and leave comments and PM me with them. Don't just give one and a half stars and not tell me why.<n>Thanks<n>Tom

The end of this thematic tournament. Glad to play in because i learn this opening.
to be able to catch d4 with e3
POST-MORTEM, this pawn strucure and both Ne4-Ne5 is call double stonewall by Soltis. I still don't have read this part of his book. So no idea of an usual plan. I had try Qc2 both time in this MT and both time is was a mistake or i  hadn't been able to play it. ___ now i suppose Qe2 is a better place like in the dutch stonewall.
This time i try a no king side attack rush __ POST-MORTEM, the turn of the game. And also the move i would like to takeback. Probably Qe2 and not Qc2, but i don't know if there is a " theory about ". So the stonewall middle game is where i have to learn.
Ok, so c3 was pinned. Never a good idea to let an opposite rook and our queen on the same column.
ok, the end of my visualization__I realize i don't know really how to play pawns vs a rook. can i push the pawns or the rook just have to move column to column and take a pawn (if enough room) ? I have to go to ABC of the endgames to try to learn.__27.g3 Rh5 28.h4 (Rg5 is not possible nice) Rf5 29.Rc4
31.g4 to prevent the push of the pawn h, Rf5+ is not possible too 31...Be8 32.Rc1 __or__31.Bg5 a3 32.bxa6 bxa6 33.Rc1 Bxa4 34.Rxc4 (looks difficult to defend against a pawn on a and one on h)______ i realize after having played 31...Be8 is not possible 32.Rd1 Bg6 33.Rd8+___ and to be honnest i don't have the feeling i will have back my two pawns.
I think black is black is over, Rg5-Ph6 can't move, Bb2 can stop c4 and e4 but.... 34...axb 35.axb Kf8 36.b6 Ke8 I am not abble to push b6 __ 37.Rc7 Kd8 38.Rxc4 Rg7 39.Rc7 Rxc7 40.bxc7 Kxc7 41.Kxe4 Xxx 42.Bc1 and h will fall. And i suppose i will be able to have a queen.
The opening is called "The Grand Prix Attack." The point of it is to launch a hard-hitting attack on the king side. Black expertly avoids this however.
Not taking the pawn was a wise choice, as it would allow White to get back into an open game with attacking chances.
I do this to relieve some of the tension on the queenside. It may not have been the best move, but it helped me to not have to go into long analysis about how to keep that pawn alive.
Now, looking back, this may not have been the strongest move, as it just invites liquidation in a posistion where my oppenet has two pawn closing in on my turf.
The Bishop sacrifice seals the game as a draw.  White had the small edge until that point, now black has that tiny advantage. However, as you will see, that advantage isn't enough to win it.
I offer the material back.  If Black accepts it, White gets the edge back. If it is denied, Black maintains the small edge.
A great move! By preserving the Bishop, Black ensures that White will not be able to take the lead from him!
A small mismove on Black's part. 42...hxg4 43. hxg4 Rc5 may have gotten Black the win he so desired.
6. Qh5!! here i have challenge him to a queen to queen to defense my horse from the attack his queen..but he refuse, instead he attack my Qg2!? to have a piece advantage.
Now black has removed most of the pressure
if 9... cxd5 then 10. Nxd5 is useful - even if the exchange of knights happens, the remaining black d6 pawn is not happy.
Trying to support playing a4 and a5 here. I wanted to create a positional squeeze in black's camp.
Attacking the c3 knight. If 11... cxd5 12. Nxd5 Nxd5 13. Qxd5 Qx3  is nasty.<n><n>I need to remove the fork on the rook at move 13, ideally whilst protecting the b4 and c2 pawns -- hmmm....
I think there is little choice to play the exchange, this is quite awkward for white, as the defences are stretched very thin to look after the pawns because of their poor structure.
Defending the pawn, and the c3 square, allowing the knight to defend the d5 square properly, and advance their itself if appropriate.
Considered playing b5, but decided against it because of the ease which the Queen could move out of the way. Obviously 13. b5 axb5 14. Bxb5 is losing for black, but unless white gets b6 and gets the a pawn up to a5 it will be hard to hold material I think. Maybe this line would have been better, but I wanted to castle and relieve the pressure on any c3 forks to reactivate my queen in an attack.
This is interesting. I am now looking at Qd8 , giving a long term positional awkwardness to black's back rank. The bishop needs defending, and 16... Bxf3 17. Qd8  Kf7 18. Bxf3 looks very interesting. This game could still explode somewhat I think!
Both the bishop and the queen are hanging, and after gxh5 there is a mate threat on g2 if the g5 bishop moves, so 23. Qxa8 gxh5 leaves the other bishop hanging also. Things are looking very grim for white.
Last, desperate counter-attack measure. After 23... Rxd8 24. Bxc6 either the d7 knight or the d8 rook are hanging. If 24... Ke8 then 25. Bxd8 Kxd8 26. Bxb7 seems good, returning material to equal again.<n><n>23... Qxf3, bizarrely, looks best, as after 24. Qxa8 the immediate danger is over with a slightly favourable exchange for black (bishop and knight for the rook).
Doubling up to take the pawn. Could simply play Be4 and defend the pawn, or alternatively 29. Bd5 Bxd5 30. Rxd5 is interesting, though it looks like 30... Qxc2 31. Rd7  Be7 would end any long term attacks. It's a tactical possibility for the future though.
Awkward, even with the threat of back rank mate I don't really want to exchange (30. Rxd8 Qxd8 31. Bd3 may be possible), yet obviously the immediate threat is mate in one anyway. I'll retreat here and try to regroup.
Hmmm, 31. Bd3 seems to expect material exchanges, but keeps  my two passed pawns ok after 31... Bxd3 32. Rxd3 Rxd3 33. Qxd3. I'm going to play Qf3 in the hope of finding some tactical traps appear. This isn't really good chess but mass material exchanges don't seem ideal for white either :(
If 38... Bxd2  39. Kg2 it is hard to see black's next move.
As said, Black now has two hanging bishops, it is hard to see where to go from here.
e5, deadlocking pawns and keeping the center deadlocked
lets get the queen out of there and get my black bishop into play
develop and add support to the center
lets slice and dice!
uh ow.........here comes Buzzy to infinity and beyond
Take me to funkytown!
The preacher has left the church
Oh Yeah more trading at the New York Stock Exchange!
Death To The Gamecocks.........I mean the Gators...........!
My bishop went stark raving mad!
ok pope i want to kill the central villagers before saving you
death to the villagers!!!!!!!!!!
and I'm rookle County
attack the villagers!
A perfectly plausible position to be in. Now its time for an epic queen sac to get mate.
?? Seems to just sac the queen as the knight was pinned.
And checkmate. It is quite nice to see the minor pieces get a mate while the queen is sacked, when normally it is the other way round. To avoid this position, instead of taking the queen, black should take the knight on e5 with his knight.

Recently a friend uncovered in his basement an old chess club magazine which had been gathering dust for a good twenty years. It contained my  first game in the Belgian inter-club competition. The game itself also originated in a basement, so truly a case of "Cellar Chess"! The cause of this unusual playing venue was an administrative oversight: Our club (KGSRL) was at that time the largest club of Belgium and brought 13 teams to the inter-club competition. The request to have only half of the teams play at home on any competition day was not taken into account in the schedule and so some 130 players came together in the clubhouse when we played home. The teams in first division played upstairs and the teams from the lowest echelons had to play in the cellar... Best of were the guys playing in 4th division: they got to play in the bar.
In those days I opened virtually only with 1. d2-d4. Against a relatively strong opponent (rated 1928 ELO KBSB, when I was still unrated) I did not want to deviate from the familiar path, so back to the queen's pawn opening.
5... Nb6 seems somewhat better: The knight on f6 shields direct pressure from Bg7 and forms a target for the advance e4-e5
Played to support d4 and also with the idea of continuing with Qd2 and Bh6 in order to exchange the strong bishop on g7
This does not look very useful. c7-c5 seems a better way to attack the white center than preparing for e7-e5. May be black moved the rook so that Bh6 could be countered by Bh8.   At the chess-club we had lessons by a master and this game got reviewed there - which is also why this game made it into the club magazine by the way. The master - Bernard de Bruycker - suggested 8... Ng4 for black.   White can then continue with for instance 9. Bf4 and 10. h3 but I was probably lucky black did not play this: I had completely overlooked that reply during the game, and so the move would have come as a shock and been very unsettling. At that time I resolved that I would very quickly scan all legal moves of my opponent before playing my move, but it is something I have not been able to stick too in practice... :-)
There is no reason to deviate from the plan: eliminate the strong bishop and weaken the black castle.
Better was to expand immediately on the queen side with 10... b5. The knight move is weak and white could have won a pawn with 11. Bxf7 Kxf7 12. Ng5 Kg8 13. Ne6 Qb6/Qa5 14. Nxg7 Rd8 15. Ne6 Re8 16. Bf4 threatening Nc7.
White is focused on his plan and misses the tactical opportunity offered. Another factor contributing to the oversight may have been that I used to play quick in the opening in order to avoid time trouble - something I was susceptible to. Even though - if my memory serves me right - that year was one of the last that the first time control was still the ancient 40/150.  No wonder we got home late back then... it was not always the 'après échecs'
Pressuring f7 to induce e7-e6, a move which blocks black's bishop and weakens f6. Note that black can not defend with 12... Rf8 because of 13. Bxf7 Rxf7 14. Ne6 forking king and queen.
White stops a later e6-e5 and attempts to get control over the weak squares d6 and f6.
White is going for the black castle, so he gets his king out of the way and involves the rook on a1. May be this is too straightforward as it immediately gives black a target on the queen's side. 14. h4 seems like a less committal alternative.
The idea of Bb3 was to keep out of the way of the white rooks which will attack the black castle and to give the white king some cover. But in view of a7-a5-a4 this seems like a tempo loss.
16... a5 and 17... a4 was another idea. Also 16... c5 to undermine e5 seems valid.
This knight stops 17... f7-f6 and eyes the d6 square.
17... Bd7 frees space on the back rank but the move does not seem to fit in a specific plan. 17... a5 or 17... Nc4 would continue the attack on the white king. If white exchanges Bxc4 after 17... Nc4 the black rooks get an open b-file towards the white monarch.
Black connects his rooks, useful when the h-line would be opened. Also the queen could join in the attack on the white king with Qa3+
Blocks the access of the black queen to a3. White contemplated 21. Nc5 since then the white knight could not so easily be challenged by the black one, but decided that the d6 square was juicier as it is closer to the black king.
Black is trying to reduce the pressure.
The white pieces are concentrating on the black king.
Puts an extra defender on the weakness f7 but removes one from e6. Black should probably immediately have exchanged the knights instead of postponing this until his next move.
A rooklift to train more forces on the black king.
A fatal mistake. 23... f7-f5 was possible since white can not take en-passant: Nd6 is attacked twice. White's attack would have been slowed down, needing g2-g4. Now however e6 gets uncovered and becomes a new target. As a result black's position collapses quickly.
The rook takes aim at e6 and there is nothing black can do about it - his pieces lack mobility.
This leads to checkmate in three but the alternatives were not pleasant either. Only giving up a lot of material postpones immediate loss. It is also too late for f7-f5 as white can play around the obstacle:  26... f5 27. Qe5 Rg8 28. Rxe8+ Rxe8 29. Qf6+ Qf7 30. Qxf7#
A new idea to get the queen or to prevent the castling.
King can't take the bishop without loosing the queen.
This is an interesting game. My opponent plays the opening fine. I am just getting to the end of my opening database line, when he makes a mistake. The first move of the combination is not original. Although he has an equal position after 12 moves, mistakes on move 13, 14, 16 and 17 lead to a hopeless position. My opponent resigns rather than prolonging the agony.
He blocks the diagonal for my Bishop.
I prepare to castle.
I take, discovering an attack on his queen.
I attack the bishop.
The Bishop retreats.
This is a mistake. This same mistake was made in Colin, Vincent (2396) vs. Mercier, Jean Loup (2056). It seems to me that this move just drops a pawn, and although black can regain it, white has an initiative. However, Gameknot post-match analysis surprisingly doesn't give it as a mistake. Anyway, stop and find white's best move now.
So I recapture the bishop.
Did you find it? The problem for black is that 17.... Bxb5 is met with 18. Qg4! with a mating attack, as 18.....g6 is met with 19. Qg5 (threat 20. Qh6 and 21. Qg7 mate). 19....Ne7 seems black's best in order to meet 20. Qh6 with Nf5, but then g4 renews white's threats and black's position is resign-able.<n>Gameknot gives black's best defence as  Ne5 18. Nxc7 Bxe2 19. Bxe5 Rxa3 20. Rxa3 Bxd1 21. Bc3 g6 22. Ra2 Bb3 23. Ng4 Rd8 24. Ra7 Kf8 25. Kh2 but still with a huge advantage to white.<n>My opponent goes down another path.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This game started off as a Dutch Defense in a thematic mini-tournament.  This resulted in closed positional play right until the latter part of the middlegame where I managed to win a pawn and go into an endgame with a pawn up.  You would think this ought to have been a straightforward win, wouldn't you?  Well, not quite - let's throw some opposite coloured bishops into the mix and things were not as straightforward as they seemed, even when I increased the advantage to that of two pawns the graffiti on my wall was reading "Low Draw".  However, before hitting that Offer Draw button, I decided to have one last throw of the dice but did it pay off?  Well, in order to find out you will have to read on ......
1. ..... f5 - this is the Dutch Defense and I have had mixed results with this opening.  It looks as though I will be leaving Henry exposed on the Fool's Mate diagonal, but in order for my opponent to plonk the Wicked Witch of the West on the h5 square, it is not as simple as it first seems.
6. ...... Bg7 - I complete the kingside fianchetto and the Fool's Mate diagonal is firmly closed off.
12. ...... 0-0 - finally Henry is tucked away on the kingside.
17. ...... Ne5 - I return my knight to its outpost.
20. ..... Bxe5 - B for N exchange.  Nice to keep the bishop pair.
22. ..... Bf7 - one move ago, white played the seemingly strong f4.  However, this has left Roger with a backward e pawn and now I sneakily discover an attack on it.  Glenda is getting her broomstick ready ......
27. ..... Rf8 - I have a very subtle plan here to win that e3 pawn.  Where there's a will there's a way.
33. Qd2 - now I can start the exchanges which will alter the course of the game.  By taking off the knight on d3 I ensure I get the e3 pawn but the price I will pay is that I end up with opposite colour bishops.
50. fxe5 - now the rooks have been traded off and it really is an opposite colour bishop ending.  I decided to let the pawn on a7 go for the pawns on a3 and b4 and regain my two pawn advantage.  However, it does allow white to get a passed pawn.  The alternative was to play a6 but then Roger could always play Be4 and then my queenside pawns could fall.  So I decided Bxa3 to be the lesser of the two evils.
63. .... Kxe6 - Henry snaps off Roger's final pawn and now three pawns down Roger decides to hit the resign button.  Here are his post game comments: "In my white game, disregarding the computer analysis, the move I thought lost it for me was #53. Instead of h5, I should have moved my K to Ke2. This would have stopped you B from guarding the diagonal including h6 for my advancing pawn. Of course, being several pawns down was a killer in end game". He will not be able to stop Glenda from appearing on either c1 or a1.  That's all for now folks but I will be back with another endgame where I have had to deal with stubborn resistance in a rook ending from a Class C Player by the name of Dan.  Until then have a good read and a nice weekend - Kind regards - Joanne
There are really only two pieces involved in the Tiff-tiff opening, the bishop and the queen. The first step is to clear the way for both the bishop and the queen.
The second step is to place your bishop so that it is attack the King-side, on the square diagonal to the king.
Through review of other annotated games, this defensive move is common on GK and ive adopted the defence myself as it prevents the pin on the knight or d pawn with the white bishop on b5.
clearing space to castle kingside, i heard it said once, castle early...not sure whether this is still thought of as a good idea. Ive also seen others wait until they see what happens in the opening game first then castle before the attack.
forcing my to move my knight again and losing opportunity to develop my pieces further
aiming to own the a1 - h8 diagonal
with my knight on e4 i intended to pressure blacks queen with my dark bishop taking advantage of the cover on e4. It is at this point that i see a few good forking opportunities. (thats fork - ing not the expletive way you'd pronounce it if you were from Ireland...I've got Irish ancestors...G'day to all the Irish out there)
opportunity for piece advantage so i decided to take the Knight
I thought about whether i wanted to go ahead with it, looking at 15.Ng4 16. Bf6  and winning the black queen, but i thought my opponent would have seen this and easily avoided the pin, So i went ahead and increased my piece advantage
now to stay ahead in piece advantage
getting back to base to load up and try for another fight
I saw the pin once again on g5, but also saw 18.f6, so decided to make a more stupider move instead
?this move was aimed at a few different senarios - both as you will see didnt work too well, but i was hoping for 18.b5 19.c4xb5, axb5 20.QxR8. At the end of the day i wanted to try and bust up some holes and saw c5 as a vulnerable hole and went for it
claiming the half open e file with potential to double rooks
preparing to get the a file rook into the game
However, black bishop now owns the a8 - h1 diagonal and looking quiite menacing...maybe the trade wasnt too well thought out and i realise i really need my queen in the action
Necessary block, but now my opponent has the opportunity to push around his centre pawns aimed at eventually threatening my rooks
thinking i can afford the lose, i decide to try and keep to my game plan to double rooks
pushing further and threatening f2, so i decide to double the rookos on the e file hoping to muscle my way in
preparing to squeeze tighter and connect his pawns in the centre
practically forced stopping the mate on g7, but now i have the fire power on the e file and fire away
I didnt miss it. I was excited about how I played my end game thus i wanted to try an annotation. As i have said earlier, this is my first annotation so constructive comments are appreciated. I purposely removed my opponents name from this annotation as I dont agree with publicly annotating a game when i dont have the permission from my opponent, so in respect for my opponent i maintain his annominity.
White's aggressive opening move opens lines for the queen and king's bishop and fights for control of the squares d5 and f5.
Black plays the classical response to 1. e4. By mirroring White's move Black has guaranteed himself an equal share of the centre and scope to develop his pieces. 1...e5 is one of the few moves that directly interferes with White's plan of playing d4.
Ye olde stuff here. I attack Black's king pawn, preparing for kingside castling, and preparing for d2–d4.
Is the natural move, combining defence of the pawn with control of the d4 square and refusing to commit another pawn. The extent of this move's popularity is such that the typical player of 2. Nf3 as White is already thinking beyond it to their third move, safe in the knowledge that any variation by Black will play into their hands.<n><n>White has multiple choices here which can lead to very different games. 3. Bb5 (Ruy Lopez) is the most played. White puts pressure on the knight defending the pawn. I was thinking of 3. d4 (Scotch) because my opponent wanted a "Fast correspondence game" and 3. d4 is aggressive but decided against it as I have not played it in a very long time...not seriously anyways...
Enter the Ruy Lopez. White threatens to trade the bishop against the knight, leaving the pawn undefended. It is not a real threat as after 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. Nxe5, Black can fork the knight and a pawn with 5...Qd4 or 5...Qg5. As nothing's urgent, Black can respond in a variety of ways. The most common move is the Morphy defence : 3...a6, forcing White to make a decision about his bishop. Many other moves are available, some neglecting completely the protection of the knight and the pawn and continuing development.<n><n> I assumed he would choose a route that would let us really open of the center...
The Berlin Defence!?!?!, 3...Nf6, has long had a reputation for solidity and drawishness and is sometimes called "the Berlin Wall". This was not what I expected considering they wanted this game to be a SPEED GAME! If he wanted fast and some action why did he not take 3. ... a6  so might be able to follow 4. Bxc6 (Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation) or any other line for that matter?
He already went with the Berlin Defence line in this so called "Speed Correspondence Game" and now...he closes it!?!?! He could have played the solid 4...Nxe4 or the more combative 4...Bc5 (the Berlin Classical Variation), but no...I am stuck trying to hurry through ...sharp lines...open it up...anything... cause he wants to be done in an hour!
Here I go making yet another attempt to get us away from slow and drawish. Even if it actually increases his winning chances!
I have done what I can to continue to develop safely up to this point and attack get some kind of middle game going.  We are out of my notes now and there is just too much shit on the board still for me to count very far ahead.  This pawn move, I thought, should make him shit or get off the pot! I thought maybe he would 7. ... Nb4. Then maybe I would follow up with 8. Qe2 and he would 8. ... 0-0 and finally castle and we could get a move on. Could have even gone  7. ... Nb4  8.Bxd7 followed by either Nxd7 or Qxd7  and then 9.a3 with his Knight backed up to a6 square.
NOPE!!! He backed up to his starting square.  Now he kinda makes me bring my queen out to d3 (i guess Qe2 would have worked too) to defend both the the pawn at e4 and the bishop at b5.  <n><n>I considered 8.Nc3 to defend the same squares but this was not some lightning real time game on yahoo (Where I know I would have done it). I started playing correspondence so I could take my time and develop as a player...see deeper faster...learn more theory.  I saw lines like 8. ... Nxe4 9. Bxe7 Qxe7 10. Nxe4 Bxb5  where I am down a pawn and have my rook under attack by Blacks's light bishop. Getting in a hurry would have cost me material and momentum.
I chose this over 8. Bxd7 to deny him a chance to re-develop his b1 Knight with Nb1xd7. I worried he might 8. ... Nxe4 this move than covered that. <n><n>If for example they 8. ... Nxe4 I could follow with 9. Bxd7+. Black's response to that could have been 9. ... Nxd7 or Qxd7 and would still get hammered by 10. Qxe4 scooping back the lost material +2.
Black finally castles, I develop my Knight to the c3 square and black attacks my light bishop on b5. Finally black does something less that passive.
I did those to avoid all together 10. Ba4 b5 11. Bb3  lines that might involve me moving a3 at some point and tucking my light bishop into the a2 square. I am ahead
I saw combinations of h6 attacking my dark bishop and blacks night on the g4 sqaure in my future without this move. Although I did almost move Ra1-e1 here, I did not want to give up a chance to attack on the queen side near his idle queenside knight. With 11. h3 I made h7-h6 a pointless waste of time and gave my self a few moves to get over to his queen side without his night in my house.
...I tuck back my bishop and Black pulls back his knight...looks to me like I just gained momentum from Black without even thinking more than 1 move ahead!!!
As the capture of the rook was certain black seems to have decided to make room for his underachieving knight to get out of the way...
and still ...nothing they can do to stop it....

the traditional, to occupate the center
My intention was to take a pawn in advantage.
this was my mistake. the correct was qh5
? I am playing altogether too passively probably out of respect for my opponent. I should have been looking for more forcing moves. This is the third time I missed a better one because I was nervous of his plans. The obvious 25 e6! is much stronger here<n><n>25 e6! then if 25 .. Rxb2 26 e7 wins eg .. Re8 27 Rf8+ Kg7 28 R1f7+ 1-0<n><n>Passed pawns need to be pushed!
?? Losing<n><n>The correct move was 35 Kf3 with a draw<n><n>35 Kf3 g4+ 36 Kf2 a6 37 Kf1 Ke7 38 Kg1 Ke6 39 Kf1 etc<n><n>Its drawn because the Black King can't take either pawn. I should have seen this possibility - an important motif to remember.
Cambridge Springs Defense (or less commonly, the Pillsbury Variation) is a variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined. Black breaks the pin  on the h4-d8 diagonal and forms a pin of his own on the c3 knight (exploiting the absence of the queen's bishop from the queen side). If Black later plays dxc4, there may be threats against the g5 bishop. The first recorded instance of this opening was played by Emanuel Lasker in 1892. The name derives from a 1904 tournament in Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania in which the defense was used several times. Practitioners of the opening have included Efim Bogoljubov, Vasily Smyslov, and Garry Kasparov.<n><n>The line remains popular among amateurs because there are several traps White must avoid.
Black has solved his opening problems by exchanging pieces and his c8 bishop can develop freely. The opening phase is over and White has the advantage of central pawn majority and his Rooks and Queen are better placed than Black's pieces. White King has not castled as yet.
Look at the 7th rank domination by White's Queen and Rook. Black can resign now. <n><n>We can see the logical flow in this game. In the opening, aim is to control the center. In the middle game, aim is to dominate the center and open lines to attack the opponent's King. In the end, dominate the 7th rank. Looks like a text book game. My guess is many Chess principles of today were authored after studying Steinitz, Lasker and Capablanca's games.
A pawn move threatening Black's Rook on d6. The hidden motive is to switch White's Rook on e4 to the b-file.
... hmm easy reponse, better to activate both rooks
?? better to play Rc7;Re-c8? because of threat of...
This is the other game between tag1153 and me that I've been slow about annotating, but here it is.<n><n>Again, as always tell me about any logical errors or typos.<n><n>This is probably the most flexible way for White to start the game. It forces Black to choose what to do without wasting a tempo.
Black decides to play for a Sicilian or English set up.
I try hard not to do this when I annotate, but I'm going to step into my personal feelings about the game from behind the Black pieces rather than be objective for just a second.<n><n>I am a fairly conservative player who likes to keep opening lines fairly fixed. The way White has played until now was driving me absolutely crazy because there was no guarantee as to which opening the game would move into.<n><n>So, Black decides to eliminate the QG lines and the English lines. Of course, White still has the option of guiding the game into tons of other openings, and things that resemble other openings. White is still very flexible.
Recapturing with the Queen would have simply wasted a tempo after 3. ...Nc6.
Black is trying to get rid of the flexibility of the position still.
Finally, White commits to something. Now that he's decided what he wants to play, Black can start to form a plan of attack (or defense).
Black begins his development by giving his Bishop access to the long diagonal.
Now White has really committed to an opening. This is called the Maroczy Bind for White. Black's specific line of the Sicilian here is the Accelerated Dragon.<n><n>White's control of the light squares will cause Black a lot of trouble trying to get his light-squared Bishop into an effective position. Normally, in the Accelerated Dragon, Black has enough trouble with that, but with a Maroczy Bind, it becomes and absolute nightmare.
This however, is not. The capture of the Knight on c6 is normally characteristic of very sharp games. Normally, in the Maroczy Bind, White wants to keep Black's play to a minimum, but by doing this, he removes his Knight from its powerful post on d4 and releases tension in the center. He also increases the Bishop on g7's power tremendously.
I would assume that this move stems from the pressure coming from the g7 Bishop.<n><n>However, it should also serve as a clue to Black that White could be planning to castle long. Of course, Black can't know absolutely yet, but this move hints at it.
Black simply continues developing. He's ready to castle now and adding pressure to the center.
White has to develop too of course! This placement on his Knight relieves a bit of the pressure that Black is applying to the center.
This was a wasted move. The Black Queen ends up going straight back to c7.
Now there is a slight tension between the Queens. It's nothing large yet, but it affects both players' central plans. If Black ever tries to open the center with ...d5, the resulting trades would open the c-file for the Queens to have at each other.<n><n>This isn't to say that both players should try to put as much pressure on the c-file as possible yet, only that they should consider this small tension in their plans and calculations.
Both of White's Bishop's are activated and gunning for the kingside. If the Queen on c2 weren't a good enough hint, this is a clear indication that White plans to castle queenside. The only reason this can be so readily determined is that the light-squared Bishop has no entry into Black's position unless White launches a kingside pawn storm, and usually, you don't storm with pawns in front of the King.
Black is now committing to playing with the Bind in place, meaning that he doesn't intend to challenge it. Black needs to be very careful when he does this because it commits him to carefully watching White's powerful attacking ideas for the duration of the Bind.<n><n>Black's idea here isn't to develop the Bishop (it's fairly useless everywhere, that's the nature of the Maroczy Bind), but to connect the Rooks in a couple of moves. He will put his Bishop on e6 (which blocks the pawn, but it's safe) so that it can apply the infinitesimal amount of pressure it's capable of applying. <n><n>I think though, that Black would have been better off if he had just played ...Ba6 at some point and left his Queen's scope untouched.
There's the castle that White's been flagging since move 7! It's only too bad that Black hasn't done much to prepare for it.<n><n>Also, it should be noted that by placing his King on the c-file, White has created more tension (negative tension for him) there.
The Bishop adds its small bit of tension to the c-file.
And the pawn storm that we had forecasted is now raining down on Black's kingside.
Black attempts to create a figurative umbrella by moving the key point of attack of the pawn storm to g4, a square that he has marked several times, and has the ability to add support to.
White prepares to advance to g4.
Black feels safe enough to castle, and it would seem that he is. However, he needs to be constantly ready to defend against any possible attacks that White can initiate on the kingside, which means that Black's minor pieces are basically stuck defending.
Black decides to begin to do the same for his pieces. However, his minor pieces are chained to the defense of the kingside, so the effect of his optimally placed pieces will be considerably less than White's pieces' effect. This is one of the key elements of the Maroczy Bind if Black doesn't manage to break it down (or in this case Black doesn't even try to break it down).
White continues to increase the value of his pieces. If this were a video I would make all of the arrows from White's pieces into Black's kingside, but since I can't you'll have to imagine them. The Rook on h1 influences the entire h-file. The two Bishops and the Queen pressure virtually every diagonal leading into the Black camp (notice that the light-squared Bishop is going to facilitate g4 after Rg1 (after Rg1 notice the new imaginary arrow pointing directly at the Black King)). White's attack is swelling to unbelievable strength.
Black ignores White's threat. He prepares to double his Rooks on the b-file and create an invasion of his own. However, I think that it would come just too late. If 16. Rdg1 Rgb8 17. b3! and Black's attack is stopped for long enough for White to start his own.
White has not only wasted that precious tempo, but he has made his King critically weak! Suddenly, the pressure on the c and b-files seems stronger, and now Black has a reason to blow the center wide open!
Although Black has been happy to play in the cramped, time-critical Maroczy Bind, he has been nicely prompted by White to shatter the center and start a vicious counterattack.
This sequence of moves is kind of cool to me because you can watch the center loosen brick by brick. You can also watch Black's pieces become tremendously powerful. White's pieces will go from well-placed for attack to terribly placed as White needs to defend quickly (and they won't even have to move!).
Now we can see the tension between the Queens that I mentioned at the beginning. Though it would have been possible for the game to finish without this tension ever having been exploited, it was one of the subtleties of the position.
I admit I searched for this solution. I had no idea before to play Ricardo what to do here. And I must admit it is very intersting.
and more space to black
and now what? I am still blocked in my hopes to play d5, because b4 will be exposed to rooks attack after exchanges.
a bishop and a pawn against a rook: viable...
Another big mistake.  I'm going to ground, and trapping myself.  I think a better move here would have been h3, but at this point his bishop could move away from that threat and still maintain his pressure on my king.  I could also have gotten my h rook to safety, allowing him to assist in the kings defense.
If white takes back with the pawn, it opens a nice attack on the dark squares. It will not damage white, but he'd have to play defensively. So I'd suggest Nxd4 instead. Of course, it lets the way open for e5-d5 from black's side.
I got rid of his Bpair, I still have strenght on the dark squares and the B, and white has to spend tempoes for developing, just as me. It's not "his game" anymore.
? Useless move, since I can ignore the threat due to the hanging R.
Another "sgrunt" move. The idea is to control Qg5, with some embarassement from my part.
...to close the center, which makes my lsb a headache. Moreover, if I castle, my K will be naked.
? Not necessary. I though on f5, hoping in exf6, and the chanche to move my e pawn, even sacrifying it for the sake of activating my lsb. But I didn't dare: on a blitz, it was too risky. g7-Ba6 was another plan, but it only aimed to getting along, nothing more.
...g4 is a threat, as the N has no squares. And it grabs space, while my K is in the center, but well protected for the time being.
Easily preventing my threat. But now, his N is fixed. Of course, h5 was not possible. Qd8-Rg8 could be a nice idea.
...but instead, I saw the weakness of d4, and played this in order to play b5 in order to prevent the N to go to a4, kicking my Q. Q and N will press d4, forcing white to defend. But...
? This makes only easier my task, since I can defend the N with the B and the Q won't take it.
Maybe a mistake. Bd7 was more in line with the idea of shielding my K in the center. But the idea was to play on d4, and if I get it, my d5 pawn will be able to move, aiming at his K.
Maybe the idea is to play b4 having a3 defended, but my idea was...
...and this makes Bg7 the good move. My K will help in the defence of the c column, connecting R and stay shielded at the same time. I still can't take d4, but I will be able. Of course, white has countergame...
Goodby my Bpair. I'm still wondering if f5 (if exf6, Bxf6, adding pressure to d4 and still guarding the white squares) was preferable.
Well, this is a tricky position. I can use my N for good, or lose it miserably. Just a matter of care. And I still have to solve the problem of my lsb!
The plan was a5, and then, a4 or b4, depending... I dont' intend to move the f pawn and offer him a square for his N.
I realize now his blunder, and the fact I lost the chance to plan Nxd4, probably winning in the long run.
? I can exchange now his lsb, making my own one strong...
He will be able now to play the Qside pawn, and get dangerous.
Still, it has no  place to go to! So...
...and here it comes his attack. I won't lose time.
? Not a good idea? Better was Be2, and if Nf3, Bd1 wins a pawn and more.
? Kf7 was necessary and probably enough to draw.
He accepts a pawn's exchange in order to break in. And he will.
White has to sac the N or lose the game since he has no way to stop me from castling.
Up to this point it looks like simply developing the pieces.
This is a very bad move ! Because Knight at c3 has two defenders including the Queen but three attacks, here also including the Queen. If Knight got moved then it is going to loose the Rook. So, better move the Rook.
Black knight is trying to get back. Here, better cut the Knight then Black Pawns will be doubled in the e file. May be bit advantage for the White side.
Black side is moving nicely and trying to get more pieces and it seems it is working.
That's a mistake. He had abandoned the Rook with the Knight to f3.
going for the quick checkmate.....can always still develop with Nb3 if plan A fails.
blocks with the Knight...this is the typical way to stop QxP (checkmate)
Attempting to take the pawn at e5
Hopewell blocks by moving out his other knight.  This is also a good move because he continues to develop his pieces...and he can move the knight to d4 to threaten my queen.
I pose a double threat on the pawn and also prevent knight to d4 without causing a knight exchange.
EXCELLENT MOVE by Hopewell!  This move threatens my queen with his bishop (revealed check) and threatens my bishop at the same time.  This is going to cost me a three point lead and a major piece.  Hard to swallow--but I must move the queen...and lose the bishop.
he doesn't feel the need to take my bishop right away--and forces my queen back farther first.
trying to develop some before the attack comes in.  The best offense is a good defense.
protected the pawn, but lost my ability to castle with this move.  Another good play by hopewell.
his attack continues to develop--his queen now controls center and protects the loose pawn on c4.
threatens to exchange another lesser piece in attempt to gain positioning and advance his pawn.
Hopewell castles to give rook support to his pawn which has already moved almost all the way across the board and we are only on move 16!
attempting to clear a space for my rooks to move in--but I have a bigger plan then that--Rg1, Pc4, BxN or if his knight moves RxP to create a slide.
instead he attempts to threaten my rook and move his pawn to d2.  He didn't see the position I am now in until it was too late!
where should I go now....my rook has free reign to move the board.
I end my attack with RxR and I now have a 5 point lead.
he frees the rook to take my pawn at f2.
interestingly he doesn't take the pawn, but decides to protect his pawn with his rook.  Probably a better move.
I threaten his rook....If he moves it away from the bishop, I have the bishop and check.....if he retreats from the pawn, I will have the pawn.  Either way, he is in a worse position than when he started.
a bishop for a bishop?
he protects his and now, if I take his rook--it will just be an exchange.
He protects the bishop and prevents my attack from working.  He also advances a pawn that could become a queen sometime soon.
this move was to threaten the pawn's currently location making it impossible for him to move the knight and bring the pawn all the way across.  My rook guards the pawn from making it right now.
He made a pawn exchange hoping that I would take his knight and not realize he was going to cross with the pawn (now protected by the bishop).  Hopewell holds on.
I take the pawn exchange.
threatens my bishop. Hopewell continues to try to regain ground.
here I threatened the pawn on a5.  Since this is 1 of 2 remaining pawns, and he can't checkmate with a knight/bishop combination, he will have to either move a4 or defend his h pawn and get a queen.
he choses to exchange...the h pawn now becomes crucial for black's survival.
I attempted to pin his knight and then attack with my bishop on g3.
I still am attempting an exchange since I am up in pieces.  This time, if RxN--then he will also lose the bishop on d5.  A strong move by white, as least so it seemed.
double protection on the knight....the knight will play an important role in moving black's h pawn across.
I am trying to get a queen as well....but his bishop stands in the way at d5.  I hope to move c6 and have protection so I can continue to cross.
he continues to proceed with his pawn....I plan to exchange with my bishop once he reaches h2.
I continue to move my pawn forward hoping to get a queen.
I tried to remove protection first and he got his queen!  And a 1 point lead.
I have to move the rook to escape his attack.
so I put him in check...double protecting my rook with a pawn and a bishop.  The goal here was to keep all my pieces protecting each other so that the queen can't pick them off.  This move put the king in check and did just that.
check again--black's best bet is to keep me in check hoping to pick off pieces...we can see both sides of this situation being played out--there are two specific goals in mind--mine is to defend my remaining pieces, his is to attack and pick off my pieces.  May the best man win!
I'm trying to hide behind my pawns now...
he moves the bishop to prevent my pawn from crossing to the other side.  This is actually a good move....I'm stilted because I am out in the middle of the board....he can attack with the queen easily.
check......if I moved to b4--it would have been game....his bishop and queen are too powerful--the best bet is b6 (behind my pieces).  However, I block off my pawn by doing so.
I threaten his bishop.
he moves to block off my pawn--hopewell still has the upper hand.
Re8!!!!!!!!!  This was one of my best moves in the game....he is either forced to loose the bishop or move it and allow me to queen my piece.  The best thing to do was probably Be6.  If I proceeded with my pawn in this case, he would have had the c8 spot double protected.
who says I would have moved my pawn in that  case--probably would have moved the king to b7 first.  Anyway, it doesn't matter because hopewell hopes that by putting me in check he can postpone or escape this dilemma.  He has noticed that my rook on e8 is no longer protected. Neither is the bishop on d6.
Bc5!!!!!  Suddenly he is in trouble.  The queen is threatened as well as his bishop and he can't put me in check.  He is forced to move the queen and his bishop is mine.  I now have a 1 pt lead.
and he has only a queen and king to play with.
I hide behind my pawns--once again, he is not able to check me....and I'm set for my next attack.
Qc6!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Check and the queen if he chooses to move his king.  However, if he chooses to take with the queen--he is not standing alone with his king...I still have a bishop, rook, and pawn.  He is in a very bad position....
one move away from checkmate.  All good things must come to an end. And he resigns.
And no, not Qxd5, way to passive for my liking, this most of the time gives a much nicer game to play.
I thank my opponent for this, as you can see this is the only move that allows white to hang on to its pawn, but it leads to...
3.... e6!, the Icelandic gambit, an awesome gambit with great attacking lines for black and white has to defend real secure to keep his pawn up and don't lose material.
And yet another in between check (and a second queen move in the opening!), however this one is not so easy to counter as Nc6 gets countered by Qxb7 getting the pawn with tempo on my knight and 7.... Qd7 also leads to Qxb7 and the loss of a rook as well. Bd7 leads to Qxd5 losing my knight and so the only decent option was...
This was practically forced, as I can't allow white to play Qe2+ himself as that would've lead to queentrade which I have to prevent! He now has two options being 11.Qe2 and 11.Ne2 (as 11.Be2 leads to 11.... Bxg2 winning the rook)
threatening the rook on a1, the queen with my bishop and the queen can only move back to a6 to get to safety.
And my opponent takes on f8, it doesn't seem the strongest move, as my bishop isn't really playing and so he takes out an 'inactive' piece. I would've taken the knight on b3 to get the active knight and bishop back for my queen.
Taking a tempo before attaking my knight, it however bumps into the nice:
Qg4+ which wins another pawn with tempo as f3 is not an option (16.f3 Bxf3+ 17.gxf3 Qxg3 winning the rook) and 16. Ke1 Nxa1 and mating issues with Nc2.
Qxg2 and threatening to take the rook, so he moves to e1
I didn't like the look of that bishop and rook lining up on my king so I decided I had time enough to spare a tempo for Kd7
with ideas of Re8 and mating chances on c2.
blocking the bishop out and eyeing for f4 and mate on c2 (21.Be2 f5 22. Bg4+ Kc7 and troubles)
Winning the bishop and 0-1. thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed it, feel free to comment!
after our last game he told me he was gonna do a silicain and i looked forward to it
figured i would pin the knight to mate
now the rook is pinned, like it was gonna move soon anyways
good now the bishop is not aiming at anything at all now to focus on the queen
trying to rescue the pinned piece
gonna pin the bishop instead of the knight
hoping to get a square for my rook over there or my knight at d5
he gave me the bishop? i did not think the pawn was gonna make it
ok gotta put the rook down there to stop it
this is the game deciding move right here, i can kill the queen and make the game knight and bishop vrs 2 rooks or i can kill the rook and make it rook and bishop vrs queen and rook. i know that killing the queen is the better move but i do not see any mates with one knight or bishop i also notice his king is still subject to back rank mate ideas, i need a rook for those to work so that made my decision
Interesting. Black is willing to weaken his kingside in order to land a knight on e5. While that is of course a great outpost for a black knight, there might be no safe haven for black king in the future. The move played can also amount in a pawn sacrifice, as the g5 pawn is going to be somewhat weak. But even if black loses a pawn, white would lose some tempi in the hunt so the game is quite balanced, IMO.
Simple chess. Black is forced to lose a tempo and white won't have to lose it back by defending the h-pawn. There is something beautiful in these kind of positional moves...
Not that much for attacking the g-pawn, but to drop the LSB to e2. That would increase the scope of the d1-rook and monitor a black knight that is likely to go to f4 via h5.
...Nh5 is another option. Black is in no hurry to castle queenside.
Cutting queens access to a7 and so preparing ...Na5.
White has nothing against trading of his LSB, as it seems to lack constructive role in this position. Moreover, there is possibilities of Nf5 hanging in the air and an unprotected rook just might improve whites chances. If white is to aim blacks kingside, then it is easy to see that it is the dark squares that are easier to exploit.
Here 21.Nf5 straight away is playable, but I just couldn't see a line that would have provided white more than simplification and "boring" equality. There is the thing that, when you're thinking of attacking, you might misjudge the results of simplification... I judged that whites e-pawn would have been an weakness and blacks bishop pair a strenght. Fritz, however, said that it was the right path to choose.<n><n>I decided to renew the threat of Qa7  and prepare Nf5.
Good spot for knight. Now it is the unprotected rook that makes white NOT to lose tempo.
It is natural to defend the f-pawn, given that the knight no longer helps it from e5.
Natural move, but it appears that the strongest continuation is 23...exf4 24.Nd5 Bb5!(!) denies any White advantage. I had, of course, missed this move as I believe my opponent did, too. I only considered queen moves, and given that it must guard the c4-knight, Nxe7 wins another tempo. 23...Bf8 was the move I was waiting, whereupon the unexpected 24.Rd4! (Ne5 Rb4!) seemed like a good idea.
This was part of my preparation, but I must confess I missed the fact that my opponents next move was possible. Although i did look at it!
?? Misses the mate in two. It's a couple of days since this game was played, but I recall I thought that after 25...b5 white has various ways to play on. One line I was interested was based on playing e5, Qb3 and a4 (sacrificing the exchange), but there are some safer ways to go, namely taking the knight or checking twice at a7 followed by Rxf6.
Philidor's Defense, an irregular defense where black's queen's pawn push to d6 defends his KP and frees his QB, though blocking his KB and allowing white some ground in the centre. I respond with the main line, staking my claim on the center.
Nd7 is a traditional Hanham move, marking this as the Hanham variation of the Philidor. The advantage is defense of e5 while ensuring that trading pawns in the center doesn't give white an opportunity to exchange queens..
The experts recommend 4. ... c6 to prepare 5. ... b5 or 5. ... Qa5 . Alternatively, 4. Be7 is also recommended, though generally accepted as inferior to 4. ... c6. As played, black's 4th move strayed from my limited opening library, so it's off to uncharted territory I go. Well, at least I don't have the chart...
Black's 5th move baffled me. I don't know what he thought to gain, other than maybe security against a queen exchange if the pawns trade off in the center. And he blocks in his king's bishop. Or maybe he had is eye on taking the e4 pawn after he plays 6. ... exd4, though that is foiled easily enough, and the simple expedience of castling handles this rather effortlessly, and develops the king's rook in the process.
Now black is attacking the center. I am agreeable. Perhaps chopping up the center will open an avenue for my rook to skewer his queen on e7. Besides, I'm fairly certain to at least win a pawn here.
It seems black's center pawns have overextended their reach, and the e-pawn is sure to fall, leaving the lonely d-pawn isolated and faced with inevitable doom.
The obvious pin, eliminating one of the pawn's defenders by pinning the knight on f6 to the queen. The other defender, the queen herself, is only an illusory defender - if she sticks her neck out by capturing on e4, then white skewers her and wins her with Re1.
Black's 10th move spared him any worries about being skewered by the rook, but it maintains the white pin on his knight at f6. Hence the e4 pawn is ripe for the plucking, and in the nick of time, too, since it's poised to bring swift demise to the white knight on f3.
A pawn ahead, I am more than willing to liquidate pieces. I expect black to recapture with his bishop, then another exchange will follow with 13. Nxf6.
Black spared himself a second exchange, at the expense of his kingside pawn structure. 13. Re1 indirectly pins the black bishop to his king, leaving the pawn on f6 undefended if I capture it with the knight at e4.
The knight was in the way, he had to go somewhere, might as well threaten a fork on e6, though that space is sufficiently defended at the moment.
Threatens mate in 1 if black is foolish enough to play 15. ... dxe4. I suppose black is feeling the pressure of being attacked by 5 pieces while he only has 1 defender developed (the distant knight on b6 is little help at the moment).
If 16. ... Nxb2, then 17. Bxd5 threatens mate in 1. Black cannot reply 17. ... Qf8 because of 18. Qh6  . On 17. ... Kg7 black crates an escape hatch and white cannot immediately force checkmate, but after 18. Qf7  Kh6 19. Rxe7 black's goose is properly cooked. White is threatening multiple checkmates and multiple pawns will fall if black can find some way to avoid mate.
Black evidently felt that counterattacking was the best defense. He probably thought his move pinned the knight at c3. If nothing else, he seems to have created an escape hatch for his king at f7 - which I promptly close for him, as well as capturing a pawn and threatening the bishop on b4 - all of which is obvious and none of which is the main reason behind the move.
Black took the bait. Time to justify the sacrifice. Black could run with 18. ... Ke8 but that allows white to cpature the bishop on e1 with check and a tempo, bringing another piece to bear on the fleeing king. One such continuation might be: 19. Rxe1  Kd7 20. Nxf6  Kd6 21. Ne8  Kd7 22. Ba4  b5 23. Bxb5#
Black chose to huddle up and try to weather the storm. After 19. Bxc4 black can try to save his bishop, say with Ba5??? but then mate is forced with 20. Nxf6  Ke7 21. Qg7  Kd6 22. Ne4# (black can sacrifice his queen and bishop to stall, in which case it takes a bit longer, but mate is equally inevitable).
Now the exposed king has nowhere to hide. White has a significant material lead, so black dare not step onto the d-file with his king, for Rd1 will skewer and win the black queen, and while black may eventually flee to temporary safety on the queenside, his material shortcoming would ensure a hopeless endgame.
Black's move was desperate, and it staves off immediate mate, but it appears he still had some running room, though just about any line I try ends in checkmate or winning black's queen. Or both.
Black took the bait, and now it's mate in two.
Though labelled a "beginner's move" by some others consider this the best continuation.  A good alternative is 4.d4, and 4.0-0 and 4.d3 have been tried.  The last is better than it looks...
(?) Very risky, as black comes in for a savage attack.  "Normal" here is 5....Na5, turning the opening into a gambit.  Black gets good play and quick development in the sequel.  Also interesting are 5...Nd4 and 5...b5, both of which lead to intriguing play for both sides.
Bringing up more support for the besieged knight.  9...b5 and 9...h6 have also been tried.
Black can cut and run with 10...Kd7 11.Nxd5 cxd5 12.dxe5 Kc7 (not 12...h3 13.e6ch!) 13.0-0-0 Be6 14.Bxe7 Bxe7 15.Bxd5 Bxd5 16.Rxd5 when White emerges with 3 pawns and an attack for the piece.  After the text, a battle royal is taking place...
The pressure on Black's centre - and, since he's entangled in it, the Black King - has become enormous.  Black's answer is a counterattack.
(?) Played to reduce the pressure by exchanges, but this proves to be the decisive error.  Black can improve with 15...Ke7, breaking the pin on the d5-knight.  If White plays 16.e6?! Nxc3ch.  However, White can instead play 16.Bxd5 cxd5 17.Nxd5ch Kf8 (17...Ke8 18.Qg6ch) 18.Qe1! (18.Rhf1 Rxf1 19.Rxf1ch Kg8 20.e6 Qd6! is OK for Black) 18...Rf7 19.e6 Rf5 20.Qe4 winning material; or 18...Rf5 19.g4 Rf3 20.h4 Be7 21.Qe4 Rf2 22.Qe3 ...
Now that the bishop has been induced away from the c1-h6 diagonal onto h4, White launches a final attack.
Where is the queen to go to escape imminent capture?
...Why, to the square recently vacated by the bishop...
so nothing special untill now. The the black lsb should be better, in my opinion in b7, the the black knight can go to e4 (...Ne4, Bd3xNe4-d5xe4 and then the white position is quite bad wiht no way to move the rook to f3, which is one of the important lines.) But now if Bg4xNf3, it loose bishop just for a knight and help me developing.
may be better to retake with knight ? This was in order to move the rook to h colon.
I'm playing with a ggod challenger, so  in this case i alway try to do something risky and aggressive, in order to give at least a little fun to my oponent
black has to defend, white is quite well developped. Center is mine and strong. C5 cannot destroy it because  of e3 retake and keep occupying the space
this was expected. it will open the e colon, and help me developing the dsb an, so, joining the rooks
it will go to g5, then i will exchange it whith my lsb and open the g colon
ho ! this was a mistake from me. now the black knight can escape to g3. I should play Rf1.
nice position for me. I will try to attack the a3/f8 diagonal from here, ...and it will work !
first : pretending to attackk the a colon, but the idea is then to move the dsb on a3 protected by rook...
now i'm so happy !! But, this c3 pawm is very very dangerous. And i will have to manage with a big theat on d4...one thing at a time
defending the bishop, i can attak on h7 !
but i wont go on to win the c8 rook, it wont be easy to win something from now
i have to defend f4, i will first move Qh6 then move the pawn g5 g6...
in order to Qe3xa7+
from now i will exchange the rooks on g2 and bring back my queen there to keep it in the game. so first i will chess the king on a8 (targeting g2). But first i have to defend f4
exchanging rook will give more oportunities to attack the king and find the mate.
king. This give the oportunities to keep on attacking with the rook. It's becoming dangerous for balcks...
this was not the best idea from me ...of course if ...Bf6xRg5 - Qa5xe5+ and it's quite a mate, but king can take f4 and that' all
of course, but it s easy to defend
and now i have a tempo to keep on attacking
there is a lot of ways to go on ttacking searching the mate, is Rg4 the best ?
this was not the move i expect, it's just a mistake, i was thing in moving the queen !! but , lucky blitz, it was the winning move !
? A loss of tempo, being Nb-d2 more accurate for developement. But I have g5 in mind to control black's lsb.
This nice outpost doesn't threat anything, and I have a tempo to play against e5.
Another plan could have been b4. Is the only way to prevent Na5, in order to build an attack on f7 after castling with moves like Nc4, Qb3, Ng5. I know by experience that it is an attack black can defend from, and I sense my opponent knows it very well. So I went for this. I have to take advantage from my g pawn: if f5, I can open the g column for my attack.
I threat to win a central pawn. Developing in the meantime. Now, Nd2 or Ng5 can be emergency plans if needed.
? A mistake. I had to be wise and play g5. It blocks my minor pieces' best square, g5, but gets a grim on black position. The text allows a potentially dangerous attack on my kingside.
Well, if black goes for h3 I will be partly ok unless black can build some quick attack. Plan is castle Qside, and get the bN to c4.
Another little "price" I have to pay. But it just helps my Q to go to a better square:
Now I stopped for a moment and realized that I was falling on my own trick. If now Nd6 (threatening NxBg7+), after BxN and QxB, black has Qxb2. This threatens QxR and... wow, very hard to get into. Can I allow myself to wait?
Let's see. I said "no" to the tactic line. Your turn to do something. This is an antinatural strategy I won't recommend, but in this case, it is stupid to go into a tactic you spotted if you realize it won't work. I'll accept the return of a pawn, and will go Na3, Nc4 as planned. g5 is not a concern after Nxg5, RxN (or QxR+), BxR, fxB, Qh5+, followed by choice between going on with checks or play b3, stopping black.
As before, g5 is not wise (in my opinion. Later, with the analysis borard I'll be able to tell).
I can't say if black estimated more valuable the K's safety than the pawn, or he was simply got distracted and missed Bf5!
As I suspected, he preferred to hide and keep the other R free to act... but how? Nevertheless, I have the same problem: how to proceed? If Ng5, RxN, but if 19. Ng1... and black loses something after any move, e.g. 19..., Rh7, NxB, RxN, Qe6+, followed by QxRh3. BUT remember that still in that case, black has Qxb2, winning a R.
I thought this move was going against my interests, since I don't like a Q exchange if I want to win. I should have played Rh6, to keep all in control. I got distracted. I won't lie.
Finally I got the Q where I wanted it to be! Yes, at the cost of a R and a deadly weakness of my K.
...as planned, missing the obvious Qa1+, Kd2, Rhxd5+, forcing Nd4 to go on hopelessly for some more moves.
Given the situation, I thought the wisest was to go for a draw. Cash the prize won't have assured me a good game (I'm -6, and I can recover 3).
I am only +3, he has the B pair and a fork: e5, that frees his position and makes an unbalanced but very interesting game (if I am right, of course).
? A pity, after e5 it would have been another game.
No move can save black, in a way or another.
I'm sorry for this ignominious finale. But the midgame was whorth it, I hope. Thanks for reading!
To avoid a severe weaking of my Pawns if White had played BxKN. If he plays BxQN now, my Q will recapture and my Pawn structure in front of my castled K wil remain intact.
To unpin my KBP in preparation for driving Black's QB.
Clearing the square for my Rook.
Gaining a small material advantage. Now my job is to swap off some of the pieces. The more wood leaves the board the bigger the advantage of one Pawn looms.
Forcing the horseman to retreat.
To my surprise, White allows the exchange of Q's. One very major piece for each side leaves the board, simplifying the position.
If White doesn't want to lose another Pawn, more wood must now come off.
...and I do, winning a minor exchange to boot.
Now I have to guard my base Pawn on the Q-side.
I retreat and reconnect my Rooks.
Activating the B.
Securing the K where the white Rooks can't reach it.
After White's 42nd move I can get rid of BOTH remaining pairs of Rooks. I was only trying to swap off one pair...
...but I gratefully take the opportunity to dump both pairs.
Now all the pieces are gone and my extra Pawn is an enormous advantage. White's K has to defend both flanks.
...and now quickly switch to the K-side, where I threaten to massacre White's pawns.
...but now I'm one vital tempo ahead.
If White plays 50 KxP, 50... KxP and my K will escort the KNP to the promotion square.
White now must move his K away from his KNP...
White's strategy is to dominate the Kingside. Black responds with the sharp reply 1...e5!?, From's Gambit, named for the Danish chess player Martin Severin From (1828–1895), thus sacrificing a pawn to exploit White's weakened Kingside before White can develop adequately.
A more obscure, modern move order. The idea is to defer ...d6 and develop instead, hoping to transpose to better variations. After the normal 2...d6 3.exd6 Bxd6, White must play 4.Nf3, avoiding 4.Nc3?? Qh4+ 5.g3 Qxg3+ 5.hxg3 Bxg3 checkmate. Black has two main alternatives: 4...g5 to drive away White's knight, and 4...Nf6, threatening 5...Ng4 and 6...Nxh2! Emanuel Lasker introduced 4...g5 in the game Bird–Lasker, Newcastle on Tyne, 1892, so it is known as "Lasker's Variation". Today, current thinking is that 4...g5?! is more dubious; a quiet response considered favorable for White is 5.d4 g4 6.Ne5! (6.Ng5? leads to a dubious piece sacrifice) Bxe5 7.dxe5 Qxd1+ 8.Kxd1 Nc6 9.Nc3! Be6 (9...Nxe5?! 10.Bf4 f6 11.Nd5 Kd8 12.Nxf6!) 10.Bf4 0-0-0+ 11.Ke1 Nge7 12.e3 Ng6 13.Bg5 Rdf8 14.Bf6 Rhg8 15.Be2 Ngxe5 16.Rf1 with a slight plus for White. The sharper 5.g3 g4 6.Nh4 also seems favorable for White, after 6...Ne7 7.d4 Ng6 8.Nxg6 hxg6 9.Qd3 Nc6 (9...Rh5 10.Bg2; 9...Na6 10.c3) 10.c3 (10.Nc3? Nxd4! 11.Qxd4?? Bg3+
5? leads to a dubious piece sacrifice) Bxe5 7.dxe5 Qxd1+ 8.Kxd1 Nc6 9.Nc3! Be6 (9...Nxe5?! 10.Bf4 f6 11.Nd5 Kd8 12.Nxf6!) 10.Bf4 0-0-0+ 11.Ke1 Nge7 12.e3 Ng6 13.Bg5 Rdf8 14.Bf6 Rhg8 15.Be2 Ngxe5 16.Rf1 with a slight plus for White. The sharper 5.g3 g4 6.Nh4 also seems favorable for White, after 6...Ne7 7.d4 Ng6 8.Nxg6 hxg6 9.Qd3 Nc6 (9...Rh5 10.Bg2; 9...Na6 10.c3) 10.c3 (10.Nc3? Nxd4! 11.Qxd4?? Bg3+ wins White's queen) Bf5 (10...Qe7 11.Bg2! Bd7 12.Nd2 0-0-0 13.Ne4! favored White in Taylor–Becerra Rivero, Minneapolis 2005) 11.e4 Qe7 12.Bg2 0-0-0 13.Be3. At this point, White seems to have an advantage in all lines, although play remains extremely sharp, e.g. 13...Rde8 14.Nd2; 13...Rxh2 14.Rxh2 Bxg3+ 15.Kd1 Bxh2 16.exf5! Re8 17.fxg6! Qxe3 18.Qxe3 Rxe3 19.gxf7; or 13...Bd7 (threatening 13...Rxh2!) 14.Bf2!
wins White's queen) Bf5 (10...Qe7 11.Bg2! Bd7 12.Nd2 0-0-0 13.Ne4! favored White in Taylor–Becerra Rivero, Minneapolis 2005) 11.e4 Qe7 12.Bg2 0-0-0 13.Be3. At this point, White seems to have an advantage in all lines, although play remains extremely sharp, e.g. 13...Rde8 14.Nd2; 13...Rxh2 14.Rxh2 Bxg3+ 15.Kd1 Bxh2 16.exf5! Re8 17.fxg6! Qxe3 18.Qxe3 Rxe3 19.gxf7; or 13...Bd7 (threatening 13...Rxh2!) 14.Bf2!
Logically consistent. But with this move order, probably better is 3.Nc3! Nxe5 4.e4 intending 5.d4, rather than 3.Nf3?!, and then after g5!? or d6!? when Black has the kind of position they are playing for.
Jo does not like the more passive retreat to g1.
Again, Black chooses the most aggressive response.
Black continues the aggressive play. The N is now threatened.
Hoping for a Q trade and to allow the N to retreat. The GK computer considers this weak compared with d5: (Inaccuracy: -0.45 » 8. Qd3 Qxd3 9. exd3 h6 10. Ne4 f5 11. Nc5 Nf6 12. Na3 b6 13. Na4 Be6 14. Bf4 O-O-O 15. Nc4 Nd5 16. Bg3; Best: -1.10 » 8. d5 Bh6 9. dxc6 Bxg5 10. Bxg5 Qxg5 11. Nd2 bxc6 12. Ne4 Qb5 13. Qc2 Be6 14. e3 Qb6 15. O-O-O Qxe3+ 16. Kb1)
? This move is a serious error, giving a clear, winning advantage to Black. The GK computer prefers Qd4, which is what I had expected. (Mistake: +2.04 » 11. Qg3 Bd6 12. Bf4 Qf6 13. Nd2 Nf3+ 14. Ngxf3 Bxf4 15. Qf2 gxf3 16. Nxf3 Nh6 17. Qd4 Qxd4 18. cxd4 O-O-O 19. Ne5 Ba4<n>Best: +0.77 » 11. Qd4 Bg7 12. Qc5 c6 13. dxc6 Qxc6 14. Qxc6 Bxc6 15. Na3 h6 16. Nb5 Kd7 17. Nxf7 Nxf7 18. Bc4}.
Of course. An immediate threat is to win the White Q with ...Nf3+. Also the White N is trapped and can be attacked by pawns.
!? I decided to play this move rather than Qf6 because I wanted to keep pressure on e4.
Jo realizes she is in trouble and attempts to complicate. But this accelerates the loss. Better was development, such as Nd2 first as the GK computer suggests: (Mistake: +1.65 » 13. Ne6 Qxe4+ 14. Be2 Qxd5 15. Bxe5 Qxe5 16. Qxe5 fxe5 17. Bc4 Nf6 18. O-O Bxe6 19. Bxe6 Bc5+ 20. Kh1 Rf8 21. Rf5 Bd6; Best: -1.02 » 13. Nd2 O-O-O 14. Ne6 Bxe6 15. dxe6 Ne7 16. O-O-O Qg8 17. Qe3 Kb8 18. Bc4 Nxc4 19. Nxc4 Qxe6 20. Nxd6 cxd6)
? While this protects the N and prevents Black from castling, it really doesn't help and accelerates the loss with what is essentially a spite check. After this blunder, White is truly lost. THe GK computer suggests Bxe5 instead. (Mistake: +4.52 » 15. Ng7+ Kf8 16. Qd4 Qf7 17. Nd2 Kxg7 18. Ne4 Re8 19. Nxd6 cxd6 20. Kd1 Nc6 21. Qxd6 Bf5 22. Kd2 Nge7; Best: +1.62 » 15. Bxe5 Qxe6 16. Bd4 Qxe3+ 17. Bxe3 Ne7 18. Nd2 Nf5 19. Bf2 g3 20. hxg3 Nxg3 21. Rh4 Nxf1 22. Re4+ Be5 23. Nxf1)
Now Jo waves the white flag. White faces horrific material losses or checkmate. As Jo said: "I can safely say here that I am on the wrong end of an annihilation. I am now resigning our game on the grounds of ruinous loss of material. If I try and save Glenda (by dodging your knight) who will be pinned against Henry next move then I see you have a forced mate as follows:- Here is the forced mate. 17. Qg3 Nd3+ 18. Kd2 Nxf4+ 19. Kc1 Ne2+ 20. Kc2 Bf5+ 21. Qd3 Qxd3+ 22. Kb3 Qb5#" Even the line given by the GK computer: 17. Nd2 Nd3+ 18. Bxd3 Rxe3+ 19. Bxe3 Qxd3 20. Bxa7 Qb5 21. Ng3 Qxb2 22. Rd1 Bxg3+ 23. hxg3 Qxc3 24. Kf2 Qb2 25. Rhe1 Qxa2, leaves White annihilated. But I'm sure Jo will extract revenge in future games.
the lesser f 2 evils
not sure hwy but i had no intention on going to g5
pulling the king off his throne
The first 15 moves are discussed in two of my other botvinnik (#3&4) annotations, so I'm not going to re-discuss it here.  16.Na4 is where the annotation will begin.
This is the alternative to Rb1.  Rb1 stops the knight being taken because the opening of the b file is very powerful and so that black queen goes to a6, this brings the knight out of danger with tempo.  The black queen now has the option of b5, and the value of white's knight is unclear, it might be out on the rim but it might be a useful piece in an attack as black has a lot of potential weaknesses.
Questioning the pawn, if it takes (or stays where it is) white opens the a file and if it advances Nc3 comes with tempo on the black queen.
the move looks good, the rook starts to open up against the white queen and the knight looks actively places to threaten g4, f3 and d3, all potentially useful squares, however it's undefended and white finds an excellent way of showing it's misplacement.  The mistake isn't a strategical one, strategically this is a move black wants to make, but tactically the knight's unguarded.  Perhaps 17... exd5 as played by Shirov later is better, but Ivanchuk did get a beautiful win against him out of it with a queen sacrifice on g7 (that was apparently found over the board).
The bishop was attacked, so it moves with tempo, 22.Bf4  is probably well met by 22... Rxf4 23.gxf4 Rg8 with some pressure, also remember, if white doesn't force something black can make a passed pawn with c3.
Black gives back an exchange instead of ceding tempo to white, after a rook move Bxa7-b6  would be very dangerous.
! We've seen this kind of potential sacrifice in the 16.Rb1 lines (where the knight cannot be taken) and this has the same plan, give up a piece to open the b file against a misplaced queen or king, in this case it supports the b pawns advance as well.
And not only does the b file get opened, but it comes with tempo!
A rook retreat is met Rfb1.  This move brings the h8 rook into the defense of b8 and covers d4, but the b file has not been covered, however how could he cover it?  The position is shattering and I don't believe black has a way out.
The bishop may win tempo at some point on the a1 rook and if it's taken black will have a strong pawn dui on c4 and d4.
! So instead white finds a way of reorganizing his pieces so that his bishop can sneak around black's dark squared bishop via a3.  Taking on f2 doesn't help black as then he'll have the extra  worry about his loose bishop on f2 after 28... Bxf2  29.Kf1
The bishop on d6 cannot be taken because of the discovery on b5.  This move is stronger that 31.Bxb8 because the a6 rook is attacked, 31.Bxb8 Qxa6 32.Bc7 c2 would give black hope.
Where would the queen have gone, a rook is hanging with check and black would have no compensation, so he tries to draw the king into the open where the queen (and maybe rook) could have a hope of delivering stalemate.
And black resigned in light of being hopelessly lost.  41... Kb8 walks into a wind mill and 41... Kd8 42.Rd1  Qd2 (42... Ke8 43.Bxf7  Kf8 44.Re8#) is simply lost, he's down two bishop after his queen is taken (sadly, white doesn't have 43.Rh1 because of 43... Rxf6  44.Bxf6 Kxc7).  Kamsky pulled off this win by giving up his queen for two pieces in order to place a dominating pawn on b7 with two very long scoped bishops supporting it that together dominated the board, not only that but he opened the a and b files to great effect, in the botvinnik black has very loose pawns one of white's goals is to open up files, 16.Rb1 goes for that but 16.Na4 followed by a3 is another completely viable and very dangerous plan.  I think the most remarkable thing about this game is that black got no counterplay (except his slight prayer for a perpetual at the end) in one of the most dicey and counterattacking openings, white's queen sacrifice tied Kramnik down completely.  Kudos to Kamsky.  if you have any comments or variations, I'd love to hear it.  I'm never sure how many variations to stick in, and when to stick to descriptions.
I plump for the Sicilian, i find it pretty flexible and is probably my fav to play as black...
Seizing the opportunity to pin me...
I want an instant decision as to the future of that bishop...
The old pawn advance heading my way, however this move does hinder the white queen a little and if my opponent isn't planning on keeping it there why not move to b4 in 1 foul swoop?
So i make room for my Qbishop and also attack his. Notice how i still haven't committed to castling yet on either side, hopefully this serves as a source of a little annoyance to my opponent.....
I decide to try and keep the pin going for as long as i can....
I wanted to line up this Bishop with h2, it wasn't doing much where it was and i felt when the big pawn exchange happens it will be a dangerous diagonal to own..
Splitting open the kings defence and exposing him to the harsh realities of life....
Hi everyone!<n><n>I think it would be a nice idea to explore the Grob Opening where white starts out with 1. g4.  It was a very enterprising idea of Jerry to try against Class A 1900 oppo.  It certainly got me out of the Gameknot DB pretty early on.  It can be quite a tricky opening as my 3 games will demonstrate.  This is the first of these three games.
1. .... d5 - opens up a line for Fou Leblanc onto that pawn on g4.  It looks a little vulnerable.  Easy19, aka the Master Mater, is not afraid to play the Grob.  He has tried it against me and won.  I must make sure that I do not fall to a calamity here.  In this game, Henry has a 19 rating point bounty on his head!
3. c4! - good move here, if I now play 3. ..... dxc4?? then my pawn on b7 and my rook on a8 will receive the last rites from Jerry's bishop on g2.
3. .... Nf6 - develops a piece and defends my d pawn.  It is twice defended but the second defender is Glenda.  I would prefer to delegate that task to either another pawn or a minor piece if at all possible.
5. Nc3 - and we have further pile on to that poor little pawn on d5.  So, now I exchange it.
6. Qxc4 - The Wicked Witch of the West recaptures.
9. ..... Nxc6 - after having to reverse Fou Leblanc's development and to merely move pawns, I finally recapture a pawn by developing a piece.  Now I have just got to develop my bishops and I will feel a little happier with my pos.
13. Na4 - but that white knight finds another square to harass my pieces.  This is b6 threatening a fork on Glenda and my rook on a8.
15. e4?? - this, however, is a blunder because I can now fork the Witch and the knight on a4 with another pawn stab.
19. .... Nxd4 - although there is no mate in the offing, Jerry decides to wave the white flag as he is now 11 points down on material.  It is an interesting opening and now will come the first of two correspondence games which are not from Gameknot but from the THEM series that Freddy the Master Mater also plays in.  My opponent is chessmaniac (Guy Shelmerdine).  We started that THEM tournament via e-mail but then, after Guy joined Gameknot we agreed to play out the rest of the game on Gameknot.  I won with white and conceded a Low Draw with the black pieces.  Watch this space my friends ......
Always a frustration.  What to play?  2. ... e5?  If you want to play 1. ... e5, play it.  2. ... d6?  Play it at move 1.
The only move to give something original, particularly if White plays 3. e5.
Oh come on!  What next?  A draw offer?  I think that OTB I'd probably punt for 5. ... c6 because if White exchanges the pawn structure is like an exchange Caro-Kann and I can develop the Bc8 before playing ... e6.  Instead, however, I made the fatal error of looking at the database and went for
I'm never quite sure about playing ... e5 as Black.  I've never played it at move 1 and a lot of my systems are based on either a fianchetto or ... e6.  It always looks a bit loose somehow.
Forced - 11. ... gxf6 12. Qxf6 wins instantly and this way I can at least get my bishop out.
The knight can't really stay where it is because 14. Bd2 will force the issue anyway.  Black's plan has to be to play c6, Kc7, perhaps Be7 and attack on the g- and h-files.  Can't dislodge that knight though, so maybe Nd6 will do the trick.
Designed partly to stop Ng5 or Bg5 and partly to threaten g5 and thus to dissuade him from 0-0, the natural continuation from his previous play.
?! The d4-square is given away, the Queen obliged to move to a more useful square and the d3 pawn rendered permanently weak.  Is ?! too generous?  Should it simply be ?  ?
If I can take the d4 square with a knight or even bishop, I can get some compensation for my pawn.
White's obvious follow up, defending b2 and d4, whilst putting pressure on e5.
I don't get this move.  White continues to exchange pieces but the white-squared bishop can only come into its own on the h1-a8 diagonal if Black plays exd4 with a reversed Modern Benoni, a pawn down.
Big Queen.  Suddenly Black has some compensation for the pawn.  White has done nothing to develop his position in the last 10 moves.  Now I'm not saying that Black has, but White's pawn structure is weakened and I can have a go at f2 from here.  Indeed, the remainder of the game consists of Black trying to get at f2, albeit that the Ne4 is a resolute defender.
?  Too passive.  White should be playing Qc2 and trying to 0-0.  Indeed, 19. 0-0 Qxb2 20. Rb1 Qxa2 21. Rxb7, giving back the pawn to open up the Black king, is sufficiently worrying that I'd probably have played 19. ... Be7 with a view to playing Kc7, Raf8 and g5.
X f2, again.  Can I bring enough pieces to bear?
This is reasonably obvious, although Black can always look to dislodge it with g7-g5-g4.  White can play h3 but d3 is weak and Black has ample compensation for the pawn.
Put your rooks on open (or semi-open) files.  If Black had ... f5 available to him, his position is crushing.  Shame I blundered that pawn.
White wants to develop his rooks, defend d3 and play on the Q-side with a3, b4, b5 etc.  Black has a bishop pair and an attack on f2, but that pesky horse holds firm.
White misses his change to get the king to safety.  25. Rhd1 g5 26. h3 and White can try to play Kf1, Rd2, Rad1 and aim for d4, although it all looks a bit slow.
Still heading for f2, Black now threatens 27. ... Bxh3 because 28. gxh3 Rxh3 wins.  Helpfully, Black's king is already on a dark square, away from the White bishop.
A quiet, but devastating move.  Black simply relocates his bishop to h5 to force the issue on f3 and then f2.  29. Bxh5 Rxf2+ is the first plan, whilst Bf7-h5xf3 will cause devastation in the White ranks, and that's only Plan B, with Plan A involving Bf7-g6 and e5-e4 to open up the White King like a torpedo.
A misconceived plan to start action on the Q-side brings the White position to a swift end.  The fight for d4 is too little, too late, and in any event, it's that f-pawn upon which I wish to wreak havoc.
White can't resist advancing his pawns with tempo, but the Black queen is simply being forced to the square she's fancied for some time.
It's taken 22 moves, but I've tripled on the f-file, the Ne4 has gone and White is lost.  Any bishop move allows Rxf2+ winning, but the alternative ...
I was tempted to take the knight but instead I pin with my dark squared bishop. I think I should have just captured the knight with my pawn.
I am in no position to defend my king!
I attempt to open up room for my other rook
Dragon variation. I think the fianchettoed bishop and knight on f6 creates a strong defense for the black king.
Tricky!! Now after Bb3, Qxh2#, and after Nf3 or g3, then dxc4. Hope you enjoyed the extremely short game.
My development is complete, white's is lagging.  I am excited about the opposite-castle setup, with both knights prepared to strike at the white king, but I have no plan as of yet.
I take the chance to begin my own pawn advance.
I took note of my Rh8, in the line of white's DSB, and in the manner of blitz, blithely ignored the threat...  Here is where I began my attempt to channel my hero, Raoul.  His signature sac is of a minor piece on, in this case, g4, supported by a pawn, with a rook menacing the soon-to-open h file.  I saw that I could achieve this setup and simultaneously support the attacked pawn on e5, and jumped at the opportunity without calculation.
My N reaches the sac square.
With this exchange completed, I can almost feel it coming, but still I don't have a plan.  The best I have seen is the possibility of doubled rooks on an open h file.
!  I offer the sac which I now dub the "Raoul".  In fact, black quickly regains equality, with positional interest, even if white plays accurately.
! My proudest mating pattern so far.  Hope you enjoyed, thanks to aeronca, respect to Raoul, comments welcome.
i think the knight was actually bait to trap my woman
and now she is locked away
well now i am really considering the trade but not on this square.
well, that sucks but atleast i got him to backword devlope his knight giving another tempo as well, but now i must trade
now attacking the knight and the second bishop driving the kinght away
hoping to trade of for the knight
now i win the knight anyway and i get to keep my bishop, Bonus
i probably could have cheked wiht the rook and traded both pieces for the rook and won with the other bishop and knight but i played it safe and left the rooks on the board
this way i can munch his pawns away
i decided to do it this way to block the rook out of the pawns way and insure his safe passage
trying to isolate and corner the king
My opponent has now broken off from the standard line, which would have been f4 instead of h4.  I continue with the standard line, though, because it still seems to make good sense.
Still on the main line, although with a different effect.  I was hoping to get b3, in which case b5 wins either the bishop or the knight.
I play b5 anyway, because I need to get my bishop free.  By breaking off from the main line, my opponent has given me enough breathing room to do a little development before the attack on my king begins.
Now my opponent has returned to the main line, but it's a little late.  I pin his pawn to his queen with the intention of playing b6 and either Nxe4 or Bxe4.
I decided to go with Nxe4 instead of Bxe4 because I wanted the discovered attack on the queen, allowing me to sneak my knight up on something.  So far, though, there's nothing to sneak up on.
Didn't see that coming, although I should have.  Nd7 is the only real option here.  Bc6 and Nc6 both result in losing the knight on e4.  The upside is that as long as I can survive the next move, my opponent has thoughtfully provided a piece for my knight to sneak up on.
As expected.  Now, the question is why did I expect this move, and why on earth did white make it?  It's a horrible move!  Must be something in the water.  I really did not see it until several minutes of staring at the board.  That's twice now in a couple of weeks that I've won a major piece by exploiting an illusionary pin.<n>The other alternative, Qg4, would have left me scrambling to avoid a mate (which I think I would have, with advantage).  Lucky me.
With nowhere to go, the best for which white can hope is to claim my bishop in exchange for his queen.  He can forstall the exchange a little by Bxd7, but that only delays the inevitable, and leaves him even more disadvantaged after the queen trade.  White's best move would probably be to break up the rook fork and claim my bishop after the trade.<n>As I rather expected, though, after this move, white resigned.
Another options are 3. Nd2 (Tarrasch) and 3. e5 (Nimzowitsch).
The key move! 20. Nd2! intends Rf3, heading to f7. The Queen is not allowed to abandon the f file.
According to plan!
The attack has not vanished, yet!
I've never attempted a Two Bishop Mate before.<n>62. ... fxg4 would have made things easier for me.<n>I wanted to have a "pure" Two Bishops Mate with no other men on the board.<n>In retrospect I could have just promoted my third Pawn (to a Rook or Queen) and then forced White to take it.<n>I was completely willing to risk the easy mate I could have had by getting a Queen for a chance to attempt the Two Bishops.
Shredder:<n>65. f6 lose in 19 BEST<n>65. Kd3 lose in 18
I really want to get rid of that Pawn...
I was concerned as to whether I can keep the White King away.
Shredder:<n>69. Ke5 lose in 16<n>69. Kd6 lose in 17 BEST
Shredder:<n>73. Kf4 lose in 12<n>73. Kd3 also loses in 12<n>73. Kf3 also loses in 12
Eventually I realised that I needed to move my King down to free up one of the Bishops...
Without Lasker's QP in the center, this move threatens to seize it for Black.
Black creates a retreat for the B and guards against 7 N-N5.
Cutting off another diagonal and creating a flight square at K2.
Forking Q and R. If 11... KxN, 12 QxP ch K-B1 13 Q-B7 mate. So Black resigns.
in order to mowe f4 after castle
surprise ! <n>i didnt expect this risky sacrifice, i'll try to move the king in g1 after eat this agresive bishop
anoiding knight, i'll try to go on treatening f7 whith the queen after Kc5 x Bb3
surprise, it' becoming hard for white<n>but it give me a oportunity to keep my white bishop whith Bc3 c2
i have to eat it, to dangerous
that was sure ! but i found a response whith Bf3, if he take it then i take it back whith the rook a treat the black queen
this exchange was not very interesting also for black, it shows that they have no more plans<n>so a good oportunity to regain the initiative
good, but not enought : <n>23. Qd5 - surely c6 ignoring the treate of the f1 rook whith the a3 bishop ...
It was nive, but if somebody know about the opening, thanks in advance !
White opens up the kingside.
?? Relatively better is to try and develop.
it has been a very long time since I have had to face the panov attack. I predict that I will have no trouble in this game as I am very skilled in handling the panov
this is a slight edge to black because he has a lead in development
in exchange for the rook I gain superior piece play and attacking chances
the resulting position after the exchange is that black is better because he has a major lead in development and piece mobility
with the idea to play Rc4 with a massive edge
increases the influence of the bishop and denying white an good developing square on f4
Black gives up his second rook but the trade is good for black because the bishop pair will rule the board
preparing an escape avenue for the bishop
The bishop is well positioned to join in the king hunt that is about to begin in haste
attempting to activate the rook
Not vital to return to knight to f3.  White losing tempi by moving the same Knight so often.
Black prepares Be7 and with the two central pawns has the flexibility of moving to d5 or e5 later
White was eyeing Bh6, while Black moved Rfe8 to take away the target and protect Be7.
White wanted to place his Knight on g5, then advance f-pawn
Black took some time over 14...Ne5 as he also considered d5. He said he knew f4 pawn move was coming after the Ke5 so the next choice was where to put the Queen for a check.<n>Check to drive King away from defence of Rf1.  He said he chose the bolder Qc5 rather than Qb6, just to improve Black's presence in the center.
17.Ned7?? wrong move.  Capturing the strong bishop on d3 is a no brainer. Black said he wanted to land the Knight on the weak g3 square. But with this move Black is giving back all the advantage he gained and the Queen looks misplaced on c5. A protected Rook on f5 looks juicy.
With this move Black wanted to shake things up in the center.
White starts to move his pieces to the Kingside. Black weakens his pawn structure to deal with the pressure.
Again, where to put the Queen.  It's looking after a weak pawn,it's not the job for a Queen.
Black is looking at the f2 Rook to attack if his bishop goes to h4. White attack is slow in coming maybe a few equal exchanges will take the sting out of it.
While White was fooling about with the Queen, offering no immediate threats.  Black contorts his pieces to protect and get them into a better attacking position. Bishop can take over from Queen, who intended to head for d8 to link with both Be7 and Rook.
calm before the storm
White felt he could attack with tempo if when moving the Nf3 in front of the doubled rooks.  But it didn't go the way he was expecting.
just to pause again, White expected the Black Queen to move.
Black considered Qc3 and Qa1 because there the Knight can move and attack Queen but with a1 and c3 if 1. Knight moves Bxf2 2. Nxc3 (or Nxa1) Be4 and has won another pawn with tempo.  It's still a tricky endgame in time trouble, to Queen a pawn.  But with two Bishops every square can be covered.<n><n>In the post mortem it was pointed out Qa4 was out of danger of the Knight but Black wanted the Queen in a dominant position and a dark square meant less thinking time worrying about White's Bishop.
White decided to on the Queen exchange.
Nd6, Ne4, it will take two moves to position this knight somewhere good, giving white opportunity to develop his pieces.
PxBe4 isn't going to wait forever.
Mm, I kind of like Be3 to protect that pawn.  RxPd4 would be a terrible idea, since Be3 would pin black's rook against the queen.  QxPd4 is the way to go here.
White might think Be3 will pin black's queen against the a7 rook, but black can respond with QxPe4, giving time to move the rook out of harm's way.
Every trade now counts to black's advantage.
Black does not need another queen.  Here Kf7 would probably help end the game quicker.  Time to run the white king up against the edge of the board and gut him.
black has no space to play.
This is a game at the Dutch youth championship. I'm black and play against an opponent with a rating of 2080. My rating then was 1520 (Although it should be about 1800 I think). After the opening I'm standing worse, and start to play for a draw, at which I succeed in the end.
Up to this point I new how to play, but this move was a bit new for me. I played c5 here since after e5, the normal move most of the times, 7. dxe5 dxe5 8. Qxd8 Rxd8 9. Nd5 black is clearly worse and already losing material.
I knew that because of this move I would have to exchange my bishop for a knight, I didn't see anything else. I don't think it's a bad move because the knight could be more usefull in this position because of the linked pawns. Also, I needed to bring my bishop out and exchange pieces because my position is a bit cramped.
I needed a plan here, but didn't really have one. Nb6 isn't a good move as the knight doesn't really do anything on b6. perhaps better was Qb6, perhaps followed by doubling the rooks on the e-file.
I think I shouldn't have traded the rooks, but first do Qc7. This creates the possibility Nf6-d7-e5. I don't need to hurry to trade the rooks.
I should've played Rxe1 here and after that Qc7 and the knight manouvre. Nh5 is rather useless and only give white time to get a better position.
Now the knight can't go to d7 because the pawn on d6 was attacked. My position is getter and from this moment I'm only playing for a draw.
My hopes for a draw were big now. My plan was the moves h6, g5, Nf6-e8-d6, f6, and a5. If I would get the time for that, it would be a complete draw.
This threatens to break open the queenside, so I need to close that. This gives white the time to try something.
I hadn't seen this coming, but I don't think it's that good. I lose a pawn, but I can also exchange a piece after which a draw get closer.
If I can exchange all the kingside pawns, it a draw. I put my king on d6 and my bishop moves along the d8-h4 diagonal and white can't get through. So my plan was to exchange pawns. Just don't really do anything and till white plays his pawns up the board.
I moved my bishop here to bind the king to the defence of the g-pawn and also set a trap to make it a permanent draw....
And he falls for the trap. It was a draw anyway, but he might have tried something with Be3-h7-g8. After that, I just move my bishop to the b8-h2 diagonal.
And after this move, white can't get through. I just moved my kink from e7 to d6 and nothing happens anymore. He still plays more then 13 moves, I think because of the rating difference.
This is the Ruy , known for it's ability to maintain longterm pressure on the black position.
Known to be the best reply , after Bxc6 black will play dxc6 and after Nxe4 black will regain the pawn with Qd4 and an equal position.
The only reply to try to retain the advantage as after Nc3 Black will play Bc5 with an easy game.
Another idea is a4 trying to undermine the extended queenside.
Known as the classical ruy, this move allows the marshall gambit to be played. If someone wishes to avoid the gambit again a4 is the key. That is known as the antimarshall variation.
Blck leaps to the attack and now 14.h3 looks very dangerous due to Bxh3 so g3 is virtually forced. But after g3 the light squares around the white king are very weak so black will have good play for the sacrificed pawn.
A little trick in the marshall is when the queen moves to any other square other than d3 and black's plays Bf3 when mate can't be avoided on g2.
Declining the exchange as this would kill black's intiative.
A common move in the marshall which prepares a rook swing to g6 or h6. Another idea is f5.
Black ignores the threats to the queenside as winning another pawn doesn't help white with his kingside problems.
Black prepares an eventual f4 push which would rip apart the kingside.
Stopping f4 but , pinning in the dark squared bishop; probably the best move.
Black goes for the all out kingside attack and also avoids the exchange of rooks that would happen if the e- file opened. Black will then play Qg4 and gxf4 with a big attack.
A move that wins a second pawn but allows a flury of tactics to arise to which are in black's favor . Still , it's hard to see a constructive plan for white.
!The key move as this blasts open the kingside.
?! a move which wins a queen for two rooks but Rxf4 was better. After Rxf4 , if Qxf4  Rxg5  and the white king has to go to h1 as Kf2... Rf5 wins the queen and after Kh1 ...Bg2 Kh1 Bh3 Qxg5 Qxg5 Kh1 Qxd2 black wins a piece
Karpov is acknowledging his current position and is defending rather than attacking. He plays ...h6 to prevent the white knight from invading via ...g5
What is the plan! By exchanging the dangerous Bishop black weakens his opponents attacking chance.
! Seizing the center and the initiative
Black has exploited his chances in the best way possible. He has precise targets for his attack and complete justification to look to the future with optimism. White has no counter play, and the pawn weaknesses at a3,c3 and h5 make their defence extremely unpleasant.
A new try. Some annoyance can spread now from Qe2+, but nothing unhandable.
The isolated d pawn is not easy to handle.
?? Qa4+ and I'll lose the N! The idea was to avoid Qe2 after Qd7+, disturbing the developement of white's lsb and considering Nd3+ (BxN it's a clean B pair for black).
? Probably trying to castle Kside, but still Bg2 was needed.
Where to go? After a double threat, of course.
This was the point- but not enough to save the game.
Grabbing the edge.
I can let white take b7. I'll lose an exchange, but I will be able to use the tempo.
I can play Rc4+ and after Kb3 I'll lose a piece.
This was to avoid any escape for the b pawn.
The GPA
This is I think the best move, and is a relative novelty with the planned sacrifice. The fxg lines are weak against the uncastled black king, as they give black some breathing space opening the h file for his rook. Black needs to play very accurately for the next few moves to wriggle out of white's mating threats. The subtlety of Bb3 is to permit black to win the bishop on white's terms.. ie. not dc (opening the d file for an annoying check by the black queen on d4) but ..c4, ..cb, and after ab white can whip his rook into the attack via a4.
White can avoid the sacrifice with 9. Ba4, 10. Bxc6 if he wants, although this is fine for black.

"When ahead, exchange into a winning endgame". Except when the piece being exchanged (the black-square bishop) is important for defence. This is a weak move for black.
I briefly considered the silly dc (making 2 sets of doubled pawns) with the intention of bringing the bishop on c1 into the battle. But this is not necessary.  Preferable is to capture towards the centre, bringing the bishop in next move via d4. White needs to keep one eye on the endgame if black survives the attack
I started with pawn to e4 and black replied with e5.
We mirrored each other with knight to f3 and knight to f6.
I moved knight to c3 and black answered with DB to c5 attacking pawn at f2.
I moved pawn to d4 and DB retreated to d6.
I moved my LB to b5 protected by c3 knight and black moved pawn to c6 attacking my LB.
I pushed pawn to d5 and black moved pawn to c5.
I moved DB to g5 attacking knight at g6 and black pushed his pawn to a5.
I brought my C knight back to e2 as I want to bring them together at f3 and g3. Black moved pawn out to b6 supporting his c and a pawns.
I moved my E knight to g3 and black pushed his a pawn again to a4.
I now stop a pawn's progress with pawn to a3.  I do not intend letting black into the queen side.  Black moves his rook down to a5 but I don't intend letting him move it out of that square.
I move my LB to a2 and black moves pawn to b4.
I move my f3 knight to d2 attacking the b3 pawn.  Black moves his LB to a6 now pointing at my queen on e2.  Its a party on the a file!
I move my queen out to f3 and black takes LB with b pawn and now there are 3 pawns on the 'A' file!  At this stage black could have taken my F rook with his bishop and that would have left me with a pawn ab out to take my B rook so would have created difficulties.  When I look at my king side I see I cannot progress with the queen still at d8 so I would have been hoping that my opponent would move this soon!  There was the f5 square for my knight which would be safe.
I take pawn at a2 with my rook and black moves DB down to protect a3 pawn and attacking my knight at d2.
I move pawn to c3 and attack DB at b4 which moves back to c5.  My pawn was protected by queen at f3.  I am not sure I was aware when the bishop went to c5 of the implication to f2.  However I knew my next move would be rook to b1 and the black queen would be at risk so was not concerned about attack on f2.  If black had proceeded with this move then it would have changed things.  Queens would have been exchanged and game would definitely have gone a different way.
I now move 'F' rook across to b1 and take control of b file protected by knight at d2 so black queen moves away to c7.  If I was black I would have moved my a5 rook out to b5 as it was protected by a6 and put up a fight for the b file.  If black had got the DB at c5 out of the way the queen would have been able to get down the c file and defend.  I am not sure the pawns were worth fighting over while the king was left with a knight and a rook.
I move my pawn to c4 and DB moves down to d4 attacking f2 pawn.  The knight at d2 and my c4 pawn are a great pair as the a6 LB is thwarted by this move and if the LB were to move to b7 would only be blocked by pawns on the h1 to a8 diagonal.
I move my g knight to f5 threatening to take pawn at g7 or checking at d7 but queen would capture so this move is not available.  Black moves pawn to d6 which allows queen to protect pawn at f7 and to cover d7 and e7 squares.
I take black's f6 knight with my DB and now attacking g7.  Black moves his LB to d4 attacking my rook at a2.
With my next move I move my knight to h6 checking the king who moves out of check to h8.  I did not leave my queen on f3 as my DB was still there but I could have moved up to f5 but I may have been concerned that queen would have been under attack where on g3 black pawns were shielding the queen.  I knew I could take LB with my d2 knight but this piece was occupied with covering the B rook.  I was getting ready for mate so did not see any reason for captures at this stage.
Black has not had a chance to take my rook on a2 and I now capture another pawn at a3.  Black moves down one of his doubled pawns on f file to f5.
I capture f5 pawn with my knight and black moves his DBfrom d4 to c5.  Also the DB is now attacking my rook at a3.
Black resigns. After 37...KxR; 38 Q-K6 , K-B1; 39 Q-B8  mates.--Fischer
Unnecessarily blocks in the KB and cramps Black's position. 3... B-B4 is the correct move.
Bernstein, quite properly, tucks away his King befor engaging in complications.
Another bad move. 4... N-B3, or even 4... N-R3 to add extra protection to the KBP, would allow 5... B-K2 and 6... O-O, getting the King to a relatively safe spot.
Opening the diagonal fully for the Bishop and ensuring his King will never have a safe haven.
Forcing the monarch to bestir himself.
Adding force to the attack.
In spite of removing the Q, Black is still mated in 2 moves.
Forcing the King to...
The opening for fast games and the one to use if you trust your attacking instincts. I've mated a lot of people with sharp opening play in as little as 15 moves. It has its risks, but it's also loads of fun, as long as you know to expect some losses once in a while.
The typical response in the O'Kelly.
The natural response, opening lines and targeting the intrusive White Knight at f5
I think the prophylactic 8..h6 would have given black a very easy game due to the weak d4 square and to his solid center.
The Knight has landed! It sure is easy to plan an attack with a central Knight lodged into the enemy position.
Aiming for the Black castle and even envisioning a pawn storm on the king side.
Black has a Knight of his own he can lodge in the center, but his plan is focused on the queen side. I always go for the King when I can help it.
Trying to undermine Withe's queen side and fantasizing about removing the Knight from d5
White secures the foothold in the center.
Starting to conjure threats on the Black monarch.
A bold sacrifice meant at activating the f6 Bishop and at removing the support pawn for the Knight, the drawback of it is that it has the almost the same effects for the Black position
Removing the Rook from the Bishop's line of fire and exchanging it for Black's active one.
I'm not so sure this is a good move, it keeps the initiative for Black, but at a very high cost, activating the white squared Bishop with drastic effects on the security of the Black King.
The fortress has fallen.
A desperate attempt to stall the outcome for one more move.
Hi everyone!<n><n>After the events of the last few days, boy I am sooo glad to get back to some normality.  Homework.  This HW is for my Mentor, Drhpatron who I have had some fairly good games with even though I lost the lot.  This game starts off OK and then goes south for me after an injudicious knight trade and that familiar dread disease, passivitis sets in.  David then injects a paralysis into my position so that I finally run out of moves that avoid further damage to my position.  Much to my horror, David then erects a mating net around Henry of which he cannot escape.  He is then hunted down and ruthlessly but elegantly executed as my buddy Gerhard (Chicoboy) stated!
2. f4 - David decided to give me the Sicilian so I start the Grand Prix Attack.  I wonder if it will lead into the Master Mater's (Easy19's) annotation project?  We shall see.
5. Bb5+ - nope, it ain't gonna be that annotations project and it will soon be like the Rossolimo Variation but with d4 not yet played.  I never get round to playing that move until it becomes detrimental to me, sigh and double sigh!
6. ..... bxc6 - I can't resist it can I, Ion, I give up Fou Leblanc for a knight to split up my opponent's pawns and it will not be to my benefit.
10. e5 - attempting to shut out David's dark square bishop.
12. Nxe2 - at least the queens are off the board and I remember telling David that I thought that Henry could sleep a little more peacefully in his 4 poster bed!  How wrong I was to be!
13. d3?! - maybe d4 was better at this point.  Incredibly I never get to develop Fou Lenoir and this ties up the whole of my queenside.
15. Rd1 - I defend the pawn on d3 for now but it is gonna be a target.  I am now rueing not offering it up for David's c pawn to exchange it on d4.
17. ..... Rb3 - another invasion and I never get to drive it off.  I try and break free by trading knights but this makes things soooo much worse.
24. Rd1 - over the last few moves I have had to scratch around while David improves his position still further.  I get the feeling like I got when I lost to the Dentist many moons ago and Coach Ion and Dmaestro said that they both felt that I waited for the executioner.  My instinct was sadly right.  Like Henry the 8th in The Tudors, David has already ordered that executioner from France by DHL!
25. ..... Rc2 - cutting off Henry's retreat to the 2nd rank.  Yup, I really am feeling like Anne Boleyn right now!
Committing to a plan too early in the game can be dangerous. Black is committing to fianchettoing his kingside bishop on only the second move.
One thing about me is that I don't like to waste moves taking pawns. I develop another piece while Black has yet to develop.<n>One might think Qxd4 is a good move since it attacks Black's rook while centralizing the queen, but it's a risky move so if you want to play it, do it at your own risk.
Black could've held onto the pawn with 4...e5, and I can't play Nxe5?? because of Qa5 ! winning the knight. But it's okay, I don't want to waste a move taking the pawn anyway.
I have three very strongly placed pieces in the centre, plus a pawn and queen giving additional support. While all Black has is one piece developed and a cramped position. Playing this opening as White is risky because Black may recover and hold onto his extra pawn, but I love to take risks in chess since it makes it more fun.
Black needs to secure the squares on the third rank to make his position solid before he can comfortably complete development, but by then I'll have already launched an attack.
Clearing way to bring my rook to the d-file. I shouldn't develop my queenside bishop yet since there isn't a clear place for it to be developed. I should develop my sharper pieces first and then a proper place for my bishop will come into play.
If Black leaves his queen on the original square, then I will have a lot of tactical threats on the d-file and dark squares, and Black's position will be even more cramped.
Since my bishop doesn't have an active role yet, I decide to clear the way for my rooks to double on the d-file, while enticing Black to play e5, which will weaken the light squares in his position, especially d5.
Black plays the tempting e5, weakening d5.
Black needs to be careful not to fianchetto his bishop because his d-pawn is very weak, especailly after I double my rooks on the d-file.
Black can't think of anything to do. This is because of his heavily cramped position.
My knight is strong on the weak d5-square, while it joins with my bishop's attack on the weak b6-square.
Further weakening the d-pawn, but Black probably just wants to castle here.
Black's dark bishop is the only thing capable of defending the pawn, so Black cannot fianchetto his bishop like he was intending.
Look how much territory and control my pieces have. Now Black has to struggle to defend f7. It doesn't really feel like I'm down a pawn.
I have a tactical threat of Nxg6 fxg6 Qxg6  winning the rook. Black tries to make a counter threat on the next move but it turns out to be a blunder. Blunders are common when you're in a cramped position and can't do anything. Black could've tried Rg7, which would leave me with a more complicated win that I would have to work harder for.
I am pounding on Black's weak d-pawn, and he cannot take because of Rd8  Nxd8 Rxd8#
Black stops my threat of Nxg6 by moving his queen to the 7th rank to defend his rook.
Now that I have gotten my pawn back, I can be comfortable with my attack since Black doesn't have the pawn to compensate for his cramped position.
Black defends the knight while adding another defender to d8.
It's time to break through to Black's hopeless passive cramped position and put him out of his misery.
Black knew that if he declined the sacrifice, his misery would last longer when he's down a few pawns in a hopeless passive position. His first instinct must've been to accept it, giving me a faster more brilliant win.
Now an array of tactical threats crush Black. Black has four legal moves, three of which will immediately lose material. Black chooses the one that doesn't lose material, and actually gets mated.
Black probably overlooked my forced mate. He could've suffered longer with Rf7 Bxf7 Qxf7 Qxf7 Kxf7 Rd7  then Rxb7, which would leave me with a winning endgame, two rooks and an extra pawn against his rook and knight.
Black tries to flee but.......
The text move, and Nf6 are the only ways Black can keep equality.<n>Other less agressive moves will leave me with a small advantage due to my strong centre.
5. e5 isn't a good choice for me because after Black brings out his queen's bishop and plays e6, the game will transpose into a French game, (e4 e6 d4 d5 e5 c5) but where Black's bishop isn't sitting passively on c8 blocked by the pawn on e6.
Be3 is less accurate because it doesn't help me clear the way for castling kingside, and the bishop would also be passive, unlike the knight which also adds control of the central e5 square.
6...Bg4 is better because it actively places Black's bishop, unlike now where it is blocked.
Tempo.
7...Bb4 is worse, because even though it develops a piece instead of retreating one, I can simply play Bd3 and O-O, then the queen will have to retreat anyway, leaving the bishop on an unimportant square, because ...Bxc3 bxc3 strengthens my centre.
Black must be careful not to fall for my cheap trick of 8...Nxd4? 9. Nxd4 Qxd4?? 10. Bb5 , winning Black's queen.
Black can play h6 and g5, but it weakens his position and it places my bishop on the more tempologically correct g3-square.
A risky move. I decided to sacrifice my isolated pawn to add to my slight lead in development.
Now Black's queen has to move once again, because of all my tactical threats along the d-file.
Black's only hope of stopping my tempo gains is to trade queens.
A miniature tactic to take one of Black's bishops, leaving me with the strong bishop pair. Black cannot stop Nb6.
Now that I have the strong bishop pair, I can place them actively in the centre where they control both sides of the board.
Preparing to double my rooks on the wide open d-file.
Now if Black's bishop moves, I still have the tactical threat of Rxd7 Nxd7 Bxb7.
If I can get the rook for free, then I will be up a piece in the endgame, my strong 2 bishops against Black's defensive 1 knight.
Rd8 was the other move that defends the rook, but it allows me to trade rooks and get my pawn back with Bxb7, giving me a good bishop vs. knight endgame, where my bishop is stronger because there are pawns on both sides of the board, and his knight is too slow to jump across the board.
I must be careful not to play the losing Rxf5?? because Ke6 relieves the pin on Black's rook, while attacking my rook, and I don't have time to get my rook back and defend my own rook, so the endgame will be left with his strong mobile rook against my weaker bishop.
I prepare to bring my king to the centre for the ensuing endgame.
Now I've reached a rook endgame, which seems rather drawish. I play Re2 to stop Black's rook from coming to d2, where my queenside pawns are likely to die.
Black cannot stop my control of the e-file with Re4, because it isolates his pawn, and isolated pawns can be very weak in endgames, especially pure pawn endgames.
I was hoping Black would trade rooks here, because his kingside pawns are weaker than my kingside chain, and exploiting pawn weaknesses is easier in pure pawn endgames.
I thought moving the rook along the d-file was better because it keeps my king from advancing to the centre. This may have been Black's losing error, letting my king get to the centre.
My king is active in the centre while Black's is stuck on the kingside. If he doesn't retreat his rook and let me onto the 4th rank, I can play Kc3 forcing him to do so, because Re4, like I said, gives Black a weak isolated pawn.
I am planning to take advantage of Black's weak kingside pawns.
Black decides to counterattack my pawns instead of passively defending with Rc7.
The most important thing in endgames is to have active pieces. Black's king is inactively placed in the corner while my king and rook are actively directed toward Black's weak kingside pawns.
Kg6 is dubious because Ke5  takes his king away from his pawn and results in the same position as the actual game, but where Black hasn't played a5.
Black resigned. His two pawns can't promote faster than mine, and my king is defending all the squares I need for my pawn to promote.<n>The game would've continued g3 f7  Kd7 f8=Q and my queen would create numerous tactical threats to win the rest of Black's pawns.
Here I am playing as black, which I am still not very good at. This is probably the ugliest game I have played to date. Though, my awkward play on this game may have caused a bit of confusion for my opponent. At the time of this game his score was not 1555 due to his timeouts, but 1555 is his score at this time. Please feel free to comment. I know if I played him again he would probably do 1000 things different. I should have lost this one.
My pawn moves may look like wasted moves, but to me they are keeping those pesky knights from advancing. This is the first time I have ever opened up my game like this and it was the last.
This is a pretty awkward situation. Now I am regretting to have developed my pieces. My King is out in the open and I don't feel I have enough pieces to adequately provide the pressure needed to stay on the attack.
Apparently, we are about to exchange rooks. I am not to worried because I have a pawn just 2 moves away from being a Queen.
these last months i try to fight my own fear of offensives. I like the clean attacks, which always come to late against average or strong players. On gameknot, I try to find some places for sacrifices, to fight myself against that pressure; this is an example
white decided to occupy the center: a strong ambition
proposing to open
i decided on the last move to compensate white lack of offensive senses by mine.
preparing g and h to come and join the party.
and white seems decided to think there is nothing to do on the queen side.
this move kind of helped me= i had the intention to move my king to let my rook pass.
my knight is so able to participate to the party...
oho! i am losing a piece here... if Bg5, then f4 takes knight or bishop and destroy my attack, so...
... i decided to keep the attack
dangerous of course to align king and queen...
an exchange would lead to an easy winning for white
Rf2 may have been more inspired? No, because h3 was threatening another mate witht the pawn... but though... I think Rf2 was better
black has recuperate the disadvantage and is now on a winning position
doubling the enemy pawns and installing the knight + liberating the second rook; i think this is an excellent move
the white king has to be liberated, because the black king is going to the center and threatening Rh8 if able to pass on seventh line
seventh line... threatening directly the king, and forcing the rooks exchange
i have my time now... i decided to anticipate a potential counterattack
here i anticipated Nd1 followed by Nd7-Nc5 threatening the bishop, but also Kf6 and white is soon in a new zugzwang
I double-step my king's pawn to free his bishop and my queen...
...and I capture it, going to the exchange variation...
Now I bring out my knight on the queenside to attack her...
...and he develops his kingside knight to contest the light squares in the centre...
...and I now bring out my bishop, and decide to check the king...
...forcing his light-square bishop's pawn out to block...
He brings out his dark-square bishop to pin down my knight...
...so I bring up mine to unpin it, and to keep a reasonable pawn structure should the bishop capture...
...and he castles kingside...
...and he attacks my light-square bishop with a pawn...
...but his pawn sees to that...
..so I retreat my queen to cover the pawn under threat from the knight...
...and he fianchettos his light-square bishop, no doubt hoping to eventually attack my pawn on g2...
...so I attack its twin with the pawn in front of my inactive rook...
...forcing it to the only safe square to attack my king...
...and he moves his dark-square bishop's pawn to pressure mine furthest forward...
...and he recaptures with his rook...
...so I attack his rook with my knight...
...and I now attack his isolated king's pawn...
...and he moves his knight forwards to a safe place...
...and I capture his pawn with my knight, forking his queen and rook...
He moves the wrong rook to attack my knight (if it stayed put) or queen (if it moved)...
...but I can capture his other rook with my knight...
..and lose it to the bishop, meaning that I won the exchange by a rook and pawn for a knight.
...and I pressure his knight with my remaining rook...
...paving the way clear for my rook to advance to the top rank, so I can fork the king and bishop, ending his challenge.
Probably my lowest point in this game.  I thought that he'd have to ruin his pretty king side structure to defend against this piece (I was thinking 11. h3), but apparently that was not the case
Similarly I felt nervous at this point... I need to learn how to deal with backwards pawns in the middle.  Or atleast I should atleast remember to avoid them.
Another low point, I was sure that he'd win at this point with a safe advanced pawn.  Castle queen side, advance the C and F pawn to destroy my interior and I would be screwed.
Another reason why you don't advance the f pawn before you are secure.  His e pawn was well defended by 2 pieces and was at no risk.
At this point he resigned due to the obvious 26... Bg4 which would have secured me at a 7 piece advantage with a weak, but sufficient, pawn structure and support.  I would like to thank Alin for putting on a great game and having the better of me for most of the game.
.I played C20 Portuguese opening, as a surprise weapon, it allows black to easily equalize the game, but he has to know how to do it, also allows some dangerous tactics to the unaware... black mishandled it, and overextended his queen side pawns, postpone the castle and underdeveloped his pieces... all this means certain loss, in a short game.
It makes sense to advance the c pawn before Nc6, Noha's ark maybe the other idea from black
resembles a Ruy Lopez with an overextended pawn chain by black, d5 is the week square for black now, my main ideas are the pawn break a2-a4 and an outpost in d5
transposing to a Ruy Lopez but with black under developed and over extended in the queen's wing
? black might try to exchange the light squared bishops with Be6
again more presure over f7, and a little trap if hxg5 then Qxh8 gains a quality
and now black only option is to capture with the queen exchanging rook and two pawns for two minor pieces: 10...Qxf7 11.Nxf7 gxh5 12.Nxh8 Ne7 and the knight is trapped but the h pawn soon drops
removing the queen from danger, and if hxg5 then Bxg5 wins the queen
The lack of developed pieces and the absence of castle allowed some tactics against f7, the resulting game would lead to in an material imbalance of tow minor pieces and two pawns for a rook, with the queens of the board and a majority of white pawns in the king's wing...
The battle here is for central squares, this move doesn't address the issue.  I'd consider directing force against the e5 square with Bd5, C5 later to pressure whites control of this square, and Nc6 with Re8 all keeping the center under lock.  I'm a Tarrasch player, I don't mind an Iso from time to time.
Horrible Blunder it seems.  He can throw a few pieces at the king, there's no reason why black can't toss his attack aside and win.  Worst case, navigate through f7 and reposition king on queenside, I'd take the rook after a 2 second think.
Not enough. He's looking Ne5 and queen invasion, hitting king and e6 pawn, there is no mate here unless it's handed over. Black has Nf5 stopping both threats, although this leads to a little skewer, giving back the material still leaves black up a piece, some consolidating moves, and it's an easy victory.
Queen protecting the pawn gives more flexibility, and pawn hits the bishop on h-file, queen could help out more than the rook.  And after the pawn move, (with queen protecting) Rook f4 saves the day and the threat is over. Doesn't look best, but even moving the king away might help out a bit more.
Qc8 picked up b7 and d5, there's no mate here, abondon the idea and secure endgame win. Emotional players, eh? And i think i would've taken the bishop a few moves ago.  I lost a game at the NJ HS championship by postponing to take a piece... I won't do that again, under normal circumstances.
NO! NxR so the rook can't support or take the knight afterwards.  The black king looks, trouble...
? Re1/d3 was better. There are key problems with my position I am already missing - such as how the queen attacks a4 should the b4 pawn be moved and the pin on the knight protecting it - in short my pawn fork really threatens nothing!
Instead of Nh3 which would allow Black to weaken my kingside I attack the pawn...
I think I ought to have taken the bishop at this point - Black would be winning in the resulting positing but I would still have had reason to play on! Instead, I'm thinking that I can be clever here....
!! Goodnight White! If I want to play on I play without my queen - 18.Bc2 Bxd1 is best but of course completely losing! I resign after my next move after spending about 15 minutes considering how Re8 after Qxg4 leads to my doom while overlooking the obvious move!
Hi everyone!<n><n>If you have been following my annotation about Pawn Fork Part 1, you will notice that I made a Bad Draw Offer because of planless play in a won position.  However, I felt so much better after this game because my opponent was the same opponent that I gave that draw to.  I ended up with a two pawn advantage in the late stages of the middlegame but kept my eyes firmly averted from the Offer Draw button and somehow worked out how to gain a much needed victory to get my Class A status back.  My opponent kicks off with c4 which is the English Opening and you can follow the action with the following link to Gameknot Analysis.<n><n>http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15650010&fb=1&rnd=0.3572556454226388
13. ..... 0-0 - both kings castle kingside.
17. .... f6 - to screen out the white dsb's attack down the a1-h8 diagonal.
30. ..... Qxa3 - I decided to rid myself of one set of rooks before swiping off the a3 pawn.  I now have two connected passed pawns on the queenside and they are my two extra pawns.  They should be enough to win but I must now convert this win.  Concentrate, Joanne, concentrate.
33. Qf4 - defending the pawn on f5.
34. ..... Qb8 - I do not mind a WR on my 7th rank as I now have the opportunity to exchange queens.  I have worked out that I can somehow shepherd one of those two passers down to Glendadom but it will be a matter of technique.
37. Ke4 - after allowing me to initiate the queen trade and the WK moving towards the queenside I now decided that it was to be the a pawn to have the honour of the march towards Glendadom.
40. ..... Ra8! - not a2? as the WK can blockade it with Kb2 and Ka1.  This ensures that at the very least, white must give up her rook for Glenda.  This is exactly what happens.  It is amazing, that at the sight of a big black queen, how many opponents wave that white flag.  Gail duly waved it as soon as Glenda appeared.  Gail would have been a whole rook and pawn to the bad and my rook would have no trouble in cleaning up the white pawns and then checkmating the WK.  I hope this will help if you do get stuck in a won position but you are wondering just how to convert it.  I hope you have a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne
This game is famous for the concluding combo and the report that Curt von Bardeleben didn't bother to resign but simply got up and walked away without a word..Sour grapes or what! He resigned later on that day! Steinitz was definitely past his best in 1895, but as he himself said, "I may be an old lion, but I can still bite someone's hand off if he puts it in my mouth."
Black keeps it symetrical and also stakes a claim for the centre.
There are no really solid alternatives here apart from Philidors defence 2....d6 which is indeed solid however has seen little use at master level because it is deemed rather passive. There are some other gambits which are shaky to say the least; 2...f4 The Latvian Gambit; or 2...d5 The bizzarely named Elephant Gambit.
This moves signals the beginning of the Italian game. The development of white's bishop to c4 prepares castling, eyes up the f7 pawn and hinders an early d5 by black. This is obviuosly not as popular as its durable neighbour the Ruy Lopez. This is because in most accounts black has a pretty simple route to equality in all directions. However this obviously wasn't realized in the 19th century as it was seen quite often at master level.
This is the Giuoco Piano. There are three moves now to be considered. <n>1) 4.c3 followed by an immediate d4. If balck isn't careful he can end up very lost, very quickly, but theoretically White struggles to equalize against precise defence.<n>2) The Giuoco Pianissimo ('Very quiet game') variations with  d3.<n>3) 4.b4!?, the Evan's Gambit, which has been tried by several strong modern players i.e. Nigel Short and even Gary Kasparov.<n>4)Nc3 The Italian four knights which often transposes into lines of the Giuoco Pianissimo.
Black takes advantage of whites inability to defend his e4 pawn with Nc3 by attacking it. One lesser alternative includes d6 which aims to defend the e5 pawn from the inevitable advance, however this is an old fashioned move which has now been deemed obsolete.
?!Steinitz was willing to sac a pawn or more in return for a lead in development. Curt von Bardeleben declines the offer to win material by (7...Nxe4) and immediately strikesback in the centre. The struggle now shifts to the battle for the control of d5. A rare alternative to 7...Nxe4 8.O-O, when Black may choose between 8...Nxc3 9.bxc3 d5 [9...Bxc3 10.Qb3 has been known to be very good for White since the time of Greco] and the speculative Moller Attack, 8...Bxc3 9.d5, now thought to lead to a draw with best play.
Steinitz was again willing to sacrifice another pawn,i.e. 9...Nxc3 10. bxc3 Bxc3, in return for rapid development and again Curt von Bardeleben  prefers to concentrate on reinforcing his control over what he percieves the criucial square, d5.
Black still hopes to connect his Rooks by castling, but he will be unable to shake off the pressure on the central files. A slightly better try was 13...Kxe7 14.Re1  Kf8.
This pins the Knight to the King.
Steinitz initiated the preceding series of exchanges for a subtle yet ingenious reason. Now Curt von Bardeleben can't castle, because he needs his king to guard the knight. He now hopes to escape his predicament by playing his king to f7 and then a rook to e8, but does he have enough time? I dont tink so!
Allowing a powerful pawn sacrifice. Better was 16...Kf7, and if 17.Qxe7  Qxe7 18.Rxe7  Kxe7 19.Rxc7 , the ending is by no means clear, though White will have enough pawns for the Exchange.
Steinitz has sacrificed the d- pawn in order to clear the d4 square for his knight. The time gained to bring the knight into the attack is worth more than one measly pawn. Notice how Von  Bardeleben's rooks still stand on their original squares.
Of course the Rook cannot be captured by the Queen (22...Qxe7 23.Rxc8 ) and 22...Kxe7 leads to 23.Re1  Kd6 24.Qb4  Kc7 25.Ne6  Kb8 26.Qf4 . But after Black's next move, every White piece is en prise, and mate is threatened on c1...
If 30...Kd6 31.Ne4  dxe4 32. Rd1   removes the mate threat and wins the black queen.
CHECKMATE! Von Bardeleben walked away from the board without playing out playing the final sequence which is bad manners but understandable. I know if I'd been in his shoes I would have been extremely frustrated by my inability to to move anything other than his king for so long! I hope you liked this game. I'm happy for positive and negative feedback aslong as its constructive criticism! and feel freee to leave comments.<n>Thanks<n>Tom
Gotta keep up the defenses on the d4 pawn. I also considered 6. d5 but then I thought black would just go with 6. ... Ne5 for more pressure on my knight at f3.
I was hoping for 9. ... Bxc3  so I could play 10. Pxc3 and put a pawn on defense of my d4 pawn, and also creating a threat at b7.
Black evidently wanted to prevent that pressure on b7. But 9. ... b6? costs him a piece. Now he's on pins and needles...
I had wanted to play Pxc3 but I feared I would lose my advantage on c6. I think, however, that after 11. Pxc3 black has no way to save his knight. 11. ... Qd7, 12. Qa4 and the knight still falls. 11. ... Qd6, 12 Qa4 Kd7, 13 e5 wins a different piece, although I think this line would have been best for black since he would then play 13. ... Qd5 threatening my pawn on f3 and then my rook on h1, which might almost force me to liquidate with 14. Bxc3  and after all the exchanges, I would be only up a knight for a pawn, with isolated pawns on d4, f3, f2, and h2. So after all that, I decided to just double up my assault on c6.
Here I overlooked 12. ... Ke7 which saves black's rook and only lets me gain a piece (the knight I just took). AFter 13. Qxd6 pxd6 my attack is finished and I am only a knight ahead. Not 13. ... Kxd6? because of 14. e5 . My correct sequence would have been 12. Bxc6  K~, 13. Bxa8 Rxa8 leaving me up a rook instead of just a knight.
But black missed his better continuation and traded queens, allowing me to capture his rook after all. After the game he confessed to me that he didn't know he could not castle out of check - he had planned on castling queen-side to save both king and rook.
To liquidate pieces, of course. And to open a file, if black will let me.
Taking the open file. The threat is Rg7 and Rh7 and Rxh6, creating a passed pawn for white. Black could immediately defend by Kf8 to defend g7, but then white can castle, then double the rooks on the g-file at which time the king becomes inadequate defense. Or black can defend by getting his rook to h8 before white gets to h7, but this ties his only rook to tedious defense.
Defends the pawn at d4 and prepares to double rooks on the g-file, though that means bringing my king up to c3 for pawn defense.
To prevent b4 and White is forced to what seems an awkward Knight retreat.  Our database seems to suggest that castling is fine and the text clearly wastes time.
Looking for some counter-play.  If Black is drawn into 11. ... e5 then White can reestablish himself with 12. Nd5.
Cuts off the Bishop's attack on the King's pawn, which had been preventing the massacre that follows.  I am unsure what Black's better option was.
White gets a little over-eager.  15. Nxe5 and Black must trade Queens (leaving White in control on the Queen's file, no less) or retreat and White has his tempo back with the gain of a piece for a pawn.  The text leads to chaos.
White, in the final reckoning, traded a minor piece for two pawns.  He has moderately better development, but his Queen looks vulnerable and his pawn structure is non-existent.  His only chance is to push the Queen-side (where he has a pawn majority by some miracle) hard and fast, but the Knight is in the way.
Retreating the bishop was in order because of the placement of White's King and Rook.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is my second game in my match, Jo against The Titans.  It is against my Master buddy Janet.  Things seemed ok until the middlegame when Fou Leblanc got caught in a Noah's Ark type of trap but this time it was on the kingside.  I played on and tried to counter-attack but unfortunately her extra piece proved way way stronger than my pawn and her rook and bishop were enough to ensure that I had to choose between losing ruinous amounts of material or allowing sudden death.  I allowed the latter.  How did this happen?  Well, here is the game: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18563516&fb=1&rnd=0.8143384377108815
12. Ne5 - this makes it impossible to create a bolt-hole with h3?? because of NxB and my f pawn cannot recapture because it is pinned!
17. ...... Qh4 - hoping for a perpetual but Janet prevents this by moving her king forward.  I try and lose my bishop in the most destructive way possible and that is to break up Janet's kingside pawns and to increase my chances of creating a perpetual check later on.  However, Janet ensures that this is not to be.
21. ..... Rfe8 - cannot avoid the queen trade else my pawn on b7 will fall.  I decided to exchange on my terms by putting a rook onto the e column so that I will be in a position to double rooks on the e column on the take-back.
26. ..... R4e7 - this retreat is forced.  If I move my other rook to e7 then Rd8+.
I believe black still has a task to equalize here and find ways of dealing with both white's e4-d4 centre, 'spanish' b3 bishop and eliminate weaknesses on c file. Hence I played by a standard plan preparing c5.<n>It seems g4 was better, as white has problems with protecting his d4 pawn.
Here I noticed white was threatening to start a strong attack with e5!, and decided to prevent that by moving my knight to g7, also preparing f5.
?<n>Second mistake in a row. I had to give up my bishop with moves such as Nc6 or Bb7.
?<n>After this move, black gets some hopes of activity against white king (and decides not to resign for a few more moves!). In view of what happened in the game, Rf1 was better.
?<n>It's black's turn to be demoralized by the flip of the board. The Queen was needed for protecting e4, and the a5 knight does not matter. Necessary was 30. Ne2 Rxe2 31. Rxe2 Qxe2

The e5 pawn is safe, but not for long, so white defends it against future attacks.
Black has decided to leave his pawn at e5 hanging, so white goes in for the grab.
9. ... 0-0-0 put the black rook on d8, pinning the d3 pawn to the white queen, which effectively left the e4 pawn unprotected. This move unpins the defending pawn.
d3 was getting a little hot, so d4, defended by a pawn, seems safer. This was the reason behind 11. Nbd2, defending e4 so the d-pawn would be free to advance.
Driving off the unwanted black LSB.
Except black didn't want to be driven off. 15. ... Nxg4? probably deserves a question mark since black didn't have anything terribly threatening to follow it up with. The white knight on f3 shuts black's queen out of h4 and g5, and Bxf3 won't work because white would reply Nxf3 and the other knight, now at f3, would still shut out the black queen. With another piece or two ready to pounce, this kind of sacrifice in front of white's king can be very effective. The first sacrifice is a dubious one at best.
More sacrificing from black, but this time it's very dangerous. If white handles the next couple of moves badly, black will obtain a winning advantage.
White's turn to sacrifice, recapturing with the pinned knight. The third sacrifice is pretty much forced. If white had tried to hold everything, for example, with 19. Ncd2 which rescues the knight from c4, defends the pawn at e4, and defends the knight at f3, black's follow up 19. ... Qf6 puts winning pressure on the white knight at f3. It cannot move because it is pinned. If the knight at d2 moves, the knight at f3 falls. At this point, black would be threatening 20. ... Rxd2 21. Bxd2 Bxf3 and now with the threat of mate, white might very well be forced to sacrifice the queen with 22. Qxf3 Qxf3 and black will go on to win with a crushing material superiority. Since white can't find a way to hold it all together, relieving the pressure by giving back some of his material edge seemed called for.
Consolidating and defending the king.
A shield against 22. Rg6+ and an attack on black's queen.
An indirect attack against black's rook threatening 24. Nc4 discovering the attack from the white rook on a3 against the black queen on f3.
A rook on the 8th would be very dangerous, and a rook on the 7th would force an exchange of material. Both good.
26. Qg6? was a mistake. It lets white win the exchange.
Now black's queen must move, or black's rook can exchange for the knight. Either way, that knight is getting the black rook.
Now simply play 29. Nf8+ K-any, 30. Nb6+ (or ++) Ka7 31. Nxd7 Qxc1 and white wins the exchange. But instead, white wanted to save the bishop on c1. Black's queen can go anywhere she likes, and white will still get that black rook. If black defends the rook, white will only win the exchange, but will have kept the potentially strong bishop.
Oops. Black went for the undefended pawn. 29. Qxa4?? is a serious blunder, because now white plays the same combination but wins black's queen instead of the rook. 30. ... K-any, 31. Nb6+ Ka7 32. Nxa4 leaves white ahead with two rooks+two knights+bishop vs. black's rook+5 pawns. All those pieces can easily stop black's pawns, so black resigns.
This appeared to be the best way to attempt to refute black's overaggressive play in the opening.  8 Nd5 came into consideration but was dismissed as wanting.
The computer indicates 11 Nd5 during this and the next move.  It's right.  I overlooked 11 ... Qxe4 12 c4! with a mating attack.
Here I was prepared to follow with Qf2 but ...
Forcing black to sacrifice his queen for the knight.  Otherwise mate will be forced in 5 moves.  After 13 ... Ka8 14 Qb4! forces mate at once.  13 ... c5 14 Qa5 is the quietus.  Perhaps the most elegant line is 13 ... c5 14 Qa5 Ka8 15 Qxc7 Rb8 16 Qc6+!! Bxc6 17 Nc7mate.
Centralizing the Rook!
Doubling the Rooks! Increasing the pressure at the c-file.
Centralizing the King is a good strategy in the endgame!
Can´t go away to far with my King. Must guard the Black King side pawn majority.
My plan was ...fxg4 and White has three connected, passed pawns against Blacks two. White have then the possibility to block Blacks two passed pawns with his King!
a little stronger is Nb3 guarding the d-pawn so as to avoid an isolated pawn if recapture with exd5 after cxd5
Better is Qd1 which boosts the defence of the Non f3 without risking disrupting the pawn shield in front of the K.  Also it moves the Q away from the centre of the board where it is open to attack by minor pieces
mistake. sets up the Na4 fork which follows.  Better was Nfe5 linking the Ns deep in black's space and blocking the attack on b2.
much better is f4 or g4 beginning the ofensive on both sides of the board. Plus giving the K room to move
a little late as now the K is on the edge of the board and the b-pawn pinned to it
This move controls the center and opens up lines for development of the queen and bishop. This move usually leads to sharp open battles, but can also lead to quiet closed positions if White plays something passive like d3 Nd2 transposing into some kind of King's Indian Attack
I don't like to play normal openings because White usually has a slight advantage in those openings, and I have to fight for equality as Black. I like this move because White usually plays d4 here, and the passive e6 is safe and solid, and it usually brings White out of his opening repertoire.
The sharpest moves were d4 and Nf3. This move is somewhat passive to play as White, and can transpose into King's Indian Attack, which is a passive opening and gives Black immediate equality.
I like to bring my queenside knight to the kingside so I can have an extra defender when I castle, and also have an extra attacker if White castle's kingside. A lot of times when I play this opening, White advances his pawns trying to chase my knight, and a lot of pawn moves create weaknesses.
This is a terrible move, and White should've expanded d4 with tempo, or at least followed up with his plan to fianchetto the bishop. This move blocks the queen's path to the weakness f3, so now f3 is severely weak.
in my attemp to castle as Sr. Barbara told me within the first 4 moves, I move my bishop out
I was interested to see that you chose not to castle. I thought about moving my bishop e2 to c4, as you left a lovely gap. However, In thought better of it since my black bishop and b knight were still hemmed in. I will continue to develop before attacking
perhaps I should have moved my h pawn to  row 3 to force your bishop to either attack or move (?), but I did not. I figure I have 2 pieces on your c pawn and can possibly gain a piece
dumb move here, I think...checking your queen is fruitless if you choose to attack my white knight, I probably should have moved to queen to e2 to add a layer of protection.
The Tumbleweed, in all its glory. White has open lines on the K-side to use for attack, and Black's Queen is exposed, but Black has a material advantage in return.
Unpinning. White can get his KB and Q mobilized quickly.
If Black can develop quickly, he will have the better game. The K-side Pawns will be an insurmountable endgame advantage, if Black can reach one.
A mistake. Black needs to get his pieces off the back rank with more alacrity, or White wil mobilize his forces and overwhelm him. 11... N-QB3 or 11... B-K2 were better choices.
Now the King's exposed position on the open file comes back to haunt Black. If he had played 11... N-QB3, he could have followed up with 12... O-O-O and his King would have been safe.
This Bishop now dominates the board.
Another White piece joins in. Now Black is in trouble.
Usually I play Nc3 here with option of 3.d4 for a mainline Caro, or Nc3 for my usual 2 Knights line that Fischer played. Here in blitz I sometimes play Nf3 instead, planning to go into the 2 Knights to begin with, but giving the impression of "not knowing I am Supposed to play 2.d4" :)  And it stops 2...e5, for what its worth.
4.h3 first is customary here. But again, I want to confuse the issue, and give him the chance to drop a tempo by 4...Bxf3 if he is so inclined.
ZWISHENZUG, an "in-between move". Zwishenzugs win many games, by the way. Tho this is not that particular Kind of Zwishenzug. Still it is forcing. And being blitz, maybe the opponents heart will go pitter-patter here if they did not see it. I try to do it Quickly, and slam the piece down loudly for such moves~! }8-D
I dare him too, and he does. The idea is: I am planning to gain time against his Q now, and maybe sac later on d5. After placing Rook(s) on e1 and/or d1 maybe.
Now I could probably play 11.Rfe1 for a strong but safe position. And then he would really need to think twice about 11...Qxb2 (if he has plans to O-O-O) 12.Nxd5~! exd5? 13.Bd4+ Discovered Check and his Q is lost. Or 12...Qxb5? Nc7+ forking the K & Q.
At this time I am thinking: "I wonder if it's sound? Looks very Active." And my center lines are open for Rooks to occupy.
Perhaps my sac wasn't sound. 13. ...Nge7 attacking my Queen, while defending the Nc6 looks hard to meet. I had thought to have a bit of a bind then with 14.Qe5 but he has ... O-O-O~! and I have not time to play 15.Bf4 now since the Nc6 has become unpinned and thus attacks my Queen "for real" now. Also he could play 13. ...Qd6 threatening a Q trade, but I would retreat my Q, to come back and harass his with a Rd1. <n>***<n>Then again, I've always been a pretty LUCKY Player~!? At board games that is; not cards, dice, or lotteries. I used to say "Love" there, but I met my wife on GK~! Can't get luckier than That ( Ok, on a Chess site ... right? :)
And the Rook or Queen must fall. 1-0
“Best by test as said by bobby fischer “Develops and attacks d5 center square while opening up lines for queen and bishop
Directly challenges white pawn by attacking center square d4 and opens lines for his queen and bishop
Develops kingside and attacks center square e5 and d4
“Fischer defence “Opens diagonal for C8 bishop but blocks diagonal for F8 bishop pawn also attacks e5 square therefore move must be good
Develops bishop on dangerous diagonal a2-g8 and attacks weak f7 pawn
I considered setting the trap 6.Ne5 hoping he play 6...Bxd1 followed by 7.Bxf7+ Ke7 8.Nd5# winning. But if black does not play Bxd1 and instead plays Nxe5 I would be in serous trouble therefore I played d4 opening up an diagonal for my bishop
Regains pawn and white clearly dominates the center. It can already been seen that white wins because he dominates the center and all his piece of developed and active as well as no weakness in his camp while black s has no pieces developed on kingside ,has little control of centre and weak squares f6,h6,f7 will be costly latter ing the game
Falls in my trap he should have played a6 either forcing me to exchange my bishop or to force my bishop to B3 with b5
Winning the knight for a pawn ,black cannot move knight because then I would attack his queen
Taking bishop away from danger back to the diagonal a2-g8
Preparing to queenside castle and crush black on kingside
Preparing to bring rooks into play
Wrong. He should have played Rfb8 (increasing the pressure on b2 square) and prepare to attack my king with his bishop, rooks and queens
Trying to trick him again if 14...Bxh6 I would play 15.Qxh6 any move 16. Ng5 and mate on h7 latter on if he plays stuborn
Increasing the pressure on the weak f7 pawn
Mate follows after 19...Rxd7 20.Qxe5 anymove 21.Qg7#<n>The reason black has lost is because of not developing as fast as he could and for not have a plan
Revenge Mark 1<n><n>There is a special joy for those return matches where I've been absolutely thumped in the first match and manage to squeak summat in the second. Jap managed to quite comphrensively overwhelm me in the first game to the point where he was saccing his rooks for fun at the end....
Worried about the a7 spot and not wanting to give him any holes to exploit. This time.
No real plan here other than to push him back and try to constrain his movement.
That was I think a mistake by him. It ignored what I was about to do so he evidently hadn't seen it. Then again nor did I.......
That had been my original planned move, so intent on that one was I that I didn't even think of QxK instead. But it still works well as queen under threat but has to find some way of keeping me out of c2 and to a lesser extent f3.
O...k..... that wasn't supposed to happen. Its MY turn to attack, not his.... Luckily that move that I overlooked before is still there....
*chortles happily* This is the point at which I can imagine my opponent swearing profusely. I'd certainly be in his position. Two pieces under threat and he can't take either. Still got to worry about that c2 spot for the knight, but now those e and f pawns looking decidedly iffy.
Overwhelmed with choices here, knight to f3, queen to f3, queen to e3.... I chose the rook in the end simply to continue a three piece attack rather than try and cope with the two, over-reach and get thumped.
Black sticks with his plans to play the pirc, and I oblige him.
All standard so far -- this is the Austrian attack of the pirc defense, where white has a big classical center, and black will counterattack against it from the flank.
I was expecting something tame, like 0-0, getting the king to safety.  Apparently, this is a good move, too, as it forces white to commit to what he wants to do about the center.
Not the most popular decision, but even now I think it's pretty good, as it doesn't overextend like the alternatives e5 or d5 would, and it gives the white queen a little more scope.  <n><n>The drawbacks are that it gives up a center pawn for black's c-pawn and exposes the Nc3.<n><n>Most common, though, is Bb5 , which leads to a different type of game.
Better than dxc5 7. Qxd8 Kxd8, as this entices white to go for a free pawn with 7. cxd6? Nxe4!, with a big advantage to black.
Defends against Nxe4; IMO the best move here.  One lesson I've learned (painfully) is not to try too hard to create an advantage when there is none.
Preparing to chase the queen with Be3, while keeping options open about where to castle.
An aggressive developing square, but this pretty much commits black to ceding the bishop pair to white; this will turn out to be a very big deal in the endgame!  My preference for black would be to play 0-0 here, deferring the decision on where to develop the bishop.
Now there's really not a lot wrong with Qa5, or with Qb4 for that matter (black has more success with Qb4 according to the game DB), but why not play Qc7?  (The answer is that Qc7 fails to 10. Nb5!, and then black must play Qa5 [albeit with check] anyway.)  In any case, Qa5 leaves the queen open to harassment with, say, Bd2, and then she'll have to move again.
Now black has a decision to make; give up the bishop pair (and this is a pretty good bishop for black), or retreat it.  Note that, due to black's queen maneuvering, he's just the tiniest bit behind in development.
This exchange allows black to catch up in development, but costs him the bishop pair.
Catching up in development, and threatening to win the bishop pair back with Nb4.
Revealing a second attacker on the Nc3, while shifting his attentions to the queenside.
The first new move of the game.  This frees the Nc3 to move!
And this prevents the knight from moving to d5, while giving the queen a chute to probe the white kingside, perhaps.
Aggressively pushing towards black's kingside.  Is this warranted?  I think so -- white has a good presence on the kingside and in the center, and black's pieces are pretty passively posted.
Seeking exchanges may not be bad for black here, especially if he can remove white's bishop-pair advantage.
Will I give up my Bd3 to keep pushing into black's kingside?  Apparently, I will!
It's understandable not wishing to expose his king, but I had expected Nxd3.
Isolating black's d-pawn and still threatening to open the kingside.
!  I think this is a very good tactical defense!  Either the queen must go back to d8 or black must give her up.
Forcing black to play Nxf3 , otherwise he loses the queen for not enough.
The best way to get out of check... take the piece!
Unexpected!  I had thought I'd see axb6, and black has to figure out what to do about his atrocious pawn structure.  But this allows white to exchange even MORE of black's pieces.
Basically forcing black to play Bxe3; anything else loses material.
And this move was necessary now, otherwise white just has a large material edge.  So take stock now -- black's pawn structure is a wreck, he has a knight to white's bishop in the endgame, and his rooks are on ineffective squares, and it's white's move.
Forcing black to recapture; if instead black plays Nxd3, white has gxh7 , winning a pawn, creating a passed pawn on the h-file, with good winning chances.
The main alternative to this was Nxd3, but the rook   pawn endgame favors white heavily.  It's hard to argue with this move; the only downside is...
White gets to keep his bishop, and the b7 pawn for black looks very weak!
Trying to get his king involved -- generally a good plan in the endgame!
Centralizing the bishop (preparing to go to d5).
Marching forward; again, a risky strategy, but perhaps the best chance to hold the balance.
Forcing the rook to defend the b2 pawn, otherwise b4! wins for white.
Necessary in case black has the idea of Kg5.
Time to send the knight backwards; this leads to the win of the d-pawn.
This move is necessary to prevent black from winning a kingside pawn.
no harm no foul.  Now, black must deal with the impending loss of the d-pawn.
An interesting try -- looking to take the g-pawn in exchange for it.
Helping to hold the c2 pawn, while threatening Rxg6  if black plays Nxg4.
Kf2 or Kh2 allows black to take the pawn on g4 with check.
Black correctly understands that he must get rid of white's pawns to hold the position.
Now that the king no longer defends the g6 pawn, it's time to take it.
Another interesting way to play is Nxg6, where the endgame is rook   b-pawn vs. rook, but the black king may have trouble getting there in time to help out!
Denying black an exchange while still defending c2.  Black now has no good way to avoid the loss of the pawn on b7.
Harassing the rook, although perhaps black has already hatched his drawing scheme at this point.
Preparing to advance the queenside pawns.
I know I've got to get my king involved if I want to win!
Threatening to win the b-pawn; the only way to defend it is for white to play c3.
Of course I don't want to lose my pawn...
In practice, however, this endgame is very difficult for both sides.  Even in games on chessgames.com, the strong side wins 35% of the time; Karpov defeated Van Wely with it as recently as 2003!<n><n>I have 50 moves to either exchange his rook for my bishop, win his rook outright, or mate his king -- otherwise it's a draw.
So first things first -- I need a strategy.  I decide that what I have to do is force his king back to the back rank, and then, if I can do that, I should be able to either mate him or force him to drop material.  It's going to be tough because he's so well-centralized, and I only have 50 moves to do it in!
And of course, if black can exchange rook for rook, or can win my bishop, it's a dead draw.  The nice part about an endgame like this in correspondence chess is that you can analyze incredibly deeply!
This is an important concept in this endgame (at least for me), to use the bishop to defend the king from the rook, while using my king and rook to push his king towards the back rank.<n><n>White has to be careful of black's drawing techniques, where basically all he has to do is get the white rook off the board by whatever means necessary!
This will force the black king back to the 6th rank now...
It looks like white must abandon the idea of a rook on the 6th rank now, but there's a sequence that allows me to keep it there...
And now the bishop is free to move.  Bh5  is threatened now.
Keeping with the strategy of keeping the bishop close to the king and center, but I overlooked something here...
Keeping the rook adjacent to the king (i.e., king on the e-file, keep the rook on the d-file) and between his king and my rook will help him defend exquisitely!  At this point I realize I need to regroup and try again.
?  Black had discovered the drawing strategy of allowing his rook to get between his king and my rook; so Rc1 was the move here; this pushes his king towards the back rank again.
Note that White has to guard against Rxe4 , which will allow black to take the white rook!
??  After all his great play, this blunder costs black the game in dreadful fashion.  <n><n>The last hope was Kd8!, leading to the famous "philidor position" in the R B vs. R, which is a win for the strong side, but it takes something like 13 or 15 moves to do it in -- enough for black to hold on here!
And there's no good defense now!  Running with 87. ...Kb8 leads to 88. Rf8  Ka7 89. Ra8  Kb6 90. Rb8 , winning the rook, and there's nowhere for the rook to move to defend against Rf8# without losing material.
And black resigns, for it's a mate in 1 after 89. Rf8  Ka7 90. Ra8#.  This endgame almost never comes up, but it was fun to learn about it and awfully exciting to win from the strong side!<n><n>To those of you who stuck with it, thanks for your fortitude, and I hope you enjoyed it!  -Ethan

c6, laying claim to d5 - stopping me putting my knight there later if I want to anyway.
Aware that black may pin my knight, I make a bad move. This was very passive, and a waste of time. Bb4 would have been a better bishop move, or h3 would have removed the threat of the pin.

brucey bishop comes out to cover d5
neddy 2 comes out to help with the middle-board scrap
the bounder blocks my bishop from attacking his neddy
I like to castle, gives the king that warm feeling...either that or it's time for a new adult nappy :oO
ok ~ tucks bishop away out of trouble, but losing ground in the middle board in doing so :o/
mutty accepts the exchange
nice, bishop has protected King, and is lined up with his queen too
back to the centre then
hmm queen wants to get on my King..hmm need to be decisive here
ok bishop come back here young man - there's pots to wash
a gift for black thanks to muttit's muppetry *slap*
ok lets try & halt this nonsense...the black gee gee is going nowhere fast, and his queen is clumsily sat in line of his king <n><n>- hands up if you've been punished for doing that in the past :o/
oi I wanted to eat that h6 pawn !<n><n>black does rh8 to save his sorry rear-end
hmm now if I can just connect my queen & rook...  ;o)
black has to take back
with the material advantage in muttit's court at last...black is in deep doo doo
I played Nc7 and not Nb6 because I had plans for an a6, b5 expansion
Its typical to play for a queenside expansion in the sicilian
While my opponent plays for cheapos, I continue developing. Though my knight is pinned, it wouldn't be going anywhere in the nearest future
Ok I must confess, I wasn't too comfortable with the knight pinned
Oh no, I need to find some form of counter-play if I want to win this game
It was around this move I began to panic. If I was going to play f6, I should I left my rook on f8. I could have won the pawn on h4 but that just losses time and open lines to my king
Yes! I get a bishop for my troubles. Notice I also have an intimidating pawn centre. Immediately I played d5, I saw Bxh7+ could be dangerous for black if not handled carefully
The best way to lose the bishop
I forgot to mention that my opponent and I had just 60seconds to make a move each. I delibrated kf8 for a long while but that just let's the bishop escape. Yeah, I know I'm greedy but if the bishop turns out to be poisoned, then my king would die with the comforting feeling of taking an enemy bishop with him
Again solid play from my opponent as he continues to pressurize me. I noticed that if I could somehow get my rook to h8, I would trap his queen but to do that, I would have to play Ke7 which would become very exposed after Nxf6 Kxf6(the only way to recapture since the g-pawn would be pinned). Even though, I'm not so sure having my king on f6 would be that bad as the f-file is still closed to the white rooks.
My opponent castles and gets ready to bring his other rook over to the kingside
Now that my opponent has castled to the queenside where majority of my pieces are, I try to pawn storm his castled position also
But my opponent just keeps knocking on the door looking for an opening somehow. Surely I can't allow the f-file to open so I play...
??? A horrible blunder from my opponent after all his good play. He should have just sacrificed the exchange and play Qh5
Probably not a good move but who cares! I get to win a pawn and the exchange which automatically simplifies to a won end game for me
This was played with the intention of fully opening the board for my rooks to operate on. If he dosent trade, I would have a passed pawn
This was an absolute mistake as it allows me to trade rooks.
A pawn sac to open up lines to my king???
Now this is a horrible mistake that with best play would lose the exchange for white. Best was Bg3 even though I get to trade rooks. This is exactly why Bf2 was a mistake
Now I could win the bishop with Rc1 but I spotted something better
And the game comes to an end, hope you enjoyed.
The master rightly trys to introduce imbalance into the position against his lower ranked opponent.
The more conservative option.With this white is hopeing for a small white plus with a (draw in hand?).6.cxd5 though the more aggressive move claiming the centre with a pawn duo I feel allowed black to much counterplay vis. open a1/h8 diagonal and q-side p majority a position Im sure the master was eagerly anticipating.
To prevent the pin and reduce the activity of blacks white squared Bishop,
8.Qe2 was an option which the gameknot computer after game analyses called for.(Though it gives another perspective on the whole I mistrust the gameknot computers judgement).I rejected the move at the time as I considered the move too drawish.
To prevent b5 permanently.11.Bg5 developing was better as black could nt push b5 at the moment.
Taking aim at the dark squares around the black king and uniting the white rooks
Here white decided to try for the win so made this capture to add imbalance to the game.21.Be3 wad more conservative and more drawish
The Ruy Lopez.
I liked queenside because it puts my rook directly on d1 and the half-open file, and I'm expecting black to go kingside which leaves open the possibility of pawn advances against his castled position.
If 15. Bxc3, black can find a nice little hole in my position with 15. ... Nf4.
16. ... dxe5 seems to open up a whole bunch of trouble for black. White can recapture with check, or with the knight to put pressure on c6 and f7 while attacking black's queen. Also, the possibility of Bxh6 while discovering the rook attack on black's queen is dangerous for black, too. Meanwhile, black's knight and pawn are both under attack.
To defend the f2 pawn against black's knight, preventing the fork.
Black diffused the pressure in the center by castling, but now I get to wreck his pawn structure a little.
Now the weak pawn on d6 looks ripe for an attack.
Black threatened my unprotected knight on e1. It had to be saved.
So much for winning a pawn at d6. This was just an exchange, and now black's weakness has evaporated and I've gained no material for it. If I had played a little more conservatively, shored up my pawns (or maybe just got Kb1 in there early enough), then went after d6, I might have eventually won the d6 pawn.
And now I'm down by a pawn with nothing to show for it.
Here's a blunder. Looks like a pawn exchange to open up black's castle. But it's just a pawn commiting pointless suicide.
I could not recapture the pawn on g5. If 28. Qxg5, black will play 28. ... Qb4  forking my king and rook. As it is, my queen is attacked by the pawn she cannot capture so she must move. Most of her options allow black to fork the rook, so I see no alternative but to trade queens - deadly when I'm down by two pawns.
Black's pawn is racing for promotion and must be stopped. Seems like my king and rook can team up on him if he advances too far.
I have prevented the promotion, but I'm still down by two pawns. Black has his passed pawn on b7 that I must prevent from promoting, and he has a 3 to 2 pawn advantage on the kingside. Worse, my kingside pawns are isolated and cannot support each other. There is only one way this game can end, so rather than drag it out, I choose to resign.
I had begun looking at krkofbutlers previous games and looking at how he plays, trying to establish a theme or style within his game. I saw that in most of his games, he always goes for the conventional openings on d3, e3, d4, or e4 or using Kb3 and Kf3. It was then i decided to also use a more common opening, aiming to throw a few unusal moves in as the game went on..
Although I didnt want to retreat the knight off e5, it would mean a more conventional Bf4, which takes the middlegame into a basic, standard route, and that as mentioned before was not my intention. It's at this point i determined to attempt to put my opponent into a position on the chessboard that he had never seen.<n><n>While I'm no master at naming certain openings or plays, or even strategies, I could see from this point, that the game could easily take a turn, where simply setting up an attack and/or exchanging pieces was not going to get either player anywhere, forcing the situation so, that, the first to make a mistake, would be the one that loses, not the one that outsmarts the other.
Once again, not a move a grandmaster would likely tell someone who isn't an advanced player to attack with, but it was with a long-term goal in mind. A simple b5 or Bg4 would have been too blatant for the opponent, and the goal of this match was to surprise him into over thinking, and/or making a fatal error
Nice move by white, opening up the c bishop, and allowing the f bishop to move freely as he pleases, knight being covered. Maybe not the best move, but I saw it a good choice by the opponent.
When i saw this, it simply frustrated me. I'm usually a player that will play to a plan, and whilst doing so, overlook the more simple, subtle plans and fall for them. Took me a few mins but I soon found a way out of it, and also a way to equalise the material
I had a strong feeling he wouldnt use his b pawn to take me, that would make awkward positional play, plus its a free chance to develop the c bishop
Not only is there the threat of bc3, but also the Kingside there with the 3 pawns and Rook undeveloped, is looking very bare, so its towards that corner, I prepare for my assasult....Even if O-O was to be the next move, both Kng4, and Qd6 both start to really make the King think about the position over in the King's corner.<n><n>It was also at this point where the aforementioned "over thinking" came into play i would say. He is deliberating about the Bc3 fork, the Bishop and Knight combining to come together towards the King's side, and also the blatant Queen threat, and just overlooked the next move.
Misses the Bc3 move, probably anticipating a Kng4 move or something to that effect
Game starting to look really bleak for white now. The only possible outcome in my opinion would be to attempt to trap the Black bishop on a1, therefore gaining some material in an attempt to try gain any momentum in the game.
Progression with the horse in order to begin the endgame
I liked this move and was one i overlooked. It threatens both Ba1, and Rd8. f6 cannot be played because of whits bishop on c4, and even a h6 attack on the g5 bishop would still result in losing the rook..
Leaves the bishop open without a defender, so thats the obvious move. I was expecting to lose the Knight here, but I went with the simple theory that Bishops are better in the endgame (in theory) than Knights
Setting up 18. f4 19.f7? Still obvious and simple to remove the threat, but also mistakenly forking his Rook with his King, setting me up with another free Rook with Ne3+
There is it, and it was clear from here (although highly probably earlier on) that the game was now over, and it was only a matter of time
Up until here I thought it would be interesting just to experiment and try to remove some of the pawns, and not go for a default straight checkmate, purely out of interest
Finally lose the bioshop but its altogether too late for my opponent now.
With this the opponent surrenders, avoiding further embarassment? More like not wanting to continue to suffer. A well played game, but one in which I thought I had the momentum pretty much from the get-go.<n><n>Any comments or advice will be greatly appreciated :)
Not a good developing move a this point.  It surrenders the tempo to Black
Big mistake!  this surrenders control of the center to white after the exchange, cxd4,  exd4.
Black missed the play to win the knight.
The dreaded pin, which was expected hence 2. e6
Trying to get George to safety before the fight begins
Here I only tried to keep some integrity in my position and had to defend with the bishop, taking with the G pawn would force me to castle to the queen sided. If he then exchanged on c3 the a7 pawn would possibly not hold
Finally getting the King out of the way to free up the knight on c3 if needed
This would have been a nice pin before 11. O-O, now it is only a menace as I saw he could not swing the momentum back even if I had to play Qd7 later on to defend
Keeping up the pressure with the intention to break the pin on f4 by his bishop, so I had to draw the king out from the back rank
Here my opponent resigned, I would be up another piece no matter what he played.<n><n>I was hoping he would play a greedy blunder for the poetic sacrifice to stop the mate 14. d3 Qxg5 15. Kxe4 Nb4+ 16. Bc6 Bxc6+ 17. Qxc6 Nxc6 but I was happy to take the win none the less.
That was a weak move i think as it affects king's defence and the hole kingside anyway.
Now i opened the bishop. I wanted to attack in the f7 square.
And now the plan is simple. Exchange at first the knight in order to have a clean and free road for my queen to move on h5 square.
In order to a avoid checkmate.
I took his knight of course to clean the road.
Now the other bishop back there was now really useful!
It was good to open the way for his DSB. If he plays Bg5, I will have doubled pawns. I must play something against it!
I played this in order to avoid having troubles with the f7 pawn.
I complete the exchange, again attacking his bishop.
Now, he played this. I have some choices, but I chose to bring the knight out. In my opinion, it was a time losing move, he didn't develop any pieces, but I could, on the other hand, he didn't have any choices, just to save the bishop.
Bd6 seemed to me the best to play.
Now, my pawn is pinned! I cannot take his bishop. I ought to move something which defends my e5 pawn and also make an end of the pin.
I could easily play this, because he puts no pressure on my queenside and not either on my kingside. I don't have to take care of that.
Blunder. This is why I wanted to make an end of the pin. I think he played this because he din't notice that the pin has been abolished.
So, I took his bishop, and I also opened the e file. It's good for me because if he takes my queen, I can recapture withmy bishop (later on, I had te take care due to I had to keep my bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal), but if I manage to capture his queen, his only possible move to capture it with his king. And the a6-c8 diagonal is opened, that can be important, because if I move my bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal, my pawn would be out of defender and that can elicit his king to capture it.
It will make my job easier because of the undefended c6 pawn.
Just take my pawn, I am not defending it, free meat :D
Here starts the big problem: Where can his king go if I defend the pawn on f4??? (After the game I told him that Kd1 may have been the best, or maybe Kd2 have been another better choice)
Tempo-losing move! If I had tried to take his knight with my DSB, my f4 pawn would become undefended, there wouldn't be mate for a long time.
And it's checkmate! Do you remember that I said I played correctly after 6. Bb5+ ??? If I had chosen the other way (Bd7), I wouldn't have this "bad" bishop which was the most useful piece! It made the king to move out to f3 by checking it, it took the e2 square when I defended the f4 pawn, and it's the bishop with which I gave my friend a checkmate! Please, rate my second (THIS!:D) annotation, and write comments. Thank you.
!? Very aggressive. Black cannot win the e-pawn right off since the Bishop is hanging after 6...Nxe4? 7.Bxc6 bxc6 8.Nxb4.
Anticipating 8.Nxf6+ Qxf6, Black is making ready to castle queenside, so this move is preferable to 7...bxc6.
Black releases the tension in the center in preparation for castling; he must close off the White Bishop's scope. This also foreshadows the massive kingside attack that is Black's signature in this opening.
This seems to be intended to prevent 12...c5, but Black is obviously ready to castle here. Developing the Bishop or simply castling were preferable; this just wastes a tempo.
Forcing another Queen move for White, as he must now defend the backward d3 pawn.
With his King safely tucked away, Black begins to march on the White kingside. Black is now completely developed, whereas White still hasn't castled and is at least a move away from being able to (unless he wants to go kingside, but that looks... risky).
White responds with an aggressive posture, though I think Bd2 and O-O-O would have been safer. As it is, White is threatening to trap the DSB, but Black has a preemptive response...
Thanks to White's unconnected Rooks, Black is happy to blow the h-file open and kick the Knight back at the same time. Removing the Knight from f3 also make h4 look particularly inviting for the BQ.
I think the immediate 16.Nh2 would be better, to prevent giving Black the h-file uncontested.
Now g1 is the only reasonable place for the Knight (since 18.Nd2 runs into immediate problems after 18...Bxf2+! where if White captures, 19.Kxf2 Qh4 20.Ke2 Qg3 21.Rg1 Rh2 and there's no way to stop the g-pawn from falling as well), which is why I think Nh2 should have been played earlier.
White has to lose a piece to eliminate the advanced pawn now, and the f4-pawn is nearly as big a threat looming on the horizon. The Ng1 can't even move out of the way, since it's still pinned to the undefended Rook.
0-1. White eagerly snatches up the e5 pawn, only to realize that he's terribly lost anyway; his Rook and Knight are both about to fall to Black's pawn (probably after 22...Be3+) and he has no counterplay opportunities whatsoever, so he throws in the towel. Thanks to mesledarya for a fun game! Comments are much appreciated; thanks for reading!
Hi everyone!<n><n>This was the closest I have ever been to becoming The-Black-Queen.  Right until the end I had a winning advantage over Michael, but, due in large part to Old Matey (in the form of Michael's queen) sniffing around Henry, I ended up forcing a queen trade and immediately hitting the offer draw button.  Michael duly accepted the offer.  Little did I know that the gameknot analysis was about to show that I had a winning alternative continuation to initiating the queen trade.  I now feel as though I bottled it.  So, how did this all happen?  Well, here is the gameknot analysis below:-  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=22336553&rnd=0.7168277988215053
2.d4 - Michael has played the Pirc Defense and allowed me to get control in the centre.
10. 0-0-0 - I make a somewhat brave decision to castle on the opposite side of my opponent.  This can involve pawn storms on both sides of the board and a race to checkmate.
11. Rxd3 - I have no desire to capture with my pawn and mess up my pawn structure, so the rook recaptures.
23. Rf7 - King Michael has managed to run away from the kingside and back onto his home square.  I now give my opponent a bone in the throat.
25. Nd1 - Henry is in Old Matey's shadow so I elect to defend it with my knight.
26. Qxh6 - now the h column is dominated by Glenda and one of my rooks, but now Henry is subject to a little harassment.
28. e6 - trying to evade capture from the BQ and putting a further crimp on Michael's position.
38. c3 - I block a check and push my passer up one square.  However, Qd2 threatening Qc1# should Glenda stray off the b1-g8 diagonal prompted me to trade queens.  I did briefly consider Qf7+ but I thought it wouldn't lead to anywhere, so I closed down the game with the queen trade and a subsequent draw offer.  Gameknot analysis showed that Qf7+ won for white.  So, a missed opportunity for yours truly.
will try to work a way to pin his Queen
Now, he have to sacrifice his to exchange his tower for a weaker piece
best move for him are to exchange Queen, he will gain my tower for a bishop
Unpinning and clearing the way to castle.
Centralizing his Q with the recapture.
If Black had not played 9 P-KN3?? this would secure the King behind a solid defensive wall.
To create a pin.
Applying more pressure to the pinned and helpless Knight.
The only move to avoid losing the piece.
Tightening the screws.
The Knight must fall, as it cannot be guarded a 3rd time. 15... QxN? falls to 16 QxN ch! K-N1 17 B-R6!
The Queen must stay near the action.
Black's game, like an archaeologist's career, is in ruins. If 16... K-R3, 17 Q-B4 ch and mate in 1.
Black resigns, as he has no good way to stop 18 Q-R6.
This was to prevent a knight incursion on b4 but the computer calls it a mistake preferring e5
This was a bit unexpected I'm not sure where the rook is headed
Now my a1 rook is defended I can safely do this but I don't think its best as it allows black to exchange off his a rook which looks awkward to me
I thought long and hard about this and decided to take with the queen so as not disrupt my pawn structure too much, in particular I didn't want to open the c rank for black. As it turns out this was the start of my demise.<n><n>Analysis calls this an inaccuracy
This didn't seem unreasonable at the time, the bishop is pretty safe there and keeps the black king hemmed in, I just need to work out how to get at it however analysis calls this a mistake preferring g3
For some reason I completely missed the threatened fork here. I took with the queen to avoid doubled pawns and to keep the c rank closed.<n><n>Analysis calls this a mistake and gives black a large advantage from this point.
I saw this as an attempt to cut my losses but at this point I started to lose my way, the computer prefers Rxd4, from now on I fall into my opponents hands completely.
Usually White is not willing to trade a flank pawn for a center pawn and to help Black develop.
White's position here is fine.  In fact, I think it's preferable to Black's.
computer considers black as much better than white. Though, I like this kind of situation; white dominates the clear squares, threats to double c pawns and black has no specific threat. In 2 moves, I am completely developped.
Now, white seems much better, according to the computer, but I finally saw a threat on d3... and panicked...
here comes rokk + 2 pawn for a bishop and a knight
the idea to take back with the queen was already to point on the threat on c6 and prepare the queen to go on c4, whenever...
i am not sure the threat has been seen by black
now I want to gain a move for my queen. I hoped for him to take
Now i try to gain an advantage for a3 and c3: if we exchange, I have considerable possibilities as my rook is much more mobile for a few move: his has to wait his king to get free from corridor mate.
Now my plan is much more simpler, as i can just act to exchange the queens. My king is not too far from c3.
to keep the king off e4
maddie and myself jst enjoy a good game, and after a overpowering defeat by maddie, i had my knife in for him:) This game, i rate one of my best games to date, and im sure he wouldnt mind if i share it.
I think he jst took a chance, sometimes it can be a tactic to draw in a piece....so he had his reason.
I have lost 10 games in a row...and whot i,ve learned is that i am way to eagar to attack before i'm developed...by opening the bottom rank, i can switch my rooks into the direction that i feel the game will swing, either queen or kingside, but because he havnt developed fully, i still dnt know wot he think, and he knows it.
so, my rook pin, or will pin his pawn at d6 against his queen....
so...that bishop tried to free that pin white had on the night at e5....so it will have to go...
attacking e5 with the piece that had the smallest reach to pentrate defences off oponent
and....sending the good bishop in as a power moove!
white is now thinking two things....he must prevent black from casteling...it would be a great setback...and he must keep the attack fluent...and wot better means than to attack the black queen!
so white is winning time...and persist in preventing black to castle!
the goodbishop had shown its strength up to now...standing its ground through a good tactical moove...it threaten the queen, also if the black bishop take it, white will release its queen and then the rook will attack d6!!
the good bishop open the file, preventing black to castle
that castle jst had to go there!
realising the pin, black moove the king...white have to prevent black to moove into Kh7....how will he do it?
and that was the moove....its time for the black king to come and greet oponent!
keeping the king on the run, and isolating it from defence..
!!! the rook blocks communication and prevents f4
So really it is a english opening, with white getting a powerful grip in the center, on the light squares. The advantage of this system is that white will always have a lot of space, and has potential on the kingside with the e4 pawn. In most variations, white is planning on the kingside area. In english opening variations without e4, white is seen playing Rb1,b4,b5, and attacking the queenside.
Black is executing his plan of attacking the queenside right away after making the obligatory Nf6,Bg7,0-0. Although the center is techincally still dynamice in nature, it is difficult to open it up, since both sides have adequete control over it. Therefore, a flank attack is totally acceptable.
Here, white had a choice. He could choose the plan of 13.g4/Ng3, but that would be a bit too slow. The move 13.f4 certainly frees the g7 bishop, but the benefits given to white should not be overlooked. White's pieces, including the f rook and the e2 knight are both gaining in activity.
(?!!)A very interesting tactical idea. Now black has 3 main candidate moves. 14...dxe5 15.Bxc5 is easy. 14...Nxe5 15.gxf4 with a double attack on the rook and the knight. 14...fxe3 gives white a choice. A)15.Bxc6 and now black has a choice. A1)15...exd2 16.exf6 Bxf6 17.Bxa8 Bxh3(or 17...Bxb2 first) 18.Bg2 white has some advantage. A2)14...dxe5 15.Bxa8 exd2 gives black the advantage. He is getting many pawns for the exchange, as well as active pieces. By the way, there were more variations that needed to be calculated. I am just listing a few. Therefore, white needs to play B)15.exf6 Bxf6 16.Bxc6 Bxh3! 17.Bxa8 Qxa8 18.Ne4 Bxb2 with a advantage to black, but nothing winning. Just listing these few variations makes my head start really hurting:). And these were just the main lines that we needed to calculate! To calculate the variations properly, you really needed to slow down, during each half move, and ascertain ALL the new candidate moves for each side, keep track of the material properly, and avoid fainting at the same time, and much more! Certainly, black could have gotten an advantage with taking 14...fxe3. However, the resulting position is still complex. Maybe black missed the variation. That would be possible, considering the difficulty of the calculation here. Absolutely crazy position! However, this is just the beginning! Black now chooses to take up the complexity up another level(!) and plays a dubious, extremely complicated move.
The fourth candidate move! Now the position requires immense precision. In fact, I will not attempt to calculate many lines. I will just find the candidate moves for each side for each ply. Ready? Now white can play 15.gxf4,Bxc6, g4. After 15.gxf4, black has Bb7 only, as it is clearly the best move. But then there are not many tactics. As a last judgement, the h5 knight is misplaced. 16.Ne4 looks accurate. OK, but after 15.Bxc6, black can play 15...Bxh3,fxe3,. After 15...Bxh3, white can play 16.Bxa8 Qxa8 with complex position. Also, white can play 16.Nxf4 with also complex position. So many different moves at each ply. Actually, IM Lilov told me he spent almost half an hour calculating the variations in this position. Unfortunately, the position is very complex, and he made an oversight.
(?!)A very nice interesting idea, which gets white the advantage if black does not find the right reply. Actually there are 2 replies of equal strength; black just needs to find the right idea. It is clear right now that both the rook and the knight are hanging, but the knight is trapped. So by logic, shouldn't we save the rook?
(!)16...Rb8 leads to the same result. When you look at this move here, it seems so very simple to find this move for black. However, to tell the truth, it is very very difficult. There was no way for white to know that this was the key line when there were many other side variations that needed to be calculated. Some of them had multiple branching points at every half move, leading to dozens of variations. It is calculation at the highest level! By the way, most calculations an master makes in his games will never look anything close to this. There are usually few branching points in the simpler variations, so we can calcualte them easily. Now, the critical moment has passed, and black has a winning advantage. However, Nevednichy, the GM, is confused and blunders the advantage right back!
The smoke has more or less cleared, and black has a crushing attack and 3 pawns for the piece. Now, 19.Re1 Qc8 wins for black.
(?)Certainly not the best move. 19...e4! would have opened up decisive lines against the weak white king, and frees the bishop. The f1 rook is not going anywhere after 20.fxe4 Qd6 with a raging initiative.
And in just these few moves, the position is more or less balanced! It is still probably somewhat favorable to black, but both sides have chances. Although black has the rooks, they are not effective, since all their open files are totally blocked off!
Now white is back in the game, and has a clear plan. He has more force on the kingside, so it is time to start an offensive there.
Probably the best move, showing that the d5 bishop is worth more than the rook.
Now black has to give up the queen to avoid mate, so white has won. An amazing game. Neither player can be blamed much; Very few chess players would be able to even find the right candidate moves in the variations.
This moves "breaks" my attack on the kingside. I am experimenting now how to face it, and by this moment, Qb3 it is almost the only way to consistently develop the game for white.
Black thinks that it's ok to leave the queens on the table, and that an exchange started by him is not the better idea. <n>Black has to discover that letting the exchange to white is dangerous, too...
Why to open further the game?
No way for black to defend the pawn.
I get rid of his second Bishop, leaving me at an advantage if a two-minor-piece end game arises.
I definitely don't want to give back the minor exchange.
With the consideration that I don't want my B trapped behind my Pawn chain. Now it can participate in the coming attack.
This is a mistake, as it opens the KR file and lets my Rook have an avenue of attack.
This Bishop is destined to play a key role on this diagonal.
Hastily rushing to the K-side to defend.
Threatening BxN forking Q and R, and if BxN QxB??? QxQ mate.
Black has exchanged queens, but is far behind in development and needs to play carefully.
Develops and protects against a check and pin. An alternative to consider was... a6 to prevent the N from going to b5.
Preparing for pressure on d6 and 0-0-0. The alternative 8 Nb5, Na6 9 Nbd6  was to be considered.
Wins a pawn and forces the king to move.
Black tries to exchange pieces to gain some freedom.
Black wants to drive off the bishop.
Finito! Black can only avoid mate by giving up a piece, and resigns. Interesting how quickly what are seemingly fairly normal defensive moves entangle the black position.
If it doesnot go on the kingside, I must try to broke blacks' Queenside.
I try to open files for my rooks. After Nxe5 dxe5 I would have a big advantage.
The black king is alone and the Bxe5 gives pain.
Hi everyone!<n><n>I have joined the Annotations Project Part 3 Mini-tournament and I am trying to avoid stepping on the mines playing the black pieces.  Yup, black is Q for 2 pieces up but the minor pieces, e.g. the knights and bishops are everywhere so it is a minefield for the BK and BQ.  Now, my buddy Thom Pham (tofuman) who is a Dentist has bravely joined this tournament.  Although he currently has a Class D rating, he has an optimum rating of 1407 so underestimate him at your peril lest he drill a terrific cavity in your rating and give you a massive toothache!  I thought I would annotate this game because he is due to be my opponent and I do not wish to incur my second loss against him so I need to learn something from it to be prepared.   Freddy, the Master Mater has used the Caro-Kann Defence to build up to the traditional Queen Sac.  The Caro-Kann is 1. ..... c6 in response to 1. e4, preparing a move like d5.  I will comment further on the action after white's 9th move.   You can follow the game move by move by referring to the Gameknot Analysis version of this game as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14257584&rnd=0.7276568196264748
10. Nf7 - hmm, this actually breaks the rule of Do Not Cash In Too Soon.  It may redress the material balance but it wastes tempi.
16. ..... Rf8 - black looks OK here, he is fully developed and just needs to play a move like Kc7 and then try and take advantage of white's lack of development - he still needs to move out his c1 bishop to prepare castling long.
17. ...... h6 - instead black decided to chase Thom's knight around.  Aha, I see that after Ng5 Kc7 is not possible because of a Royal Fork on e6!
20. ..... Ka5? - I do not like this move as Kc7 IS now possible.  I fear that for the BK things are gonna get really horrible.  I feel it is far too early for the king to come out into the middle of the board unless forced to do so, do you the jury agree?
25. ...... Kxb4 - It seems as though he has given up his knight to save his queen, but, now comes a royal skewer from Thom's dark square bishop which finally develops on move 25 to devastating effect ...... for black ....
27. Bxc5 MATE!! - the Royal couple perish together and The Dentist (Well played there Thom) has his day.
Hi all! This is the second game in this team match (the first can be found here: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/kings-gambit-i-accept?gm=45099 ). I open with the English, and after a lot of quiet posturing early on, some convoluted action starts happening in the center, eventually culminating in a frenzy of activity ranging all across the board. I come out of it ahead in material, but my opponent has surprising resources left to him and my pieces are scattered all over.
This is the Anglo-Indian: Black intends to fianchetto his King's Bishop and attack the White center from the flanks. Of course, as yet, White doesn't have a center to attack.
White proclaims his intention to compete with the Black Bishop for the a1-h8 diagonal.
No one has set foot in the center yet, but the squares are already hotly contested. White's King's Bishop has a strong diagonal supported by the pawn at c4, but he's going to need to move his Knights sometime.
Black makes the first claim to own a center square, snubbing White's DSB's reach somewhat and giving Black some space on the kingside.
Black's QB can't move out yet, as it must guard b7, and ...Nc6 would allow White to exchange on that square, inflicting doubled pawns on Black's formation (though again, White must not give up his KB lightly with all the holes on his kingside light squares.
Both players are continuing their development logically. Black's position is a little more reserved than White's, but by no means is it significantly inferior. With this move, White places a piece of his own in the center of the board, and challenges Black to do something about it.
Now each player has a Knight on a good center square. Black still has a little development to complete, but after some preparation again e3-e4 and driving the White Knight away with ...c5, he may be able to bring his Bishop out with tempo to f5.
13.Nf3 would also be okay, but it invites 13...Bg4, developing Black's QB and forcing the Knight to move again.
Pinning the Knight, but this Bishop has no future this far across the board.
White brings up his Knight, aiming to entrench a Knight in the hole at d5 and blockade Black's backward pawn.
? The Bishop moves a third time along the same diagonal, with a paltry threat, easily parried with yet another gain of tempo.
This Bishop has now spent four moves to arrive at a square it only needed one move to reach.
Black wants to open a diagonal for his DSB, and he doesn't actually have any way to defend d6 anyway, so this move prevents White from playing Rxd6 with tempo against the BQ.
Instead, tempo is gained harassing the Rook. This move marks the beginning of the bloodiest phase of the game--pieces of both colors, waiting on the flanks, fly to the center to kill and be killed.
This is a very strong square for a Knight; however it isn't meant to last. This move forces Black to trade off his Bishop, but more importantly for White, it allows a free Rook lift to the fifth rank.
The d-file is becoming a dangerous place to be. Black also has the problem of dealing with the threats to his Ne5 and pawn at c5. This answers both, for the moment.
White's King's Bishop is no longer useful on the long diagonal, so it moves to become dangerous again.
Thinking to play ...Qxa2 and pin the DSB, but there's no time to actually get it done.
??! Black throws several pieces to the wolves at once, striving for counterplay with the threat to White's Bishop and the fork at e3, but it is not enough.
White is having none of Black's shenanigans; now the back rank is cleared out, though White is about to lose his other Rook as well, to this marauding Knight.
Black kicks the Knight to try to get his Queen back into play.
White is now in a curious situation. He is vastly ahead in material, but his King and Queen are relatively trapped behind a wall of pawns, with the BQ glaring angrily at them. Slipping the WQ out should ensure a speedy mate on the Black King, but only if White can avoid the BQ's nasty checks.
? These queenside pawns were not doing anything for anyone, and now White's DSB is at least two moves from doing anything productive. White underestimates Black's chances for counterplay with only a Bishop and Queen, and this move wastes valueable time. Better is 31.e5! Bxe5 32.f4 Bd4 (or 32...Qa1+ 33.Kg2 Bd4) 33.Qe8+ Kg7 34.Nf5+ gxf5 35.Be5+, simplifying to a winning endgame for White and keeping a firm hold on the initiative. The text move allows Black to claw his way into the driver's seat.
! This seemingly-simple move is the first in a series of tricks that Black has up his sleeve. The d-file is now closed off, so nothing can get across to attack the Black King, and nothing can get home to defend the White King.
?! I think it was more accurate to play 32.f4. White needs an escape route for his King through this forest of "friendly" pawns, or the BQ will start rampaging through the White queenside. The text gives the King some luft, but 32.f4 would prevent ...g5! after 32...Qa1+ 33.Kg2 Qg1+ Kf3, whereas the text offers no defense against the Black pawns.
!? This pawn thrust is surprisingly dangerous, cutting off the escape square h4, and threatening ...h5 to lock the WK away in his corner.
White hopes in vain to trade off the cruel Bishop.
White is still reluctant to attempt to trade off the Queens with 37.Qg2, even though it would give him a clearly won endgame.
! Black maintains his hold on the initiative and pulls the WK away from his pawns and away from his Queen.
38.Kxh5 Qxf3+ 39.Kxg5 Qxe4 leaves White *still* unable to catch the BK.
White has to be extremely careful now. For instance, 39...Kg7 40.Qd8?? Bf6+ 41.Qxf6+ Qxf6+ 42.Kxh5 Qxh6+ 43.Kg4 Qxb6 and Black has an easy win, or 39.Kg7 40.Bf5?? (to defend e4 and cut off the BQ from the BK) 40...Bf6#!
? This allows the White Bishop to interpose on f5 with check, preventing mate on f6. Better was an immediate 39...Kg7.
The last hurrah, but there are no more serious mate threats left--now it's just a question of how much material he can force White to give up before the BQ finally runs out of steam.
The attack on the pawn is failed, so let's try to mix the cards
Sacrifice the horse. I'm still in doubt about this. I meant to force the black to column the pawns, or to make the queen move to finally win that pawn. But I opened the street for the tower, or let the queen have a straight road to my downtown.
Another change of side, to let my tower advance and threat the horse
invaders must die!
I was in doubt, if trying to ignore that big bad tower and continue the attack on the other side. But I don't like big bad towers. Even if that meant stopping my white bishop's threat to white's pawn-queen-tower
preventing queen to advance in 2 moves protected by the tower
Let's try to unblock the situation
Here's the first of some moves I didn't catch. But for me it was "loss time" of my enemy, it was good.
If the
and today i hosted a game 3 day / move as black 1450-2000 rating and he joined for a 4th rematch. the pressure was on. one of my big rivals i have to even the score here!
and so i go with what i find to be my strongest black start against d4 openers, e6.  this Game will demonstrate the importance of time in chess on a few occasions. and the importance of always looking at all moves possible.
i decide to play this to throw him off. im pretty sure he expected c5 but i have plans for my c pawn and this prevents his knight from going to rest on the e5 square.
and so i place my DSB on my favorite diagonal instead of developing my other knight.
i personally thought that his e3 move and his bishop move to d3 allowed me to play this following sequence
strengthen my d pawn in anticipation of his e4 and create an opening for my bishop if he decides to push by instead of exchanging on the d file.
anticipated. i now have another time gain. i decide to use it to reinforce my defensive position. to solidify a future mid and prevent the e5 push
decides to exchange instead of passing by. this delighted me it opens up the resting spot for my e knight again and strengthens mid.
decide to further setup a defensive structure. i still havent decided if im king side castling. time seems not to afford it at the moment.
this finally allows knight to go back to c6
i was trying to force a knight exchange that knight on f3 is bothersome for DSB dives.  but i also have to be careful of the blind check from the rook
it immediately invites be3 and i dont really have an attack with my queen from this square man this is a big concern.
and so i take the oppurtunity to take off the bother some knight and thought he would take back with his queen and i would castle long and it would solve alot of problems.  but right away as i played this i saw that if he takes with his knight it can be an annoying situation and he would still have a knight posted on f3.
forces my queen retreat i was dissapointed now with my losses of time before he can trade out my DSB if he wants
hmm doesnt swap out my DSB so im pretty sure hes eyeing for my g7 pawn. and for some reason for the last 3 moves i missed and so did he miss my hanging pawn on d5
my opponent blunders here i believe probably not anticipating my LSB move i think he played too quick. for me i took a second to look if that is what he wanted me to do. i couldnt see any threats come if i did.
and so i accept and now my queen is set up for a deadly attack on his king.  this entire game i kept thinking about a recent comment i read by Ion,  that often when kings castle on opposite sides of the board the one who often attacks first is often the victor.  and the tempo i lost with my qb6 move earlier.
sorta anticipated as it creates alot of pressure around my king. but i do not plan on ever moving the b and a pawn unless forced to. so i dont know if this is a time gain
i decide to develop my last minor piece and cover the dangerous attacks that can come from f5 and connect my rooks. i thought this to be a pretty good move here.
i can see a dangerous attack coming if he dives his bishop
he decides to stay within the ranks of my king i wonder if rc1 is better. yes it invites qb2 but i dont think it would be wise to send my queen up there at this stage
huge time loss by me. sigh i was supposed to just play f4 here. this might throw me on the defensive again. but atleast it creates pressure on his queen and i can choose to displace her if i want to.  trading here for him is a loss of tempo on his queen i believe.
and so i still decide to move forward with my pawn
i decide to protect my d pawn in anticipation to his b5 in case i decide to swap out rooks
here i think im forced and i think he wouldve been wiser to take with either the bishop or the rook lol having quadruple coverage on the square. i was really hoping he would take with the pawn and this would buy me all the time i would need to attack
pressure on the rook have to keep covering the e square. he cant take my DSB unless he wants to lose his Queen
perfect. same scenario as below he cant take the d pawn and my plan was to take with my f pawn anyway to start my attack. this only invites fxg3
so i can now send in my other bishop
i can ignore that and let him take my pawn with his LSB, if he wants, and my king will be perfectly safe recapturing on b7 protecting himself.<n><n>now i still had a hard time seeing the proper play from here lol even with all the pressure.
opponent resigns.  a free queen and his entire attack has also petered out. and the following rook would shortly drop also and then he would also have a hanging lsb.  i hope you all enjoyed the game.  tied with my highest rated beaten opponent ill take it! 2-2
gambit accepted. i think this is the first one i post where the gambit is accepted,<n><n>its meant to undermine whites middle and take it for yourself. the proper reply is d5 to take middle and recapture the pawn with your WSB
followed by recapturing the pawn,   some whites will double pawn you here immediately if they dont know the lines well and to avoid further black shannanigans, a double pawn situation is acceptable and very playable for the black as this opening makes for a strong king side attack and apart from getting double pawned it might be the only time you play on the queen side of the board.
e6 is the proper reply. if white takes out the DSB. you block with your DSB. if he promotes his knight to e5 you defend with your queen on d6.
my oponent decided to play the knight now. you see the importance of d4 over d3 last move it will gain me time to reinforce my other knight and have no possible double bishop pins
now all is left is to kick the bishop away or force the entire exchange as i like to do
my oponent decides to not retreat and open up the game its desired
here he probably knows that on my following move i will trade off knights and try to gain a pawn with my queen and he decides to swap out knights instead of reinforcing the position i think this was a mistake.
now if we look at the board on move 10. he has 3 passive pieces top right side. with 1 middle pawn gone. black has center control and is 2 moves from full development and onwards king side attack,<n>the bearing down on the c3 pawn is also supposed to force my oponent into defending it thus giving me more time. my play simple develop bishop to d3, king side castle having the open file from my f5 move,
take my favorite diagonal for my DSB
he decided to pull a queen check now it is too late he had to do it way earlier when he still had his other knight. he missed his left side opurtunity for counter tricks, <n><n>to defend this it is very important not to use your pawns keep em aligned as long as possible having lost the F file pawn
here if the queen doesnt retreat to e2 or d1 i will take that c3 pawn i was eyeing earlier and that false sense of security he got with his knight,
this i think for me was a mistake but i didnt want his queen going right side at any stage during this game. and i was looking for possible ways to attack with my bishop on his queen but those were all plans made on the spot due to my opponents reactions and i should be focusing on the checkmate left side instead<n><n>although as i said earlier queen side play isnt  necessary during this game and can throw you off course.
he sees the threat coming decides to block it and forces my retreat. which i liked cause it came back to me during the game i dont need to play queen side.
when he replied this i saw the weakness in my pawn i didnt want to focus a battle there so i decided to gain time on the queen this was a mistake
as soon as i played this move i was like damn what did i do i just missed my favorite trap,<n><n>the proper play here is Rook to f7 and letting him eat the pawn with queen as in:<n><n>and then Qxe6 Bxh2+, Kxh2   Qxe6!!!
i was so happy he stayed in that file but i had to give him the opurtunity to take the pawn before he backed his queen with his rook. he didnt see the trap yet
he takes it.  why it was so important to do Rf7 earlier! now i still have to block with the rook but pray he doesnt move the queen or reinforce with his rook.
Dun Dun Dun! it cost me an extra bishop cause of my earlier attack/mistake with my black bishop but i still got my favorite trap! btw those are the bishop sacrifices i mentioned in title (i think :D)
i decided to move my queen first because i inivited the rook to go to the C file
all i wanted was for his knight not to come to f4
and it didnt!<n><n>time to scramble for a checkmate, it looks so close yet it can be very far id appreciate anyone telling me if i took a detour lol
here im trying to cramp the king more but its important not to go to high with the pawn in this situation or everything can backfire
hmm my fight isnt on f2 although he thinks it is. although the way my pieces were aligned i wouldved judged the battle was headed to f1 after my pawn move, i wonder if him moving his rook there is weakening.<n><n>for what i had planned it was perfect i considered it a wasted move
if he takes the rook with the pawn he cannot stop the checkmate. all whites replies from here on would be appreciated.<n><n>but a "free" rook looks too juicy, this being the rook "sacrifice" (i think :D)<n><n>with this move is also why i thought the fight was going to end on f1 and why his rook to c2 delighted me
GM Mihai Suba is an excellent GM who's played a lot of strange ideas, and frequently pulls out oddly spectacular victories.  In this game he takes black against GM Raicevic.  He begins the game with a speculative gambit and quickly gains a developmental advantage.  His pieces find ingenious ways to march forward, and he wins in nice style.  I recommend flipping the board as Suba plays black and having a board at your side while watching this so that you can analyze variations.
Normally this move seems a little weak as the pawn will (and does in this game) grow weak on e4.  However Suba is prepared to give up the pawn.
This is Suba's idea, the Bellon gambit.  If white takes black will get a good game via 5.cxb5 d5 or 5.Nxb5 I think is met by 5... c6 with ...d5 to follow, but maybe 5... Bb7 is a more natural continuation.  I think white's best response is 5.d3 where white is solid and black's pawns will soon look weak.<n><n>I initially wrote the awful idea of 5.Nxb5 d5?! 6.cxd5 Qxd5?? but that hangs a queen to 7.Nxc7 .  I got a bad rating off this, and I apoligize as it was a silly mistake to make.  I hope others won't rank it as harshly for one silly (but now corrected) blunder in the analysis.
Black continues to develop with threats.
So, after ten moves white is up a pawn, but his bishops looks AWFUL.  Black's got two potentially useful files, a nice pair of bishop and an active queen.
Black does not want to trade his light squared bishop for black's knight, the light one is better than the dark, because the dark squared bishop's diagonal has been blunted by the pawn one e3.
Black continues development and adds a little pressure to the knight on f4.
Black has basically concluded development (as opposed to white who has an embarassingly bad bishop on c1) and he now goes for the attack, the two bishop are pointing menacingly towards the king and the rest of the pieces now enter the attack with the following excellent move.
The knight should not be taken as after 15.exd4 Qxf4 and black has targets on d4 and e2.
The knight still shouldn't be taken and white threatens the queen (16... Nf3  would win the white queen).  Suba continues to develop with threats.
But once again black manages to retain his powerful knight on d4.  The knight is still safe as 18.exd4?? Qxg2 ! 19.Kxg2 Rg4#.
And as always, the knight has no need to retreat as black would take back with the bishop, winning black's queen with a royal fork.  Black also brings to the kingside with the threat of ...Rxh3 as the g pawn is pinned.
The king sidesteps the pin, so the knight on d4 is (finally) forced to retreat.
But it stays on the kingside.
This is either a weak move, or an extremely clever move.  Black's queen intends to find a home on h6 but first it pressures e3.  However white gains a free tempo attacking black's queen, maybe though white's next (developing) move actually brings his bishop away from it's defensive duties.  It turns out that this idea proves extremely useful later.
Looking back from move 29, I think that 20... Qe6 is one of the most fantastic moves of the game.  It acted as a decoy to bring the bishop away from it's defensive square on d1.
After 23.Kg1 Ne2  forking king, queen bishop and even pawn on d4 should leave the advantage in black's hands.
And the kingside cover is blown, so he flees.
After 24.gxh3 Qxh3  I assume Suba wouldn't've taken the prepetual, but would've played 25.Kg1 Qg3  26.Kh1 Re5!! threatenening 27... Rh5# and when the rook is taken 28.dxe5 Qh3# because the dark bishop has once again entered the game.  This would've been a fabulous finish but the attack still retains interest.
So, after a few checks white seems to have diluted some of the attack.  How to continue?
Black's bishop had lost value on b7 (it was stuffed by the pawn chain) and it now finds a new way to take part in the attack.
However, Suba finds better thatn 28... Qf1  where black might escape.  This move wins g2 and brings the attack back to life (not that it had died, it just looked stymied for a moment).
The bishop tries to return to the defensive square it was coaxed out of by 20...Qe6!
Now black has equalized material (which seems somewhat unimportant now) and he adds pressure to the e file.
This may lose a pawn, but it closes the e file with a following f4.
Trying to stop ...c5! which would allow the dark squared bishop to enter the game with devastating effect via Bd8-h4.
This odd looking move follows the same plan.  When the pawn is taken white loses the ability to block the bishop's maneuver with g5.  Another spectacular move and a very tough one to see, at least for me (hey, that rhymed!).
A great reply!  Who needs the rook when black mates with Qd2# or Qf2#.  Black resigned here.  I hope you enjoyed this spectacular, and ever insightful attack.  The gambit led to good compensation and he always found astonishing ideas to keep the attack going.  If you have any comments or criticisms I'd love to hear them.  I think studying the way ideas are formed around use of pieces and tactical plans could greatly help almost anyone's play.  I hope to study and improve from this game more when I have time.  Honestly, I think this is one of the most phenomenal games I've ever seen and I hope I gave it justice here.  If you give a low rating please tell me why.
!?  An interesting move, showing that black will play his king's knight to e7 and then probably to g6.  This indirectly impacts the d4 square and is not as vulnerable as I had thought.  I wanted to attack the queen with Nc3 Nd5 but saw that Nge7 refuted it quickly. After researching this position, I found that on chess.com all the given games of this time give the win to black.  This is a sideline in the Cordel/Classical Ruy Lopez that I wasn't familiar with as I normally see the Berlin or the Steinitz Defenses.  This is a solid defense for black indeed when played correctly.
Prefering to not give me control over the d4 push after Bxe3 fxe3 (with the semi open f file to boot).  This is still found in databased GM games and is a common response to the logical Be3.
Anticipating black to castle short, this move allows the bishop to relocate to a more useful diagonal.  White plans on exchanging the dsb for control over d4 and thus central power.  It doubles black's b pawns but there is much to be said about the compensation black gets for activity on the QS down the a file.
The bishop serves well here against its inactive black counterpart.  Now h6 shows to be a bit of a weakening of the KS light squares.
Preventing the annoying Bg4 that Capablanca played in this variation at one point which leads to crushing activity for black with the semi open a file in combination.  This does allow Nf4, which I was concerned about, offering the sac on h3, although I considered tucking the king to h1 and Rg1 to take control and crush counterplay after the bishop sac.
Striking for a break in the center
Not black's best to be sure... though f4 is still theoretically weak for white atm
?  A strange move, which I capitalized on quickly otb.  This prevents the queen from going back along the dark diagonal.  The idea seems to be a quick c5 to strick at white's strong center, but this is debunked with...
Showing the semi open a file a quick way to develope black's queen's rook.  This combination that follows (which I calculated for the most part, although black chose the more interesting exchange sacrifice that I didn't believe he would) proves the oddity that is the undeveloped lsb of black.
I thought the black rook would aggressively swing to h5 to prepare to sac on h3 with the bishop but there it would be tactically vulnerable
An interesting idea, I was thinking perhaps after Qxf3 and ...Qxf3 gxf3 Bxh3 with some chances though black is better with the queen's on the board if he seeks initiative on the KS with his knights.  This seeks counterplay and black does achieve some semblance of attack but the center proves to thwart the majority of his potential.  I certainly was forced to be wary and hold ground instead of trying to pound in my positional and material edge for quite some time, which drained my clock and gave my opponent the psychological edge for awhile.
Allowing black counterplay but proving all his efforts to be well met with stubborn defense.  This creates an important passed d pawn, and with the pawns connected in the center this is a large trump card.
Perhaps Rfe1 was better, but this has a clear goal of supporting the center, and preventing the black queen from infiltrating on d2 to cause trouble by double attacking bishop and b pawn.  It allows the annoying Nf4 though....
Kh1 was necessary because if Qg3 earlier ...Ne2+ winning the queen.  This slows down black's attack and forces a retreat which gives white some tempo.
Soldifying the material edge and closing out black's queen's options before advancing with an attack
Black seems a bit limited though I think the activation of his rook might have been important (then his king would be more vulnerable to attack).  He has committed enough effort on the KS where he seems drained on the QS and is now somewhat zugzwanged (not literally but it seems so by the passivity of his attempts, he must avoid exchanges and simplifications as he will surely lose the resulting endgame as is).
White uses black's wasted tempo to develop some initiative against black's king.  Many tactical opportunities may become presented against f7
What follows is calculated to win the exchange...
! Calculated to win, the pin picks up the knight for two pawns
This is perhaps dangerous for white even with his substantial edge in material because of the exposed nature of his king, though there is a solid defense, which I do not take.  I actually blunder but have saving move that gives the endgame later indicated.   Qg3 was best I believe here with the line: Qg3 Bxf1 Qxg5 hxg5 Rxf1 and white is clearly winning with connected passed center pawns and the exchange up with black having two sets of useless doubled pawns.  This line is preferable for black over Qg3 Qxg3?? gxf3 Bxf1 Rxf1 and the pinned knight is lost again with the same motif that lost its partner earlier, black is even more lost.  After Qg3 the first line is best, and because the black queen is the sole defender of the f4 knight, which holds together black's KS operations, black cannot retreat the queen anywhere but g5 where it is weaker and after Rg1 or Rc1 black is the one in trouble.  I blunder here with Rg1, although white is still winning after the resulting line
! Threatening mate in one with Bg2 double check (mate). The following move is calculated as the only saving move for white which gives away a large portion of his advantage in material but forces a simplification that leaves him with an endgame where he has at very least the draw, and with correct play a win because of his pawns
!  The only defense, for now if Kxg7 Qg3+ simplifying to the endgame with a forced queen trade, and if the king moves then Kg1 is saving because Bh2 to prepare Qh1# is met by Rxg2 and all is good for white.
The wrong idea.  Black wants to get to e4 if possible to try to undermine the center pawns, although this is preventable and white can just play to the QS to create more passed pawns with correct play
I went on to win from here and stopped annotating but I got my King to the QS and forced black to sack the knight for the e pawn and then sacked the rook for the h pawn so that I had passed a and c pawns with black's king on the KS corner.  My opponent resigned with 30 seconds left with his bishop on c8 (my pawns on d6 and h5 after I played a6+ because one of the pawns will queen and black is lost.
White went a bit off script for the Stonewall. That pawn is usually played to c3 instead of c4. Now it looks like he has transposed into a Queen's Gambit (it's not much of a gambit now with his bishop defending the pawn at c4), maybe the Marshall Defense with the black knight at f6, though an early pawn move to e3 is not really main line for white in the Marshall Defense.
Black wants to castle, so the bishop move clears the way. I considered 4. ... Bb4, but after 5. Bd2 we just end up exchanging bishops. I wanted to keep the position complex, so exhanging pieces early was contrary to my plans in that regard. Of course, white can easily play c5 at any time to drive back my bishop, so e6 might not have been the wisest choice for black here.
I decided not to let white play his pawn to c5. After white's last move, taking the pawn now seems to gain a little tempo.
This move is contrary to my intention of keeping things complicated, giving white a chance to trade queens if he wants simplification. But I felt I needed to challenge his center.
White can choose not to capture the bishop. Either way, he has already lost a pawn with no recompense.
Black is up a pawn and he has ruined white's castle. Of note is the fact that we have opposite colored bishops, and eventually, if white is allowed to exchange everything else off the board, black cannot force a win with K B P vs. K B when the bishops are on opposite colors.
Black cannot leave the knight on b5 where it is just one move away from c7 where it wins the rook on a8. The black queen defends c7 for now, but she can be easily chased, and being tied to the defense of c7 limits her scope. Also, with a6, black gives his rook freedom to escape if white's knight is ever played to c7.
d6 dangerous place for the white knight. It has no credible threats, and it can be easily attacked. As I noted after black's 11th move, black is in favor of white playing Nxc8 as that eliminates the opposite colored bishop ending.
I don't know what the pawn on a4 is good for. Perhaps white was thinking about playing his rook to b3 to threaten black's pawn on b7. But his knight is still in a precarious position, and now I pin it there. White seems to have no escape. If 15. Nxb7 or 15. N(d6)e4, to threaten black's queen, black can play 15. ... Rxd1 and now white's rook is en prise and white loses material. It's interesting to note how destructive 9. ... Bxh2  was to white's position. If white's king stood next to his rook on f1, white's knight could escape this pin and even win the pawn on b7 (black couldn't play 15. Bxb7? for white wins a rook with Qxd8 ).
Eat the knight before it escapes, especially since now it can capture at b7 guarded by its queen.
Black is ahead by knight and pawn, and more than willing to liquidate pieces. White dubiously offers the first of the liquidations.
Of course, white has Qd8 , but black's queen can save the day with Qf8. However, this takes black's queen out of the center of the board and puts white on the offensive, so I deem it best to prevent the move, which also serves to broaden my queen's scope once she's not tied to preventing checkmate. In retrospect, I think the better move would have been 17. ... Qh5  to force the trading of queens.
White's 19. Ne2 seems to serve little purpose. It has nowhere to move that presents any threat to black. In fact, it opens up e4, which looks like a great home for a black knight. But I choose a move that might give me an opportunity to pin and exchange white's knight.
OK, let's exchange. If 22. Bxc5 Bxd1, 23. Rxd1 Nxc5 black comes out a piece ahead, and his rook protects against the back-rank checkmate.
Queens are gone, the opposite-bishop ending has been prevented, and black has a winning material advantage. Time to figure out how to win with it.
This was a bad move by black. I wanted freedom for my king to get off of the bank rank and make himself useful. I wanted to move towards the center, so the f-pawn made sense to me, but 25. ... f5 makes my pawn at e6 backward. However, as played, my knight on h5 is now trapped and falls after 26. f4 and 27. g4.
OK, if I must lose the knight, maybe I can win a couple pawns for it. I anticipate white's next move, but it wins me one pawn after 27. Rd6 Nxa5, 28. Rxe6 Nxb3 and now black has adjacent passed pawns on the a and b files and has extended his material advantage.
Aha! White fell into my trap, but he missed the other outcome, namely, that his doomed pawn at b3 was required to remain home and suffer the consequences because it prevented this fork. It's not the deadliest fork, since white can avoid losing material with 29. Rd3 Nxa3, 30. Rxa3, but black has just won a pawn, extending his lead, and now exchanges knight for bishop, liquidating more material.
I could have played 30. ... Nxf4 to capture at least one pawn in exchange for the doomed knight. But I think adjacent passed pawns on the queenside is a better way to gain a pawn. I truly expected white to defend with 31. Re4 which allows my knight to escape his doom with 31. ... f5, 32. Pxf5 Nf6 and now white must save his rook, but all the squares on the 4th rank are covered, so he cannot continue to protect his pawn at b4. End result, an even exchange of pawns and black's knight escapes with that deadly pair of passed pawns on the queenside.
The kingside is locked. Time to promote a pawn (or two).
Not 35. ... Pxh6? 36. Kh5 Kg7, 37. Re7  and now black must lose both H-pawns and white gains a pawn majority and a strong attack on the kingside. The move as played retains the lock, blocking white's king's advance. Of course, white cannot capture at g6 because he loses his rook, and even with another capture at h7, he cannot promote his passed pawns due to black's rook on a1.
The only move to defend the b5 pawn was 36. ... Ra5, tying my rook to dfense and allowing white a probable draw with perpetual check Rb7  and Rb8  (if black moves away from g6, white threatens to promote a pawn with Pxb6). Black might be able to stave off destruction after 36. ... Ra5, 37. Rb7  Ne2, but 38. Pxg6 thratens to promote a white pawn. I think black can hold out with 38. ... Kxg6 and now white has no more attacks to dislodge the black king. However, I am worried that I might have overlooked something and it just seems imprudent to allow white to play for that combination when it can be prevented. As played, I can now save my pawn with 37. ... b4. White must move his rook, it is en prise. And no matter what he does, black can play 37. ... Nxe3 .
And now black's kingside is perfectly secure, white has no perpetual check while black can safely hide on his own back rank, or safely block with his knight. And black's pawn at a4 is clear to advance.
White stalled, and now he's out of steam. White probably wants to get his king into the center, to block the black knight's best squares and to try to support his rook in stopping the advancing black pawn, but he is blocked from approaching the center (without going all the way down through f3 to e2, unless he moves his rook to a safer square first.
And now white commits his ultimate sin, and black is unwilling to offer mercy. White wanted the center, just like I had expected he would, but he failed to observe the consequences of not going the long way around.
White is making it easy on black, approaching an edge of the board. Time for black to limit the white king's range. At this point I announced mate in 5.
My opponent didn't return to this game right away, allowing me some free time to explore the Conditional Moves feature. By the time I was done, I had entered 23 combinations that covered every possible avenue of white moves from now through checkmate. A couple days later when I was offline, I received a message that I had won this game by checkmate, and I wasn't even there.
Saves the knight and defends the rook from a square the white king cannot reach.
Final position. 49. ... Qd7   would have also worked, but 22 of my 23 Conditional Move combinations ended with black making the exact same moves from 46 through 49. The only different combination was if white played 46. Ke8 Qf6, 47. Kd7 Qd8   because it was 2 moves faster (hence prettier). On a side note, I wish the Conditional Moves feature allowed some kind of wildcard for my opponent's move, so that I could have essentially said "whatever white plays, I play this one move in response. A feature like that would have allowed me to enter just a single Contitional Move sequence to arrive at this position (white's king might end on e8) instead of entering 23 combinations. In any case, it was a fun exercise to work out all the combinations.
same for my opponent, so I decided to go to vienna oppening with black pieces
he must be considering second one and decided to guard it
closing the shooting space of my black bishop
so at the end I have centralised queen, very powerfull knight and king ready to castle with open f file.black need to defend the a rook and has a lot of weak undefended squares...not bad uh?
my knight now has choise to choose between to tasty rooks:)
??have no idea. at this moment I thought that I need to shift my heavyweight weapon to kingside as soon as possible.
Initiating another exchange.
Now I have a small edge AND a chance to swap off the heavy pieces, magnifying the Pawn up. This is the turning point of the game.
Even after Black takes the advanced QBP, I'll still have a 3 to 2 Q-side majority. I plan to advance these Pawns and force one through to the 8th rank.
I'm shocked Black exchanged off the Knights. With every piece that vanishes my advantage of one Pawn is magnified, and we're down to just one piece each left.
Now it's just a matter of technique. Of course, I must centralize my King.
Now the wall of Pawns prevents Black's K from approaching on the Q-side.
The KP must now fall. Black resigns.
Now I was thinking that its good time to get king to safety.
Im trying to force whites bishop to move and white doesnt have black squared bishop so my king is still in good safety
38.Ra4!? Rxb5 39.Rxa7 and white would have slightly better chances to get into game if black makes mistake.
The King's Pawn opening, my personal favorite.<n><n>Note: be sure to read the full introduction to this game (click the back arrow)
Rather than threatening to win a pawn with 3) ... Bb4, black decides to solidify d4 further.  The potential downside to this opening is that black's light-square bishop will be very restricted if the center closes up.
Although this move seems strange at first, it's the only real spot for the knight, since it could be kicked out of the f6 square after white plays e5.  The knight will soon move to g6, freeing up black's dark-square bishop.
Developing the bishop to eye h7 after an eventual e5.
Completing the knight maneuver and freeing the dark-square bishop.
Leaving the database and closing up the center, thus restricting the mobility of black's light-sqare bishop.  My own light-square bishop is now poised for an eventual kingside attack.
This move seemed a bit strange to me at first.  However, it does a couple of things for black.  First, it expands on the queenside.  Second, it gives black's light-square bishop room to develop.  Third, it has the possibility of attacking my knight on c3 with the move b4.
Black prepares to castle as well.  I think that b4 is the better square for the bishop, but the bishop on e7 is still a farily solid defensive structure.
Developing the bishop and allowing me two options: Qd2 and Nd2.
Rather than commit his king immediately by castling, black decides to develop his second knight.
This move prepares the pawn thrust f2-f4, and also potentially prepares the knight maneuver Nd2-b3-c5, taking advantage of the weak square in black's position.  Of course, this knight manuever is more of a potential threat than an immediate threat, since both his knight and his bisop currently guard c5.
Now that black's king is committed to the kingside, I can start my kingside attack.
Closing the pawn structure and preventing f4-f5, as well as shutting off my light-square bishop from the attack.
Although this move looks aggressive, there aren't any immediate threats behind it.  The most immediate threat is that of Rf1-f3-h3, attacking h7.  I now no longer have the possibility of exf6 ep, but I had a different plan for dealing with the pawn on f5.
This move both removes black's threat of doubling pawns and starts to bring my knight potentially into the attack.
With the kingside pressure inevitably mounting, trading off queens to reduce pressure is a good idea for black.
I considered a move like 13) Ng3 (which probably would have been better), but I decided that I would have enough pressure to form an attack even without the queens on the board.
Continuing to push away his minor pieces from my position.
Black is now defensive and a bit restricted.  However, there's still potential for counterplay from black on the queenside.
Edging my pieces toward the kingside and eyeing the g5 square.  A knight on g5 would attack the currently undefended pawn on e6 (though he only needs to move his knight on d7 to defend it with the light-square bishop).
Preparing to expand and generate play on the queenside with c6-c5.  16) ... c5 is impossible because the pawn on b5 would hang.
At first glance, this move looks sort of odd.  However, it's all part of my kingside attack.  If I can put a rook on g1 and play g3-g4, I can start to bust open the kingside.
Continuing with the plan of expanding on the queenside.
I'm not worried about the queenside, however.  I'm focusing my energy lining everything up for a kingside attack.  Of course, I can't ignore the queenside, but I looked and didn't see any tactical shots he had on the queenside.
Finally developing the light-square bishop and connecting rooks on the back rank.  In the abstract, it also lines up his bishop with my knight (which is currently undefended) as well as my king, so I have to be wary of potential tactics.
The only possible bishop tactics I saw for black existed if I capured his c5-pawn with my d4-pawn, so I went ahead with my plan of attacking the kingside.
Black doesn't have much choice.  No matter what happens I will have the g-file to work with for my rooks.  If he allows 20) gxf5 exf5, I will have a protected passed pawn on e5 and I will still have the g-file open.  However, 19) ... fxg4 has its own downsides, as shown in the annotation for the next move.
I now threaten to win a pawn with 21) Bxg6 hxg6 22) Rxg6.  The only way to defend the pawn would be 22) ... Kf7, after which I still win the pawn after 23) Rag1, attacking the pawn once more.  Black cannot defend g6 enough.
My opponent does not wish to bring his king out into the open, so he decides to continue with his counter-attack on the queenside.
Now I'm up material and have plans of doubling rooks on the g-file to continue the attack.
This attacks my rook and prepares to move his king away from the now-open kingside.
I now threaten to win a second pawn.
The only way to defend the pawn.
A nastly little trap.  If black plays 24) exf5, then I immediately counter with 25) e5 , winning his knight.  The move 24) f5 also prepares to bring my bishop into the attack and threatens his pawn on e6.
Again, aiming to trade off material.
Considering that black is down a pawn, it would probably be better to have avoided the trade.
Although this move seems a bit counter-intuitive because it moves the bishop back to where it came from, it has plans of chasing away my rook with 28) ... Bf5.  Unfortunately for black, I now have a tactical shot to win another pawn.
! Because of black's last move, his pawn on g7 is now pinned to his rook on g8, so he can't take my bishop.  I will win the g7 pawn and have a passed pawn on the h-file.
Since black can't do anything about the pawn, he instead chooses to move his light-square bishop into my position with and eventual Be4, pinning my undefended knight.
Winning the second pawn.<n><n>Although I hadn't yet lost my other game in the tournament, I made the dangerous psychological decision of telling myself that I had already won this game.  Although black is down material and position in an endgame, he still has chances for counterplay.  Winning a won game is possibly the hardest thing to do in chess.  When your opponent is down and on the verge of destruction, he/she will be looking for his/her chances the most.  If you make one slip, the game might just slip away from you, and recovering from such a psychological blow can be very difficult.
Being up two pawns, all I need to do is trade off material (preferably the rooks) and I should have this game under wraps.  However, to do so I need to play the correct moves.  You don't win a chess game by making bad moves, after all.  You always need to play the best move, even in a winning position.
Moving the king toward the center as opposed to letting it become trapped on the edge.  In the engame, the king is a valuable fighting piece, and should be treated as such.  This theme of an active king being used as an attacking piece will eventually become the deciding factor of this game.
Again, offering to trade material and simplify.
Of course, my opponent can't take on g5.  If he plays 31) Bxg5, then I end the game immediately with 32) Nxg5#.  My rook now looks like it's running out of room, but I use my rook's active position to my advantage.
I now threaten two things.  One is to simply win the pawn on c5.  My other threat is to move my bishop, which then threatens Ng5# (note how my pawns and rook trap his king on e6).
Black finally relieves the tension on the queenside, but with a purpose.  After 34) bxc3 cxd4 35) cxd4, the threat of me winning the pawn on c5 no longer exists.
And the position has now simplified itself a bit.  I was starting to feel a bit uneasy about winning the game because of the positioning of my two passed pawns.  Passed pawns that aren't too far advanced and have two files in between them are able to be picked off by a lone enemy king.<n><n>I won't go into too much detail, but king-and-pawn endgame theory shows that two connected passed pawns are self-supported, since if the king takes the back one it will be unable to catch the other.  Likewise, passed pawns with one file between them are also self-supported due to a "wall" that they create.  Ironically, passed pawns with two files in between are no longer self-supported and can be picked off safely by the enemy king if the pawns are not advanced too far.<n><n>Although this was a bit far-fetched of an analysis of the position, that thought started to weigh down on my mind.
Potentially threatening Bc3 if I ever leave that square unguarded.  More importantly, though, it allows his rook to come into the game and threatens 36) ... Rf8, attacking the pinned piece.
I continue to centralize my king while unpinning the knight.  If black tries 36) ... Rf8, which threatens the knight, then I can play 37) Bf6 to adequately defend.
An interesting idea by black.  After my king recaptures, he will be able to move his rook onto the open file with check, buying him some time.
Now if I make a move like 38) Kg4, he will have the possibility of 38) ... Rf2, winning either the a-pawn or the h-pawn.
This move guards f2 while staying on light squares to avoid check by black's bishop.  Ke3 was probably a bit more accurate, though, and black utilizes my poor decision a bit later on.  The mistake: putting my king on the same rank as my pawns.
Avoiding a fork of his king an pawn after Rc6 .  This move also solidifies his bishop and pawn, who now defend each other and cannot be easily attacked.
Stopping me from pushing my passed h-pawn.<n><n>It was around this point in the game where I blundered in my other game.  I was frustrated at myself for making such a huge blunder in that other game (I was calculating a bunch of endgame lines and missed the fact that my first move allowed him to take my rook for free), and suddenly needed to win this game in order to advance in the tournament.  The psychological pressure definitely started affecting my moves, which were sometimes too forcing and not calculated enough.  My next move is a good example of this.
This move had the wishful thinking that he would go after my weak d-pawn with his king and play 40) ... Kf5.  My plan was then 41) Rf6 , hoping for him to play 41) ... Ke4, allowing 42) Rf4#.<n><n>Of course, I had calculated out other lines for black, and with each line I tried to convince myself that there was something there such that I could win by force.  The line that my opponent played was one that I had calculated out, but incorrectly evaluated at the end.<n><n>The move I probably should have played was 40) Kd3, as you will see later on.
As I expected, he declined the trade.  I also expected him to move to one of the open files, and probably the c-file, since it threatens Rc2 , winning a pawn.  This is the reason that 36) Kf2 was a mistake: it allows black to threaten Rc2 .  This is also why I should have played 40) Kd3.  Leaving my king on e2 was a mistake, and part of the reason I missed it being a mistake was because I was focusing on my attack, and not thinking clearly about his possible counter-attacks.<n><n>If my king were on d3, he probably would have moved his rook to f8 instead of c8 in order to threaten the move Rf2.  If his rook was on f8 instead of c8, his 42nd move would have needed to be different than what it was.  This would allow my to move my rook behind my passed e-pawn.  All will be explained in the next move's annotation.
Now it becomes clear why the rook can't be on f8.  If his rook is on f8 and he moves his king to d6 (or c6, like he did in the game), then I would have 43) e7 , winning the rook on f8.  If his rook is on f8 and he plays 42) ... Kc7 [or Kc8], then I play 43) e7, threatening his rook and preparing Re6 to get behind my passed pawn.  If his rook is on f8 and he plays 42) ... Ke8, I play 43) Bf6, followed by Rh8, forcing a trade of rooks.<n><n>Back to the game, this was all still part of my calculation made on move 40.  I figured he would move his king to c7, c6, or d6.  Afterwards, I would play 43) e7[ ], and he would play 43) ... Kd7.  That is what ended up happening in the game.
Now black is threatening my pawn on e7.  I'm still focused on trying to force a win, and I didn't want to just give up my passed pawn that was advanced so far.  I would love to play Re6 to get behind the passed pawn, but his king defends the e6 square.
The only move to defend the pawn.  However, this move was still a mistake.  This was still part of my calculation on move 40, and the continuation I saw was 44) ... Re8, attacking the pawn once more.  After this I would play 45) a4, and after all exchanges took place I would have a winning king-and-pawn endgame.<n><n>Here again comes the theme of psychology.  I was convinced that he would play 44) ... Re8.  I never even considered what he actually played.  The move I should have played was 44) Kd3.  I needed to let my e-pawn go, since I would still be up a pawn in a rook-and-pawn endgame.
Considering that his bishop, pawn, and rook form a wall preventing my king from getting to the queenside, bringing my king around this way was the correct idea.<n><n>However, I'm now in a bit of psychological trouble.  I was two pawns ahead in an endgame.  Now I'm only one pawn ahead and he has a passed pawn.  I was looking for any opportunity I had to try to force a win.  The most direct route I saw was by bringing my king to e5 to attack his pawn on d5.  His bishop can't defend it, his rook has a hard time defending it, and his king can't defend it because it needs to defend the queening square of my pawn on e7.<n><n>My plan was to play 46) Kf4 and 47) Ke5.  I saw his saving move 46) ... Re2, but I found myself not caring due to my mindset of needing to win.  I was trying to lock onto anything I could.
Now I was starting to feel worried, since my opponent has stopped my plan of reaching e5 with my king.  At this point in the game I tried calculating out what the endgame would be like after 47) h5 Bxe7 48) Bxe7 Rxe7 49) Rxe7 Kxe7.  I can't remember my exact calculations, but I think I ended up seeing both of us queening with me queening first for one line.  Actually, my mind kept on wandering through calculations and I don't know if I was thinking perfectly clearly.<n><n>I'll go through some calculations I've made since the game ended.  First off, I can't run my h-pawn up the board alone because his king is close enough to catch it.  If I try 50) Kg5 to defend my pawn as it comes up the board, then my opponent plays 50) ... Kf7, and he can pin my king against the edge, blocking my h-pawn.  After that, he can simply queen his a-pawn, and I would lose.  The final idea was a rather long one: each of us going after the other's pawn and coming back to the pawns on the d-file.  Neither of us moves our pawn because it just wastes a tempo for our king.  The variation runs as follows: 50) Ke3 Kf6 51) Kd3 Kg5 52) Kc3 Kxh5 53) Kb3 Kg4 54) Ka4 Kf4 55) Kxa5 Ke4.  There's nothing I can do to stop 56) ... Kxd4, and an eventual win by black.<n><n>I ended up pretty tired after trying to calculate everything out and not seeing a win for me, so I went with option number two:
Double-check, forcing his king to take the queen on e8.  Again, I had a calculation in mind that gave him chances to slip up, but would ultimately end up a draw if my opponent played correctly.
The temptation for black: 48) ... Re4 , which forks the king and pawn.<n><n>When I was calculating out black's possible responses to my 48th move, I found the move 48) ... Bc3, which would basically force a draw.  The continuation I saw was 49) Bf6 [defending the attacked pawn] Re4  [winning the pawn] 50) Kf5 Bxd4 51) Bxd4 Rxd4 52) Rxa5 Rxh4 53) Rxd5 Rh5  54) Ke6 [or Ke4] Rxd5 55) Kxd5 and draw by insufficient material.  Note that 50) Kf3 would lead to the same general thing, except it would be king and rook vs. king and rook, which is a technical draw.
My king being in close proximity to his king is a crucial element of my plan.
! And now black is in a bit of trouble.  He is still able to save the game with 50) ... Re4  51) Kxd5, evening up the material and becoming a technical draw.  My plan, though, was for him to mess up and play 50) ... Kf8 instead (the only other move that stops checkmate without immediately losing material).  I would have then played 51) Ra8 , forcing 51) ... Kg7.  Then I would have 52) Bf6 , winning his rook.<n><n>All this was still part of the calculation I made back on move 47.  I had my hopes up, but my opponent played the correct move.
Giving up the pawn, but avoiding the tactics I mentioned before.
My opponent now has plans of moving his rook behind my passed pawn.  The way the board sits, it should probably be a draw.  The main reason I kept on playing was because I needed the win.  I saw that it would be hard for me to lose the position, so I kept trying to find the forced win, even though there really isn't one in this position.
My idea behind this move was to somehow win his pawn on a5 after getting my king to b5.  After the game, I later discovered that I should have instead played 52) Bf6.  The plan behind putting the bishop on f6 would be to put the bisop on d5 and the king on e6.  The most likely continuation would be 52) ... Rh1 [getting behind my passed pawn] 53) Ke6 Re1  54) Be5 Be7 [the only move to stop checkmate] 55) Rxa5.  This would win a pawn for me and give me a better shot at winning the game.<n><n>I think that a lot of the reason why I didn't see 52) Bf6 was because I was looking for a direct way to win.  Piling up pieces on a5 is the direct way to win the pawn.  However, black should still be able to pull off a draw in this position.  The only key difference between my position and black's position is that my king is active in the center, while his is pinned against the edge of the board.  With this, I have a small advantage and can try to use it to win the game.  Of course, the advantage is so small that the game should still technically be a draw.
Putting his rook behind my passed pawn and creating an odd symmetry in the position.
At this point in the game I realized that the king on e6 and the bisop on e5 was the correct idea.  My mind had calmed down a little bit.  However, I was still playing off of wishful thinking.
?? Black's costly blunder of the game.  Although it doesn't look like a complete blunder at first glance (no material is lost and it attacks my h-pawn), there is a crucial element to the position that loses the game for black.<n><n>White to move, mate in 5.
! To be honest, I didn't see just how powerful this move was when I played it.  It wasn't until I was looking at what to do for my 55th move that I found the win for white.<n><n>Now it becomes clear why 53) ... Be1 was a serious blunder.  Black's bishop blocks the checking square for black's rook!  Black has only one move to avoid Ra8#, which he played.
I looked at this position for a long time, calculating out possible lines for me.  I looked at 55) Ra8  for the longest time.  After the king moves to g7, I looked at 56) Bd6 .  Unfortunately, black can survive with 56) ... Kg6.  The king will be able to escape to h5 and g4.  I also looked at 56) ... Kh7, and saw a win for white.  Only after looking for a while did I find the winning move, and I started to get excited.
!! The quiet bishop move that wins the game by force.  Now black is forced to play 55) ... Kg8 to avoid Ra8#.
Only now do I give check with the rook.  His king is now forced to go to h7...
! One final exclaim.  In the beginning of my final combination, his bishop stopped him from delievering check to my king.  Now in the ending, my own bishop stops him from checking my king!  At this point in the game black resigned, because there's nothing he can do to stop 58) Rh8#.<n><n>There's a certain beauty surrounding my final combination.  A checkmating net formed by a king, bishop, and rook.  A net where there was a single checking move before the final checkmate.  This brings up yet another theme: the threat is often stronger than the execution in chess.  If you leave several threats hanging in the air, your opponent will have to try to defend all those threats.  Once you grab on to one threat, though, your opponent no longer has to worry about many threats and can simply defend one.  One final psychological theme out of many found in this game.<n><n>Another note: the "need to win" was what caused my opponent to get back in the game, and it was also his downfall.  My opponent acknowledged that he needed to keep his bishop and pawn connected, and the game would probably be a draw.  However, he went for the "win" by attacking my pawn, not fully realizing the consequences.<n><n>I hope you enjoyed reading this annotation, and I also hope you learned something from it.  I hope you not only learned from the final combination, but also from the psychological themes that appeared in this game.  Psychology is a huge part of chess, especially in over-the-board games.
You can cut up my pawn wall if'n ya like, but in exchange I will have one rook.
One pawn steps forward and all 3 pawns look unprotected to the untrained eye, but each one is guarded...unfortunately d5 is not guarded enough. The wall is to be shattered, and  I am in trouble...or so it seems. But I shall survive, recover, and win! Watch on, and see my triumph.
White chooses the bishop to attack first. Bad move, as you will see. The knight will not survive this encounter either, but the bishop COULD HAVE, and in addition WOULD HAVE taken care of business afterwards. Black made a mistake allowing this to happen, but white's sloppy attack plan makes sure it is black that benefits from it. For shame, Hilo! (Watch and see.) [Many players prefer to lose a bishop to a knight, myself included. The bishop's more of a pain in the ass piece to get a use out of come end game {pawns standing on the opposite color as a bishop prove untouchable}, and less tricky/dangerous in the beginning. But these decisions must not be made hastily, instead they must be made according to the situation, and in this situation, the horsie was the piece to lose...as wonderful as horsies are.]
Queen steps forward to defend. Bad choice. Her movement has left g2 undefended, now if the knight were to choose to move I'd snatch first a pawn, and next move, sweet sweet rook. In other words that knight is now as good as pinned, and with no second defender in sight.
White steps out to block the horsie pin too late. The trade is made.
I push forward leaving b4 less defended. If a pawn trade occurs I can put some more discomfort on his majesty with my bishop.
Ooh scary. The knight can feel free to move forward or so it seems...since he was not protecting a piece. Oh wait wasn't that the knight you were using as a blockade against my bishop snatching g2?
Yup, it was.
White has learned from his bad queen trade, and decides not to go for the trade here.
If he had castled, protecting d5 would be a simple flick of the bishop, but now protecting it is not even an option.
Allowing yet another piece to be pinned rather than retreating...noticing a pattern here? Perhaps not the wisest course of action ever.
See? (This is where he surrendered.) White loses based on pushing too far into uncharted and dangerous territories. ..... (Ruachessnut2, and Nuntar have rather aptly pointed out to me, that this is not entirely the case. Basically Hilo's rather daring moves could have went better had he made some rather spectacular tactical decisions to back them up, crushing me, utterly. This may be true, but I don't think we should forget that players with 1200 ratings are not Bobby Fischer, and until they become as good as he is, they need to play a little more carefully than he would. Therefor I say don't dive into the fray counting on your ability to manage a piece being attacked from 3 places at once that is pinned to another piece that also needs to be defended because of complicated and terrible future following dominos that your brain can barely comprehend. Play it defensive, I say. It is a poor teacher who doesn't advise his student to learn the basics. They say beginners should castle early, and experts should consider not castling at all. Perhaps Ruachessnut2 and Nuntar would simple tell a beginner to play like an expert, but I say...castle early, dangit!) Still, thank you boys for the advice. If you felt like saying something positive in the future, some people respond well to that kind of thing...or so I've heard.
Alright here's another end game,i am white,my opponent is black. This game is about grinding down your opponent with the center. having the center is extremely important in the end game,not having it can result a loss. In this game my opponent made a mistake causing him to loose the center and the game.
my bishop was attacking that a5 pawn so just moving it out of the bishop's sight is ok to do. You may ask ''why not 31. ... Bb4?'' which seems ok however the problem with that move is that now the bishop becomes defensive. In the end game you dont want to be defensive because you won't have any chances of winning. it's better to be aggressive even tho you might not win that piece.
Now i am aiming to move the king closer to the center,centralizing the king is a good thing to do,heck centralizing every piece is a good thing to do in the end game. Even tho i feared Nh4 to create weaknesses on the king side i decided that my king really needs to get in to the game. and as long as i stay on light squares i should be ok. as you see most of my pieces are on light squares to avoid the dark squared bishop. Now you are probably wondering also why not Nc3? well i feared the let go of the d4 and d6 squares and decided that i can play that move maybe later but first getting my king up is my main objective. Getting the knight off the center was a scary thing to do,i decided it is on an ok outpost at the moment.
Bc5. Well the bishop is simply better placed on c5 than on e7. Now it is targeting the f2 pawn preventing my king from moving to d3 which was my plan (d3-e4-d5 to support that passed pawn). also he is using a trick,he is blockading my passed pawns and that is an excellent thing to do in the end game.
i have to go to f3 instead if i want to move up. The downside with this move is that it is blocking in the f2 pawn. however i wasn't planning to camp on f3 anyways.
now he is moving his king closer to the center. the second point is moving to e6 (out of my bishop's range and protecting that knight)
see? told you i wasn't going to stay on f3. moving the king to the center was my point all a long.
i decided the the most important thing to do here is Not letting his king come in to the 5th rank. exchanging pawns remove the pressure and making my king more elastic on the 4th rank. in the end game you don't want to give up ranks,they are important as well as seizing a file in the middle game.
This move was a mistake. firstly he over looked my next move which is strong, secondly he is moving away from the center and now i am trying to use the center to grind him down, making him cramped until he will have no way out and this is interesting to see.
Na6. I am knocking off that bishop from blockading my passed pawns and now things become to heat up.
c5. now i am planning to move my pawn to queen. Look on the difference on the position now and after 38. Ke4. he has two pieces pushed down.
blockading the pawn with his king a king is a good blockader in the very end game due to if it gets knocked off it can simply move one step backwards and it will take time queening that passed pawn.
now do you see why it's better to have pieces on light squares against a dark squared bishop? i believe the Bishop is excellent placed on f8 even if those three pawns under him wouldn't be there.
i think he wanted to move his bishop to e5 or something like the just preventing my king from assisting the blocked passed pawn.
I was really confused what to do in this position. i didnt want to let go of the e7 and d6 squares but i couldn't see any other move to advance my pawn. that's why i decided to just win material,i figured nothing bad would happen.
We are still in theory at this stage of the game. My plan is to settle 9K with weak isolated, doubled c-pawns. 9k's plan should be to utilize his bishop pair  and space advantage to put pressure on my position. With correct play by both sides, I think the game should be about equal.
8.bxc3 	Ne5 <n> 9.e3? 	...<n><n>White should play 9 f4! Here, with the following ideas in mind.  First, if Black plays 9%u2026Nxc4? white answers by 10 e4! attacking that knight and building up a huge center. That gives white a big advantage and a big initiative. Black should on the other hand play  9%u2026Ng6! 10 Bxf6! Qxf6 11 g3!  <n><n>And now, if Black wants to stay out of trouble, he should send his knight on g6 on maneuvers with 11%u2026Nf8! Intending Nd7 to c5. The game continuation, on the other hand, leads almost to a strategically lost position for White. 9K is burdened with doubled, isolated c-pawns with nothing to show for it.
9. ...	d6 <n>10.Be2 	Ng6!  <n><n>After the painful experience with pins in the game before, I was happy to break the annoying pin on my knight standing on f6.
The retreat 11 Bg3 also leads to an easy game for Black.
11. ...	Qxf6 <n>12.0%u20130 	0%u20130 <n>13.Qc2 	Re8 <n>14.Rfd1 	Nf8! <n><n>I logically maneuver the knight to its ideal square, where it influences a good chunk of territory and cannot easily be dislodged. White has very little counter-play here and must somehow manage with those weak, doubled and isolated c-pawns. <n><n>An added plus in my favor is the point that trades benefit me. If I could reduce it down to a king and pawn endgame, I would win easily.
15.Bd3 	Ne6 <n>16.Nb3!	...<n><n>CM is now on the defensive and this move correctly anticipates my intended maneuver of bringing the knight to c5.
17. ...	Qe7 <n>18.a5 	Bd7 <n>19.a6? 	...<n><n>9K should have avoided this move because it closes the files on the queenside and shifts all attenion to the Kingside, where Black enjoys a clear advantage.
19. ...	b6 <n>20.Nd4 	Nc5 <n>21.Nb5?	...<n><n>After the exchange of the knight for bishop, White%u2019s position goes from bad to worse. White%u2019s bishop does not have much defensive value because its own pawns keep it away from contact with the kingside.
21. ...	Bxb5 <n>22.cxb5 	Qf6!  <n><n>I am steadily improving my position by dominating the center. 9K has no way to create play on the queenside thanks to the blocked pawn structure on that side of the board. I will calmly build up my position by first doubling rooks on the e-file.
23.Bc4 	Re5 <n>24.Bd5 	Rbe8 <n>25.Rd4 	Ne6 <n>26.Rd2 	g6!  <n><n>I need to set my kingside pawns in motion to apply maximum pressure against 9K%u2019s passive position. As a prelude to that plan it makes sense to first improve the position of my king. Kings can often play a very useful supporting role in the middlegame.
The pawns are starting to rumble and there is little that 9K can do to ease the pressure.
31. ...	f5 <n>32.Qb1 	Qf6 <n>33.Bd5 	f4! <n>34.e4 	...<n><n>After 34 Bxe6 Qxe6 I will force a breakthrough on Black's e3 point. Now, beside the game continuation Nf8, I had a strong alternative in 34..f3, which cuts off support of the White e-pawn from his comrades and imposes a powerful, decisive cramp on White%u2019s king position.
34. ...	Nf8!<n>35.f3 	h5 <n>36.Qc2 	Ng6 <n>37.Qa2 	Kh6 <n>38.Qd2 	Rg7 <n>39.Qd4 	g4 <n>40.fxg4 	Nh4  <n><n>I was sorely tempted to play 40...hxg4, but could not find a clear way to make progress after the reply 41 g3! which freezes my knight.  So, I went in for another plan to slowly build up pressure on 9K%u2019s weak g2 pawn.
I've built up my position to the maximum extent. I had foreseen the following sacrifice and judged that it had to be winning. I was later severely criticized for playing the sacrifice but it was a later error that cost me the game.  <n><n>Although a rook is a very heavy investment, I felt that the sudden exposure of White%u2019s king and the prospect of obtaining two connected and far advanced passed pawns hurtling down the board just had to be worth the high price.
White must accept the sacrifice. If 54 Qb1 I could plant a rook into the heart of White%u2019s position with the devastating 54%u2026Re3.
56.Kg1 	Qh5 <n>57.Kf1 	f3  <n><n>This appears to be very strong but 9K managed to find the only defense. I had a strong alternative in the pawn-grubbing sequence 57...Qh1  58 Ke2 Qxg2  59 Ke1 Qh1  60 Kd2 g2 61 e5! Qxd1  62 Qxd1 g1=Q and Black has the upper hand.
59.Kd2 	Rh4 <n>60.Qe3 !  ...<n><n>9K starts to take control over important squares on the kingside while also forcing my king to retreat. I was starting to feel that I had royally butched this game.
64. e5! 	...<n><n>This pawn sac brings the bishop on d5 into the battle for control over g2. I could have resigned now but decided to punish myself. Sometimes it is very difficult to accept the inevitable.
64. ...	Qxf3 <n>65.Bxf3 	Nxe5 <n>66.Bd5 	Rh5 <n>67.Ra3 	Rg5 <n>68.Kd2 	Ng6 <n>69.Re3 	Ne5 <n>70.Ke2 	Kf6 <n>71.Rh1 	Ng6 <n>72.Rh7 	<n>(1-0)<n><n>And here I resigned. A very bitter defeat for me after I had skillfully built up my position to a crushing advantage. After the game, numerous spectators and kibitzer remarked that I had %u201Cgone nuts%u201D with my sacrifice but it was my follow-up to the sac that cost me the game. At least the battle was entertaining!
double d pawn opening. One important rule in these double d pawn opening is:<n><n>Don't block the c pawn with a knight unless necessary. Why? Because the c pawn's advance to c4(c5 for black) will ensure a breakdown of the opponent's d pawn, and thus breaking down or at least pressuring the pawn. Also, if it is possible in dd openings, the knight behind the c pawn will give that side more space and an easier game. The c-pawn gains central space.
a waste of time. Inexperienced players do not know when to play this move. a3,a6,h3,h6 should only be played when there is a reason to play it.Reasons include:<n><n>1.A piece may go there with a THREAT <n>2.The king needs an escape square.<n>3.it may be necessary to support other moves in some positions.<n>4.it restricts a piece's only good square<n><n>here, none of these apply. One more thing is, don't play that just to stop a bishop from pinning a knight. If the bishop has no more good squares,  or the pin is a threat, then the move may be necessary.
this is a good square for the bishop, and now h3 is looking completely useless.
now black may be having a space shortage, or at least his center is under pressure.
Not good. Bb4ch can be met by Nd2 and a3. Black has given up the bishop pair, generally worth half a pawn.
yes. Now Black is really threatening to play Bb4ch, forcing Ke2, where his pieces may have trouble getting his pieces out. good.also, the space gaining b4 is an idea.
a weakening move, but it seems ok, because now the bishop can fianchetto, and black can castle queenside.
not good. The d pawn is overloaded, trying to support c5 and the e5 knight. This is an important point. When looking at a position, ask yourself: <n>What are all the seeds of tactical destruction? these are:<n><n>1.pieces or pawns that must multitask.  2.loose pieces(unguarded)   think about if you can exploit any of this.
the pawn is immune, and there are no good discoveries moving the bishop.
blunder!!!!!! after Qb4+ black's bishop, which is attacked once and guarded once, is loose, because one more attack with a piece with tempo will win, and I see Qb5ch almost immediately, and black has 3 pawns for the bishop but better development, and after Qb5ch, white has the advantage. If black had just guarded his position, he would still be winning.
fine. Both captures are good. Now black has a strong bishop, and he can activate the king and advance the a pawn, but he must watch out for 7th rank checks. He can develop the king to f6-e6-d6-c5
it will be tough for white to get his king out now, because of the rook.
the
now black will lose the pawn
Developing normally. A lot of times in hypermodern stuff, they try to pin the knight or something and pick up a central pawn.
I thought about d5, because then after  4. d5 Ne5 5. Nxe5 Bxe5 6. f4 I would have a lot of board control, but in doing so I would weaken my king side, and open up the long diagonal for his dark squared bishop. This maily develops, protects e4 for the future, and just gain more central space.
Now d5 isn't really an option unless I did some weird line that I thought about at the time, but can not remember it at all right now. It had something to do with Qd2 then d5, then after exd5 i play exd5 winning the knight and/or bishop.
? At the local tournaments I go to, there is a person who plays hypermodern pretty much all the time. He is the only one there who ever does play it by the way. Whenever i play him, he always develops his knight on the fianchettoed side to the seventh rank. By going Nf6, he blocks his bishops and loses a tempo.
Poor knight, e8 and d7 weren't even options. =( the knight must be all sad face. Now i have both of his bishops kind of boxed in, although he can always fianchetto his LSB.
Preparing Qd2 with standard kingside pawn attack. however, he could always castle queenside, but then i would still have the minority pawn push.
Now i lose a tempo. i probably should have gone Qd2 and then after b5 go Bb3, but then his pawns would be threatening my queen side, where i planned to castle.
Now his knight gets the right idea. My LSB isn't going anywhere, so he can ignore it for the time being.
Moving to a more useful square? Trying to trade off the bishop? No idea.
I like my bishop though. I thought about Bf4, but there my bishop isn't useful. I was also looking at g4 to start the beginning of a king side pawn rush.
Quick story time: I sometimes will be able to look 7 to 15 moves ahead and make the right decisions. this happens rarely though. With my ADHD, most of the time, i look ahead anywhere from 3 - 5 moves. I don't like long games, cause i can get bored... Here i was expecting 12. ... f6 13. exf6 Bxf6 14. Bxf6 Qxf6. My line of thinking went like this: I trade off his black squared bishop. yay! But then he is less cramped. A LOT less cramped. In the end this helped immensely.
Bye bye Knight. Back to standing in front of the king!
Or you could take away my LSB  and ruin my queenside pawn structure, therefore kind of screwing up my castling ideas. Jerk. Oh well, that bishop wasn't doing much anyways.
I took a minute here trying to decide which pawn i should take with. If i did castle queen side, which i still planned on doing, i would have an open king if i took with the c pawn. I could always move to b1, but i would still be open. with the a pawn though, when i castle, i can move the king to b1 and i would be much more safe.
?! this allows me to get an outposted knight. a very, very strong knight. However, got to give him some credit. He is aiming to bust open the center and get some counter-play.
?? this gives me a winning attack. Kd7 was the best move. Although i didn't see the "free" pawn, it was poison. After 18. Nxf7 Rf8, he wins material. {Insert correction that will undoubtedly come from Ionadowman here =P}
Threatening mate in one, and he will have to lose material to protect his king, and his king can't even run away as fast as he can, although i probably could catch him because he's not the gingerbread man.
an okay idea to stop the mate, one that i didn't expect. i was thinking that 18. ... Nf5 stopped it, if only temporarily, after 19. gxf5 exf5. {Insert another correction by someone else}
Hooray for en passant! now he is forked and about to lose.
UNLEASH THE FURY!!!
I put the king away and now must think how I am going to get into Whites area
Not sure about that last move as it opens the diagonal up for my bishop
Black is attempting to break out and if  succesful Whites King looks a little exposed
White is not shy about throwing pawns forward, but as I said earlier there is lots of space at the back if only I can get my pieces into it. Taking the d pawn will open the position a little
I know have a file to work with and can put White under some pressure
The E pawn is going to fall
I always mirror my opponent's nf3 with my nf6 and wait for white to decide the center.
and here, 16 automatic moves in, is the moment when I must stop copying to prevent hanging my queen.
I panicked under the pressure and captured the pawn out of order.
?! this is inferior to 2. ...Nf6 because it hinders piece development. The general rule to keep in mind when playing through the opening is to develop knight before bishops, bishops before queen and Queen before rooks. If you follow this rule you will have a good position coming out of the opening 80% of the time.
Normally I would only recommend this move only after the majority of your pieces have been developed. However, this is an exception because 2. ...c6 has left ...e5 undefended. If black decides to capture with 3. ...exf4. Then white recaptures with e3 and Bxf4 to follow. <n><n>Strategically speaking 3. ....exf4 is very good for white because it weakens black's center by deflecting the e pawn away from the center while white's center pawns remain in the center. It also will give white the plus of rapid deployment of his pieces.
?? putting your bishop in front of a unmoved center pawn is never a good move. This move hems in black's queen, LSB and Knight. Alternative suggestions to defend the pawn would be ...d6 to keep the center semi closed or go for broke with ...exf4
retreating the bishop to c7 or e7 was safer. Now I can setup a very powerful center.
The cannon is all lined up and ready to destroy
I like this over 1...d5 because it leads to much more unbalanced position and tbh, I find the Q's Gambit very boring.
Seizing central squares. However, many defense systems for Black are aimed at exactly this square, including the Gruenfeld, the Nimzo-indian and the Benko gambit. Maybe one day a super computer will refrain from this pawn advance and play something slower like 2. Nf3. Until then, mere mortals like us, can only use accepted knowledge to make our decisions.
Black wants to fianchetto his Bf8 and go for a quick castle. He's postponing the central struggle until he's better developed.
But wait, what's this? Black was supposed to castle first then fight in the center. Well, that's the KID, you're talking about, this is his naughty brother, the Gruenfeld. I have to confess, I really like this opening. Playing it against someone that doesn't know much theory can lead to a very fast and crushing win. The downside is that there is a lot of theory and the resulting position vary a lot, so you can't rely on one line to play another, you have to know them all.
White exchanges the c-pawn for the d-pawn and in the process creates for himself a central majority. But, just like in the Q's Gambit accepted, Black is looking to the future, hoping that the endgame will favor him due to the pawn majority on the Q-side.
Even though this bolsters White's center, retreating the Knight is very bad, since more pieces on the board mean more attacking chances and with the center in White's hands, it's clear who's going to be the attacker.
Black's strategy seems to have failed. Just counting the moves, White has one extra tempo and on top of that, he has acquired a nice looking central phalanx, bolstered by the c-pawn. What was Black thinking?
Older books claimed this is a mistake because now White could play 7. Ba3 to prevent c5. The problem with that move is that the Bishop isn't very active on a3 and Black will make c5 happen with 7...Nd7 anyway.
The old main line. White is already envisioning a K-side attack. If Black would play passively, that would quickly become a dire reality, with Ne2, 0-0 and f4-f5, going for the throat.
Now that Black has completed development, it's time for the second strike at the center.
If you want to play the Gruenfeld, there is a simple rule you always have to remember, it's always about White's d-pawn.
White has managed to hold the center and according to old principles should claim an edge in this position. Black must play very energetically to claim equality.
A little counter-attack. It's also important to remember not to play cxd4 early as Black because without the c-pawns, White would happily play Rc1 and relinquish the Bishop pair in order to hold the center.
Tactically defending both threats. 18. Qxb5 with the idea 18...Nxe3 19. Qb3+ Kh8 20. Qxe3 doesn't work because Black will win the d4 pawn.
Now that White has lost a tempo with the Bishop, I can exchange in the center with less concern.
The threat is Qf1+. Well, not really a threat, just enough to get White jumpy and propose a convenient exchange of Queens.
This King is really going back and forth. I think he's had too many and needs to sober up.
Ouch! I'm going to get my pawn back and then can look hopefully to a brighter future.
I'm not a greedy person, really I'm not. I just wanted to activate my pieces to the maximum before I take any material.
White sees the opportunity to save the g-pawn and takes it.
i played chessmaster computer,  this is how i win it. I name this opening my monkey moove... i thought that i cannot match the skill of the computer, so it would be stupid to make clever mooves...the monkey moove is jst that...(tip...jst flip the board, that way it doesnt feel as if its you who call the mooves)
and to defend it?
my next moove is Ra3...if he take it with bishop, my queen go Qg7
there it is....a computer cannot resist such moove...so i already win one small battle....sum chessplayers refuse to take that rook...feeling sorrry for me...then i jst leave it there...by the way....my opponents rook at a8 stayed there the entire game...so why dnt get ridd of it while you can by taking his bishop that run on black diagonal?....
i can push pawn to c3, eventually he will do this...note: Black seem to be well developed, white had reserved his options...the less mooves is made, the less  combinations there is for the computer to take advantage off...in normal conditions, the black bishop would provide cover for the night at c6 to penetrate whites defence...but it will change!
i do this....then push c4 later....also....where is his black bishop? and my king is on a black block....most of my pieces is on black...so was the trade fair? .........also i could have prevented him from castle-ing to kingside, by taking his bishop with my bishop.....but i want him to castle....!!!!
and look at that.....i even anticipated opponent to castle to the side i wanted him to...now i get rid of g2 and put rook at g1 to pin pawn g7 it leaves h6 open for attack by queen....look at my position...
chess is also about drawing opponent into moves, one can use his pieces to slingshot yourself across the board..
and....
because he have castle more than me- im  thinking of keeping either my pawns in a chain/or his/ from preventing castles to move about board...remember...we play an opponent that can predict moves well in advance...
my idea was never to castle, but to use the strength of the king to protect pawns, also to keep on black blocks, but at e2 the king is safe from attack, and should hold its ground.
i dnt want pawns to advance...also if he push f7..then it weaken his pawn protection
so i want a platform to attack from!
again....i leave oponent to feed on ....-while i attack!.....yes!!!!you can attack an empty space...even if it is protected!!! let me show you-lol
the night force oponent to take night...but then i do this!
i would have brought in a rook...in any case, if i made the rules i would have taken its queen with my king-THE REASON IS THAT THE PIN I FORCE UPON MY OPONENT, RENDER HIS BISHOP AT G6 POWERLESS!!!!(i can proove this...."had i any other piece to capture the black queen at d3, then it would proove that my statement is right....my tactical moove at Rg3 leave the bishop at G6 POWERLESS!!!!- WHY SHOULD MY KING BE AN EXCEPTION!!!????....but for now i accept the stupid rule, and moove to Ke1:)
monkey move!!! (he could have forced a draw....but then knowing the outcome of the game in advance....wot would the use of a draw be...in anycase, it is the loosing party that force a draw...knowing that he already lost the game...(and I can prove it....THE REASON WHY IT IS LOST BY THE PARTY WHO FORCE DRAW-IS THE VISION THAT HAD CHANGED BY THE PLAYER....IF YOU CAN CHANGE THE VISION OF A PERSON, THEN YOU WIN HIS MIND.....BECAUSE IT WAS HIS ORIGINAL VISION OF MATING YOU!!!-not drawing with you:)
?! I think this is unnecessary.  Neither Bishop nor knight is going to g5 anytime soon.
? This has to be a strategical error.  It leaves a backward pawn on d6 and weakens the light squares more.
Forcing the exchange of bishops, and his was the only defender of the light squares.  I also wanted to clear out the knight and bishop between my queen and his d-pawn.
I played this because I thought that it would make the attack on d6 easier, and that I wanted to have a bishop over knight advantage, but in retrospect, this seemed like trading an active knight for a bad bishop.
I captured with the queen to create more complications, which are favorable for me because I have more space.
! Thanks to Black's last move, this is quite strong.  The knight can't retreat to g6 because of the fork.
! Attacking the rook that defends the knight.  Black loses the exchange and rightfully resigned here.  I hope you enjoyed this game.  BTW, as this is my second annotation and I'm not quite clear on some gameknot terms, how do I use/where do I find the star rating system?
Bc4 is the most common response here--d3 appears to give black an advantage according to the database tree.
...or Nxf3.  I kind of like Rxf3 better as it preservers Ne2+, provided the queen can be lured away from protecting that square.
Be3+ drives the king further into a corner, and permits Nd2+, though the black knight's range of motion remains restricted by white's rooks.
I like Rdd6 better.  While the queen can push the black king around, this lets the black rooks roam the entire field instead of just the d file.
This seems like a mistake.  Rb6 encourages 27. Qxa7, Bxb2+.  The white king must respond with Kb1, in which case black responds with Bd4+, and the white queen falls.  The white queen has to move to some white square invisible to the black bishop, or a black square it cannot cover from b2 in one move.  This makes black's Bd4 a pretty good move in hindsight.  On the other hand, instead of Qxa7 white is probably eying Nf3.  Black should drive the white king into the corner with the bishop and knight combo.
Without a threat to the queen Rb6 was easily defended against.
In hindsight, the queen/rook trade brought a quick resolution.  White essentially does not move a rook the first 38 moves (provided castling doesn't count), then makes five simple rook moves in succession.  Precision march of the rooks.  Poetry.
Black chooses to develop his QK.
It'll be protected soon, but it develops my bishop and forces him to waste a move.
I had to fit this in somewhere.
He choose to threaten my bishop.
I for some reason chose to do this.
Gains a tempo, allows White to castle, pins Black's knight to the king and threatens the knight. Threatens a fork following capture of Black's knight.
I'm trying to encourage black to try to play the Noah's Ark trap here. (A famous one - worth looking it up if you don't know it). If he tries that line then I can get some good counterplay - white gets a good game with that line as long as he doesn't fall into the trap!
But black didn't take the bait so I castle kingside and we both continue with our development.
Black hasn't castled, and I have, so I want to open up the centre quickly before he gets a chance to finish developing his pieces..
Uh oh. Black has pinned my knight and probably plans to capture on f3, forcing me to play gxf3 and opening up my castled position. I shouldn't have let this happen. No take backs on Gameknot though! So I play Kh1, this will allow me to bring my rook to g1 quickly and hopefully exert some control over the g file.
Black has wasted time moving his bishop twice - to h3 and then to e6. A spot of luck for me - it allows me to start taking advantage of the open g file. My open position is starting to work in my favour, instead of black's. The g7 square is very weak for Black now and needs to be defended somehow. 14. ...Ne8 may be the best way to do this, but leads to a very cluttered position for Black.
Black tries to get his rook out of the firing line - he wants to play g6 without losing the exchange. This leaves the knight on h5 hanging. However, it is difficult to see a safe way to defend the knight, the rook and the g7 square..
Black sees the problem and moves his king, unpinning the pawn on g6. But it's looking very bad indeed for black now! He is down two minor pieces and a pawn, his rook is trapped, and his king can't budge an inch either! It's difficult to find a good move for black here. I think best may be Bf8 to try to exchange bishops and take some of the sting out of the attack. But with so much material down even that isn't really going to help. You might have spotted that Black can't just capture the queen with 18. ...gxh5 either.
Black doesn't notice the mate threat and grabs the queen. Checkmate.
i decided to open the center as i have more develope ment and i was in the mood for some fun
hoping to put the rook under the queen.
hoping to reopen the center.
further my pin
a sacrifice to get in.
he decides not to take.?
its pinned now to trade off the knight
attacking the knight he has no way to gaurd the rook
I always open with e4 as I'm relatively new to OTB chess and I'm trying to play the same opening enough that I'm comfortable with it. I usually play into the Italian game if I can.
I recognised this as the caro-kann, although I'm not really familiar with it other than black is going to play d5 next.
Following the rule that after e4, play d4 if possible, and I don't see any reason not to.
Defending the e pawn and developing a piece. I spent a little bit of time looking at what should come next if ..dxe4, Nxe4 and then if ..Bf5, Ng3 seems to save the tempo by forcing the bishop to retreat, plus g3 seems like a reasonable square for the knight. As it happens, this is exactly the line taken over the next few moves.
Makes sense, keeping blacks only developed piece on the board on a fairly good diagonal where my queen is tied to defending the c2 pawn.
Well there goes the threat on f7. Also d5 looks like a nice outpost for a knight if black can maneuver his way there.
Developing, and again protecting d4 to give the queen the scope to move a bit. In hindsight I feel maybe Nge2 was a better move, as this would have made it easier for my DSB to emerge later in the game. I looked at this at the time but felt I shouldn't block the half open e-file.
I guess this is to keep the bishop on because if white plays Ne5, I can force the bishop off for a knight.
Mainly played this to free up the queen that was tied to the defence of c2, this also allows the queen and f3 knight the opportunity to go elsewhere should the need arise, Qb3 as a follow up looked interesting although the response ..b5 makes life a bit awkward after that.
e5 looked like a nice outpost for the knight. Ne5 played mainly with a view to forcing the bishop to give up the nice diagonal it has, it has no retreat squares other than h7, which isn't all that great.
Black tries to hold onto the bishop.
The white LSB wasn't doing much where it was while blacks had a good diagonal, so it seems like a good idea to more or less force a trade. Black can play Bg8 (terrible place for the bishop), or g6 to keep the bishop, but neither looks enticing.
Retaking with the queen in order to bring another piece out.
Challenging my knights position. I had to be wary at this point that if I ignored the challenge, then ..Nxe5 wins a knight, since the capture would uncover a pin on the d4 pawn.
I spent a long time here looking at something like Ng6, threatening the rook or taking the black DSB off. If fxg6 then Qxg6 check with a follow up of Nh5 threatening mate on g7. Black is defending h5 though so could exchange, and Bxh6 didn't seem to help either. I came to the conclusion that there was no combination on here so gave up on that idea after running a few minutes off my clock!<n><n>I considered that the threat of a later Ne5 may come in useful, so opted to retreat for now.
Black challenges the d4 pawn.
dxc5 ..Bxc5 looks good for black as the bishop would be nicely placed (as opposed to my bishop that hasn't moved all game), also I was wary of the previously mentioned pin on the d4 pawn so with this in mind I retreated the queen. I was trying to maximise my control on the white squares also with black having no LSB, so keep my queen on the diagonal.
This is quite a clever move in my opinion, as black can create a new pin on the c3 pawn shortly.
I'd looked at a few options here, particularly with a view to getting the DSB out (neither it or the a1 rook have moved all game), but I was concerned about ..Ng4 had I played Be3. So this move was really to restrict the options of the f6 knight.
The black knight becomes a bit more active, plus with the c3 pawn pinned to the queen, my d4 knight is hanging.
This move both defend the knight and presents a tactical threat - if white could play Nxe6 from this position, he wins a pawn and the queen for the rook and knight.
Black sees the threat and retreats the knight. He offered me a draw at this point - the game did seem even to me, however with us needing to win both games to salvage a draw from the match, and there still being some chess to be played from here, I decided to play on.
if Qxb6 ..Nxb4 I didn't like the look of a later ..Nc4 and couldn't see a good way of stopping the knight causing trouble, so if there's to be an exchange, I'd rather it was on my own terms.
Finally after 22 moves the DSB leaves it's home square, I had been very conscious of it's lack of involvement so far (and the blocking in of the a1 rook), I moved it here as I also wanted to advance my Q-side pawns to light squares, so they don't become a weakness in view of only dark squared bishops being left on the board.
Offering another exchange.
I take the exchange, I wanted to keep the bishop on if possible.
Since c3 was under a double attack, I couldn't see anything better. Black can of course force the DSB off now.
Another exchange, retaking with the knight seemed better, in case of something like Rxd2 ..Rxd2, Nxd2 ..Bg5. I'm not sure if it makes much difference.
Preparing to double on the d-file and taking full control of it.
Obviously with fewer pieces on the board it would be harder to win but I don't want black to have full control of the d-file.
The king moves over with the idea of controlling d2 after Ke1 or Ke2. Obviously the black rook getting to d2 would be a major problem. I couldn't see any way for black to force the issue, nor for white to mount an effective attack from here. The other game had ended in a draw by now so the match was already lost, with this in mind I offered a draw here and black accepted.
a strong move! White threatens 21- Bxh7 and after Qh8 Bishop can retreat to e4. Meanwhile, the pawn in g3 prevents the advance of Black's g pawn and the Knight's advance to f4
a lethal attack, after 32. Rxf7 Qxf7 another neat fork by the Bishop this time
the Black is totally paralysed of course the Bishop can not be taken
an attempt to mobilize his forces to launch a counter attack, as he can not the Rook in g7 !! simply because the f-pawn recapture the black rook and then get a promotion. There is no force on the board can prevent of delay this Queening process.
now, there are more dangerous checks for Black, Qf1+ is useless, White King flees to b2 safely
After the Black Powder smoke is gone it is White's turn to fire and marches to a victory
and Black resigned <n>There are two unavoidable mates a) 45. .....Ke4 46. Qg4+ Kd5 47. Rc5 #<n>and b) 45. ..... Kg6 or g5 46. Rg8+ Kh4 47. Qh3+ Nh4 48. Qxh4 #
Here Black must challenge White's pawn center with 10...d5.  The game would continue with 11.e5 Ne4 12.Nbd2 Nxd2 13.Bxd2, and Black will plan for a timely f7-f6 break.  The game would be equal.
Now Black's freeing maneuver doesn't work after 11...d5 12.e5 Ne4?, dropping a center pawn.  White now has a clear advantage in space.
This is a useful waiting move, since White is in no hurry with a comfortable space advantage in the center.  White needs to find a good square for the QB, and the text gives White's Bishop development options on e3, f4, and g5.
A horrible blunder, which costs Black a pawn and the exchange.
White decided to go to all-out attack on king's side, and I will be looking for some conterplay on the other side. I was more succesful since my king is easily defended
A little interlude to the Grand Tour match of fatcat2 vs Computers. Having played 4 games so far against various computers, I am beginning to feel that I'm missing something. What I need is a good example of how to beat my silicon opponents - and what better one to look at than the 1st game of the 1997 match of Garry Kasparov vs the updated Deep Blue?<n><n>We start with the Reti Opening. Quite a recent one, and a flexible opening as it offers opportunities to transpose into King Pawn, Queen Pawn or English setups.
White is bypassing all of White's pawns, rather than capturing them, and thus maintaining the positional equilibrium and not allowing Black any open lines to attack down.
Suddenly it is Black who appears to be on the ropes! His kingside has been cracked open like an egg, and White's kingside pawns are menacing his position...
White is maintaining his strong position on the kingside.
Deep Blue resigns. The final result of the match, incidentally, was 3.5-2.5 to Deep Blue...this was the only game Kasparov won. But I am going to study it further and I hope to pick up some tips...
normally i play c5, but this time and whant to try something else : e5<n>if white take e5 i take back whith the g7 bishop and then the white wall center is broken, if not : i take d4 for the same result. if white put his e4 pawn on d5, i block it whith d6 whith it should be quite trong position. so let's what happen !
i find this strong, now i have to castle quickly
let's be some more agressive ! there is no white queen risk on h5, so i have time enought to attack prematurly on this side. i will castle after.<n>if white take the paw i develop my c8 bishop and brok the white pawn's center.
defending and developing, good response, so i have time to go on.<n>if i take the paw, white take back an then they are very much stronger on the center. and if i dont take it back, they will do it now whith the d3 bihop, they will be abble to exchange bishop and beak my castle, so the only good choice is to advance, witch will give me a very strong position and very ambarassing for white because they can not castle to the queen side...
f4 ! i am so proud of this nice big and long wall from c7 to f4 !!
preparing attack to the d6 paw
i won give him to oportunity to break my beautiffull wall !<n>and i will open the a colon for my rook, just in case of ...
defending the bishop
in case of move h2 h3, i will sacrifice the bishop and take back the white paw whith the queen. this doesnt garanty to win but it's very funy and surprising !
and ont have the choice i had to exchange
now i will win a paw exchanging bishop whith knight. But first  whant to open the a colon
and prenvent this lonely rook
attack the queen and hope to take the knight in c3
now it is becoming interesting, i will push the paw to f3 !
threat to pin the queen
preparing to move the bishop...on e1 !!!<n>if Rxf4, Qxg2++<n>if Qxe4, Rxf1++<n>if Rxe1, qxe1+, then Q2-g1 and Rf4 go to f1 pining the queen !<n><n>isnt it nice ???!!!
I tend to have the most difficulty with this set up. Black only slowly makes a claim to the center while quickly castling.
Clears the diagonal for the bishop
I'm not exactly sure what that was for other than perhaps to solidify the space that he had left. The move prevents the queens knight from going to c6 but in this position it was doubtful for me that it was going there in the first place.
Idea is that perhaps form a battery with my bishop. Also it links up the rooks
attacks pawn and bishop
Removes the threat on my bishop. The d file is opening up. this could be useful in the middle to end game.
Surprised me? I didn't think he would take the knight. My bishops are now lined up adjacently but they are not attacking the enemy king. Never the less I was happy to see the move.
A blunder. Nf6 is an overloaded piece. A possible line that continues the blunder is: 15.	... 	Nxe4<n>16.	Bxe4 	Rxe4<n>17.	Qxd7 	Qxd7<n>18.	Rxd7 	Bxb2<n>19.	Rxb7 	Bf6<n>20.	Rc1 	<n><n>and so forth. I'm a pawn up in the endgame and I have a rook on the seventh rank.
decided to try sicilian
fpawn cannot take because Qxe3 winning the rook
The e file is a good place to attack.
Doesn't gain anything, since I regain the tempo by checking.
I have many attacking possibilities.  My knight could move in as the queen and bishop control the king's flight squares.  My rook could go to the d file to threaten the Bd2.
At least the bishop isn't under attack.
Opening up one bishop and closing off another.  The dark bishop doesn't do much the rest of the game.
The losing move.  I was hoping to trade queens or at least annoy his, allowing to free my bishop with c4.
I could be down a queen and pawn for a bishop and rook, with a chance of recovering, but I made another mistake.
what was the correct move now becomes the game losing move. It allows Bd4 threatening to win the R Better was to withdraw the Q to c2 for defensive purposes
White gets a strong center and open lines for his B's in return for the Pawn. Zuckertort needs to make sure he develops quickly.
Counterattack on the B, gaining a tempo.
Pressing forward on the Q-side. But Anderssen's K-side attack is ipso facto more dangerous, as it aims at the Black King.
Committing himself to the attack. With his own K-side position now weakened, Anderssen's attack must succeed or he will lose.
The battering ram.
Lining up the battery on the target.
Creating a dangerous passed Pawn and sealing in the King.
Anderssen closes the ring.
?? e5. This move is only good if you know what the main line is. If you don't know the main line, then don't play this move. Best is simply take it with dxe5 but it leads to an interesting game. 2dxe5 Nc6 3 Nf3 Qe7 . Now this is where it is debatable if white should play Bf4 or not. Because 4 Bf4 Qb4+ which attacks both the undefended bishop and b2 but if white knows how to play this line he should simply play 5Bd2 Qxb2. It is now really tempting to play Bc3 but this is a losing blunder as black will respond with Bb4! so white should play Nc6 and white is now more developed and can exploit the open b-file by himself and will have a relative easy game.
Pushing through to give white a harder time to develop, and black has more control in the game.
White already has trouble developping as it now would take another move (move the knight or the g pawn) to develop the bishop.
Im pinning the knight to give white an even harder time to develop
I place the bishop on e6 because I believe white will try to attack the d-pawn one way or another and this gives black more support. Looking at it now I'm not sure if this is the best move, probably Bd7 would be good too.
White decides to move the knight to develop the bishop rather than move the g-pawn. Because h3 has been played, g3 makes the kingside weak.
I decide not to defend my lsb because an open f-file would be good for me.
But white wants me to have an open f file in exchange for doubled pawns. White also has the bishop pair.
White sees weakness in my game and plays Qg4 to attack e6.
The best way to defend e6 and the first piece is placed on the f file.
White decides to attack on the queenside.
develops the knight. I like this move better than Ne7 because it attacks the queen with tempo. I can also play Nf7 after Qh5+.
the b5 square is a very good square for white since both the queen and the knight can move there. So I decided to play this move.
I decide to play dangerous. White could play g4 here, and I would have replied with Nh4 to have a really active thread on the kingside since the f3 square will also be weak.
I was looking some time and found this the best reply. I'm not sure if this or the next move was the time that I really found a good plan to win.
!! atacks the queen and the rook on a1
If I played Rxa2 then Ke1 and there isn't much pressure anymore. Also if I played Rxf2+ then white would play Be2.
Note that black's rook on f8 was attacked by the bishop for 4 moves. I hoped you liked the game!
The black squared bishop is blocked in
Black can cause chaos with this pawn now
There were many alternatives.. like ensuring His Highness' safety (10.Kh1) or playing the so Sicilian-like 10.Be3. What is the target of 10.f5 then? Maintaining the tension and making Black loose his nerves.
And here we go. After the cold blooded 10... Bc4 11.Bg5 (11.Bxc4 Qxc4) Be7 12.Rf3 h6 13.Be3 Ng4 the situation is hazy, no clear attacks. Though 10... Bxb3 was a logical answer with the idea of simplifying the game without loosing tempo and penetrating the white pawn structure.. it misses the chance by exchanging a bishop on an opening board and giving the half-open a-file (and the queen-side with it) to White.
From now on Black has two tasks to deal with. Securing his king and keeping the white knight out of d5 since that could give a full-scale attack to White with a solid centre and tied-up Black forces.
Here I was thinking about 13.Kh1 but decided to make it later when (if ever) getting forced to do so. 13.Qe2 also crossed my mind with the idea of 13... 0-0 14.Rxa6! Rxa6 15.Bxa6 Rb8 16.Rd1.. most probably it was better then 13.Bg5 anyway. However, found these moves too delicate, too slow. I was in a rush to win the game.
Withdrawing that bishop to d3 might have been better but here I was to get rid of the only valuable black bishop.
Sacrificing that bishop here was a bold move. I did in full confidence of winning the game with a breakthrough my opponent has no chance to stop... when failing to go on with it this exchange could have proven itself to be a key error. However, there are some circumstences that save the situation and give a good ground for this move. Black cannot take back with the g-pawn because that closes up his own bishop badly. Moreover after 16.Bxf6 he has to make another move to make that bishop active and to give way to his f-pawn. What else then? 15.Qe2 for attacking a6 while giving way to the king-rook to occupy the d-file... or 15.Kh1 doing the inevitable.
Inaccuracy.. Thought it was time to put the king on the field. Foolish idea till the black queen gets eliminated. Naturally enough 17.Kh1 was the proper move here.
White can play Nd5 with gaining a tempo. 20... Qa7 was more fortunate though the battle has already been lost.
this is one of the first times ive seen e6 as a response. there's probably some<n>devious methodology to it.
if you EVER want to tick someone off: push the pawn when they offer a trade. this also provided protectioin against Nc6 and helps really later on.
pawn trade? ok. my knights are ready to counter.
note the simple beauty of this move: i now have two knights on e5 and a discovered attack on Nd5.
i liked the queen where it was: alive and on the board.
my opening tends to lose minors early on, doesn't it. oh well, I always seem to come back at the end. it's like watching the bears in reverse.
this was not a mistake. I like this move on black's part. I didn't like it then, but i give props to black on this one.
i have already seen comments about this, but, to my opinion, this only worth to simplify rapidly and avoid two-bishops endings.
I don't like the idea to put my knight here and block my bishop for 2 more moves, when white can freely develop on the center.
maybe better was to take with the queen, allowing the knight to arrive on more natural c6 after.
forbidding any intention to put the queen on a4 or to threat b7 via b3.
d3 was more logical, according to me
this is a structure i am used to. But this time, I made a mistake, because none of my horses can easily go on d4. So, the sutrcture is pointless... I played too fast, because i hate openings. I have to discipline myself...
he, on the other hand, could imagine to go on d5 or b5 (which he will), whenever he wants and, by the resultance of an exchange on d5, have a dangerous pawn there, pointing e6 and c6.
Considering d2 better to me; here the bishop only threat a defensive and redundant piece.
I really was surprised here. And nuntar sent me a message later, pointing it was not the best move ever. I agree.
this move was very much thought. I intended to authorize a return for my bishop and planned a f5-move. on the other hand, i regretted the loss of a potential position for my knight.
we need, not to impeach, but to slow down this attack
free the queen off the protection of d6 and prepares f5.
forced, but happy to do it. I saw the combination that will follow without a problem. I meant, not to have a piece for two pawns, as it happened, but to gain a lot of space. Later I thought it was risky, but, he, what good game is not?
apparently no choice. Opening the a column, to my great joy. I was thinking, after my next move, that he could imagine to take a8, but for me it was not a problem. It would have cut the attack in two. My own attack would then have been double: a column and f5.
I thought to myself: he will have to leave the pawn, because of d5 attacking b4 with the bishop
i chose the variant where i win a piece...
20. ... Nxd7 has the same result as the main line, because he can't take my bishop: 21. Rxb4 Rxa1+ and mate on next move. Or 21. Rxa8 Rxa8, and still cannot take the bishop.<n>he would have simply taken exd. Like he will 2 moves later
the exchange may not have been the cleverest thing i made, but i felt confident with b7, my knight and my bishp to block his pawns. I just did not figure my king would meet some difficulties to pass. <n>However, i did not want to be preoccupied by moves like Ra7, or Rb1
i guess the main goal was to approach the king to the center, not to threat the bishop
i had no hesitation on that move. Was it interesting to consider a5 or d2?
preventing any will to approach too soon by d4-c5, and pre-protecting the pawn: my knight is very strong as a defensive piece.
losing a tempo. There was no need not to go directly on f7 - i lost a lot of tempo from now!
the king has to leave the center.
i intend to keep my pawnschain
defending e5.
?! here, i may have played too fast. Maybe h5 was more clever!!!!!<n><n>I had in mind to make pass my g pawn here. This was the first time the g-pawn was considered by me the key of success. I got totally wrong.
threatening Na8, but then Nd7; Nd5, but then Nd7 and Ne8, but then Nd7 :-) The three moves resulting in the possibility for the white king to penetrate.
once again, Kc6? Or Kc7? Or even Nf6? to come back and try to kill my attacking f-pawn?
of course: my bishop has to impeach the d-pawn to arrive on destination.
and now the freewheeling
?? Why not to launch the knight against the f-pawn?
but this is the winning move. There is no escape for the knight. If 54. c7, then Qxe8, 55. Rb7 Kf4, and my new born queen will sacrifice on c8 if necessary to let g-pawn win the game. This is why I thought
This occurred in one of jkarp's games against redfox17. And now, if black plays Nxe4 Nxe4 and d5! this gives black an open game with good development - but I think that after Nxe4 5. Bxf7+! Kxf7 6. Nxe4 is better.
? I could see what Black was planning. After 12. Qxe5! Re8 13. Qf4 Re1+ 14. Bf1 and white is safe.
But anyhow, I hadn't realised this at the time, so I prepared to develop my bishop.
To relieve a hole for my king and attacking the bishop.
Now I figured that I could take the bishop, as my king could escape to f2.
Now the other bishop is lost, and there is no mate.
? Adding to the double bishops lost, a knight is now thrown in the bag.
To be sincerely honest, this loses to a mate threat.
Bh6! and black resigned here, seeing that there was no way to stop mate on g7. Well played perrinnn, and thanks for watching! @oodle3
Dangers and surprises lurks in the background for any chess game. The unaware who falls into the trap is bound to suffer eternal damnation. Right so in the opening. Once in a while, we are bound to fall right into the opponent's hands.
Playing an opening I am unfamiliar of, I, without hesitation, accepted the counter gambit staying true to the principle of the best way to refute a gambit is to accept it.
Although the White King has been deprived the right to castle, it seems he is not in danger with Queens traded off.
Right now, Black is developing freely with gain of tempo.
Suddenly, the Black King is under attack and is somewhat caught in a corner.
After I made the last move, I knew that my King was caught.
This game reminds me of the ones played by the immortal greats like Adolf Andersen and Paul Morphy wherein they sacrificed pieces in wild abandon just to mate the opponent's King.
Preparing for the Kingside attack, and preventing Ne4

Playing it safe in the face of Qc8 if the Knight moves to b4
Can Black take the rook?
Forced exchange and Queening to follow!
Blocking the diagonal of the fianchettoed bishop, as Keene points out in "Flank Openings" the whole concept of erecting the structure c4-d3-e4 "is based on one of Nimzowitsch's ideas:  White holds the centre under restraint and prepares the flank advances f4 and b4"  However, unlike positions with the queen's knight developed on c6, when the choice of White's central pawn formation would be merely a matter of taste, Botvinnik is practically forced to adopt his customary set-up here, as Black was threatening to ply  ...d5 under favorable conditions.  Kotronias
Szabo has played methodically enough to restrain White's ambitons on the wings and now proceeds to exchange light-squared bishops, a decision strategically justified if one takes into account tht d3-d4 always renders the position of the bishop on e6 problematic.  His plan is not lacking in finesees and would have been almost perfect, were it not for the loss of time involved and the passive position of the knight on e7.   Kotronias
A fine move, highlighting Black's weaknesses along the d-file.  At the same moment it reveals a fascinating aspect of flank openings, namely the ability to cause Black distress through "indoor manoeuvring".  The psychological impact on Szabo becomes evident after a couple of moves.   Kotronias
An unsound attempt to break free.  The Hungarian had t live with the idea of defending a backward pawn and to this end the best continuation was 15...exd4 16Bxd4!? (16 Nxd4 Na6 17 Rd2 Rad8  looks playable for Black) 16...Na6 17 Bxg7 Kxg7  18 Qd4+ Kh7 (it is important to put the king here in order to be able to repel the queen invasions on f6 with ...Ng8) 19 Rd2 Rfd8! (19...Rad8? (19...Rad8?  20 Qb6)  with chances to defend successfully, White can improve on this line by means of 18 Rd2! Rad8 19 e5 but Black's resources are not exhausted:  19...Nf5! (not 19...d5? 20 Qa1! with an attack)  20...Nc5 and it is not easy for White to win a pawn without allowing some counterplay.   Kotronias
Black's pseudo-activity has back-fired, but considering the undeveloped state of his queenside this was a rather inevitable conclusion.  The remainder was undoubtedly sheer torture for Szabo, as he could only sit back and watch his position collapse, in order to reach a respectable number of moves.
I wanted to move my bishop to attack the knight on e3.  I had a mental lapse.  In the end, it still got the job done though.
This way I can block the bishop attacking my knight...or at least take out his bishop in the process.
Was for him to castle himself in to check mate.
I think this was a mental lapse.  His score doesn't show making an amatuer mistake like I would do.  I think I won this game because I started it out aggressive.  I usually play very defensively, and lately my wins have been showing because of the offensive moves.
preparing a battery after Bd3 and a probable e5
with tempo
Black :this has always been my response to Nf3, it seems to be solid and catches people who expect knight moves unaware. It also allows black to steer white away from e4 opening traps – which I hate. It also fits in fairly well with my queens pawn opening play as white as some of the ideas seem to be the same.<n><n>White: I agree and play the same.  When Reti first played 1.Nf3, his master opponents played either d5 or Nf6, still the most common replies today and approved by Rybka and Fritz.  I too play d5 when black, as 2. c4 d4 followed by 3. ... c5 quickly establishes a troublesome cramping outpost in the midst of White's undeveloped space, which will only get worse if ignored.
White:  Yes, better than the other common moves dxc4, c6 and e6  I think.  Rybka and Fritz also prefers it.
Black:   6. …   Nf6 is apparently better, as played by Junge – Alekhine 1942 (0 – 1) – I think the plan is for black to challenge for the centre with this knight aiding the e pawn  etc. in an opposite vien 6. … c6?! (Fridman – Short 1999 (1/2 -1/2)) aims to give white’s centre mobility problems and take some of the sting of white’s white bishop.<n><n>White:	Rybka agrees, but most people play e5.
Black: perhaps 9. Nb5 would be stronger? – it still hassles the queen and assuming black plays Bb4+ 10. Bd2 Bxd2+ 11. Qxd2 Qe7 the knight is now in a more useful position, and protects d4 for the pawn advance.<n><n>White:  Rybka agrees that Nb5 is better by 0.3 of a pawn.
Black: using the won tempo to cover the weak black squares on the kingside – I almost expected something like Qg5 to come next here however that wouldn’t be much of a game. I think this position is even.<n><n>White:  Rybka agrees it's about even with 0.16 advantage to white, although thought 11. Qd4 was a slightly better move for black.
Black: 12.  0-0-0 perhaps is stronger? Making the most of white’s developed pieces – giving his centre a bit of a boost? Black hasn’t got a black bishop any more so there’s no threat of the pin on the queen, and white has time before black can activate his other pieces, and due to the black queen’s position …f5? To challenge the knight isn’t strong as it practically damns the knight and limits black’s castleing options. Though this line is interesting and might be worth looking into.<n><n>White: Rybka gives:  Be2 (0.10), Rd1 (0.03), O-O-O (0.02).
Black:  I don’t understand this. White’s knight is in a much better position than black’s and it’s moved more – therefore it’s worth more. Whilst this move does kind of force white to win another tempo on the queen white kills his own attack. Perhaps castling would be better. – let black deal with it and keep the initiative.<n><n>White: White and Rybka disagree with the above,and find castling on either side slightly inferior.  Rybka rates Nxf6+ at 0.13-0.18 and castling at 0.08 and O-O-O at -0.10 , a slight but significant difference.   White expected (and Rybka strongly advises)  13. … Nxe4 14. dxe4, because black would not tolerate the presence of this centralized knight.  Regardless of how that knight got to such a strong presence, white assumes his opponent will make the strongest move and it will be gone in one move.  Given its doom, white must decide:   is it better to be taken or to do the taking?  If white waits to be taken by black, he is left with two unprotected pawns and the Queen  wide open for attack by a rook on the d-file, that rook protected by the Queen safely at e7.    On the other hand, if white takes black’s knight first, black does not gain any tempo, because his Queen will have to expend a move recapturing.  This recapture move by black does not improve the his Queen’s position.   In fact, with O-O, the black Queen is in danger of the castled rook, which White hoped would be unveiled unexpectedly at a time inconvenient for black.  f4 nicely accomplishes this on the next move, a move that an overconfident White unfortunately overlooked. <n><n>So black’s Queen was safer at e7, and the recapture move was of no benefit and if anything lost time.   So, white ch

So, white chose to do the taking to prevent the undesired scattering of his pawns by the recapture preferring black’s recapture putting his queen in a possible line of fire at f6.<n><n><n>White did not seriously consider O-O-O because the King is a bit too vulnerable with the stray c-pawn, which can be easily attacked by Be6, a move Rybka recommends.

White:  Now that black has attacked the base pawn to his chain, his kneejerk reaction is to add a defender.  He notes that black can pile on more attackers as is carefully analyzing the danger.  White has two goals for this pawn:  either keep it as the base of the pawn chain or advance it to the other side of the board, defended by multiple heavy pieces.  In past games using Reti, White has won games with center pawns making it to the other side aided by rooks, so why not plan ahead?
A little furniture rearrangement so as to continue to have 3 defenders on the base pawn.  With the old arrangement, the Queen was the second defender, but we want our smaller defenders first.  With the new arrangement, the rook can take second and the queen third.  This also will make room for double rooks in a couple of more turns.<n><n>Maybe black won't notice his a pawn is under attack.<n><n> <n><n>White was particularly concerned with a possible e4 pawn advance, adding a 3rd attacker, and then Qg6, a forth attacker.  However, Rybka doesn't see an issue with e4 advance,  as d4 advance works just fine, even with the Queen where it is, but it approves of the Qe3 move, nonetheless.
White:  With Black's advance, white takes pleasure at long range diagonal shots fired at the queen side.  The bishop makes a tidy move rearrangement similar to that of the queen, capturing the beautiful long diagonal parallel to that of the Queen creating a swath of squares his opponent can't use.  White's main reason originally for considering the move was to support a b5 pawn advance on the next move
Black: close to even here I think with the main difference that black has command of the half open d file – I thought as this was my main advantage it was to be defended at all costs: hence move 20...<n><n>White:   Rybka agrees, rating it at -0.21.
Black: ! my favourite move for black of this game, though I feel I didn’t make the most of it. <n><n>White:  Ouch!  White was completely blindsided by this, even joked with black to please move the Rook back!  This outstanding move could have been made back as far as move 17.<n><n> <n><n>White’s pawn advance has been blocked, which makes the two connected rooks useless.    What’s worse, the centralized rook cannot be evicted by any pawn or minor piece, and trading it with another rook would take far too many moves.  The only way to get it to move is to tempt with some morsel, (like say, a stray pawn, or require its use in a recapture, or find a way to get the e-pawn on the d-file by a capture.  (White eventually put its beautifully developed bishop on the chopping block as the bait.)  Rybka scores the position at -0.43.
White:  After many days mediation, this move appears the best way to deal with the unfortunate turn of events.  Rybka agrees this is best.  Before making this move, I spent most of my time worrying about vulnerability of pawns on the queen side and the danger of e4 attacking my beautiful bishop and threatening an attack on my Queen.  Then I notice the rook could move to the king side and support a large attack there.<n><n> <n><n>With h3, the plan is subtle but effective for three reasons:  (1) It eliminate one square (g4) from black’s already cramped bishop [and eliminates this useful square for black’s queen and rook as well].   (2)  White prefers to keep all his big pieces where they are, but doing nothing is not usually a winning strategy in chess.  This does something:  it advances a pawn.  If Black does nothing monumental next move, g4 chases off the bishop furthering the pawn advance.  (3) It gives the King a crucial escape square which is fully utilized later in the game.  White normally resists moving the three pawns in front of the king, but in this case, black has no dark-square bishop, and no easy way for black to exploit the hole created, and the advantages all outweigh the costs.  It also has the advantage of possibly lulling in the opponent to thinking white is being careless.
Black: ? I was blinded by the promise of converting my little advantage into a free pawn and missed the much better Qd6! Threatening the b pawn, further securing the central file and mounting more pressure on that e pawn. After 22. a3 Rd8 and white cannot protect that backwards e pawn without trapping his own white bishop on d2, allowing either black to use the extra tempo to protect the king with something like h6 or something more aggressive like e4! Winning the centre.<n><n>White: Rybka ranks them in this order: -0.40 Red8; -0.40 Qg6; -0.39 Qd6<n><n>White sees the advantage of Red8 as it centralizes power on the middle file contesting the other side from white and helps to address the back rank problem that becomes an issue later for Black (and thought black should have done this instead of Rfe8 before). White was anticipating these moves, none of which Rybka finds as favorable: attacks/advances: Rh4(0.21), Qh4(0.95), e4(1.53); defense of back rank: g6 (escape square)(0.16), Kf8 (defends rook in event of attack and centralizes king for end game)(-0.18)
White was pleased with this response: cuts off Rook from the attack, entices rook off of central square, and for White's d-pawn to capture move of the d-file and enable mobilization of doubled rooks to attack the back rank. Black can't ignore the aggressive bishop, another piece again threatening the Queen. Ryka also finds this the optimum move.
White: The moment White was looking for. The pawn has moved on and the doubled rooks are mobilized for action rather than stuck at a road block.
Black: c5 might have been stronger.<n><n>White: Rybka agrees that c5 is much stronger (-0.49) vs. Rxc4 (0.13). Rybka's other choices: Qxe4 (-0.04) and Rxe4 (0.04). c5 would have solidified the lockhold the rook has on the center and avoid the temptation to leave to take a “free” pawn.<n><n>Black: funilly enough enough i considered Qxe4 for a while, but worried about an invasion onto my back rankwith my queen stuck infront of my e pawn.
White is more than happy to lose a pawn to have the troublesome rook out of the way and to gain access to the bank rank and pin the rook against the King. Rybka gives White back a half pawn of advantage here. White wonders if black is aware the back Rook is pinned (and fears saying anything that might reveal this and have black correct the problem by creating an escape square for King or protecting the Rook).
White: Black has unpinned the Rook, but White was still uncertain if this is part of some other plan and by coincidence. White expected f6, f5, h6, h5 or Kf8. Rybka finds f6 best at (0.12), then Kf8 (0.36) and Qe6 at (0.37). <n><n><n>If black had tried the best move f6, white would have responded with Qb3 (pinning the other rook too!) or Qd3 (tripling the heavy pieces on the d-file).  Although all very exciting and the appearance of a strong attack, Rybka finds these responses to f6 basically a tie. However, with the actual move Qe6, Rybka says white has nearly half a pawn edge.
White: Rybka agrees this this the ONLY move.<n><n><n>Black: my only option really, my main worry now becomes the g5 square. a queen secured on that could cause some major hassle for me. i played this line in the ( foolish) hope that white might be tempted to give me a position where i could swap the two rooks for the queen (for example, any move here that doesn't put the queen on the d file or move the d8 rook. my insurance policy of Rd4 is about to pay dividends i think!
Black: Qg5 is interesting! After  26… f6 27. Rxe8+ Qxe8 28. Rxf6  black seems to have an advantage though the kingside threat is impressive<n><n>White:  Although White considered the moves that Rybka prefers here, notabley Qd2, Qd3 or Rxe8+, the exchange doesn’t seem to leave White with any real advantage.   However, Rybka thinks these lines are still better than the above, e.g.<n><n> <n><n>1. = (0.25): 26.Qd2 Rd4 27.Rxd4 exd4 28.Rxd4<n><n>4. = (0.08): 26.Rxe8+ Qxe8 27.Qd3 Rd4 28.Rxd4 exd4 29.Qxd4<n><n> <n><n> <n><n>compared with: <n><n>5. = (-0.02): 26.R8d7 Qh4 <n><n>White thought having the pieces out gave them more power to threaten Black with possible mate.<n><n> <n><n>              Note:  This move is a trap:  26. R6d7 Qxd8 27. Rxd8 Rxd8, costing white the two connected rooks in exchange for a Queen, leaving blacks’ Rooks ready to pounce on the back rank.  Black and White had longs discussions over whether this was playable for White, and eventually agreed it was not.  Rybka rates it at   -1.53.
White:  Rybka prefers these moves:  Qf3 (0.04), Rxa7(-0.13), a3(-0.14), f3(-0.20), Qd2(-0.29),b5(-0.35).  g3 it rates as -0.50.  White doesn’t discover the back door attack on the a-file until next move.   White had considered Rxa7 but only to get a pawn which seemed insufficient.  White wanted something grander.<n><n> <n><n>The idea was to chase the Queen from protecting against Rd8.  If 27. … Qxh3 28. Rd8, and black was going to lose the Rook at e8.  However, Rybka says that Rf8 addresses the problem., but after a difficult fight for survival:  29. Rxf8+ Kxf8 30. Kxd8 Qg8+ 31. Qg5+ f6 32. Qxg7 Kxd8 33. Qg8+ Ke7  34. Qxc4.  White’s being down a pawn puts White behind at -0.44.
White: White is now probably at the peak of this game.   Rybka ranks the position at 0.84.  Unfortunately, finding the best move is no easy task!   White considered many moves and lines:<n><n>28. Qf3 Qxf3 29. Rd8 f6 30. Rxe8+ Kf7 31. Rde6 Rc1+ 32. Kh2 Qh1#<n><n>28. Qd2 Kf8  29.  Rd8 f6 30. Rxe8+ Qxe8 31. Rd8 Rd4 32. Rxd4 exd4 <n><n>           33.

Black: why do i persist in ignoring the h3 pawn? mainly because i'm too woried about a queenside pawnstorm - and also the possibility of a queen supporting the rooks after Qxb6. the main idea behind this move though was essentially agressive in nature - i want to get that rook ont eh back and seventh rank. and this way (i thought) meant that white couldn't stop a potentially tempo winning attack on the 1st rank.<n><n>White:  Rybka agrees that Qxh3 was the best choice.

White over looked 31. ... Qe5 and perhaps also f5 or f6 to protect the rook.
White: The rest from here is easy for black with those two passed pawns. The best white can do is force black to retreat the king and capture a kingside pawn before helping the passed pawns to the end as with a move like 40. g4 etc. though this is a temporary reprieve, as … c3 traps the white king within two squares of c1.<n><n>Black: it wasn't completely obvious that black could take the queen - it occurred to me only after i was almost resigned to loosing a rook! however i think this is the move that removes all white's chances in this game - the c, d and b pawns are just too strong against that lonely a pawn.  however a very close game - with white more often than not ahead.

The Canal-Sokolsky attack
I played this not checking the Game DB or the opening explorer but because I didn't want to play Nc3 pinning the Knight or Nd7 blocking the Queen and Bishop and Qd7 is just ridiculous.
Still by the book and once again I choose not to go into the opening explorer or Game DB but played because I wanted the flexibality of playing Nc6 rather than Nxd2 which means I have to develop the queen on the a5-d8 diagonal and the Knight is forced into a more defensive square.

This is the Evan's Gambit- a popular opening in the 1800s, and is still played occasionally today. White gives up material to gain an advantage in development.
Black did not capture the Pawn on c3 as this would have given more development advantage to white.
Anderssen is not interested in the Pawn on c3. Instead, he eyes up on the black king.
Obviously, Dufresne could not capture the e5 Pawn as he would have lost a piece: 9...Nxe5 10. Re1 d6 11. Qa4  forking the King and Bishop.
Rather than defending his own position, Black offers a counter- sacrifice to activate his Queen's Rook with tempo. Here, 11... a6 would have been better.
This is a beautiful sacrifice to open up the lines for attacking the uncastled King.
Taking the advantage of the pinned position of the g2 Pawn, Dufrense grabbed the f3- Knight. But he unconsciously set his foot on the cunning trap laid by Anderssen. Instead, 19... Qh3 would have given more resistance.
Double checks are dangerous the force the king to move.

Here is a game from the "Walking the Walk" club. The idea is that the wannabies (like myself) issue a challenge to one of the masters. After "talking the talk" it is then time to walk the walk. The Wannabe is to annotate the game on completion. I'm going to annotate this game along the way, to ensure a I represent my thoughts correctly, rather than with a retrospective eye.
Caro-Kann. This is what was expected as I suggested to Shamash that I was going to turn his Caro-Khan into a Caro-Can't. Seems a little bit like threatening to stab a T-rex with a plastic fork.
The advance variation. I have almost no experience with the Caro-Kann, and the small amount of study I was able to put in before the game suggested that this variation doesn't require as much theory to back it up as 3.Nc3 I wouldn't play the exchange variation (3.exd5) as it seems to give black a much easier game. I also noted that Shamash (who is yet to be beaten on this site) has drawn more games of this flavour than the rest.
I'm not familiar enough with the theory really, but to my untrained eye I would suggest that the idea behind this move is Black offering a pawn in order to draw White into an overextended position. My crash course in Caro-Kann informs me that this defence leads toward long games where it can all come down to the integrity of pawn structures.
White now must try to defend his advanced pawns. A big drawback to White's pawns is that there are squares in the centre that they can no longer exert control over.
Looking to place the bishop at d4.
Developing. Perhaps looking for Nf5 challenging the bishop when it gets to d4.
Trying to exert more influence on the kingside squares. Black is unlikely to exchange his knight for a "bad" bishop and allow White to take away the pawn weakness. At this point I am thinking about b4, trying to gain more space and to put the squeeze on black.
Challenging e5. I can see two reasons for this. Firstly, Black wants to improve his light square bishop. It is currently locked into a relatively useless diagonal. Secondly (and perhaps more importantly), this move is a bid to regain the pawn that was given up and to agressively place his dark square bishop by 10...fxe5 11.Nxe5 Nxe5 12.Bxe5 Bxc5. The resulting position is probably ok for White, but doesn't fit in with the strategy I am trying to implement - basically to make it difficult for black to develop his pieces onto good squares, and to cramp his position.
I played this move to avoid the previously mentioned line, and to keep the material advantage for a little longer. Ideas for white may be to follow up with a4, gaining more space and making any Queenside action for black more difficult. An opprtunity may even present itself to exchange with blacks b pawn to create a passed d pawn. A bit of a pipe-dream perhaps! I am expecting Black to respond something like 10...fxe5 11.Nxe5 Nxe5 12.Bxe5 - at least that is what I might consider as black - exchanging pieces to free up a cramped position.
I think Black is looking to exchange at b4, in order to take away a defender of d4. 11.a3 doesn't prevent anything (PxP, PxP, RxR), and 11.bxa5 looks like positional suicide, bringing the black rook into the game and creating isolated, doubled pawns. 11.b5 seems a good way to proceed, forcing Black to either retreat the knight or exchange with White's "bad" bishop.
However, I figured that my plan would still be valid next move, so I chose to hit Black's pawn structure first. Black must either recapture with gxf, or try to mix it up with something like: 11...axb4, but after 12.fxg7 Nxg7 13.Bxg7 Bxg7 14.Be2 black looks quite scattered. Otherwise 11...Ncxd4 12.cxd4 gxf6 13.b5
At this point, it's looking ok for White. I seem to be more or less keeping up with development, and seem to have a space advantage. The material advantage is an illusion though. I can't see how white can defend d4 after 14...e5
The threat to d4 isn't in itself doesn't look all that dangerous. Exchanges on d4 seem to favour White - Black would have a difficult task on his hands trying to defend all of those isolated pawns. There would be a passed pawn of course, but I don't think that is enough for Black. However, If white doesn't exchange on e5 then Black can play 14...e4 gaining space and forcing the White knight to retreat back to g1. I cannot immediately see any reason why not to take on e5, but I'm sure Shamash wouldn't give me an extra pawn for nothing...
It took me a long time to make this move. The obvious responses for Black are 14...fxe5, which seems very bland, and doesn't achieve anything, or maybe 14...Bxc5 which could bring about some complexities, including a bishop sacrifice on f2. I don't think the sac is sound (at least for now). after something like: 14...Bxc5 15.Qxd5 Bxf2+ 16.Kxf2 Qb6+ 17.Ke1, it looks fine, but definitely worth keeping in mind.
I now think that it is a bad idea to take the pawn at d5. after 15.Qxd5 Qb6 the f6 pawn will fall and the White king will be exposed (the White Queen can't come back to d1 because of Bb4). It seems that 15.Nc3 or 15.Bd3 are safer. After 15.Nc3 Qb6 16.Nd1 Bxb5 17.Bxb5 Qxb5 Black has regained the material and has a very aggressive position. After 15.Bd3 Qb6 White can castle into safety.
As expected, although before making the move Shamash revealed through a comment "the issue is whether to go for a little material right away, or to ramp up the pressure"
Forced - otherwise 17...Bxc3 and the White queen will have to watch the rest of the game from the sideline.
Unfortunately I fell behind in my annotation here so the rest is retrospective. Sometimes chess must move aside for more important things!<n>Anyhow, this is a strong place to post a knight. it will be difficult to dislodge and exerts pressure on the White King's position.
Giving the rook some influence on the c-file. Also defending the pinned knight.
If instead 19. Bxb5 then ...Nf3+ and the White Queen is lost. There were some comments around this time (which sadly aren't available to me anymore) about the notion of a knight sacrifice on f3, and how awkward it could make Whites game with an open g-file.
The Rook at h8 now looks destined to create havoc for White. Also notice how difficult it is for the White pieces to plug the gaps in the kings position.
Stepping out of the Black Bishop's way and defending the e5 pawn. I was dreaming of ways to try to create a passed pawn to make life a little less comfortable for Black. The down side of this move is that Nd5 is no longer a good option due to a self inflicted pin.
Bringing the last piece into the action. Shamash commented here that he had 4 sound moves to choose from - a tribute to the mobility he has created for his pieces.
Offering a rook to gain the initiative and hopefully find some counterplay somewhere.
Trying to create some chances for the pawn, and looking for ways to coordinate the knight into a last ditch effort.
But it isn't to be. The game was lost for White a long time ago, but now the writing really is on the wall.
I wanted to gain space in the middle.
I made this move in order to fix Black's pawns on the dark squares in order to limit his Bishop's mobility.
This move was made to avoid an exchange on g4. I did not want to trade Queen's at this point since mine is crucial to holding my position together. I was focused on keeping my Pawns where they were. Fritz 8 says I should've made the move Nc3.
I expected ...b4 here. In that case, I had planned on trying to get the Knight to b6 via a4. I realize now that the plan was faulty and Fritz 8 shows it to be a weak move.
I made this move to force Black into the ...f6 move which put another pawn on the dark-squares, thus blocking his Bishop in even more.
I didn't take the Pawn because I knew it would free the Black Bishop.
At this point, the draw was offered by Black. I was tempted to exchange Queens and knew that the Black King could not break through. Eventually the Pawns would be exchanged and the Black Bishop would be free to roam. I wasn't sure of my chances in the endgame so I accepted the draw.
I didn't understand this move. It's possible to take pawn on g4 or protect pawn on e4. He prefers to let his bishop free to take f4.
I gave options to my bishop.
Free to castle.
I tried to avoid his movement with his knight on f3 or his castle.
And he moves his knight to e5 just before... ¿resigning?<n>It was going to be such a difficult game, but so difficult to resing now?
White naturally castle and the knight is free to move.
Black reckons it's time to castle as well, though Ne7 leaves the knight with few options to further develop.
White begins to harass.
White aims to exchange queens, while capturing a pawn and leaving the rook in an uncomfortable setting for black.
Pushing the pawn to increase the pressure, while opening the white diagonal for the queen, in view of a deadly attack.
Black has to block and the knight move is his best option. (Pushing the f7 pawn would have weaken the defence of the king).
Black secures the queen while seeking to annihilate white's offensive by capturing the pawn in e5. NB. white's bishop remains problematic.
There's less pressure on d7 now, so black can develop his bishop (as per the original plan).
And black wastes another move.
Black needs to remove the push white's bishop back.
Gains a tempo and attacks the bishop.
Sticking to the plan.
Now the bishop is finally free to move.
White is ready to sacrifice the bishop and corner the king.
Black weaken's the defence of the e5 pawn, but..
...loses the knight and could lead white closer to victory.
I argue this was probably not the best move for black, but the mate was anyhow imminent.
The queen captures and black resigns, seeing the mate in 2 moves.
This is one of my favorite games I've played because a lot of tactics are used to chip away at black's defense. I hope you enjoy and give me some feedback so I can improve.
gxf6 was probably better but that doubles his pawns and leaves the g file open
winning the pawn AND forcing the king to move
Bringing my queen smack in the middle of the board and pinning the knight to c6
Freeing the knight to move
Winning the bishop!
using my pawn advantage to start something on the king side
an in between move, taking the bishop before I grab the pawn
wanting to trade and win the pawn
wanting to win pawns
black is happy to trade his rooks
Wanting to move to g6
sacking the bishop, now the best black can hope for is a draw
but can black stop my pawns?
Isn't this the main line of the Caro-Kann advance? It's the way I like to play
This begins a strategy of slowly constricting Black and limiting options with flexible moves that offer transpositional possibilities to favorable positions, according to the DB.
Here White prevents Bg4 but also lays the groundwork for an attack on the kingside.
Drives away the queen and prepares for an attack on the other wing as well as possibly fianchettoing the bishop.
Contests the center. Note that although Black appears to be ahead in development, White is better prepared to use the open lines.
Drives the bishop away with tempo, and prepares a wing attack if Black castles kingside.
Be4?! loses a tempo and the bishop pair.
White decides to retreat the Knight. He wants to save it for the attack once Black decides which side to castle on.
...0-0-0?! While 0-0 is risky and this is common in the Scandanavian Defense main line, here White can rapidly bring every piece and a pawn storm to bear on the Black king.
To weaken the Knight.
Black resigns, the attack is too strong to defend against and a piece is lost.
In my tournament experience I don't like playing any type of Colle/London setup against the King's Indian, as I usually end up with a position I don't like to be in, and I don't play any type of anti-indians with the dark bishop; Ergo my reason to play the Classical KID.
This move came a little shocking to me and I didn't know how to proceed.  Even at my stage I expect the player to make the moves he "needs" to make!  LOL!  What kind of chess player am I?  I thought I could play this game on auto-pilot.
I don't know if this was the way to proceed the game.
?!/!?/!  I don't which one to grade it but it sure shocked me?  Indeed I even panic some and decied I need to move the game in my direction even more.
I would say, from move 38 or so, I continued to play, so I could view this young boy's technique with his rook play.
idea if 6..Nf6 7.Re1 In these lines of the Spanish white always castles kingside so might as well do it now as my opponent now needs to move. I will then be able to use this information to better place my pieces rather then trying to place it in a good spot now
creates a square for the bishop thus keeping bishop pair.Also controls d4 making a d4 advance possible later on
transposes to mainline Spanish
8..0-0 would be the mainline although the move played is logical. Since after 8..0-0 9.h3 and I will be able to get a d4 advance in one move. My opponents move discourages a d4 advance as my knight on f3 is pinned to queen
Decided that this square is better than g3 as the knight attacks the bishop on g4 which will have to move otherwise I get the bishop pair
This just seems to loss the bishop pair as I can't see anyway of my opponent taking advantage of his lead in development
This move is bad. Although the knight is stopping the DSB getting to e3, it's not controlling the center well.My move just forces it to a good square
Although my opponent has a knight outpost , the knight isn't attacking any key points, where as I'm about to open the position.Bishop pair needs open position
there is a downfall to my opponents last move that the queen has a good center square now
this keeps pressure on the d5 square and gives my queen a close square to the center square
puts my DSB on a good square and now I'm catching up in development. My opponent needed to develop rooks
My opponent rook must stay and protect the pawn
My opponent had to take the knight as 27.Nd7 winning the exchange and 27..Rd8 28.Nxf7 is crushing and 27..Rb7 28.Rxd6 a piece up
idea is to clear the route of the rook on e1 to e7
my opponent king can't go to g6
I'm struggling to find a plan
Now I figure get my a pawn to a7 with the rook on a8 and it will be close to promotion
Now that my pawn is close to promotion my opponent can't take the kingside pawns with his rook else I play Rb8 and promote the a pawn
My opponent must play this. If 48..Ra3 49.gxh5 Kxh5 50. Rh8+ Kg6 51 a8=Q
My opponent can't take the pawn as 51.Kxh5 52.Rh8+ Kg6 53.a8=Q
darknite13 is using the best open in my mind, e4.  D4 is another I respect.  All others are modified around these two opens unless it is the Bird's Eye Open.  The English Open is the White Sicilian to me and I know the Sicilian as Black and when White goes on a Defense I take advantage.  I like the Caro against e4 and usually go this route.
The conventional for Caro.
I've seen this many many times and trying to comment seems redundant to the Caro Kann Defense strategy.  The bottom line is grand masters use the Caro to date with acceptable success.  It is a defense for Black for Black to know what to do without the long and numerous moves in a Sicilian or the weak Ruy Lopez.  I rest the case to say my favorite defense as Black against e4 is the Caro Kann.  I have left the Sicilian and I had left the weak Ruy Lopez back in the 1980s.  To date the best defense against e4 open is Caro Kann.  Or, maybe, Alekhine's Defense! I've not lost faith with Alekhine to date! My records show it!
The "cup formation" usual with a Caro where the four king side pawns "cup" the area above the king to defend and restrict untoward advances from white.
This is the time to develop my rear bishop even to rank two which is the only place for it.  However, a tight formation is crucial in either Sicilian or Caro to e4 as an off set to the dull Ruy Lopez many choose against e4.  I gave up on the Ruy Lopez back in the 1960's while playing against my dad and he'd always use the King's Gambit on me to my disgrace.  To date I do the same with anyone doing e5 to my open e4.
Rooks are always kind of slow in the opening.  They are heavy artillery and they need to have time to set up fire missions.
It is a general rule to put a rook into an open field of fire instead of leaving it in a corner.  Especially if the field of fire can take out a position undefended (like the white c2 pawn).
I can also use my rook to advance like the 105 Howitzers in the Army Field Artillery (LIGHT).  When a rook can move forward it is the same as a Battery Battalion advancing canons to the forefront to cut deep behind enemy lines.  If a Battery Position can move ahead of Infantry (pawns or soldiers) to support Infantry then it is a better decision than sending the pawns forward to be bullet catchers.
The queen is the most powerful piece on the board but when she is constricted by less valued Material she is just in a dodge ball ring trying to get out of the way of the dodge ball coming after her.  So.....
I attack the most valuable piece on the board that is now in the center of a ring of fire.
I put my King into the defense though he is always the target.  I put him where he can move more freely to make white work hard to get him.
White is probing for an attack and while doing so push with the safest move for now.  I am already set up to defend and I am defending and that is what Black has to do always.
More probing around by white to get into my target (King) but it is just a probe again to see if I will do something stupid.
Best place for the king to return in the midst of the probing by white to try and crack my defense.
Another heavy coming to the arena of the dodge ball circle but it takes time for the heavies to really get into position in a tightly formed arena.
I loosen up the rook to tie with a rook and give more space to my king while white tries to get his heavy material into the attack in the dodge ball circle.  The cup formation and the Caro is one of my favorite formations against attack. It is good to defend and it is also good to attack at the right moment....
You can see how clinging to the Caro can mean extreme pressure at this point.  Here I know I get to go through the tunnel to see what comes.  I do get scared at points like this because the Caro does not always protect with economy of motion even though it is designed to have economy of motion (force) at most given times.
White wants to kick out my rook and I have the place for him.  Perhaps white is going to the other side to try and constrain my movements.
I see white is indecisive at this point.  I can reposition my pieces according to the anticipated avenue of approach by white and simply just draw the game with repetitive moves and I am willing to do so.  I am not in a position to attack without paying attention to what white is trying to do...
Even a rook (or a couple of rooks) with a queen need to synchronize to get something done. My knight is the piece to use right now to see how long this repetition and hesitation from white will last.
If white won't make a decision to attack I will...
I figured white should resign now but your opponent has every right in the world to continue and make the best of it.
The game ends by resignation.  It took some time for white to resign but on the other hand white was as resilient as I was in the tight trapped contained environment the Caro Kann does to offer a reasonable and flexible defense against e4.
Sacrificing a Pawn to try and squirm loose.
Black resigns. He must now lose a Rook.
Saved the Rook.
Now the Rook is exposed to the Bishop at F5 I should have moved it but...
Niether! I goofed here and recapture his knight leaving the Rook exposed.
Oh the unmitigated pain! I have to conceed here, stick a fork in my attack plan it's done!
The most agressive response.  If 7. ... Bxc3 8. bxc3 white has an isolated pawn but 4 pieces out against one for black and very strong attack possibilities for white on the center.
Protecting e and letting a place for the f rook on the semi open file.
enabling the LSB to leave his garage.
White's plan is to launsh a massive attack on the center.
But black has material advantage and if he manages to defend, white will be on trouble
Last try to attack
From now on it's finished. White tries to obtain a draw.
Ne4 was impossible due to 6. f5!  Then, if ...Nxe5 or Ng4, Qd4 or Qg4, respectively, wins a knight.
Black's in trouble now.
This actually was black's best move, regaining a pawn for the piece.
?? Opens the line for mate.  The f-pawn recapture comes back to bite Black.  Oddly, it's the a2-g8 diagonal that's fatal, not the usual h5-e8 one.
Practically a smothered mate.  This mate has been known to occur when white moves his king to g1 in the king's gambit.  I hoped you all enjoyed this short, humorous (to me anyway) game.
Up to here the play has been standard.  The book would dictate 4. ... Nc6 and there really is no excuse for this move.  It does lead to the pawn push which contains White's Queen-side somewhat, but it retards development and chokes the Queen's knight.
Having learned from previous games, White does not take the pin lightly, especially with such a tempo advantage and now clearing to castle.
Castling was perhaps premature: 8. a3 might have suited better.  Despite his unconventional opening, Black has a deal of freedom here, and has forced the knight to the side.  In the center, White anticipates 9. ... Nxe4, and plans to answer with 10. dxe5.
and White recaptures, bringing the queen into early development. According to the database, more popular here is the Danish Gambit with 3.c3
?! the main response is Nf6 (again, according to the DB - this will be the last time I refer to it in this annotation) What I had in mind was [of course] Bg7, followed by a future Bd4 to pressure the queen once more
The first aggressive attack from White, threatening to double up the pawns on the c-file.
maybe 6...Qf6 would have been better in this situation, but my thinking here was that Black's pieces would have more room after the recapture with the d-pawn (and by pieces, I mean the queen and bishop)
?! Of course, White doesn't need to double up pawns - he can easily retake with the queen - but I wanted to place the bishop on e5, then the queen on d6 (actually, I did it the other way around in the game) to pressure on h2. The most logical defence to this would be g3, which may provide weaknesses in the kingside position, but the real 'Catch 22' of this idea is that the best way to exploit the weakness would be the Queen and bishop on the h3 and f3 squares....
? gives up a pawn for nothing. Maybe White thought that Black would recapture with the bishop, at which point White would play 12.Bf4!, then 13.Bxc7 next move, preventing Queenside castling (12...Qe7?? is not possible because of 13.Rfe1!) Of course, Why would Black recapture with the queen when he has the bishop? [another interesting variation, which still ends up with an equal trade-off, was 11...Qxe5 12.Bg6 Bxh6 13.Rfe1 Qxe1 14.Nxe1+ Ne7, with a pawn, a bishop and a rook for Black's queen]
Now with the aforementioned attack on h2.
White decides to delay the attack for a move to get his rook onto a strong file
Also possible was 12...Ne7, in case Black had ideas of kingside castling
Black develops his last piece, while at the same time connecting the rooks. However, this is where things start to get complicated for both sides...
and I'm happy to follow through with it. I reckon that if White had simply decided to trade off here, Black would have come out better; 15.Bxf6 Qxf6 16.Qxf6 Bxf6 - what Black is counting on in this line is the fact that his seventh rank is more protected than White's second rank, making it easier for Black to break through
The nice thing about this move is that the threatened bishop still can't be safely taken as a free bishop; 16...hxg5 is met with 17.Qxg5 - the bishop cannot be saved, and White wins back the pawn (Ng4 can easily be driven back with a pawn) I noticed that this move also threatened to win the h6 pawn, and I could only see one way to defend everything....
...which further complicates matters! I was looking at, after the queen moved; 17...Nxh2, and if 18.Kxh2 hxg5+  19.Kg2 Qh3+ 20.Kf3, luring the king into the open. However, that all depended...
! on where White moved his queen! White threatens Qa8 mate, and the only way for Black to block that is Bd6, but Black can't do that because it loses his queen!
pretty much forced, as far as I can see - after White's attack finishes, it will have all boiled down to a rook-for-bishop trade, with advantage to White
Breaking the pin on the bishop
Black's king is now safely tucked away in a fortress of pawns!
Forking the b-pawn and the c-pawn.
the play continued 32...a5 33.Qe8  Qf5 34.bxa5 bxa5 before the draw was agreed on, but I find this last position so much more pretty - every piece is defended (save Black's f-pawn and White's a-pawn, but they can be easily defended if they get attacked) both kings are safely tucked away in their own fortresses, and neither side has an attack. Good game!
yes, the white knight can attack the a7 pawn...
I guess I could have attacked with the bishop as well, but it could lead to me wasting turns running away from White's pawns
I have to open up some possibilities here
opponent finally decided to accept the trade
forks the rook and bishop!
but I'm still on the attack on his rooks!
another stupid mistake! I have three days to make these moves, and I still manage to make silly, amateur mistakes...
chases away the bishop, and wins back the lost pawn
using the bishop as a sacrifice to get a sneaky checkmate... I guess he thought he could get away with it considering the mistakes I've made...
unneccesary - the pawn was protecting the bishop
and we are in to the game !
and black took the lead
ups ! here is interesting: if 11. ... cxd5 after knights exchange is painful Ba4+!!
and now... surprise !
another surprise is to follow
Let Sleeping Threats Lie.<n><n>I tend to be a very blunt player. I'm not subtle enough and I tend to fret overly about material, so just occasionally when I get it right it feels very good.
Not sure what he hopes to gain from that one. It makes my life a lot easier by threatening to queen....
Now normally I would have gone for the exchange, but still in the mood to let the threats develop and my opponent to worry himself.
Its a salutary lesson to me not to always go charging in but sometimes to let my opponent worry himself to death, heck enough have done it to me, you think I'd have learnt by now ;-)
Up to here my use of general opening guidelines had served me well but now i moved the wrong B. Better was Bc3 aligning Q & both Bs on the K defenses
According to Rybka this was the 7th best move i could have chosen!!! Correct was Ne4 threatening Nd7 forking Q R & B so keeping the black N stuck on guard duty for a while
A pointles move as shown by the next move back to d2 to avoid losing a N. By now a series of 2nd best moves against a sharp opponent had put black ahead by a whole pawn on Rybka's scoring
The move which sets black up to create the winning Qside attack. Better to keep the R on the board and play Qe2 giving the Q good coverage of most of the board.
desperately trying to get some play on the Kside but only succeeding in putting the Q in a bad spot Better was either Qa7+ or Qc3
But black's K finds the one escape square which will eventually allow it to help the Q promote the b pawn.
From here i worked out that black could force a position where he could give check on c2 thus forcing the exchange of Qs and finally the promotion of the b pawn
I'm trying to use the opened Q-side to my advantage by securing attacking routes.
To support my Knight.
Trying to eliminate the passed Pawn and secure a material advantage.
The tactics start to get complicated. Right now we are both trying to win each other's Knights.
I have to admit that here I didn't calculate everything 10 moves ahead, simply gambling that I would emerge with an advatage after the tactical knife-fighting came to a conclusion. Sometimes you have to grab the tiger's tail and hang on for the ride.
Now after the exchange of Queens, White cannot capture the Rook (29 QxQ RxQ 30 RxR??? R-B8 ch 31 N-Q1 RxN mate.)
Whie has to move his Rook away, and he does.
I press the attack.
Initially, I've thought that this was my first mistake, but in actuality, I think it was my next move that was the mistake. I think that had I played 4... a6 before developing my knight to c6, my game would have been better, as in the next move I could attack the queen and gain some time to develop my other pieces.
Here's where I think I go wrong. Yes, I'm forcing him to trade of his light squared bishop for a knight in an open game, but I am hindering my development far too much and this could have been what cost me the game.
Trying to get back into the game, but it seems to have been too late.
Trying to make him play some defensive moves in order to get my development going, but this might have been another mistake as well.
He castles queenside, now his king is safe, his rook has been activated and I have 0 minor pieces developed, and the rook barely counts as a developed piece as it's not doing enough to allow me some time to develop my other pieces.
I thought about Qb6 for a while here, offering my queen so that whatever attack was coming could be softened, but I realized that I would have been left with a completely undeveloped kingside which would probably take too long to develop. The same thing happened anyway, only with the Queens still on the board.
Ouch. I can't take with the queen because he'd just win my queen for a knight and a bishop and my king would still be stuck in the center and very much in danger.
I decide to give him my rook if he wants it.
Trying to give his h8 knight an escape route. If my pieces stay the same and he goes Ng6 and I capture, I'd get mated in the next move.
There might have been better moves, but I was studying and I had to move quickly. I had thought that I could develop my bishop to f5 after this, which would get me closer to full development with a tempo, even though I could have possibly lost the a pawn after Bf5. I also wanted to play Bf5 to prevent the h8 knight's escape route. I thought that if I could capture that knight for free, I could possibly have a winning game or at least a drawing game.
I move my knight, but it's still defending the d7 bishop.
And now I lose my queen.
Down three points I didn't want to give up, I still figured I had a chance if I didn't allow the h8 knight to escape. But I'm not sure it was possible to disallow that.
After this, I am in big trouble.
Many chess games against stronger player are unpleasant because you are getting tactically outplayed.  Often one gets the sinking sensation that the game is going to be a loss; that he will "take an L".  I have often counted it a principle to be sporting in such games.  Ultimately chess is about a search for perfection.  One values his knowledge of the game more than he clings to the spoils of any single victory.  In this sense, since we stand to learn directly from our superiors in the game, we should be grateful, and even value the difficult positions that attend our encounters with our teachers...
I don't know if there is a preferable square for the bishop, but I wanted to play e3...
I am not that concerned about Ng4, but I wanted to provide a retreat square for the bishop if necessary.  This move does slow white's development, however...
I am much more concerned about the threat of c5 than black's fianchettoed bishop...
With threats of Nxc2+, winning the exchange.  I am forced to consider my Be2 a blunder, and I should have prevented the knight from coming to b4.
My position is falling apart, but I want to open the g-file, if possible.  I am not yet resigned to defeat...
A desperate move to stave off Nxe3...
My queen is my worst piece, having to recapture the knight on c1.  It is totally out of the game.  If possible, I want to arrange the rousing Ne4 or Nf3...
The bishop could have been defended with Bf4, but then g5.  I am desperate to get the queen out...
I had seen that h3 was immune, but black blunders massively, in a won position, and up 4 units of material.  If nothing else, this game illustrates how in blitz, it can be good to stick with a lost position.  I think that after Nb4, black relaxed a bit and didn't play accurately enough to keep me out of the game...
The recapture with the knight seems more appropriate than with the queen because of [5...Nc6]. It is true that if instead [5.Qxd4 Nc6] there could follow [6.Qa4], but this seems to offer little positional advantage and the queen is played off sides and not able to influence the center files d and e effectively.
This move attacks the knight and should be okay if followed by [6...d6].  The idea [6.Bg5 exd4  7.Qxd4] where the pinned knight is recaptured by force fails to [6...h6  7.Bh4 g5] and the pin is broken.
Played by Kasparov in many Sicilians, this move presents the tactical attack on d6 where if [7.Nd6 Bxd6  8.Qxd6] and black finds unbearable positional pressure with no kingside castling and no easy counterattack.
A positional blunder. This move overlooks the tempo gained by [7.Nd6 ], and the followup positional pressure that white is able to maintain.
What options are available for black at this point?  Consider [8...Qb6  9.Nb5! Qxd6  10.Nxd6 ] if then [10...Kd8 to protect the bishop, then [11.Nxf7 !] and the rook is lost. Not effective for black is [8...Qb6  8.Nb5! a6?  9.Nc7 ]. No better is expecting [8...Qe7  9.Qxe7 Kxe7], because there is still the knight move [8...Qe7 9.Nb4! a6?  10.Nc7  Kf8  11.Qxe7  Kxe7  12.Nxa8] and white stands better. Another bad try [8...a6  9.Bg5!] and the knight is both pinned and lost with a queen attack pending and mate to follow. The real problem for black in this position is the serious bind placed on the d and f pawns, the lack of development, lack of a black squared bishop. The text [8...Nc6] is an attempt to clear some pieces on the back rank to activate the rook, but there is not enough time.
Here I overlook completely the better [9.Bb5!]. The text move does little to contribute to the attack.
A blunder because the knight needed to be safeguarded against the pin by 9...h6]. Even a move like [9...Qe7] would have been better. I am very happy to see this move.
I finally find the correct idea and place the bishop accordingly.
This move is a blunder. Fritz7 suggests the line [10... Qe7 {desperation} 11. Qxe7  Kxe7 12. Nd5  Ke6 13. Bxf6 Rh7] gaining a piece. The text move has the appearance of mixing it up with tactics, but all the tactics favor white.
Fritz advises that the alternative is also unfavorable: [12... f6 {does not win a prize} 13. Qxf6 Qc7 14. Qxh8  Kf7 15. Qh7  Kf8 16. Bh6  Ke8 17. Qg8  Ke7 18. Bg5#]
This move appears to be the correct path as the knight participates in the attack and a tempo is gained.
The problem for white to solve now is: where can white successfully move to create a mate? The queen has no attacks. The d7 pawn is well guarded. There is no secondary objective of creating a double attack on king and queen by the knight. So the answer was to find a way to move the king to e8 and also to remove the knight at c6 so that the queen can finally use the e7 square for mate. The answer involved repositioning the knight at f6 while producing check.
Fritz comments that the alternative variation: [15... Rh7 {doesn't get the bull off the ice} 16. Bf6 Qc4 17. Nd5 Qe4  18. Kf1 Qxd5 19. Qxd5].  At this point I notice that my king may need to seek refuge so that I can continue the attack.
There is not much to suggest because the position is already won. Just a note, black really needed [...Qb4], but the c3 pawn prevented it.
A surprising mate in 18 against the dreaded computer. I really had no expectation of achieving this, even though I always play for a win, even against the AI. The main failing of black in this game was overlooking the knight incursion [6.Ndb5] and [7.Nd6 ]. The position leans heavily to whites favor after the BxN QxB exchanges. There were other weaker moves made also which contributed to the win.<n>- - -<n>It is possible that the Nb5 maneuver was not in fashion back at the time this program was created and so maybe it was not in its book. I was lucky to have considered it because of seeing it in some Kasparov games that I have been studying. This was a very pleasing win considering how many times the AI has beaten me. I am going to enjoy this while I can in case it is my only win against this level.<n>- - -<n>I can of course dial the level down to a lower elo, and do play at lower levels. But I wanted to see what would happen if I played up some. This game will play some crazy stuff at the lower levels which can tend to demolish me. Much different play than any other chess software, and good for keeping me sharp - I hope.
Here is a short French Alekhine-Chatard attack finished recently.  There are some interesting educational themes in this game.  The attack against solitary king, the trapped piece and weaknesses in the castled position.  Feel free to leave comments.
The Classical set up against the French is probably the most testing.  White avoids extending the center with 3. e5 and prepares to develop actively with 4. Bg5, among others.
Breaking the pin.
This is a typical strategy for the Classical French.  White wants to exchange his bad dark-squared bishop for Black's good bishop.  This will leave Black with the problem light-squared bishop to deal with, while White's light-squared bishop will find an active role to play very early.
An interesting move that offers a pawn to start an immediate attack on the Black kingside.  In the days of romanticism, where gambits were always accepted, this led to some spectacular defeats for the second player.  Today, with defensive technique much stronger, this variation is almost extinct.
The best way to refute a gambit.
White hopes the open h-file will help him to attack the Black kingside.  Of course, only someone with a deathwish would castle kingside at this point.
This keeps the queen available for the defense of the kingside if needed.
Immediately targeting the pawn on h6, but this is of no consequence as Black should continue developing and wait for White to commit his king before castling himself.
White wants to keep the bishop on d3 without the ...Nb4 swat, however, this move weakens the White king's soon-to-be shelter.  Notice on move 16 how this weakness will become the target of my attack.
Preparing to castle queenside.  11. Qd2 would amount to a fairly similar game, however, the White queen would have the option of coming to f4 after both sides had castled.
Developing another piece and waiting for White to castle.
White has to commit sometime.  He would never be able to undertake any effective plan with the kings in the center.
We are now pretty clearly in the middle game and the respective plans are shaping up.  After 13. Kb1, White will play on the kingside with Rh3 and Rdh1, followed by an advance of the g- and f-pawns.  Black will blow out his castled position in an attempt to get at the White king.  An interesting battle is set to ensue.
Although, this just gets the light-squared bishop trapped.  Now the plan becomes easier.  While White tries to extricate his piece, I will work on the king.
Attempting to bring the Queen to assist in the extrication, but this allows...
Two of White's pieces have abandoned the king.  I have the ability to bring my bishop to a4 and my other knight to c4 via a5.  I decide it's time to strike.
Removing another piece from the defense.  White can stop the Black queen from invading on b4 with 18. Nb1! and if now 18...Qb4?!; 19. b3 and it doesnt seem to me that Black's attack is going anywhere.  Black can improve with 18...Nb4, when I'm still better.
White has to give up a ton of material to stay alive for a few more moves.
Clearing the way for the light-squared bishop to enter the attack.
Thanks to my opponent.
This looks like a mistake. I will sometimes with Black play Ba6 but only after a5 to give the Bishop some protection from the Rook.
The best place for the Knight, a nice outpost
And now the Bishop falls
Gets the Rook off a Black square
Offering a trick, if 4. Nxe4 5. Qa4 , winning the knight.
Now it's safe to take the pawn
And this is a new move, threatening the rook on a1
I had calculated that if 11.. Qxa1 12. Qa5  Kd8 13. Nxf7  looks good for white, with the h8 rook ready to be taken.
Development and also saving the a1 rook
I was quite worried here, 2 pawns down already and about to go a third down. I was quite pleased with finding 14. Qa4 on my board between patients at work.
So, what's the compensation. Black is 3 pawns up but White has a lead in development. the black king is stuck in the middle and lines are open for the rooks.
I was surpised by this move, but it makes sense, making some room for the king and trying to kick away the bishop. But, CM8000 gives mate in 12: Starting with 16. Bg5  Be7 17. Bxe7  Kxe7 18. Qh4  Kf8 19. Rc7 Bd7 20. Rxd7 Re8 21. Qh5 e5 22. Rc1 Qe6 23. Rcc7 a6 24. Qf7  Qxf7 25. Rxf7  Kg8 26. Rxg7  Kf8 27. Rcf7#
This was another surprise, although not entirely sure what to expect.
I've became addicted to it though, and I do it in most of my games.
Most people when they move out to f3, and the opponent's pawn is on E5, don't take advantage of the factor that the E5 pawn is unprotected. They do not take advantage of it and they respond with either Nc3 or D4. I, honestly, see that, yet I do not push and respond with one of those two. There is no point after you kill the pawn, they push you back, and they are more well developed.
I try to break up the queen contact for the bishop to be protected.
I need to get in there
White forces the issue, although Black might have done better to improve his pawn structure (perhaps 9...g6 to set up a fianchetto and help weaken White's stronghold on the a1-h8 diagonal) or move his queen back and get her out of that rather stranded position.  Development of that knight further cramps the queen's prospects to be relevant if she is moved back..
White really needs to develop his queenside. Black has a solid defensive position, although prospects for an attack are not too bright, and that stranded queen is still a worry.
White's c3 bishop is very powerful, protecting the potentially weak b2 pawn, extending White's absolute dominance over the a1-h8 diagonal, and pinning the b4 knight to that queen.
Not the best move as it looks like it could create something of a hole in White's formation, but White evidently is willing to risk that if given a piece in return.  He calculates that there is little to fear from Black's very defensive position here.
Not so much of a hole anymore - Black offered White a cheap escape route. White pumping up the pressure on that queen, figuring to remove Black's knight from the board and take advantage of White's now-vulnerable kingside. Probably loses him the knight as well but White is enjoying the initiative.
Also bad. Allows White to execute the exchange and weaken Black's back line, all for a vague threat to White's kingside with no support.
The most sensible move. Black will try to regroup.
White doesn't appear to have any affirmative ideas and is trying to get Black to make moves and subsequently weaken its own structure.
Decent desperado to escape without any major loss. White's queen and bishop still shore up a solid formation. Black needs to get that rook involved to have any attack.
I still think White has a somewhat better position - in a game like this, with diagonals difficult to exploit due to the pawn structure, two rooks probably beats the queen - but that hurt.
A4! is a strong move as this shows immediately the weakened position of black. Because of h5, 0-0 is impossible and so to bring the king in safety 0-0-0 should be played but that has a weak point which is the field b6! with a4 white immediately attacks to obtain b6. Black has a problem as 0-0-0 is risky.
So this is not so good. On the other hand black has problems to develop the pieces. In nay way white already obtained a big advantage. This move just makes it worse and thats because of the next move
Black is out of book here. He clearly plans to fianchetto his bishop, perhaps as attempt to discourage White from a Bg2 fianchetto, which is common in the English.
There is no advantage for White to trade pawns here with 18.cxb5 because it frees up the a-file for the Black Rook.
a4 was an attempt to allow Black to either exchange pawns in order to open up the b-file for my Rook, or lock up that side of the board which is what he later chose to do with 20...b4. If he would have left the b5 Pawn alone I would have left it alone also for fear that cxb5 would free up his Bishop to attack.
Avoided d4 because the prospect of trading a Knight for a Bishop in a game with locked Pawns was not in my favor. I also expected ...d5 eventually and wanted the opportunity to open up the e-file for my Rook in a Pawn exchange if dxc4 or dxe4.
Bh3 is the only safe place for my Bishop. I did not want to exchange Bishops because my Bishop had more attaching potential but if challenged I would have had no choice but to exchange them.
Kh6 shows the plan to push his g and h Pawns.
This move was important because it supported my plan to eventually move my King to f3 and later give my Bishop the option for escape if attacked.
Offer exchange to free up my Bishop. I worried about 27...h4 which would have made my Bishop worthless, but perhaps Black was not interested in locking up Pawns on both sides of the board and wanted to open the game up a bit.
Push h Pawn for exchange in an effort to give my King more breathing room.
Black recognizes 35.Bh5  and moves the Rook that would have been captured otherwise. What is missed is the potential for a fork on the 7th Rank when the King is forced to retreat. The option of exchanging Rooks with 34...Rd8 was available but possibly even better was 34...Rh8  which would have forced 35.Kg3
The plan is to pick off some pawns and free up the 6th Rank.
40...Rd3?<n><n>The plan to advance the b Pawn is understandable, but considering the current situation it would have been better to forgo attacking the b3 Pawn and instead attack with 40...Rd1 and later 41...Rh1 or 41...Rg1.
preparing Bg7 leading to a rather strong bishop for black
I wanted to develop my other knight via d2, so I avoided Qd2 here, but as we will see later, this is not really the most convenient square either, since black will be able to place a knight on g4 with a tempo gain later on.
As mentioned earlier, the ill-positioned queen allows black to make this move à tempo and it leads to a powerful sequence winning a pawn
Normally one might indeed want his rooks on the centre files, but in this case, the rook was probably better positioned on b1, where it gets to put on some (momentary) pressure. Black's favourite move to develop his bishop (seen next move) would for example not be possible in that case
unnecessary. g4 might be an interesting move to play somewhere in the future, but since the bishops are likely to trade anyways, preparing it in this manner doesn't do much but waste time.
black trades off to take away tension from the board and make transition to a won end game more comfortable, but it comes with the down side of fixing white's pawn structure.
looking to trap the knight, but really losing another pawn, since black can punch right back with his own little trick
Preparing for an exchange sequence
Seems a bit inaccurate in hindsight. If I allow black to take, his pawn structure is ruined, so I am likely to get the pawn back anyways and in this way, I allow black to create a fast lane for his king.
Opens up a quick route for the king to rush forward.
Trying to secure the h2-g3 route for the king but
Be3 was coming, so this move is useful to make sure that black is not obligated to trade in that position (which would free the white king and doom the f3 pawn).
avoiding the trade to keep the king locked up
I planned on getting my king to e3 and wanted to block his QS movement in the meantime. However, this wasted one tempo too many, as black's king will join the action too quickly now.
With the black king this far advanced and two pawns down, there really is no hope any more, since the pawns on the king side should easily overwhelm me. I rather pointlessly played some more moves.
And a concession. Black can free up his h-pawn, then block the b8-h2 diagonal with a bishop on e5 and happily march to h1.
Black develops a piece and at the same time supports the e5 pawn
The point of this move is to  <n>   1. Attack Black's Bishop<n>   2. Getting ready to play 6.d4 ( which was played in the game)<n>   3. Allowing the Queen access to the Q-side when it will go to b3 set up a <n>       battery on the a2-g8 diagonal and attack Black's weakness ( the f7 pawn)
The Bishop retreats.
Another pawn sacrifice.  White blows apart the center in the hope that the <n>   new lines that are opened up give access to the Black King.
Black just wastes time here because White is not really interested in wasting a<n>  move to recapture the pawn.
Black defends the pawn on f7 but he places his Queen on a vulnerable square.
setting up the trap of  9. Nxe5 which leads to 10.Re1 d6  11. Nxe5 dxe5 <n>  12. Qa4  and then 13.Qxa5 winning the Black bishop.
Putting the Rook on the same file as Black's King.
Placing the bishop on a very powerful diagonal that leads towards Black's King.
Instead of getting his king to safety by 11.0-0, Black tries to counter-attack. <n>   He has forgotten about the principle that you should not open lines when <n>   your King is still in the center.
To stop  14.Bxe7  Kxe7 leaving the King unable to castle ( 14. Nxe7 simpily just<n>  drops the a5 bishop).
Black continues to waste even more time and just leaves his King in the center<n>  where it is exposed to attack.
Capturing the pawn and is also threatning 17. Nd6 , with a discovered attack <n>  on Black's Queen.
Now as you can all see. White wants to force Black to take the Knight on f6<n> ( If Black moves his King here then the White Knight will just take the Black <n>  Queen on h5) The point behind White's sacrifice is so after 18. exf6 White has <n> just blasted open the e-file and has gave the White  Rooks an invitation to join <n> the hunt for Black's King. The possibility of opening up some lines against the <n> enemy King should absolutly always be considered.
Black has to really take the Knight here  because now he is threatning <n>   20. Qxg2 checkmate.
If the Black King tried  to escape with 22. Kc6 then  23. Bd7 is checkmate.
Checkmate. This is the final position. Anderssen must have been quite fond of <n>  checkmating his opponents by placing a Bishop on e7!
take the center
Adding support to the center in an non hazardous way
time to create a small outpost for my knight
wow.......I just noticed the standard bishop's head looks like the sultan's palace in Aladdin if you look close enough
run away its the killer rabbit and he's got himself a holy hand grenade to boot!
Annotated by legspin.  This is the first game I have annotated.  I picked this one due to a rook sacrifice later in the game which I thought people may find interesting.  I am not a grandmaster (or anywhere near), I have not memorised all openings.  I do refer to a book for openings and I am not as good over the board as on this site.  However, I do think about what I am doing and try to understand why certain moves are the preferred one.  This is my view of what happened and why - better players may disagree but lets not worry about that!  My favourite opening.  Who knows whats coming back at you?
Pin the pawn preventing e5 and an attack on the knight
Pins my knight and attacks the bishop.  Personally I'm not keen on developing the queen so early when the whole kingside remains stationary.  This comes back to cause problems later.
Knight back to protect bishop and make the knight better protected whilst also maintaining control on the centre of the board
Black development continues pinning my knight.  Time to chase off the queen and prepare for a queenside castle which is under pressure at the moment with the queen  at a5.
Queens gone so no need to move the knight, get the queen out of the way and double it with the bishop.
Threatening the queen and  c2 with a fork on the king and rook
Avoiding the Nxd4 blunder which would have let the bishop take my queen took the only move available to protect c2 and move the queen other than going backwards and messing up my castling as well as leaving it less well developed
Finally I castle which gets the rook down the centre.  I going to ramble a little here.  My understanding of opening theory is to develop pieces, control the centre of the board, keep pieces protected and gain space.  Apart from my doubled pawn I am in a better position on all fronts.  I am expecting black to play Nf6 and maybe g6 followed by Bg7 to free it up.  I was again wrong...
Only option available - this is where having control of the board comes in as both the queen and the bishop are protecting it and there was nowhere else to go
Still enough protection for the knight (and nowhere else for it to go so.....)
Bring out the rook to put further pressure on the queens side.  I now have every major piece aimed into the queens side except the rook at d1 which is straight down the middle.  Conversely, black still has not moved a single piece on the kingside
To cut off the rook but black didn't see what was coming
Rook sacrifice for a pawn - check!  A killer blow although it may have appeared a blunder.  I'm now looking at dxe5 and then Bxa5 which means my queen supported by the rook have a clean run at the black bishop on d7 and mate if it is not protected
Threatening Qxd7 mate if the queen removes the bishop
a simple sidestep and then back to the action - note the black kingside is still in place
Protects the bishop and therefore mate
Threatens Qb8 with the bishops lined up to close in for mate or Qxd7 if the rook moves.  Taking the queen with the bishop is not appealing as Bxb5   Rd7  Rxd7 and then Qxa6 or the knight moves in for mate.  A bit more play and blacks queen is taken leaving even on major pieces but a clear path for whites pawns to advance down the king side
Black brings across his queen to join in but too late
This is the Closed Sicilian heavily analyzed by Daniel King. With best play, White can easily secure a draw, but Black essays some questionable lines.
Black avoids the well-known Pawn sacrifice with 9....e5. Black should also consider 9...Rb8 before b6.
I don't know if Black saw this finesse, but it stops all hope of Black mounting an attack on the a8-h1 diagonal.
some vague pressure on black's queen.
pressure on Q slightly less vague.  a case of a capture (11...cxd4) being better for the opponent than for the capturer?  comments?  also, should black have done more to open up his game by now, particularly on the queenside?  maybe ...b5 (prep'd by c6) instead of ...cxd4? (or does the game swing mainly on double-pin at 16 and the exchange at 19-21?)
better to exchange than conserve as white's N would have been pushed around and black's might have done well on reaching d2. this was black's successful strategy in our previous game, exchange down and look to a potentially strong endgame.  slightly worried.
breaks pin but probably could have been better spent.  black's f pawn looking a bit weak.  on the other hand, is now free to move.
strategy from here on is push the rooks around perhaps leading them to and unwise alignment while also using all the coverage of the QBB combination to limit the rooks' options.
black can move safely only to d8 or d3 and can not save pawn.
Unusually passive reply from my opponent! It does stop my Knight getting ideas about going to g5, as if it would!
Perhaps 5.Nc3 was better? I didn't fancy the tactical complications should Black take the e-pawn and then play d5.
We both develop normally, and I see the advantage of Black having the dark-squared Bishop on e7, behind the pawn chain. It doesn't get driven back and can join a K-side attack.
Now I'm the one being over-cautious, preventing the pin on the Knight. But Black has more aggressive plans than a mere pin.
Attempting to double my pawns and removing the Bishop that's aimed at the King is not a bad idea!
I can't prevent the exchange, but I can ensure my pawns don't get doubled.
Allowing the Queen the option of heading to the Q-side and preparing for a possible d5.
I get back to f3, having made four moves to prevent the doubling of my pawns, which doesn't see too good a deal, in retrospect. But now my dark-squared Bishop is free.
I can't see a problem with allowing an open a-file, since my Rook is on it as well.
This seems the best square for the Bishop, even though it doesn't actually threaten anything. And I have to move it to give my Rook a defence.
For the present I want to keep my Bishop on the board.
I can see Black is setting up an attack on my h-pawn, which I had no real need to advance. I don't fancy allowing him to open up my position, even for a point advantage...
Black has built up a strong K-side attack now.
Black cuts off my Bishop's retreat.
This drives the Knight to f6...
Where I can exchange and avoid the Bishop being trapped.
Adding to the defence of the h-pawn.
My King retreats. Despite having made no inaccuracies, the computer has me a massive -1.55 behind at this point. And then, according to the analysis, Black blows it...
And instead of retreating as per the computer's drawn repeat of moves, Black advances his f-pawn and I'm in real trouble.
Black gets ready to pin my Queen...
There's no chance of a repeat of checks though, since the Rook can block.
But as the others must fall, I resign. Curious that the move the computer has as Black's first error was actually the move that won the game! Beware the computer analysis!
Hi everyone, this match was against the highest rated player in my 1700-1800 mini-tournament, in fact just before the draw offer his rating was 1851.  This was a strange game of which again I was struck down by passivitis and I found myself exchanging my opponent's horsies which were threatening to run riot in my position for both my bishops.  I was very lucky to draw this game, how lucky only you the jury can tell me.  I kick off with e4 and my opponent gives me the Sicilian (c5).
35. Kc2 - to try and prevent the enemy king from snatching off my a pawn.
After my opponent takes on e4, I decide to exchange rooks, not paying enough attention to the hanging knight on b5. Elyhim uses the opportunity to smash my weakest pawn. I suppose, 13. ... axb5 would have been a safer move.
Confident that I will be able to take the knight on d6 (or the pawn on d5) later, I decide to hold onto the material advantage and find a retreat square for my rook. I was aiming at b2, hoping to secure some advantage on the queenside after my center had been destroyed.
I was not afraid to trade my rook for a bishop and a pawn, because that way I would have created a passed pawn on c5 to compensate (hopefully) the passed pawn on d5 my opponent already had.
I admit, that came completely unexpected. Now I see that four other opponent's pieces (two bishops, the knight on f3 and the Queen) are aimed towards my king, and after I had lead my rook astray, I don't have any means to counter that. My first thought was to play Qxd5, but I suspected N3g5 would make my life miserable. I knew it was not going to end well...
But I took anyway. Partly because I see no other move, partly because I was interested in how the opponent's combination would unfold. The Gameknot computer that analysed the game after it was finished was okay with this move, but, frankly, I don't believe it. I think the game was lost at this point.
I expected elyhim to start an attack (most probably at Ng5) right away, but his move was a lot better than I could have thought of. All his pieces are now ready to attack my exposed king.<n>Note how the sacrificed knight contributed to this move, taking away my d6 pawn on 14-th move. In my opinion, the knight's route b5-d6-f7 is one of the most devious and cunning sequences performed by one piece.
The computer says I should have played Rb7. I agree. It would have brought my rook into play faster and secured at least some protection of the f7 square. Perhaps I was already in panic, but I did not see that.
At this point I surrendered because I have nothing to counter Qg5 followed by bringing the rook in e1. Note that in the end a rook and a knight remain undeveloped. I see my first and foremost mistake in forsaking the normal development of pieces. For example, 13. ... axb5 would have opened some opportunities for my second rook, and 14. ... Qxd6 followed by Bb7, and Nd7-Nb6 would have possibly allowed me to take back the d5 pawn with some chances of equalizing the game.
castle I have to keep my knight there to protect my queen
duhhh my knight can get taking by the  queen. lets see if black can pick that up.
I realized my rook was not safe . The black rook could of took my rook. glad black did not pick that up.
wonder if black  could pick up she could get my rook
The queen seems to randomly slide to the side. Or maybe it saw the checkmate coming, and made a slightly comprehensible move...no telling.
I think Pxg4 would have been better.  This would pin white's black bishop against the rook.
Ooh, BxPc2 forks white's rook and queen.  On the other hand, black now faces the prospect of BxRh8, a free rook, while black's fork involves an exchange.
A move fraught with potential.  White could trade queen and bishop for both black's rooks and a knight or bishop.  But Kb1 is answered by Rc3+, and black trades rook for queen.
Instead of Be6, Rf6 would protect that bishop.  Now white is bound to trade bishop for rook.
I've move a3 to try for a checkmate which I think is called something like "bradburne" it involves black moving his bishop to c5 my knight moving to d5 his knight capturing e4 and my queen moving to g4.  This will give me a good advantage and hopefully a seven move mate should things go to plan after that.
Okay he's threatening my queen so I need to deal with this.  I think if I capture his knight on f6 I can then capture his bishop on g4 when he captures my knight.
Now this is where I found the 'interesting position'  I am analysing the board as he hasn't made his move and I have time to kill.  I assume 6.Qxf6 7. Qxg4 but then I realise he can move Qxf2 ouch.  check and capture the bishop on f1 and I've opened up a can of worms.  But after further analysis I realise I have an escape route around the back d2 -c3-b3 then when he cant check me he becomes vulnerable.  My queen can move to c8 and capture g7 depending on what he does.  Even retreating his queen at some point I believe I can still have a small material advantage. Castling I can move my dark squared bishop to h6 to give him problems. The trouble is though am I leaving my king out in the open too much??  Will I set myself up for a fall.  He's still not made his move so I will have another look when he captures my knight with the queen should that be what he does.
got the bishop
I nearly missed this and immediately put my queen on c8.  I figured out in the end that my rook was lost and it would possibly be rook for rook but this way I get his bishop as well.
This move is to capture b7 then a8 I cant see an escape for the rook.
He's on e6 I wonder if there is a way to mate him here as he cant move to d5 or f5
If Bobotsev accepts the sacrifice, Portisch can put him under tremendous pressure.
Pinning the Bishop. Now Portisch's advantage in development is turned to account.
KxN is met with Q-N4ch, and the King-hunt would be on in earnest.
Portisch tightens the screws.
The hammer blow is about to fall.
The Caro-Khan
Preferring this move to 11. Bf4 which can be met with 11. ... Qa5+ by Black with 12. Bd2 Qc7
So as to avoid a potential exchange on g3 doubling White's pawns on the g-file
Kicking the knight and also asserting White's presence in the centre with ideas of d5 at some juncture
Probably best.  If 29. ... b6 then 30. Qa6+ (30. ... Kc7  31. Qb7#) Kb8  31. c7+ Nxc7  32. Qxb6+ Kc8  33. Ba5 Rd7  34. Rc2 with the idea of doubling Rooks with a decisive advantage
If Black had tried to run with the King, e.g. 30. ...Kd7 then 31. Rc7++ Kxc7  32. Rc1+ is decisive
.The opening resulted in a very closed game, were both sides avoided exchanges, until black decide for a centre pawn break with 11...d5 and after white's move decided to precipitate the action by exchanging the pawns, then instead of dealing with white threats (black had a pawn hanging and a knight pinned), black decided for an unneeded move 13.h6 after which white took the initiative and due to a cramped camp by black with lack of connection between pieces, white went on to win the game.
one of the main replies, the idea is to repel the bishop from b5
counter-attack the best option for black
to open an escape route for the bishop keeping the light squares bishop is white's main idea, and to prevent both Nd4 and Nb4
now further support on e4, and opens c1-h6 diagonal, white pawn structure is cohesive although if black tires a d5 pawn break white might have some trouble due to the weakness of it's d3 pawn
so white doesn't have to exchange the bishop
developing the last piece and leaving open the hypothesis of 0-0 or 0-0-0
no problems for white in opening the d column, it might even try to place a rook there latter on
wins a pawn, as bxc6 Qxa6+ Kd7 Nf3 Kd8 only move due to the threat Rd1 to win the queen for the rook or a piece for a pawn in d5, and white is clearly better
and white is better the threat now is Rd1 to win the queen and e5 with a pawn fork on knight and queen
now black has to block on the d8 square either way they lose at least a piece:<n>Qd8 Qxd8 exf6 wins the knight<n>Bd8?? loses the queen <n>Kd7?? Qxh8 and then exf6 wins another rook and the knight
if white does not want the center i will take it.
attacking the pawn and making room if i need to casle
Black refrains from 2...exf4 which leads to wild play.
? I studied this line at home before(with a little help from a book that mentions this,but doesn't go to much into it.) 8...f5 is better.9.Bxh6 gxh6 10.Nf3(10.Nd2 Rb8 11.0-0-0 Bd4 12.c3 Bxe5 is unclear)10...Rb8 11.b3(11.exf5 Rxf5 12.Qg4+ Kh8 13.d4 Rxe5+ 14.dxe5 Nxe5 is unclear)11...fxe4 12.dxe4 Qe7 13.Nbd2 Qg7 14.0-0-0 a5 with compensation for the sacrificed material.
? Blunders the Rook.
Black resigns since his Bishop and Queen are attacked.Thanks for viewing and/or leaving comments.
After the more active Bf4, Qa5+ is best move to force the Bishop back to d2.
Here Qc7 is usually played, delaying the development of the f8 Bishop, which goes to d6 regularly. Sensing that Black was intending to castle short, I played a quite, noncommittal move.
Castling short is the CK is fraught with danger, the Kingside being slightly weaker than the Queenside, mainly because h6 is played. But if I was desperate to win with the CK as Black, I'd play like this, too.
Here, I was intending to clear the g-pawn and also activate the g3 Knight or exchange it for a defending piece.
The proposed pawn sacrifice. Black certainly isn't forced to take it, but if he won't, the pawn will advance to g5, further weakening the Black monarch's castle position.<n><n>This move wasn't played before on GK, at least it wasn't recorded in the database, and in my database, I could only find one game where Black accepted the sacrifice and subsequently won.
Not wasting any time and aiming the Rook directly at the Black King.
This is the actual novelty and improvement over 17.Qc4 which was played in my database game. It offers a whole piece for the attack. White isn't winning here, but he has a lot of threats, especially if Black dares to take the piece.
The cat is out of the bag now, but one can hardly blame Black for taking the very active Knight. After the text move, White has the initiative.
For the piece, White has a number of direct threats, the Ng4 and the e6 are attacked by the Queen. A nasty discovery is looming on the d-file, the Bishop and the g-file Rook are taking aim at Kg8 and to top it all, the Knight on f3 is poised to reach a nice snuggle position on g6.<n><n>White's position is much better and Black is only hanging by a thread.
Black connects the Knights, he keeps the g-file closed, but at the same time, he removes one piece from the d-file so that only a pawn now separates the White Rook and the Black Queen. The Ng4 is also in the air.<n><n>It's really hard to find a move for Black here. Perhaps liquidating some material with 18...Rxf3 19.Qxf3 Ngf6 20.dxc5 Qc7, but after 21.Qg2, things look grim.
Free tempo.
i just though to centralize my knight.
i decided to fianchetto my lsb.
always good to exchange pieces when up in material.
Building a center and protecting the pawn.
Kicking the knight so that it won't have the opportunity to fork my king and rook on d7 when I need to move my queen.
The beginning of a great attack. Now white has to worry about both his c and b pawns due to my knight, rook, and DSB. I'm also offering my d-pawn as bait because if white leaves his king without its protection, he's going from being seriously in danger to sealing his fate.
Here I can do a windmill if I wanted to. What I didn't realize is that I also could have checkmated white here with ...Nc2#. Dang. That would have been pretty. In the moment I was looking for the fastest mate and actually missed it to choose this one instead:
Getting ready to castle queenside and try to march with the kingside pawns. Here black can play an interesting tactic 7 ... Nxe4 8 Nxe4 Bxg5 9Nxg5 Nxd4 and black wins a pawn. We would then already be near the endgame.
attacks the bishop.
I decide to take the bishop back.
Maybe better is Ng4 and trade the knight for a bishop. That would probably be my move. This puts pressure on the e4, because after the trade on c3 its undefended.
Im thinking that tempo is everything here so I use the bishop here to protect the pawn.
Tempo is everything, I already decide to move the kingside pawn with a bit of tempo.
I was afraid black would play 11. ... Bxc3 in which case I would recapture with the pawn or else I lose the pawn on e4.
Advancing the pawn, this move stops the knight standing on f6, which is always the key feature of the defense on the kingside.
Nd5 threathening to double the pawns on the c-file.
I decide to castle to get out of the nasty pin.
Im happy with this move. I dont really see what it does. Probably better is just take on c3 to get nasty double pawns and try to attack it with Qc7 maybe?
I want to keep the piece on the board and now its on a good square.
Probably to play Bb5 later on and give the bishop a nice square.
Pins some pieces to the king.
trading off. I don't really mind, the black bishop is not really valuable to me. Black now has the bishop pair though.
Take it with the rook.
Nice move, now if i play fxg5, then dxe5 loses the exchange.
My attention is still on the kingside.
This would be losing if it wasn't with check! Im threathening Nf6+ and after gxf6 I win with Qh7#, or black has to give away the queen. But the threat is still there.
Now my knight is pinned! another good move by black.
unpinning the knight. I am two pawns down but material may not matter too much. I don't want to go to an endgame.
The threat Qh7# was there but I think I like f5 more.
Qxf4 I'm still threathening stuff. Black took some time to figure the next move.
f5 Frees up the king.
I'm going to attack the kingside. Was there anything better?
Kc8 doesn't look to good. The pawn on e5 may be a very good piece if he played that.
to the open field!
Black counterblunders!
A mistake, he did not calculate the variant, white is winning, the best way for black would be exd4 and then put pressure on e4 with Re8 - this kind of game is difficult for black - to get out of the limited space, but normally black wins if he mange to get a good development.
A mistake, e6 was the right place to put the bishop.
The pin. Everyone's doing it. I just wanted to fit in.
Developing with tempo.
I was thinking of 15. ... Nxf3+ followed by 16. ... Bxc3 to win a piece, but white would ruin it with 16. Qxf3 defending his lonely knight. And then 16. ... Qa5 is refuted by 17. Rfc1 and the knight will escape. Then I realized I could reverse the move order a bit, lead with the queen, and good things might happen.
The white pawn on a2 was free for the taking, but it still is. Black senses a two-for-one sale: take one pawn, get another free.
Black really wants his queen on c3, but there is a little problem of white's knight. Time to chase it away.
Now we're on c3. 31. Qxc3 is just about forced at this point, a trade that greatly favors black given his material lead and passed pawn. Said pawn is dangling, undefended and en prise, tempting white to remove his queen from vital defense.
31. ... Qh3!! needs a pair of exclamations. Well, maybe only 1. It's one of the scariest moves I've played in a long time. Black is leaving his rook en prise, and white can capture it with check, gaining a tempo. That's usually certain doom, but oddly enough, in this case, even that extra tempo won't let the white queen return to defense in time as she has to run around the forest of black pawns. There is always the fear of perpetual check, and 3-move repetitions, but nothing of that sort presents itself to white either, so it's time for the poor rook to take one for the team.
White took the bait, and now he's doomed. I suspect he may have realized it too, for he didn't return to this game for almost the full three days. I took the time to enter the final Conditional moves, in all their possible combinations, including queen stalling moves with Qh8+, Qg8+, Qf8+, and Qxf7+ (which came up in several combinations, adding 4 extra conditional variations to each combination), and ended up with something like 25 or 30 combinations. The immediate threat, of course, is 33. ... Qh7#
Ok, this is another draw, where I would ask stronger players to say whether they think one side or another had an advantage in the final position. Weaker players may enjoy and interesting tussle. It started out as another Noimzo-Indian Defence, so I would refer you to another anotated game adamraoof (2006) vs. charleshiggie (1932) for the first 3 moves on both sides.
Black re-news the threat to double to c pawns.
My Scottish oponent takes the opportunity to get the 2 bishops.
White now has a massive centre, but the exchange of minor pieces eases Black's position somewhat. Do you think it was a mistake by me to force off the white squared bishops?
Giving up the open file may seem wrong, but I wanted to pull his rook away from the e file, otherwise in some variations he recovers the pawn on e5 with his rook on e8.
With some interesting threats, such as Rg4 winning the bishop, and if Be5, then Rf8 mate! I really didn't expect my Islander opponent to fall for that, I rather expected 30... Bh6, 31 Rf6 Bg7 32. Rc4 and a draw by repetition. My opponent found another way to defend.
and draw agreed on Black's suggestion. The question is - who is better in the final position. Material is level, with pawns on both sides of the board, the bishop is better than the knight. Also in these sorts of positions, it is better to have the passed pawns on the side away from the kings, ie the Queen side. On the other hand white has two passed pawns, the e pawn is further up the board than the passed a pawn black has. over to you dear reader - who do you think is better?
White has a pawn to the good and seems to be ahead in development.
Attempting to weaken the center for white.
Attempting to develop to gain some initiative.
I am eyeing black's kingside as it may become cut off from the center if I can land my pawn on f6 or cause other mayhem.
Forcing the trade of the bishops.
Need the rook to push f6.
This may not have been the best choice to refute the attack.
?! I wasn't sure what to do and needed a moment to think. So I repeated the moves to see if any other moves were possible.
Black proceeded to use the next 7 minutes of his time to timeout in true blitz fashion.
And we have a huge standoff in the center.
Sets up the fork, but leaves the e4 pawn hanging.  Black has a stronger hold in the center.
Trying to get some of the center back.
Wins the knight for bishop exchange.
And I grab some squares in his territory; maybe I can force him to panic.
This was a mistake.  I could now play dxe4 and open up (most of) the d-file for my queen.
An interesting idea, not one I have seen before in a stonewall structure.  It could well be better to simply play 8...Nbd7 at once, as the black rook is soon forced off the f-file.
While the white pawn stays on c4, black can not contemplate the e5 break.
This move is important, so as to slow down any f5-f4 ideas from Black.
I think this is a mistake, as the pawn that is about to recapture on e5 will become hard to defend.  Nh4 is possible, but 16.Ne1 looks best, as it can work it's way to the f4 square.
I had planned to anticipate the hxg3 maneuver from black by walking my king to e2, and double my rooks on the h-file.  The move played is a serious mistake, as it allows the white position to become severely overextended and highlights the weakness of the advanced white pawns.  20.Kf1! is much better, because when the white pawn is on b4, black has no way to open the queenside so the white king will be perfectly safe in the centre.
38.Rb2 is the correct rook to place on the second rank, as it can not be pestered by the black bishop.
Ok, new scenario. How to attack without a Q??
You'd queston it, but look at Nc6: he has no place to go after b5, and a6 doesn't work beacuse of the pin on the a8 R. So no developing move right now, but any alternative was just a shot in the dark (Bd3 is ok, but what for? h3, so to get a square for the B after Nd5? How boring! Let's be nasty! :-)
b5 is now uneffective because of Na5, defended. No point in playing it, unless I have concrete plans on the dark center square, which is not the case. My goal is to place a N on c4, so to threat Nxb6 until the R is still undefended...
Nice. No Nxg6 anymore, and this is hard to attack... safely (c4 opens the way to Nb4 and Nc2+). And this makes a tempo for me to save the B (I sure want it!) before b4, followed by NxN and Rxa5, winning a pawn.
Still threatening and gainin space. I can save my B into h5, so I will take the tempo.
If f4, Bh4.
I hope some N play can help me. I'm aiming at d7 and Nc6.
The natural defence leaves Ra8 undefended, but I am in no position to exploit it.
I seriously though about BxN, here, and try to win the black pawn.
Planning an attack on f4, but I have BxN.
No d6 (he saw Rxe6 after it). No point in exchanging the N, I have to shield in.
No evil in closing the diagonal for the B: it is useless right now.
For my B to come to f1 if needed.
The threat on h7 is a fake. If I play it, Rh8 and then Rxh2.
I'll let the B diag open, but this is a very poor move. I'ts up to black to show me how to break in.
Inmediately grabbing my chance to threat something: Bh5.
? The chanche I was waiting for!
The strike I was plannin.
I expected here to force d5, closing the game in my favour.
Here, I missed the winning f5!, and if black retires the N, Ne4#! Beautiful, and I missed it. i also missed BxN, and after Rxe5 the two joined passed pawns should win easily.
This a blunder. For one it hampers blacks development of the G-Knight. Second this is not the queens ideal developing square. Usually, the queens ideal developing squares are c7, e7, d7 or a5. As a rule the queen should be one of the last pieces to be developed
A logical move that allows white to attack e5 from a safe distance.
This is an OK move but lacks an serious threat. I honestly do not see the point, especially if black has not plays d7-d6. Also if you are going to play b2-b3 then Bb2 is the ideal follow-up move
driving away the bishop is a good move
nope this help white more than it helps black. The check has not real teeth. So why play it! If I were white I would thinking hum black has not real plan. So I can consolidate my position before black figures out what he wants to do. <n><n>Better is Bd7 which develops a piece and prepare for the connect of the rooks after 0-0
wrong way to capture! Bishops are better in the endgame so do not be in a hurry to exchange them .
black has managed to seal the centre. His plan should be to manovure his bishop to the king side where he can attack the king
a critical mistake by white. Black can win with the immediately with h5!
Black can play Bc3 to exchange white's dark bishop followed by Qc5 to seize control of the dark squares.
blunder! drops the bishop.
not good! the queen is much stronger on e3 for the moment. Black can try to win with h4!
too slow. Black has to play with vigor if he hopes to win.
Defending the king's pawn against a possible attack with the pawn at d6
I thought I would use the bishop for a future pin but decided to trade it
I would probably have used the bishop to recapture here
Looking to break into the castle somehow...
This was a big mistake. I cannot record what was in my mind.
I had to distrurb the queen since moving his night to f3 could have been devastating.
Fortunately now there was my chace to counter attak with the queen threat gone.....
Of course, this aimed to give him some time, but the take could not be avoided.
Gained the rook.
Very wise. guarding the backrank and also trying to force the queen away
Now it's his turn to try the mate. One move could end it up, but.....
LOL. He tries to trap my bishop. He literally just spent 4 moves trying to trap my bishop, and it doesn't even work. Observe:
Probably not the best move here, but it's already too late to try to counter white's initiative. Black has to pay for his horrid opening play.
Gave my rook free reign on the a-file, and a clear route to the 7th rank.
Now black has to think about developing safely, with the semiopen b column. b6 was simple and wise, but it seemed not enough to me, so...
If white exchanges, my knight can go out with tempo. On the other side, the d6 pawn becomes weak, but... maybe I can handle that.
And this gives me the chance to play...
So black is not cramped anymore: a good center control, even without the e4 pawn, ready to castle... if c4, Qd4, threatening the rook, Rb1 still presents problems for black to develop, but it seems playable. If Qa4+, Nc6 controls the threat.
At least I can get rid from the nasty dsb.
I calculated that the b7 pawn will open the column for my rook.
With a rook on b and another on c8, I felt confortable. g7 is a weak point, but the queen controls it.
Wise. Now, how to go on? I could have tried Ra4, since after RxR, Qxf2+ and Bg4+. But I didn't see it.
white tries to restrict the king's activity
black has the possibility to force a draw
Standard attempt to capture space in center exploiting opposition of black queen to white rook.
? It's probably a blunder. Black knight has cut the black bishop off the camp and now it can be trapped since black knight doesn't have any tempo-winning moves.
? Well, that's basically a mistake, that could cost quite a lot. The point is that I've moved my queen to f-file which undoubtedly will be opened after capture at g6. Actually quite stupid move and blacks could save their bishop by a simple answer 16... h6<n><n>Now if 17. fg?! fg 18. Qg3 Rf3 (18... Nf3?+ returns some material, but it seems rather weak, since blacks attack will weaken without a knight) with threat Qh4 so white will have to play precisely just not to lose in few moves. 19. Qg2 (19. Qh2? Qh4 with threat of Rxh3 followed by Nf3+) Qh4 20. Re3 Raf8 -+ white pieces are paralyzed, while black keep threats Rg3 and Rf2<n><n>Thus whites would have to refuse to capture the black bishop to maintain significant advantage (+/- black bishop will be off game basically), so i wouldn't definitely say that 16... h6 was a better choice. Sometimes it's better to go into mathematically worse variation, but giving some counter-play and practical chances to save/win the game. Let's say both 16... h6 and 16... Re8 deserve consideration (!?).
Another bitter blunder... Anyway thanks to my opponent for the game, and thanks everyone for reading my first annotation here.
g6 was to "better guard my king"
plan is to go f4 f5 g4
attacked on the queenside
this is to get rid of the a3 defender so i can go na3 with a better game
!! if with the bishop? no open lines! no way to attack! not now!! the a2 pawn is weak!!!
stopping the pin
stopping fried liver, most guys dont have the balls to proceed with echange 2 pieces for a rook and pawn, however it is more difficult to handle and coordinate 2 pieces
Returning the favour
accepted the exchange to be 1 pawn up
acepted this trade, knew the position could not hold
chacing the bishop
trying to open the middle
offering echange to open up f file
Chess to set up the battering ram, I was waiting for the rook to leave
King f3 was better because I would not be able to check, but also would not stop my defence Qg5
check, picking up the stranglers, and switching to white squares to defend
Trying to push his pawns and defend the king from behind..., but gave me chance to... push da pawn
exchange rook for pawn - I was actually a pawn up her if I check the board
new this was comming
i calculated for this, and new i was winning as my pawn was further up the board
deffending the pawn with check and winning a tempo
this actually played into my plan here, I had a glimps of the mate earlier, but he nudged me there
I could push Qe1 check and with tempo move the pawn d2,d1, and swop queens, but there is better, forced mate in 2
Black's aggressive defense leads to the fireworks starting early.
White is not afraid to mix it up!
A sharp thrust. White decides to try and press the attack.
Black attempts to slow White's coming charge.
Black tries to get his R and Q involved in the defense. Now the Q can move to B1 and attempt to break White's attack by offering the exchange of Queens.
White takes advantage of the pin on Black's KRP to force home his attack before Black can marshal his defenses.
This move exploits another pin -- this one on the Black KR -- to divert the Q from guarding the back rank.
The knockout !<n>0-1
I usually avoid e4 because it often leads to e5, which I think is often boring, but this time the response was the Sicilian Defense, which is one of the more interesting openings out there.
Opens up the e-file, which at this point is probably not an ideal situation for either side, but since White has the tempo, black in is even more trouble.
Developing with check and preparing 0-0-0, though it does lock down the White bishop for the forseeable future.
Both sides have castled, white has better development and better center control while black has slightly more space and much more secure King position.  I give white the slight edge right now, despite the hampered bishop.
Bb4!  While it might not seem all that great off hand, it completely compromises White's king position.  White has no way to prevent the trade and no way to take the back on c3 without compromising the attack or severely weakening the King.
Bxf6?  Almost certainly not the best move.  It allows black to win the b2 pawn and develop his queen with tempo while pointing her straight at the even weaker king down the a1-h8 diagonal.
g4??  White tries to weaken Black's king with a pawn rush, but neglects the bishop on c8.
White finally moves the bishop, but it is still doing no good doesn't appear that that will change in the near future.
Removing the defender of d4 so that the Queen can access the King.
Nd4???  Black wins with the simple c3.  White has nowhere to go and no way to prevent Qb2.  However, black was to caught up in trying to trade pieces down because of his three pawn advantage to see that he had a mate.  This is another reason why the "guidelines" in chess are often meant to be ignored.  It is much more important to see the position than it is to memorize catchy little sayings about Knights on the Edge...
Now black threatens to push the pawn to c3 again.
Black has mate in two now, but white must give him the time to do it, which he White has no intention of doing.
if Kh6, then Qf6, Kh5, Qg5  .
When someone plays this opening, specially against my favorite London attack, I have always the feeling that I must be able to destroy him. And I never do. <n>So I do actually fear of players that use it against me. They must be very sure of a deep knowledge of it to play it. I started to fight against my fear of this opening. And willing to face it, of course, with all my senses alerted and a desire to be very, very bad with him, a desire to finally beat this "ugly" and "weak" scheme that... beated me so many times!
Dare to play g6 and I will sure play h5. No problem I don't have any support to advance the g4 pawn. Oh, it would have been nice, but no, I am so sure of my absolute superiority that I can go on without it. At least: this is what I wanted him to think! (Actually I realized it afterwards :-)
Sure, sure, why he is so damned sure that there is no danger in the kingside castling? Sure he had read hundreds of books about this, and knows how to face almost all attacks (just as I do with my version of the Scandinavian). So the fear reverted to me. I am sure he was not aware of that, but this actually was... an aggressive move by him!<n>A strong desire to play h5 at once. But the support on g5 could be necessary in the future. One of the keys of this would be to open the h coumn with some exchange on g5.
You will say that c4 was the good one. And it probably is. But I have not read any book, and I know that normal moves are faced, they always are. But I believe in my God: the London System. And in this scheme, the queenside is very hard to attack for black, far and unaccessible as the peak of a high and rocky mountain. Too bad if it seems a loss of time, or a bad move...
Experience told me that, with some care, this advance is not good for black, in the long term. So, this move, that probably he played in order to making me pay for my bad opening, didn't mean any aggression to me, being just a part of a masterplan, "my" London System attack, in which this knight never plays a real threat (if I play with the due care to black queen and bishop). <n>Now, the natural move, here, would have been to protect the h4 pawn, maybe with an ugly move like g3... bleah! It stinks. Where is the attack in g3? It just builds a trap for my beloved bsb.
It is not the first time I play against this, but now it is not easy for white to keep a thing called "attack". Again... I was playing as if I had a masterplan...
It seems that black has an attack, but he would have to prove it.

I decided to play a pawn sac in order to develop the h column attack. I am sure that he didn't expect a move like this, that apparently makes just me lose a pawn.
The "normal" one would have been Ne5. This allows black to take the h pawn. But... this way, he also gets it, and besides, the knight would be in a horrible positiont. Do I have trap for him? No, I really didn't. I was just playing as if I had it (the previous procedure is dangerous. Don't try it at home or without your's parents advice! :-)
Why should I have allowed this? Oh, yes, because of c5. So no problem, just exchange c5, and everything's fixed. <n>And I couldn't castle queenside in order to take advantage of it. I don't want my king to be blocked in the center!
The base of the London System is that the white's queenside must keep being a fortress. Period.
The attack on the weak e6 coud have been set without the sac, but it is too good to avoid it.

I didn't see it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<n>ALL my plan - to sacrifice the h pawn in order to unbalance the center in my advantage - was pure crap. <n>And I didn't see it.  <n>Incredible (ejem :-). <n>I could hardly believe it... how could I been so stupid? <n>Oh, no, another sillyly lost game!
I tried not to change queens, and maybe I should have avoided it. But you see, I was discouraged. I was not trusting anymore my game. I couldn't see anything better that to wait for the ox to fall on my face...
So two straight pawns less, a knight very badly placed (since without the queens the planned attack on the kingside is hardly possible). A pawn storm coming down, and I have not even castled!
OK, ok, I have to fear the white diagonal. The advance of the black central pawns will point to weak white squares, with a lot of uneasyness for me. <n>But, to the other side, the only chance to make the game meaningful for me, up to this point, was to try to complicate things enough so I could hope in some trick or distraction by him. Yes, why not? The win is already his, so I have anything to lose. <n>I cannot wait passively the pawn storm that is approaching. I will be squeezed to death, forced to give a piece for two pawns (with luck), thus staying in a lost game. <n>Ah, by the way: my knight being tied to the defence of the f2 pawn, and opening the way to diagonal power. As an hero in war movies, I was leaving my bulletproof jacket back in order to run faster, even if exposed to the enemy's fire... :-)))
I see you come. The natural move would have been Be3, but again, I had to complicate things. The only weakness I saw was the bishops against the rook, taking advantage to the underdevelopment of his queenside (that compensates my knight bad position), but I bet that unless he plays soon g4 - and he will think twice to do that BECAUSE OF the sacrifice of the h pawn in the previous part of the game! - my knight will be an active battleforce after jumping to f4. Just a couple of meaningful moves in between... time enough for him to develop his queenside! Ah, he can still end in a neat 2 pawns advantage! But he will have to fight for it, and on the least inaccuracy, things could revert in my favour.
Ok, so now the rook is just where it wants to go. This wasn't a good move. From MY side! Just fine. Let's act as it was all part of a deep plan, and see if he gets scared.
He GOT scared! for nothing! And I won a tempo, pulling away my rook from the white "radioactive" white diagonal.
I couldn't find anything better. My knight MUST participte in the game, even at the price to let him free his queenside. But, more than just that, my bishop is aiming at b6, bothering the rook occupation of the d column. If only I hadn't moved my white bishop!!!!
With the white bishop in g5, I had Bc7 here... but not now.
He insists not to move his rook on the white square because of my Bg4. But... should I go for drawn, betting he will not be able to take the rook away because of the bishops' combined force threatening to win the exchange? Maybe. But I had a "master plan" to carry on, do you remember it, some moves ago? I had no idea of which this masterplan would be. But it SEEMED to be a magic combination involving the two rooks and the open columns... that I couldn't find at all. But probably HE thought I had one, and make him be less aggressive that he should.
Ok, the knight comes into the play. Now is the time to prove that the whole plan, since Kg5 instead of e5, was just a superdeep combination I supposedly saw at the beginning of the midgame.
He choosed to defend. He couldn't have done this having played the knight to d7, as I suggested before. <n>Hmmm... it's looking as if black is starting to have the urge to be careful, to take care of his weaknesses... more than attacking (which I think it would have been his better plan). <n>And this is the reason he doesn't see the horrible blunder that this moves represents. I checked it a thousand times, just to see what I could be losing after the piece win... and now, the game was psycologically reverted: now I am the one looking for a masterplan in my opponent's game... a masterplan that probably didn't even exist! <n>So I went for it.
Now, it is true I lost my beloved bishop pair but... you have to give something if you want to get something... now I am in advantage. What I pronosticated became true: he went inaccurated against a complex game. In other words: I have been able to find the small pieces of advantage, to have put them together and to get something from them... yummmm!!!!!
Now, you see, the knight is not in danger, while the black king stays where he is. And to move it is a tempo I could have taken some advantage. <n>True. <n>But... except for this detail of taking back a rook for a knight because of the ckeck, the check itself wasn't really a great progress in the attack! My attack (I started thinking in attack! This is a nice turn for me!).<n>And you see, my pressure over g7 is mild, unless I double my rooks (still far). So, what if I don't take advantage of it, and let me exploit the OHTER threats I could do? A far better one came to be...
Nice! I recover one pawn. <n>He can take the knight, but after Bc8+ I will take his beloved bishop and more pawns...<n>So, my Knight came to be a force in this game... now, threatening Ne6. <n>Rg8 worths a look... but it isn't enough to recover the piece.
Oh, yes, this "little" detail. Now, I have to fight against the e pawn, threatening to crown in e1. So, back to the hard thinking. <n>It was hard because I bet that he doesn't have the chance to make suffer with his pawns, but... I cannot be so sure. I, again, played "as if" I was sure of it.
In order to protect the bishop after R76+. But...
Winning move. Kg7, Rf7+, winning the bishop. Kg8, Bxe5+ and mate.
In this variation, black queen comes out on f6 to defend the e3 pawn. I usually do not like taking out my queen early and I think in most cases it is a mistake to defend a piece with a queen anyway.
white attacks the e3 pawn again. The other benefit is that white bishop on c1 has now an open diagonal to take part in the game
Black defends it again with the bishop on d6. If it was not for the themed opening with the first four moves set, I would have played d5 to restrict the black queen and c1-g5 to a attack the black queen and after f6-g6, develop my knight on b1 to c3 to defend my e pawn
This is the first "free" move of black. He moves his queen to g6 and attacks the e pawn
White ignores the attacks on the e pawn and takes Black's e5 and attacks the black bishop on d6. Black can play g6xe4 check, and probably the best move for white at that point would be d1-e2. f1-e2 would be met by d6xe5 with a Black strong attack on b2 and White rook on a1. Therefore, if 5... Qxe4+, 6.f1-e1 Bxe5, 7. Nxe5 Qxe5 with a fine game for Black despite being behind in development
Black has now an eye on the rook on a1
a protection against the bishop attack as I was not keen on trading pieces at that point. I was happy to allow the check from Qxe4 as it will allow me to develop white chasing away the Black queen across the board
Again not keen on trading pieces. My idea was to castle white Black's king in still in the middle of the board. Nothing works like an absolute pin... There is nothing that Black can attack that is not well defended
Not sure what this move was about. I think Black was trying to open up a1-f6 diagonale so that he can attack my rook but he surely must have known that I was about to develop my knight with tempo by attack his queen. By the queen his queen could not run too far away from the bishop which itself was under attack from the knight on f3
I attack Black's queen. She has nowhere else to go but f5
White attacks Black's queen. The idea here is to trade piece my white squared bishop with Black's black squared bishop and a strong attack on Black's position. if 9...Qxd3, 10. Nxe5 (a double attack on the f7 pawn and Black queen on d3) Qf5 11.f4 preparing my queen to join the attack after castling
Black decides not to trade pieces and retreats again constrained by the cover it must provide to his black squared bishop
I castle. Now, let's go for the open centre and try and pin a piece to the Black king...
Black again takes his queen out of the e file to avoid a deadly pin to the queen. But the bishop must stay thre and wait patiently for the rook pin
The rook (absolute) pin comes, now Black's bishop is attacked twice. I am expecting 11... Nd7 or Nc6. I personally would have played Nd7, just to allow the queen some breathing space, just in case...
Now Black's queen is cut off from top left quadrant of the board. Just a thought... An attack idea here?
I pin the black knight to the king. At that point, I was happy taking the knight out to gain the bishop
The only move really for Black. It allows me a 3rd attack on the bishop
White's black squared bishop joins in the attack against the bishop. I do not see any other defence for the Black bishop on e5....
Black tries to bring the knight back to the defence of the bishop by breaking the pin. If I am serious about taking the bishop out, then I must take the Black knight out now...
Black recaptures my bishop
I use the knight to get a discovered check on the Black king, an attack on the queen check by taking out the bishop on c6
Black castles. I am sure he was just relieved to get his king out of the middle of the board
I take the bishop out. At this point, I am up 5 and Black has two choices, take my bishop out (+3), I take his rook (-5) and his retakes my knight for a 4 points loss, or he takes my knight and moves his queen out of the bishop attack for a two points loss
Now for a queen fork with check. The only move for Black in Qd7. 17... Rd7 18. Rc8 mate or Kb8, 18.Qxg7 with knight now on g8 having to be lost to protect the more valuable rook
As expected. At this point, I am happy to trade pieces for simplification
I attack d5 pawn and develop my rook. I just love where the Black king is....
The knight on the move. My idea at that point is just to put the knight deep into Black territory and see what happens
Quite happy to fork the rook on d8 and g7 pawn. Black must move his rook and at the same time nurse his pawn. I must admit that I don't like having enemy rook or queen on the same file as my king, no matter now many pieces are in between. But then, I have my bishop and as long as I make enough room for my king, the king, bishop and pawn taken together should be able to defend against a double rook attack
I I just go about make room for my king and at the same time giving from protection to a pawn attack against my bishop
Black attacks the pawn. We can easily deal with this
I go meet his pawn attack. However he moves his g pawn, I will be able to meet it. And once his g pawn is out, Black's knight cannot be efficiently protected as it has few safe squares to go to
The pawn moves. I must take it out. I have something in store for Black. I know he is trying to advance his h pawn to open up my king position. For my part, I just want to open up the centre...
The idea is is to attack the d5 pawn which would allow a double attack on Black's king and undefended knight. This is one of the reason I do not like having rooks and queens across my king but thankfully for me, Black is oblivious to what is about to happen
Very few moves possible here, worst case I am up another pawn and the centre is open. The least damage is to capture the knight and limit the overall loss to two pawns. I do not see any other reply. Do you?
This is a big mistake. The king should not be in the same line as an undefended piece. A better move would have been king in c6. That has the double benefit of getting the king to participate in attacks later and putting immediate pressure on my rook
I decide to ignore the attack, I have enough pieces (with my king) to take care of defence. I sent the rook to the 7th rank for all sorts of good reasons: e.g. if I can get my other rook on the 8th, it is mate
My loyal bishop holds the fort
Happy to allow check, now I can dine on a pawn
I take the pawn. One of two things, either I get my other rook on the 8th rank once black has vacated it on his search for a desperate mate, or I allow one of black's rook to roam off his other rooks' file for a skewer on h8
As expected, Black is blindingly trying to recover some of his losses and forgets (or does not realise at all) the skewer on the 8th rank
Qe7 was the play
he should have retreated his king to f7 by now, and has passed up multiple opportunities to do so
perhaps Qb5 , then castle?  Should lead to material gain
needed to take on d6
Its better in this opening as black to kick the Knight before taking the pawn
This time it's not so much moving the same piece twice that is bad, because the first was a capture, but this closes the e file, and puts his Bishop in a bad place. If he really wants the file closed, I prefer moving the Bishop or Queen to e2.
He could have overlooked that that to rook was the only thing protecting his bishop. He might have been planning something like 19. Rxf6, gxf6 20. Rg1 pinning the queen to the king. But, I get to have a move, so..
Notice he can't play Bxh7, because of my Knight.
Preparing the kingside storm.
I think Kf2 was better, because it puts his king closer to the passed pawns.
Note he cannot take the f pawn, because he will not be able to stop the g pawn
0-1 Black wins. He didn't have much fight in him after he blundered piece. Although in my next game, Jesus Christ showed me that I shouldn't give up just because you are down.<n><n>Since I don't have a log for the next game, I'll explain it here.<n>We opened with e4 c5 nc3 nc6 e5.(I'm white.) Just a bit later I won one of his queenside pawns, he got one off my kingside. Then I blundered a piece in a trade of minor pieces. Jesus helped me to realize just because I lost a piece, I'm not lost. I still have a chance. I just have to play my best, and focus. So, I launch a queenside attack. He launches a kingside attack a bit later. I had 3 vs 2 pawns on the queenside, He had 2 vs 1. He has an extra Bishop, we both have rooks and knights. He moves his Bishop diagonally next to his pawn, since I threaten it with my Knight, and I was also threatening his Bishop. I use a move or two to get my king up there, then capture his pawn with my Knight he checks from below with his rook. I noticed his Bishop was hanging, so I took it with my king. We discussed after the game,  and he realized he should have took the Knight with the Bishop, but he said he thought he could do that(check me to gain material)for some reason. I'm up a pawn now. My Knight supports my queening squares on the a and c files. He has advanced his h pawn to the the 2nd rank of mine. I push my a pawn to rank 6. He puts his took next to his pawn, on g2. He threatens Rg1. I move Rh1, he moves Rg1. His Knight guards both the h pawn and the rook. I take his pawn. He takes my rook. a7. Ra1. a8Q. Rxa8. Nxa8.

He still hasn't moved his pawn to g2. At this point I remember the board clearly again. My king d6, queen c8, Knight h4, his Knight e3, king f3, pawn g3. Trying to find a move... I find Qc6+. He grabs his king. Hovers it over f4 and g4. He chooses g4. I move Ng2. He captures. I capture. Kh4 to protect the pawn. I move my king over and he resigned within a few moves.

Interesting.  I could outflank with Qxa3.  But I would I like the pawn exchange?  NO!  White gains points and Center!<n><n>Do I Rxe4?  Maybe.  The Rook would protect vulnerable d4, and White would have few options, the most aggressive being Rxe4 which would leave my Queen parked in a good spot...<n><n>And last but not least, I cannot ignore the e4 Pawn.  exf5 exposes my Rook to his.
I could play a5 and stop the advance, leaving a4 vulnerable to Qa3...<n>But without my Queen to support, a Rook exchange would leave my opponent up 1, instead of down 1! <n><n>Perhaps I should initiate a Rook exchange.  We could trade Queens too, and start the pawn race... <n><n>Qc3 looks promising - She attacks the Rook, Queen and Pawn in one fell swoop.   <n><n>But I think I like d3 best.  Pressing matters...
Here, I could exchange on d5 first and then play Bb5 having e4 square for my Knight after d4 but i wanted center to be closed and didnt see any problem about Ne2. Thus I played the next move 5-Bb5
i would love it if my opponent exchanged on e4, but as i said earlier, i expected this and it was ok.
My Bishop is there to exchange the Knight for a Bishop. I waited till this move in order not to lose a tempo.
Now Ne4 is a good move it is hard to get rid of Knight from that square and it is like an octopus there.
Obviously my opponent did not want me to ruin his pawn structure after the exchange on c6.
A very bad move. Just as I said earlier Knight was too strong and the Bishop was not as effective cause of my e4 pawn. I thought I could play h3 followed by e5 and kick the Knight to bad position and later use e4 my other Knight. the problem is that I did not think the fact that when i play e5 I leave the d5 square for his knight. Thus i regretted this move already in a second.
My opponent does not want to allow me to play g4 but it was not my thought. Apart from that this move weakens his kingside.  But still, his king is in the center and can go both sides.
I played this move to open up the c file. In case his king decides to go queenside, this might be a problem.
Here I think my opponent did an inaccuracy. I could simply exchange on d4 and maybe later play  b3 and somehow Bb2 followed by Rc1. That would be devastating. Bishop would be too strong on diagonal and Rook on c1 would be extremely well placed. But i didnt bother thinking about that strategy, it is the bad side of playing 5 min chess on the net. So i followed the previous strategy: play c4 followed by e5, then his knight has no good squares and my knight has e4.
Here I paused a bit, realizing my previous plan does not work that easy. in case of Ng3 he would play f5 and e4 would be mere a dream for me and the position is very unclear. So i played Qg3 somehow forcing my opponent to play g6 and weakening dark squares there...
I wanted to play my Knight g1,f3,g5 and e4 if i can so i moved my king out. Kh1 would be a better choice, i could not decide in the game.
I achieved my aim in the end. My opponent cannot play f6 or f5 cause of my queen on g3, threatening Qxg6+.
Now he can play f5 but it is white to play.
24 - f5. I dont allow him to play f5. besides that this move opens the diagonal for Bishop on c1. whites attack is already too strong.
Here Qf4 would finish the game. Cause after gxf5 white has Nf6 followed by Qh6 black cannot avoid mate. I played an automatic move despite having around 1 hour on the clock.
Still, white has a strong attack after Bh6+ followed by Qf4. In this moment i saw the previous move would finish the game and i regretted it. Here I calculated Bh6 but had a funny lil mistake on calculation and played a bad move.
0-1   I tried hard but paid the bill caused by playing extremely fast. This was a good lesson for me. Hope I will learn to play in a tournament.
Anderssen, after La Bourdonnais and Staunton, was one of the pioneers of the Sicilian Defense
(?) More than one hundred years would go by in order to show that after 7...Nf6 8.Bg5 Be6 Black has nothing to worry about, ex: 9.N1c3 a6 10.Bxf6 gxf6 11.Na3 d5! etc. (Fischer-Perosian, Buenos Aires 1st match-game 1971). However, Anderssen with his aggressive style wanted to haste a crisis in the center: previously such methods had always worked for him. But he has never had to face an opponent of Morphy's level until now...
(!) Morphy sensed that chess logic was on his side and he found an immediate refutation to Black's premature activity on the kingside.
(?!) 11.Nxa8 was probably stronger, ex: 11...exf2+ 12.Kxf2 Qh4+ 13.g3 Qxe4 14.Bg2. But Morphy did not want to divert his sights from the enemy king, and this presumptuousness allowed some counter-chances...
(!) Bad is 13...ke7 14.Nfd5+ Kd7 15.Qf7+ Be7 (15...Kc6 16.Nb4+) 16.fxe3 Rf8 (or a6...Nxc2+ 17.Kd2) 17.exd4 Rxf7 18.Bb5#. It is doubtful whether Anderssen worked out all the consequences of 13...Kg6, but his combinative feeling did not let him down: 14.Qh5+ Kxf6 15.Ne8+ (Maroczy suggested 15.fxe3, as in the game, but here after 15...Qxc7 16.Rf1+ Nf5 it comes to nothing) 15...Qxe8 16.Qxe8 Nxc2+ (16...d5 17.0-0-0!) 17.Kf1 e2+! (17...Nxa1 18.g4!) 18.Bxe2 Nxa1 19.g4! and Black, despite the favorable material balance, is helpless against the new wave of the attack.
The critical moment of the battle.
(?) "An oversight! Black thought that after 15.Qh5+ Kxf6 16.Qf7+ (now 16.Ne8+? is not possible in view of 16...Qxe8 17.Qxe8 Bb4+ -- Kasparov) 16...Kg5 he would be able to save his king, but he overlooked 16.fxe3! with a decisive attack on the f-file. The game was played very quickly, otherwise Anderssen would undoubtedly have noticed this simple move" writes Maroczy. "It was possible to avoid the immediate danger by 14...Qxd5 15.Nfxd5+ Nxf3+ 16.gxf3 exf2+ 17.Kxf2 Bc5+ 18.Ke2 Rb8 when Black, with two bishops against two knights, does not stand badly." But in Kasparov's opinion, Black is simply a pawn down, and after 19.b4 Bf8 (19...Bd6 20.Nb5) 20.Rhd1 (or 20.c4 immediately) 20...bd7 21.c4 Black has a technically lost endgame.<n>White could have been caused more problems by Zukertort's suggestion of 14...Ke7:<n>1) 15.Ng8+?!

(!) Perhaps Anderssen was hoping that his young opponent would lose his way in the mass of tactical complications, but Morphy maintained a clear head. It turns out that the King's Gambit is not the only opening where the enemy king can be finished off on the open f-file...
Black resigned in view of the continuation 17...Nxa1 18.Rf1+ Ke7 19.Qxe5+ Kd7 20.Be6+ Kc6 21.Rc1+ Kb6 22.Qb5#<n>1-0<n>An impressive defeat of the champion of the Old World! This game lasted all of half an hour. After gaining revenge on the 77th move in the very next game, Anderssen joked gloomily: "Morphy wins in 17 moves, whereas it takes me 77. However, this is still bearable..." By winning the 11th game, Morphy won the match (+7 -2 =2), and thus in just one year he had clearly demonstrated that he had no equal in the world.<n>"Morphy possesses the secret of invincibility," the newspapers enthused. The loser of the match, although shocked, also worthily assessed his opponent's immense triumph, publicly declaring that Morphy played much more strongly and solidly than La Bourdonnais, and admitting: "It is useless fighting against this man; for me he is too strong. He is accurate and faultless, like a machine, whereas I am only a mere mortal..." Later, Anderssen shared a very important observation: "Morphy treats chess with the seriousness and conscientiousness of an artist...For him a game of chess is a sacred duty..."<n>Before Morphy left Paris, a splendid farewell banquet was held in his honor.

The oldest and most tried plan, the Rook on h1 will be transferred on the third rank (Rh3) where it will be capable of defending laterally White queen-side castle while attacking Black's king-side. Others moves have been tried, and notably two of them are less direct and more poisonous by defusing first Black's attack on the queen-side : 11.Qf2 (Kramnik) and 11.Nb3 (Nijboer, Anand)
This exchange is forced if Black wants to push his b pawn as quickly as possible
A new move. Here Kasparov took Pawn b4 and Short Pawn e5, on the complicated position that ensued Kasparov crushed Short. Later it has been proven by GM Brynnel on many occasions that Short's move was perfectly playable and that white has to take the draw before getting into trouble.
This move is an error it blocks my pieces on the queen-side, as I will need a lot of time to develop my Bishop by Bb7-c6-b5. Much smarter were 16...a5, 16...Qc7 keeping the tension or the safe and sensible 16...fxe5 17.fxe5 a5 with a very slight plus for Black as he will have better control of the position through the pawn target on e5. Note that the Queen is great on d8 as it is eyeing the weak h5 pawn as soon as White try to move the h3 Rook.
There begins the long Bishop's journey to b5...
Apparently closing the gates for a future White attack, but in fact it is a false impression.
This move came as a relief for me. Had White continued his idea initiated by his last move and played 22.g4! he would have possessed all the trumps for a raging attack on my King.
Now it is a question of time. The arrival of a Knight on e4 will spell an end to any Advantage for White in the Classical French.
White was in a difficult situation, with a pawn less and no more concrete threats on my King. But here the Queen is going to far...
I just saw that my Queen will take on a2, and then my Rook will check the King on c8 and that the White King will have to defend against a Queen, a Rook, a Bishop and 2 passed pawns. Also the Rooks are laying not protected on the back of White's camp.
Perhaps not the best move but the position was not defensible.
Loses at least one more piece, so White resigned. I was quite lucky to win this. Has my opponent followed up 21.Rg1! with 22.g4, I will have had all the trouble in this game. As the Sicilian, the French is a strategical and sexy defence where one misstep can spell quickly the end for one of both sides.
Black captured the pawn at c3 with his d4 pawn.
Black develops his DB to b4 and is attacking white's knight at c3.  White is still going to have a fight to maintain his monopoly on the centre.
White moves his DB to d2 to avoid using his pawn if the knight is captured.
Now black moves his queen to f6 and attacks the knight again.
White decides to get right to it and also brings out his queen to avoid the queen hitting the square f2 which could also have been a target if black was interested in sacrificing his queen.
Black moves his queen to d6 and is now attacking the DB at c2 which is protecting the knight.
White brings out his LB to d3 with the queen protecting it.
Black moves his pawn to a6 which protects the square b5 in case white's knight tries to extricate itself from c3.
White decides the pawn can be used in the case of the capture of the knight at c3 and now moves his DB to f4 and is attacking the queen at d6.
White now develops his final piece to e2 and the king can now castle short or long but I think short may be preferable with the threat of the queen and bishop on the queenside.
Now black decides to capture the knight at c3 with the DB.
White recaptures with the pawn as the knight gives this pawn protection and it leaves the knight covering the DB at f4 too.  Now the pawn is attacking the queen at d4.
Black moves the queen to b6.
White moves his DB to e3 to provide protection to f2.
Black's queen now comes to b2.
White castles and the rooks are brought together so the black queen cannot capture anything on the squares adjacent as they are all protected.  The only piece that was unprotected before was the rook at a1 but this is also now protected.
Black queen now moves to a3 and is purely an object for white to attack should the opportunity arise.  I would think black would perhaps now try to develop and make his plan of attack on the white king.  However I think white's king is pretty well protected at present.  Whilst the black king is left in the middle with a weak square in front of him which perhaps black would like white to attack but white is no rush.
White wants to remove the black queen so moves the DB to c1 attacking the queen at a3.
Finally the black queen gets the message and retreats to e7 but not sure for how long.
White pushes a pawn to a4 which does not allow the queen to return to the a file as all the squares are protected.
Black develops his knight to f6.
White moves his knight to f4 attacking squares e6 and g6 which may be more relevant to creating an attack than other squares.
Black pushes a pawn to d6.
White moves his DB to a3 onto the diagonal to f8 with the black queen at e7.
Black's wandering queen is on the prowl again as now comes to e5.
White moves his DB to b2 to protect the pawn at c3.
Black now develops his final piece with knight to d7 protecting his other knight at f6.
Black pushes his pawn at g7 to g5 and is attacking white's knight at f4.  Black is leaving his king wide open now and g7 could be used by white as it is a weak square.
White moves his knight to g2 hoping to give cover to squares around the king while sheltered within the pawns protecting the king.
Black moves his d knight to c5 and is attacking the LB at d3.
White moves his queen to d2 as the pawn at e4 is under attack by the 2 knights.  Now the rook at e1 is protecting the pawn and the LB at d3.
Black brings his 'a' rook to e8 making a battery on the e file with the queen at e5.
White provides more protection to the pawn at e4 with pawn to f3.  This is also attacking the LB at g4.
Black captures the pawn at f3 with the LB as it did not have any protection and now the knight at g2 is under attack.
Black pushes his pawn to g4 giving protection to the LB at f3.
White moves his knight to f4 creating a barrier between the queen and the g3 pawn, the pawn is protecting the knight so cannot be taken without loss.
Black now attacks the knight at f4 with knight to e6.  It could also be a redirection of his knight.
White pushes a pawn to c4 allowing the DB to attack the queen on e5.
Black moves his 'e' knight to g5.
Black recaptures the DB with the rook at e8.
White moves his knight to d3 and is attacking the rook at e5.
Black moves his knight to e4 and is now attacking the white queen at d2.  This will mean that white will have to leave the rook for now as the queen will need to be removed from the knight's clutches.
White moves the queen to b4 where the queen can still support the rook at e1 and the pawns at a4 and c4. The queen is in position to take the pawn at b7 if it is not moved.
Black moves pawn to b6.
Black left the rook at e5 en prise in order to move the pawn so white quickly captured this.
Black's knight was recaptured by the pawn at d6.  Black has opened the d file with this capture.
With the LB at f3 and the knight at e4 it was difficult to move the a1 rook to the open file from the 1st or 2nd rows so white moved the rook to a3 with the intention of moving it to d3 without any hindrance from the black pieces.
Black moved his king to g7 perhaps to give his rook a chance to move across and come down the 'h' file.
Black moved his knight over to c5  looking to attack the pawn at a4.  Since the white queen was on b2 diagonal to h8 and the black king was now at g7.  The knight at f6 would be pinned once the pawn was captured.
White wanted to remove the LB from the square f3 and decided to offer an exchange protected by the queen and the rook at e1.
Black did not want to exchange and moved his LB to c6 to join the knight at c5.
White captured the pawn at e5 with the queen and now the knight was pinned to the king.
Now black brought his knight to d7 and was attacking the queen at e5.
White moved the queen down to f4 as white was not ready to check the king as there was not much support on hand to assist.
Black returned his knight to c5.
White moved his rook to e3 taking over the 'e' file but black's plan may be to block the e4 square with the 'c' knight which would join the knights up and it would be hard to remove the e4 knight without loss of material.
White was not to be outdone and also captured a pawn at g4 with the LB.
Black recaptured the LB with his knight at f6 but white can check the king with the capture of this knight.
White did not capture the knight but did still check the king on g5 and once the king has moved can capture the knight quite safely.
Black's king moves to h8 and any plans of the rook moving over to the 'h' file are ended.
Black pushes his pawn to a5 and he has a pawn chain from c7 to a5.  In total black has 5 pawns but the king's pawns are useless as they are not joined since the g pawn has now been captured.  White only has 3 pawns and one of these is an isolated pawn at c4.  The other 2 pawns are in front of the king still.
White now moves his rook up to e7 and has a pawn at c7 he could capture whilst the pawn at f7 is protected by the rook at f8.
Black moves his LB to c6 and is on the diagonal to the h1 square.
White moves the queen to d4 and is taking control of 2 files, d and e.  With this move it also checks the king at h8.
Black moves his king over to g8.
Black moves his LB to e8 with white's rook at e1.
White moves his queen to f6 keeping the f7 pawn on its square. With the LB at d8 this also keeps the rook at f8.
Black moves his knight to d6 and I expect this will be a sac for white here.
White sacs the d1 rook and captures the knight at e6.
Black now pushes his a pawn to a4.
White continues with the move Rxe8 which will mean the rook needs to recapture as the king is unable to move with the queen at f6.
I play the passive looking e3, opening the diagonal for the Bishop and preparing f4.
This wasn't according to plan.  White hoped for e6 or d5.  But the Stonewall plan against cd is ed! opening the diagonal for the Bishop.
Black returns the initiative to White.  Perhaps better was Nc3.  White likes to see a pawn on the e6 square because it blocks the c8 Bishop, which often frustrates plans by developing to g4.
White's setup is according to plan.  The order was changed, and Black looks a little awkward now with the c5 pawn.  White wants to continue f4, Nf3 and 0-0.
Now this pawn thrust is a waste of time.  Black forces the Bishop to a square it wanted to go to.
Now Black can't play NxN because of the pawn fork.  And an exchange on e5 will open the f-file.
White prepares the advance of the e pawn.  In some instances, White will defend e5 by playing the d2 N to f3.  In others, White plays a "rook lift" (Rf3-h3).
Black will often try f7-f5, a counter Stonewall.  Black's pieces are clustered on the Q-side whereas Whites target the poorly defended King.  Black's latest move removed a key defender from the K side.
This opens the dark Bishop's diagonal, with the two Bishops raking the K side.  White doesn't give Black time to play f5.
Black forces the "bone in his throat" to move.  (This phrase more properly applies to a N on the 6th rank.)
Brings force to bear on the vital region.
A haste retreat, to an unfavorable square.  White's next moves reduce Black's defenses, and game time.  The as yet unmoved Bishop on c1 will be exchanged for the developed Bishop on e7, and the White Knight assumes a threatening post.
Everything is as before except the dark Bishops are gone and the Knight has advanced to a very threatening spot.  The f7 square is in bad shape, and h7 is doubly attacked.
Black chooses to blunt the attack on h7.  This may not have been critical at this time.  Better would have ben Re7.
White brings over his last undeveloped piece to join the party.
[Oh yeah... this is an idea borrowed from Joanne/jstevens1, but if you want to follow GK analysis of this game, here's the link; http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14707612&rnd=0.3184220970356586 - As a bonus, I'll throw in the second game I had with starforce49, which I lost; http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14707613&fb=1&rnd=0.3867511537905609]
Philador's Defence - not one I really like to go up against as White (personal preference) but then again, I do know that the infamous Legal's Mate can also arise from this position. With this in mind, my next developing  moves were obvious to me
! an open board favours the more developed side in the opening, so I had no qualms with this move!
Black decides to exchange... though I don't think this was the right move to play - Black is still behind in development! Nf6, Be7 or Bg4 would have been better.
Meanwhile, White is able to develop another piece off the back rank, and has no fear of being chased away by the knight because of Black's own pawn on c6.
?! Black develops his own queen, though to a strange square. I still like Nf6 or Bg4 for Black.
I develop my last minor piece... and already has ideas for an attack. My last move was a big clue, but can you guess where the attack will come?
This must have been the intention behind Black's last move...
! Already, Black's in trouble - with all the pressure on the weak d6 pawn, something's got to give! Black's only option is to give up the pawn, because it cannot be defended no matter how hard Black tries!
?! Trading pieces in view of a powerful attack is understandable, but I'm not so sure about this move. After White recaptures with his queen, there would be two Black pieces defending d6, and two White pieces attacking it... but since Black's first defender is the queen, that fact doesn't matter. Furthermore, it allows me to keep my queen, which could be useful for an attack on the exposed king.
!? Of course... well, it seemed obvious at the time. The GK analysis machine prefers the rook capture, which would allow Rhd1 next move, and I did consider that, but I chose this move due to the tempo attack on the queen
Black wants to exchange queens... Normally, I would avoid an exchange like that, but here I saw that the exchange could actually benefit me... and not just the queen exchange!
With those two exchanges, White has now established a rook on the seventh rank and enjoys a positional, as well as a material advantage. Needless to say, I was feeling optimistic at this point
The best move in this position - not only does it defend the b7 pawn, it also chases away the rook!
Forced if White wants to keep his influence on the seventh rank...
...and now that the b7 pawn has fallen, the pawn on c6 is also up for grabs! However, Ng6+ is still threatened!
yum-yum! :) But White isn't full yet - he's had the main course, and now eyes the a7 pawn for dessert - there is nothing that Black can do to save it! (17...g5 18.Rxh7 Nxh7 19.Nb5)
Interesting... usually, it is advisable for the losing side to not exchange pieces like this, but I guess that Black just wanted to get rid of the menace that was the seventh-rank rook!
Black manages to get back a pawn...
A discovered attack on my knight...
! A knight fork on my rook and pawn, and White loses a point in material no matter what he does (28.Rf6+ Kg7 doesn't work) Once the rook moves, Black snatches the b5 pawn, disconnecting my two remaining queenside pawns. Despite still having a sizeable advantage, I started to get nervous, mainly because I would hate to lose a game with +4 in material and tripled passed pawns!
!? I was going to lose a point anyway, so I do it on my own terms! I chose to lose a rook for a knight and pawn instead of just losing a pawn in order to keep my queenside pawns intact, but it'd be interesting to hear what readers think of this move... comments are welcome :)
The best move - the king will be needed to halt the flow of the queenside pawns!
I was hoping that Black might try 30...Rg7, where I could set up a trap with 31.b6 [if Black takes the knight,  the b-pawn will promote] This move proves useful to Black later on
? Logical, it seemed to me, but the GK database labels this a 'mistake.' My advantage goes from a +5 to a +2... ouch! 33.f4 was preferred here, which prevents Black's next move...
White wishes to avoid any similar forks in the future - Black's rook will have no reason to check White's king
? Black realises that too, but ironically, him trying to attack them has just pushed up White's advantage once again! The right move was 36...Rf6! - the knight must retreat, meaning it can't help with the queenside pawn's advancement. Meanwhile, the Black king can hold off the passed pawns, while Black's rook starts attacking the pawns kingside
...the Black king could take the pawn on b6! here, Kxb6+ falls to the fork Nc4+, which Ra2+ would have prevented. Of course, the a7 pawn would have fallen as well, along with my self-esteem! Now White wins...
Quite a few other people may have resigned at this point, but Black is willing to fight on! Still, I would have played Rd5+, followed by Rc5+, and once the king reaches the rook [Obviously White doesn't want to draw] it would go to d2 or c2 where it attacks the kingside pawns.
Now that White has an easy win, the question is; how best to do this? White still has a pawn and rook which could prove to make things difficult for White, but thanks to my three remaining pawns I can take care of both of these pieces easily...
First, White gives up his knight to take the pawn...
Although I've never encountered a 'Rook vs Queen' endgame, it is my understanding that it's a difficult one to win, especially when the king and rook are close together like this. However, like I've already mentioned my three pawns means that I don't have to deal with this...
! And now Black has no hope - his king will not be able to stop my new set of three connected passed pawns!
Black resigns before 15. ...Kh7  16. Qh5#
I will get rid of his bishop, by switching it with my knight
I will give him my pawn, but i need to take his bishop
and no more attack at my King :)
now , 3 moves to the end
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is my return game with Coach Ion as black in the King's Indian 4 Pawns Attack.  In this game I achieved only my second High Draw against him.  Between the two draws I have had some really bad games, including the King's Indian 4 Pawns Attack as White in which I blundered a piece after walking into a pin and never recovered.  Also, that game Pipped at the Post was only a pretence of a contest, although Ion got his checkmate in first I was never really in that game.  Then there was this shocker - I think Be6 was the loser - I followed the database and I think that that move should be given the skull and crossbones http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13392792&fb=1&rnd=0.7322375019235583 - do you the Jury agree on that one?  Anyhow, I will take you to move 6 in this game ......
12. fxe5 - now only 2 pawns are left after the breach in the wall.
13. ..... Ne5 - handy how my horsie can jump on a good square where he does not have to worry about pawn molestation!
15. .... Nbd7 - out comes my other knight, to support my king knight and to clear the decks on that back row!
18. ...... Qf8 - a lot has been going on over the last few moves, one pair of minor pieces has been traded and I now offer a queen trade.  Ion chooses to put his bishop in the way.
22. Rxf3 - the queens have been traded off and now I must take Ion's bishop to avoid remaining a piece down.
23. ..... Rf8 - the knight on e5 is temporarily protected by the rook on f8.  Ion is more than welcome to take the knight because if he does he will lose his king!
25. d6 - that passer advances, only my steed stands between the pawn on d6 and promotion.  Thankfully that is as far as that pawn ever gets.  I did think Ion would play Re7 but then I can play Rf7 because Henry can recapture towards the passed pawn and if I get checked on the back rank back goes my rook.
27. Re2 - Ion eschews the trade because he does not want Henry to consume a p(r)awn cracker for his supper (that p(r)awn on d6 is particularly juicy - truly fit for a king!)
34. ...... Kg7 - now Henry must enter the fray!
37. Ng5 - I anticipated this move but never mind my rook can go to f6 and if Ion puts his knight back on e4 then I can always put my rook back on f7 and do this dance again!
38. ..... Kh6 - Henry bravely steps onto the h column to put the question to Ion's horsie which shies off to e4.
39. ..... Rf8 - rather a passive square but I am thinking about protecting the back row just in case my knight is compelled to move away from d7.
40. ...... Re8 - Ion's last rook move to d5 has permitted my own rook to move off the f file for now thanks to my pawn on g6.  I now decide to pin that pesky knight.
42. ...... Rf8 - back goes my rook onto the f column to avoid letting Ion take control of the f column.  Should Ion put his rook on the h column, my rook is also gonna go there.
43. ..... Rf5 - my rook assumes a relatively active position and attacks Ion's isolani on g5.  It feels good when I can combine attack with defense.
44. Rd5! - Ion knows just how much I lurve exchanges.  Luckily I smell a rat.  If Rxd5 then 45. Nxd5 Kf7, 46. Kd5 Ke6 and now 47. Nf4+.  Either Henry must defend the pawn on g6 allowing Ion's king to make a decisive penetration on my queenside or I must take the d6 pawn and allow a passer on the g column.  Either way I will be letting Ion's king become a bull in a china shop on my queenside.  So, I play the seemingly passive Rf8 and hold out the olive branch.  I half expected a refusal given the rating differential and the fact that I have played badly against him in the matches between the two draws against him.  Ion did not refuse and so at least I only had to wait five matches before getting my second draw against him - the first one took 14 games to achieve so maybe some encouraging signs are just around the corner as I strive to regain my Class A status.  Well, I will worry about that later and toast the here and the now!
O-O, with the plan to attack against the enemy castle (a bit risky, since white has his pawns advanced in this side)
After the changes, black begins his attack, since the open centre gives his bishops great power.<n><n>However, black didn't notice the pawn is lost...
... Exchanging Queens might not seem the best idea (since it reduces his attack capabilities)
Perhaps better was Nxb5, with more threats, although the bishop move develops one more piece, and doesn't open the space for the black bishops...
Black sees that he can take his pawn back, by exchanging one bishop for the knight... Loses the advantage of the 2 bishops, but material is even again, and black has perhaps a bit better pawn structure
Trying to get the king in the game?
Trying to stop it
white seems to have an advantage in the one side, although most of his  pieces are not there. Black has clearly more power in the other, but his pawns are not at all advanced,
Each one tries to attack in his strong side
Rejects, so that the he keeps the pawn advantage in the side, although this adds pressure to f7, and generally the black king's side.
Advancing with tempo
Unforking f7, cause it may be needed soon. Black king gets a bit more active
Rook is on the 7nth line, more pressure for the black.
reducing the pressure on the black king side
Threatens the bishop, and g6. If 33 ... B38, then it is Bxd5
Prefers to exchange the side pawns, so there is no more danger from this side (he has an advantage on the other, even after d5 is gone)
Trying to get the king into the game, and also avoid any rook threats
Offers bishop exchange
White tries to check and then get an unguarded piece are correctly defended. Rooks exchange inevitable, if white decides so.
White decides to avoid a draw and go for the win.
Because of the trapped dark bishop, I start anticipating a transposition to the dragon formation.  I always look forward to playing against the dragon.
Losing tempo by replacing my knight on the same square.  In other variations, Nb3 is common.  I don't know which is better.    I don't want to trade knights and give black a stronger center though.
Very aggresive, attempting to remove my center pawn and opening the f file for the rook.  It weakens the e8-h5 diagonal, but with my bishop and knight positioned as they are, I don't see a way to take advantage of it.
I decide against exf5, since that would develop his bishop, further strengthening black's center.
Pinning the knight to counter the attack on my e pawn.
Breaking the pin, allowing black to castle.
Defending the pawn.
Castling queenside since I plan on pawnstorming black's king.  Looking at Bxf6 Bxf6, Qxd5 winning a pawn and at the weak a2-g8 diagonal.
Bunder, overlooking Nxf6  and hanging the bishop.
12...Rxg6 is probably better, leading to something like 13. Qd2 Rf7 14. Bxe7 Qxe7 15. Qxd6 Rd8 16. Qxe7 Rxd1  17. Rxd1 Rxe7, leaving black a pawn down and an isolated e pawn.
Pinning the rook, preventing it from causing any further havok.
I had originally planned on Rf7, trapping the king on the back rank, but couldn't find a good continuation.  I decided to take black's kingside pawns and start pushing mine.
More than happy to trade rooks.
A final mistake, allowing me to fork the king and rook.  I almost passed this up to push the h pawn again, but decided I didn't want to deal with the eventual trade on h8.
So of course I am not familiar with this opening. I sank into thoughts (which no-one notices on gameknot). I was wondering about 3.dxe5,dxc4 4.Qd8:,Kd8: and expected to have a small plus. However, after for example 5.e4,Nc6 6.f4 (or Nf3),Nb4 I wasn't able to find my plus anymore. It seemed that black was ok because he wins a tempo on my e5-pawn or something. And besides that, 3...,dxc4 isn't even forced. So an alternative.
This was the first moment of happiness in this game for me. I didn't believe that black should place his bishop on this rather inactive square to win the pawn. In fact, I was a little bit happy to sacrifice it.
At least some active play, and it's hard to move the e6-bishop because of the c4-pawn. However, I didn't like my isolani on the d-file.
Threatening b5. I have a choice now to continue the position with a pawn down and activate my pieces (Rac1, Rfd1, b3 and Ne4) or try to regain the pawn immediately with Ne4. I think I made the wrong choice.
Judging the finish of the game, it might have been better to exchange the light-squared bishops.
I'd love to play d5, but always got into Ne5 which seemed to ruin the last of my defence
This is my rematch game with Joanne Stevens in the Mason Opening theme tournament.  In my white game, I won in a pawn-up endgame after a fairly long positional struggle in 40-something moves.  Here with black, I won a nice little miniature where the game sharpened early and white got fatally mauled in rather short order.
Standard moves.  Because the early development of the QB in this system weakens the dark squares at home somewhat, ...Qb6 remains a thematic black move to challenge them (as well in similar opening lines of the d4/c4 complex).  Usually white replies with Qb3 and an early queen-trade ensues.  Not to Nosferatu's taste.  Too vegetarian.
The trendy way to play the London System these days seems to delay the development of the KN as long as sensibly possible, so long as the e5 square is adequately covered.
!? In my first black game in this tournament, I played 5. ...e6, the boilerplate semi-Tarrasch setup to the London recommended in many sources.  Though I eventually won that game, coaxed by errors on my opponent's part, I struggled to concoct the type of counterplay and double-edged positions I usually thrive in.
With this move, I am essentially offering a gambit in the form of my c-pawn, since after dxc5 white can hold onto the pawn, i.e. 7. dc Nd7 8. Nb3 a5 (for instance) 9. a4.  This was a conscious decision on my part, because by snatching the pawn, white would give me counterplay in the center, following a space-gaining ...e5 and increased scope of my KB along the h8-a1 diagonal.
I figured I had nothing to gain by delaying this capture, which was the entire goal of ...Nh5, so it was best to proceed with it.
Black wins the two bishops, white has her extra pawn and half-open h-file, however the question is posed of where her king shall go, since castling kingside negates the later imbalance, castling queenside may prove hazardous as my fianchettoed bishops points yonder that direction, and remaining in the center...well, I'll let the game speak for itself.
!? The most active and congruent follow-up.  I do give white juicy hole on d6 that I'm sure she'd love to plant a knight on, however, as the old saw goes: "One must give up squares to gain squares."  I knew that white would most likely strike back in the center with a corresponding e4 whether I played ...e5 or not so I had to play actively.  I was looking at some sample variations at this point and decided that even if she did get to play Nd6, I have resources and counterplay available, and it wouldn't necessarily be the death of me.
10. ...O-O was also possible, maintaining tension in the center.  Now here is a sample variation: 11. Nc4 O-O 12. Nd6 dc 13. bc Qa5, with a very double-edged game.  Joanne elects an alternate course.
! And I permit it, with my blessing.  I didn't think I could take time-out to play the limp 12. ...Bd7 to prevent the weakening of my pawns, when after 13. Nc4 white is standing very well.  Again, since I'm already down material, I must continue to play actively to justify the pawn sacrifice and attempt to wrest the intiative in this position.  12. ...O-O breaks the pin, brings my KR into play, and whisks my king to safety.  Yes, safety, on white's same half-open h-file.  It seems paradoxical, but black's king is much safer here than in the center, because white doesn't have the piece coordination to exploit an attack along the h-file.
?! To be honest, I didn't think this was a good practical decision by white.  At least, I personally would have been adverse to it.  I could see white's thinking; up material, continue to hack wood and simplify, splatter black's remaining queenside pawns, mop up the positional trumps and eventually win.  Of course, chess is often not this simple.  By getting rid of her other bishop, black's two bishops become that much more emphatic in a fluid, semi-open position such as this, and I do gain a nice open b-file for my QR to exert pressure upon.
...which is this move.  Now white's king is marooned in the center, a very precarious place to be, in my opinion.  My bishops are very actively posted on long diagonals, exerting influence on many squares.  I wanted to play ...a5 first because the rook-pawn would be much more useful in front of the bishop than behind it, and I figured I could reasonably predict 15. a3, so I could afford the tempo expended.
Evacuating the QR off the loose h8-a1 diagonal, and covering the c4 square for a potential Nc4, to siphon off my LSB's access.
Continuing to play actively and improve the position of my pieces.  Now the e-pawn will hang if white plays 17. Nc4, and more importantly, the very strong 18. ...f5 is threatened, wrenching open the center route to the enemy king.  I had considered the immediate 17. ...f5, but saw after 18. Qb3ch Kh8 19. e5! Re8 20. Nc4 Bxc4 21. Qxc4 Bxe5 (21. ...f6 22. O-O fe 23. Nd6 is annoying to meet) 22. O-O, I regain my pawn, but white weasels away and I don't even have my two bishops anymore for comfort. With 16. ...Re8 I keep the pressure.  I believe black already has a sizable advantage here.
The best move, preventing ...f5 for the time being and actively posting the queen on the g8-a2 diagonal.
!? A cagey, queer-looking waiting move, but quite strong.  For one thing, it covers the f7 pawn, so it doesn't hang after a subsequent ...Kh8.  In some variations I also envisioned it swinging over and doubling up on the e-file.  Again, improving the placement of my pieces while forcing white to make accurate replies in a bad defensive position.
? If you have to play moves like 18. Ng1, punishment is very likely, and likely swift.  I could see white's thinking; free up the f-pawn of defensive maneuvers (18. ...Qg5 19. f4; 18. ...Kh8 19. f4 f5 20. e5, locking up the Lincoln Tunnel), and maybe redevelop it on e2 in some cases.  However, it's very slow, and dangerous as it's essentially an "undevelopment" move in a razor-sharp position.
! A second pawn sacrifice, entirely justified to increase my time-based initiative.  I intend to deflect the queen off the g8-a2 diagonal so I can play ...f5 immediately, or 19. Qa2 play 19. ...Qg5, threatening 20. ...Rxe4!, and white cannot play 20. f4 as in the previous position because the white queen no longer covers g3.
? An ugly capitulation to make.  White had to bite the bullet with 20. Qxc3 fe 21. b5!? for any hope of counterplay in this position, taking advantage of the pawn phalanx on her queenside.
?! Covers g3 with tempo, however now black's attack now soldiers on without any real white counters to worry about.
! Crashing through, taking advantage of the knight pin against the c1 rook.  White must play 24. Kd1 (24. Nxe4 Qxc1ch 25. Kf2 (25. Qd1 Qe3ch and mates next move) Qxh1, picking up the other rook), when 24. ...Qg4ch 25. Kc2 (25. Qf3 Be2ch!; 25. Nf3 Re3, with ...Rxf3 to follow) Re2 white is placed in a tortuous bind and her position will eventually collapse. An instructure miniature about the dangers of giving your opponent too many tactical possibilities in exchange for static positional advantages, especially if the position is anything but static! Thanks to Joanne for the game and annotation privileges.
Looking for a change but I decide pressure to King because it has no space
Black Bishop feels the hit
Clearly advantage for Black. Note that lonely Bishop has not move, never since he get there
White can´t find a hole and liberates king, the persecution begins. Lonely Bishop stills
Tower comes to help. If King escape loses his Queen, if Queen sacrifice, black crowns and it over, so???
Paun crowns and two queens blasted the Black King
Threatening to open the f-file and attacking the f7 weakness
Black has won the exchange plus 2 pawns.
The only move to avoid losing the Queen. Now, if Na3, then simply ... Qxc3.
If Kf2, then ... Rxh2+, which wins the rook on f1 after Kf3 ... Qxf1+
Pushing 4 pawns is always aggressive. It is laying a claim on the center. It does not guarantee an advantage, it merely attacks the center. One point of blitz is to pressure your opponent so he must take time to defend and then run into time trouble.
One can already feel the buildup of the center. At this point I'd say neither side has a true advantage except in the preference of your playing style. Black needs to be careful to not be pushed off the board as well as to consolidate his development. White needs to not over-extend. White needs to pressure with his lead in development otherwise black will become solid in defense
This opens the game up but exposes black to attack. In my opinion it would have been better to castle first.
?? A blunder on my part. 15. ... Nxe3 16. Qe2 Nxg2 17. Nxg6 Rg8 18. Qxg2 leaves black up a piece for a pawn. Had he played that I would be in serious trouble and smacking myself for making such an obvious blunder!
And the attack begins
Take the material?? What kind of scrub do you think I am? It's really tempting in blitz to seize material and lose the initiative. This move threatens checkmate and the rook is still not going anywhere. 23. ... Rh7 24. Bf7#. At this point there isn't much to be done for black.
Black's rook and queen are forked. His knight is pinned to his king and his king is in the center of the board awaiting my rooks.
I toyed with continuing the attack through Rfe1 but decided against it as it just did not look as good as taking with my knight.
The attack started with just a knight fork (after my blunder that is) between the king and rook. It basically ended in mate. Not all the moves were forced of course, I mean this is blitz and I'm no chess celebrity, but if I took the rook for the knight my attack would have lost momentum and it may have been a battle to finish the game. This ended the game without any risk of counter-attack. If your opponent has to trade the position to keep himself alive, question yourself before taking any available pieces, there may be something stronger lurking...
I don't really know what "partie de plaisir" means... my opponent, pliko, chose the title.  Anyway, all I've got to say about this game (other than what I said in the title) is this: stick around.  There will be fireworks.<n><n>(?!) Grob's attack, also known as the Spike opening.  A very unusual opening, and I had yet to see it personally.  My guess is that White plans to fianchetto the bishop to at g2, and slash at any pawns I try to put up in the center.
The Queen capture allows me to get a big center with gain of time.
Now the question becomes, what do I use to block the attack?
I chose the pawn for the reason that it could signal the start of a pawn chain that would severely curtail the power of White's bishop on the long diagonal.  5... Bd7 and 5... Nc6 seemed okay too, but I was a bit concerned for the safety of my d-pawn.
My goal was to get this stallion to c5.  Yeah, I know, "knight on the rim...", but I wanted to keep the diagonal open for my light-squared bishop.
Defending the e-pawn.  My idea was to start poking around the kingside, or centralizing the bishop after an exchange between the center pawns.
At the very least I can gain a lead in development and tempo.  White's bishop has to retreat, and his queen is prone to a discovered attack.
So I decided instead to add to my lead in development.  I can always play f4 later if the opportunity arises.
(?!) Blocks the diagonal, but White is also restricting his queenside development... his dark-squared bishop can only go to d2, which would only give his knight the unappealing Na3.  And if the knight goes to d2, the poor bishop (not to mention the rook) is hemmed in.  Furthermore, with the bishop fianchettoed, the d3 square is looking awfully weak.
Time to get the knight off the rim.  Nd3  looks very appealing, but probably won't be possible after 12. Qc2.
Not 12. Qd1, which would force a queen exchange and give me a wide-open d-file to play with.
(!?) It was with this move that I started to see the inkling of an initiative on White's kingside pawn formation.  There are a couple threats: I can win back my lost pawn with Nxh2 or Rxh2 (though I suppose I could have done that a move earlier), or I can seriously menace his majesty with Qh4.  (Edit: as Ion said, Qc7 is probably more solid.)
(!) A consolidation move-- I guess I deserve a ! for this.   It should prevent any disrupting attacks on my king, and it's got the added bonus of bringing my queen's rook directly to a VERY useful open file.
White's best course of action is to try and catch up in development as quickly as possible, and/or exchange as many pieces as possible.  d2 is a decent outpost for the knight, as it locks down e4 and controls c4 as well.
In any case, I've got to keep attacking and hope I hit on something before White consolidates himself.  I was hoping that White would respond with 17. Nf3?? (which allows for a beautiful Queen trap after Bf5!), 17. Bf3?? (same thing), or 17. Nf4 (Bxf4 exf4 Qxf4 , with a bunch of open files and a completely exposed king.
A sidestep here (to d1, the only choice) is not so appealing, however, as it concedes the outpost of d3 to my knight.  A piece block at e4 falls to Qg3.  No, there's really only one choice.
There it is.  The upside is that it blocks and attacks my bishop.  The downside is that it deprives White of the opportunity to post a piece on e4.
I wanted to keep the pressure on the diagonal, but keep my kingside rook active.  In hindsight, this turned out to be a very important move.
And there's the break, the butterfly that flaps its wings and causes the storm!  On the surface, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with White's move, but I was playing around with the chess analyzer, and I found a line that seemed almost too good to be true, but I couldn't find a refutation.  Can you spot it?
As White played this move, I realized, to my horror, that there WAS a refutation to the line I had thought of!  It involved a zwischenzug ("in-between" move) that was fairly tricky to spot (a queen check at g4), but it was still there, and it could still be played!  I had to avoid it.
Is it dirty to say that White has choked on my bishop?  Probably.
Three pieces down... and yet, I've got a forced mate on the next move!  I would have loved to see it played out, but I couldn't contain my enthusiasm, and announced the mate.  (Isn't there a way to add moves to an annotation?)  Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this annotation; please feel free to offer your feedback.  And finally, thanks so much to pliko for being my opponent.  I know it's tough to be on the wrong end of games like these, but let me tell you-- I'd trade a couple wins to get a chance to play in a game like this, regardless of the outcome.
trading off a good bishop rather than attempting the attack against my king, simply castling is recommended.
locking down the kingside, I see the coming queenside castle and I'm resisting the opening against my king.
this move looks weak but it actually is part of the plan to release my pieces against Black's king.
if White weren't up in material QxR, BxR, and BxR, BxB compicates and prolongs the struggle, it just isn't possible here.
Black won't even get the consolation of a pawn for his knight sortee.
I was prepared for this move and I was happy to simplify and get a better square for my knight.
a good attempt to open the position for the Black rooks, he's trying hard to gain an advantage.
This move is foolish and is the result of not calculating (laziness). Simpler is b5 trapping the Queen in the corner and freeing my queen to move around and maybe pick up a rook or two.
The onlt saving move but it ruins the mate threats and offers good simplification.
Both sides have completed kingside development almost symmetrically, the only difference is that White has advanced his f4-pawn early, signifying that he wants a space advantage on the kingside. I should look for a plan on the queenside. Here my idea was to place my pawns along the f8-a3 diagonal to strengthen my fianchettoed bishop and undermine White's b2 pawn. But that is a long-term plan, so I need to complete development and prepare to advance those pawns
Here I thought White would play e4 and go for an attack on the kingside, but he delayed it for several moves, and I continued with my maneuvers on the queenside
White also has the option of going into a stonewall setup with e3 and d4 to try and undermine my fianchettoed bishop, but that would make d3 a waste of tempo
Since my plan is to place my pawns along the f8-a3 diagonal, I advance a queenside pawn. I also wanted to maneuver my rook to a6 to take it off the diagonal of the bishop.
A dubious move, because I get a tempo with a4, so White has wasted time with that maneuver. I gain some time advancing my pawns on the queenside, so I get a slight initiative. White has delayed attacking on the kingside, so my attack comes first.
Although I am giving White's knight the c4-square to help fight for an e5-boost, an e5-boost isn't very dangerous for me. If White plays a3 stopping me from completing my pawn chain, then it will take me a lot longer to make progress on the queenside. I will have to complete development with Bd7 and try maneuvering my kingside knight to the queenside with Ne8-c7-b5
If bxa3, then I play bxc3 with a lot of pressure on the dark squares, and I still have the idea of maneuvering my f6 knight to b5.
I don't have to capture e5 immediately, I can slightly weaken the a-file and long diagonal with axb2, threatening to promote
If fxe5 then Ng4 and the e5-pawn is very weak. If White tries defending the pawn with d4, then I start a chain reaction with bxc3 followed by cxd4 where I have more attackers than White has defenders.
During the next sequence of moves, White used his b2-bishop like a pawn to defend the dark squares I weakened, so now I don't seem to have an advantage anymore.
Here I should've played Kf8 instead of attacking White's pawn. My bishop doesn't need to be pinned to my e-pawn, when my bishop pair is one of my few advantages. I had to waste a tempo playing Kf8 and then moving my bishop again
I wanted to defend my e-pawn with my king so that my bishop doesn't have to stay on e6, I can play Bd7 and
White wants to trade bishops to get rid of my bishop pair and go into a simpler ending, I need to get my king in the action and stop the passed pawn.
Exchanging pieces was not good for White. I have better drawing chances now, and because of White's faulty play, I got some hope to maybe win in this ending since I happen to play very well in most endgames.
It is taking me 4 pawns to neutralize 3 pawns on the kingside, so it's like White is up a pawn, which is his passed a-pawn. It seems as if I am successfully containing the pawn, so I was sure that I could draw this, and maybe win if my opponent screws up
This is a blunder. White maybe thought his knight would be better than my bishop because it can attack my light-squared f-pawn, but bishops are almost always better than knights in dynamic endgames like this. but this is probably still drawn, White just severely decreased his winning chances with the rook trade
Here I want to restrict White's knight from coming to g5 or h4. Another good thing about bishops is that they can waste moves and still attack the same diagonal, unlike knights which cannot control the same squares when they move.
After Ke6 I can try to fight for a win, but I wasn't confident that I could win that ending. Instead, I go for a cheapo that isn't easy to see for someone who doesn't calculate thuroughly
After the minor pieces go off the board, I will maneuver my king to capture White's d-pawn, while White captures my h-pawn, and then it will be a pawn race, where White has a drawing move. White's losing plan is to defend his d-pawn with his king, where I can simply waste moves until White is in zugswang and must move his king away from defending his pawn
This position is lost for White because after Qg1  White's king is forced to the h-file since Kf6 loses to Qd4  skewer. After the king moves to the h-file, I have Qh1  skewer forcing a queen trade, then my king just takes f4-pawn and I promote the last pawn and win. If White's king was on g6, then I wouldn't be able to force a queen trade and the ending is drawn. If White's king had moved to g7 then Qa1  forces a queen trade.
White resigned, I win easily after taking White's pawn and White's king is not in a position to interfere with my promotion. If White's king was in front of my pawn, like around f1, then it would be a draw.
with Najdorf, I try to find a way to protect my king first.
and more: i castled, and then saw an opening on our king side.
planning to ocupate the center, now.
and this ends the queen's dance, reforcing the center. May seem silly, but this strong center will save the day
interesting, i did not expect that. But i think fred was trying to push me to draw.
Hi everyone - this was an unrated game between me and one of my buddies who has an optimum rating in the high 1600s.  He played very well until his last move, but that last move was fatal and allowed an incursion of Glenda onto the back rank.  My opponent resigned on the grounds of unavoidable mate in 3.  Please note.  I do NOT mind if my opponents wish to resign rather than be checkmated.  Nice just to get the points.  I decide to kick off with d4.
7.0-0 - after a load of tension in the middle I now castle kingside.
8. ........ Ba5 - after a3 black chooses to retreat his bishop.  Now follows and exchange of pawns.
19. Qb3 - Glenda moves onto the b file putting pressure on b3.  Black prepares to double rooks on the c file and I now challenge the c file.
23. f4 - preparing Bb5 in order to either force a rook swap or break up black's united queenside pawns.
25. ....... Ne4 - the black knight finds an outpost on e4 and breaks a threefold repetition.  If my opponent had a crystal ball I think he would have played into it!
29. ....... Qb6?? - this move allows a fatal incursion of Glenda onto c8.  She moves onto c8 with the greatest of glee.  It is now mate in 3.  My opponent waves the white flag. This leaves the lesson, watch your back rank!
black declines the exchange & brings up queens pawn instead
black responds, uses the opportunity to bring out his bishop - but is a pawn down
black continues to open his pieces out - really wants to castle !
black offers the queen exchange and protects knight to avoid disturbing kings pawn (potentially)
white continues to threaten
this was whites chance to move her queen to safety :O(  horses are not good against the board edge as they cannot command so many squares
black makes his bishop move
black has another one ! chomp
black moves pawn up to build pressure
black links the queen & rook, also freeing up the pawns movement on the c file
This time with the Scandinavian defence. My opponent's trying to bring out the queen into the centre of the board by us trading pawns...
...I can contest the long diagonal, hoping to trade queens to bring my knight out...
My opponent brings out his bishop to attack my knight. There is one way to ensure my pawn structure doesn't get distorted, and that my king doesn't come out his comfort zone...
...and this is it. If my knight does disappear, I can stay ahead on tempo, and my pawn structure stays solid...
...and again this happens. My bishop is now threatening to poison the b7-pawn...
...so I bring up my QNP to threaten the QBP, and so I'm able to fianchetto bishop. I will finish the annotation later...
...and my opponent frees up the remaining bishop to attack my stray pawn...
...so I advance my pawn further to threaten the one on c6...
...and my opponent gains some tempo by unleashing his dark-square bishop...
...I trade it for my bishop, disconnecting the remaining queenside pawns.
Now I advance my queen's pawn to threaten the bishop...
...but my opponent's is clearly threatening a fork on c2 (if the knight moves to b4 the a2- and c2-pawns are in trouble)...
...so I castle queenside to ensure that I don't lose my rook to the knight...
...so I advance my knight to threaten the bishop...
...and exposed my QRP to the rook, so I move my king closer to protect it...
...but the knight is now eyeing up my pawn on f2, hoping to fork my rooks...
...and as the knight moves back, I can bring up a rook onto the third rank, hoping to exchange mine for my opponent's on a8...
...I put my king in the corner to keep him close to the bishop and pawn...
...and I look as though I'm in trouble here. My opponent is threatening my bishop, and now even a rook has come down to help out...
...so I move up the pawn to allow my king more freedom...
...but the pawn is now under attack from the knight and the pawn, and can't capture the latter, as it is keeping the king out of check from the rook...
...so I move my king up to defend the pawn...
...and that's cover with my rook. If the pawn captures on a3, the file will be open, and I'm hoping to do Rxb8 for a rank mate...
...and I use my king to complete the trade of my bishop for my opponent's knight, moving into another double-rook and pawn endgame. If I'd used the rook, my king would have been forced backwards onto his starting rank : 25. Rxb2 Rxa3+ 26. Kb1...
...and as expected I lose my a3-pawn, and my rook cannot recapture as it is keeping the king out of check...
...and we exchange a pair of rooks, and I used my pawn to recapture, so my king stays behind my opponent's pawn to guard the queening square. We now have a single-rook and pawn endgame, and I'm behing by a pawn, but I'm not completely lost...
...and now I line up the isolated pawn on c6 to attempt to get back on terms...
...so I now advance the pawn on b4 to threaten it. I'm still hoping for a possible rank mate...
...but the king moves forward to protect it, another prediction come true...
...so I advance my rook to line up the passed pawn on a3...
...but this move surprised me. I was expecting 31... Ra4! which would have attacked my pawn on b4, forcing 32. Rb3, keeping the rook and b4-pawn in passive positions...
...so I therefore accept the troublesome pawn threatening to advance to my bottom rank, meaning that neither of us has any passed pawns, and it's level pegging once again.
I move my king to cover my pawn on b4, as he is the slower moving of the two bottom rank piece remaining, and he could also defend the one on d4, as there is an enemy pawn on the c-file...
...but now there is only one queenside pawn remaining apiece, as I decide it's worth trading pawns, as my pawn was isolated and weak, and my opponent's was strong, as it was connected.
I move my king onto the c4 square to restrict my opponent's king's movements, and to free my rook, giving it room to manoeuvre across the rank...
...and line up the KNP with it...
...so the rook retreats to cover it...
...and the king moves next to the rook...
...so mine moves to the next file, and I'm hoping to force the enemy rook off the board by checking on e7...
...but my opponent moves the king to the other side of the pawn...
...so I threaten it with my rook. I'm hoping to advance mine to attack it, providing my opponent doesn't move the king away from the rank, as it is keeping the king out of check...
...but the rook moves sideways to defend the pawn...
...and I decide to capture the pawn with my rook, as it is defended by my pawn...
...and my opponent recaptures, giving an even excahnge. Who's king is better placed? We both have three pawns left, on common files: f, g and h (all on the kings' side of the board, where their bishops, knights and rooks start). I thought to myself "restrain the king, so he can't get to your pawns, and try to get yours in a position to threaten the enemy pawns".
So I move my king along the rank, so that if my opponent's king was to threaten my pawns, he would have to move the longer way round...
...and he moves along the rank, too, to deny my king the quick route to threaten the pawns...
...so I move up my bishop's pawn to blockade my opponent's pawn, and to deny the king access to the e5 square, should my own king move left...
...but why did I move mine backwards, when Kc5 would have been more forceful? Maybe I was trying to defend mine, but my opponent's king could not move onto the e5 square...
...and I do likewise to mine, but why did I not play the more forceful Kd5?
...so I do likewise to mine, to stop it.
...and I put him on the attack, to attempt to get in behind the pawns...
...but finally I see this possibility, and my king is now in a position to potentially threaten the pawns...
...and as the king moves backwards, mine can get a little closer to the pawns...
...and I move my king forwards to deny my opponent's access to the e-file...
...and do the same thing again. If the enemy king moves forwards (f6), I play mine to e8, if he moves backwards (f8), would I play mine to e6?
As my opponent's king stays close to his pawns, I move mine onto my top rank, hoping to threaten them. If my opponent plays Ke6, I play Kf8, while Kg7 would be followed by Ke7.
Now mine is in an excellent position to clear the enemy pawns. I my opponent plays Kf6, I play Kg8, If my opponent moves the king onto the d-file, I play Kg7, while g5 would be followed by hxg5, giving me a passed pawn.
Now my opponent is about to drop a pawn: if the king moves (the only options are e6 and e7), mine moves to g7, and the knight's pawn will disappear, either by Kxg6, or by f/hxg5...
...and I capture it with my rook's pawn, forcing the king to move, as it checks him, and now I am up by a pawn, and it is passed...
...and as the rook's pawn advances...
...my knight's pawn can force it off the board, to deprive my opponent of another queening opportunity, and to give myself another passed pawn...
...and the king moves to close down the capturer...
...and I move mine back to allow the protected passed pawn to move towards his protection...
...I am able to claim a faster queen, who can drop back to guard the f1 square, and get some help from the king to capture my opponent's last pawn, and to mate the king.
...and as the king moves away...
...and my king moves in to help...
...and she removes the pawn, so my king can help her close the king down...
...and complete the mate.
Bb4+ allows White to finish building a strong pawn structure in the center while gaining a tempo.  It's now up to Black to try to undermine White's center.
d6 is not a great square for the Bishop.  It reduces Black's ability to counter in the center with pawns.
f6 is a little bit weakening.  Black could have taken the opportunity to develop the N.
Black finishes development and hopes apparently to attack on the Kingside.  But the N is hanging.
The N on d6 is a real annoyance for Black.  For one thing, it prevents doubling the Rs on the f file.
White offers to exchange and head toward an endgame with a piece to the good.
By exchanging, Black makes the material deficit loom larger.  Although Black has an open f file and two Rs, it's not clear that an attack could be successful now.
Thinking about a Kingside attack perhaps.  Rxf3 just loses the exchange.
Black is going to lose significant material trying to deal with the passed pawn.
With the R on the e file, Black's K can't get to the passed pawn.
The pawn promotes in plenty of time to stop Black's d pawn.
Mate is going to follow in a few moves, after White plays Re5, Qd6, Re7, Qd8.  White can safely ignore the Black pawns.
My advantage was massive, but I was about to make it even bigger!
The bishop protects the c2 pawn and the c2 pawn protects the bishop.
Yet another overlooked attack. Just a few moves ago I had a massive advantage. Now I'm about to have a big disadvantage!
He never gave up, and now look at where black is. Once this had happened, I had basically given up myself.
I decided to go for this: 17. d4 Bxd4 18. Rxd4 Re1# and give him the win...
...but he instead protected his bishop. He may not of seen the possibilities of checkmate, or he was going easy on me, but then I noticed that both our kings had the same flawed protection, thus I decided to go for one final push!
THE END! As I said, "Flawed protection!" This game is the perfect example of "It ain't over until it's over!" Think about this: I get a massive early lead, black comes back and not only erases it but builds a big lead himself, but then I find a way to turn things around and bring in checkmate. This incredible, awesome, and exciting game was now over. I hope you enjoyed this annotation and feel free to comment and rate it.
I'm not an expert chess annotator, nor an expert player. Also, this game maybe full of errors from both sides. I will elaborate on the game with whatever it was I was thinking throughout the process of deciding which moves to make.
I'm not sure how good is to take the pawn, rather than developing the knight on b, I just prefer more open positions.
Trying to clear the way for a possible castle, as soon as (if) possible.
Trying to annoy black by pinning the bishop on e6, while possible.
It wouldn't have been so bad for black to castle, but black elected to "unpin" the bishop with its Queen, which will create more complications as we'll see soon...
Black seems to have solved the complications by castling queen-side. Still, white could stubbornly try to double Black's pawns on g with 11. Ng6
Black has now counter-played with a double threat, attacking the knight on h and, at the same time threatening to gain a pawn on h2...
13. Kf1 was also viable, but I wanted to keep the pressure on black by having now three black pieces under attack...
?? At first I thought that Black simply didn't pay attention to my bishop on c1, but then I saw that maybe Black was taking a shot at opening the h column for its rook, creating a potentially nasty discovered check, having the bishop on h2. I will never know which of the two were Black's motivation, but Black's apparent "queen sacrifice" will prove to be not so sound.
I quickly grabbed Black's queen, with the assurance that I would also get Black's knight and knowing that Black's discovered check wouldn't force a quick mate.
Tricky move, if you try to blitz it (as I almost did). If White takes on g5, Black now has a profitable discovered check by attacking the queen with the bishop.
White is "unorthodoxically" maintaining initiative. If 16... fxg6, then 17.Qxe6  Kb8. 18.Nxg7, eliminating the knight's protector.
Not so good, as white will now take on g7 attacking both the rook on e8 and the white-squared bishop.
Logical move, maintaining the pressure against Black.
The threat of a potential doubling of the black rooks on the h column seems now to complicate things for White.
After analyzing this move for some time, days after the game, I'm not so sure if this was better than 18.Nf5 or 18.Nxe6. Honestly I need to look deeply at all the ramifications.
10. I was surprised at Nh4.  B is cramped and the exchange of knights makes his game easier.  White should continue to develop to be able to exert potential pressure, so Nd2 or Nc3 presents more problems for B.
12. See previous note.  W's loss of tempo is good for B. Allowing B to capture c5 takes d4 is a mistake, as B can get some counterplay before W can recover the pawn.
18....Nc5 should lose. On 19. Bg3, B has Qg5 hitting the loose R, and then after W's move, Be5 to guard the diagonal, and the threatened fork on d6.  But I think B is lost after 19. Q x c3, Q x c3 19. N x c3, N x b3, then a rook move to break the pin.  B can either capture the N, or move his own, now threatened N.  Either way, he ends up losing a piece for 2 pawns.  W's dark-squared B is very strong, almost as strong as B's rooks, and B should prevail without much difficulty.  19.Qe3 ends all of these complications, and B is just better.
After 20....Ne4, B is winning.  If W trades his N for a B, W's entrenched, and unmoveable N on e4, is as strong, and probably, stronger than W's dark-squared B.
21. N x a6 allows, ...Bd2 then after the R move, B x e3  skewers the N. If the rook doesn't move, then after 21. N x c8, B x c8, say Kf1,...B takes e3 looks like B is trapping the N.
22. N x c3 loses an exchange, as B threatens the R's--directly on a2, and w/ the fork threat on e2.
27..."dizziness from success".  Allowing W to get back into it.  I had looked at R takes c2 , trading the W rook, and preserving the pawn advantage, and then forgot(!) to make the move.
This is a waste of time.  My Bishop isn't going for f3, it's headed for f5 to trade-off White's only good bishop.
0-1<n><n>White forgets the pawn on e3 can't re-capture because of the pin on the king.
This is my second annotation. This game was interesting and a game I was happy to win. I always like to move my king's pawn two spaces.
A response move I am not that familiar with, but I had to go on anyway.
flyfish283's pawn advances two spaces to e5.
I am now attacking flyfish283's queen and rook and is being protected by my bishop. flyfish283 obviously moves his queen out of the way allowing me to take the rook.
The queen moves away to a5.
I take the rook.
The queen's pawn comes down to attack my pawn and bishop.
I get taken, but I take his knight by exd5.
Castling I have to say wasn't the best option, but opened up the rook on a8.
I take the bishop on e7, but my knight is left open.
The game is about to close with the king moving to d7.
There was the mistake. If only flyfish283 had move to c7, the game might have lasted longer.
A small subtle movement cost a point on the tournament board. Thank you for watching this annotation. The writing wasn't the best, but I promise it will get better!
here we go, nothing to lose really. I can't see a complete way through but after Rxf2 Rxf2 ... Ra-f8 is a  strong attack.
if cxd4 Bxd4 probably wins white's rook whilst h3 seems to diffuse the danger from blacks rooks.
I can exchange rooks because of Bd4
It seems that with 12...h6, Black does not get enough compensation for the pawn...
Note that it took Black 22 moves before his rooks were joined.  Capablanca was perhaps the best (along with Morphy) at joining his rooks on the back rank faster than anyone else, especially from the White side, playing all of those Queen's gambit openings...and it was primarily because he, like Morphy, valued the time principle in chess very much.  His writings place great emphasis on time, especially in the endgame.  More on this on move 50.
Further overprotecting d6 and taking control of the only open file on the board.
...and another one on the b4 square.
Time to exchange heavy pieces and transition to a good chance for a winning endgame for White.
Black loses an important tempo with this move...the rest of the game could easily go into any endgame tome under the bishop vs. knight endgame literature...
Fixing the a5 pawn as a target for White's knight, and Black's bishop is helpless to defend it.
This move forces White now to take a look at at least four different possibly winning candidate moves.  It is interesting to note the positions of the knight and the bishop here.  We are familiar with the saying that a knight on a rim is grim.  But could it be that a bishop on a rim is even more grim?!
This move brings the knight back into the center of the board rather than keeping it hanging out on the west coast on a5.  It also enables White to keep the pawn on the all-important h-file, thereby fixing the pawn on h6 as a probable target for the knight, rather than exchanging it for Black's g5 pawn as in 42.hxg6 e.p.  If White can capture Black's pawn on h6, the game will soon be over, since White can then push the a-pawn AND the h-pawn, and even a bishop in the center of the board will not be able to stop one of the pawns from promoting.
What a significant difference with the knight positioned here in the center of the board rather than remaining on the a-file!
Which rook pawn will emulate its fallen brother knight and immolate itself in order to save the other?!
Here's a perfect example of what Capablanca was talking about when he repeatedly emphasized the importance of time in the endgame, since Black does not have enough time to stop one of the pawns from queening, and thus resigns.  And yet, even though he placed much emphasis on the element of time, Capa placed his overall emphasis on the element of position. <n><n>He wrote, "The fact is that chess consists of...three elements [material/force, space, and time] plus the inherent element of position, and that position is first, last, and foremost.  Position...is generally valued by the greater or lesser mobility of the pieces, plus the pressure that these pieces may exert against different points of the chessboard, or against certain pieces of the opponent...you may be behind in...material, space, and time, and yet have a winning position...you should give pre-eminence to the element of position" (pp. 66-67).<n><n>Located in "A Primer of Chess" by Jose Capablanca, 1995 ed.
This variation of the Najdorf was first developed by Polugaevsky in the 60s and refined by Gelfand in recent times. It's actually a more solid line than the totally unclear main lines arising after 7...Be7. The positions also get chaotic after 7...Nbd7, but somehow they tend to end up in draws.
Armed with my opening database I felt comfortable in this variation, as you do need to remember a lot of theory. During the game I was wondering why black could not simply play Bb7. After the game I found out that this move had already been employed by none other than Gelfand against Naiditsch in 2006. That game went 12...Bb7 13.Qe2 fxe5 14.Qc4! and ended with a draw after some complications. I think Bb7 is a better choice if you want to try to win as black, but Ra5 is safe enough if you're happy with a draw.
This is helping black. 18.Ncb5 was to be preferred, but now black has the extra resource 18...Nd5, since there is no rook on e1.
The first move in the game I really had to think about, as I was now "out of book", but the rook capture is quite natural, as now black - and not white - gets a strong attack.
Loses by force, but with a piece up and a strong attack, black was winning anyway. Notice that white's g3 move does not bury the black bishop. Black could play f5 and it would find a home in the long diagonal.
It was tempting to play Qb4 instead, but it doesn't really create any new threats, since on Qa3 white would turn the tables with Qb7 . After a while I realized that this idea with the knight sacrifice was just winning by force.
23...Rd8  24.Nd5  Kf8 was also winning, but now white gets mated in the middle of the board.
26.Ke5 and the bishop finally enters the game with decisive result. :-)
I want to play c5, but it is not possible at the moment. This seems the best developement for black, since it is not likely to have f and e pawns removed by now. Black's bishop in b7 is not dangerous if white plays f3, but it leaves a weakness in g2. This is a result of a better pawn's structure, even if white controls most of the center.
Probably better was f5, opening my king to the white pieces's action.
Defending the bishop, but leaving g3 unprotected.
Wise. And I have to lose a precious tempo.
Hi everyone!<n><n>After an ignominious defeat against Ardin (Sonata) in which I dropped 18 rating points I was really chuffed when I got the result of Gameknot Analysis for this game.  Remarkably neither player made so much as an innaccuracy - a game with such a strong Expert and no errors - whew!  How on earth did this happen?  Well, first of all, read the following analysis     http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15713503&fb=1&rnd=0.48895922418947063 then read on ....
3. Bb5 - as with Coach Ion and Brigadecommander (Janet) I decided to test Dave with the Ruy Lopez.  Both Ion and Janet got the better of me so I was even more chuffed with that 14th Expert Draw!  Dave responds with a lesser known defense called The Cordel Defense.
7. d4 - after a pair of knights has been exchanged I now challenge the centre with d4 and I am preparing to develop my queenside.
12. f3 - I have nearly cleared the decks and I have now backed up my e4 pawn.  As the queens are off the board, Henry will make his way back towards the centre.
13. Kf2 - tempted, very tempted to play BxB here, but the DB does not recommend it.  I think it is because it will open up the a column to the rook on a8 even though it does double up the black pawns on the b column, so Henry moves towards the centre as mentioned in my previous note.
14. Nd2 - after the BK has the same idea, I cleared the decks with Nd2.
18. ...... Kxe6 - both sets of bishops have been traded off and both kings are on the third rank on the e column.  I then decided to get some active play with pushing up my queenside pawns.
26. cxb5 - I know there is a principle about take towards the centre but no way do I wish to gift Dave a passer on the a column.  Unfortunately Dave now has a file of his own for his rook, the c column.  I just hope my queenside pawns do not now become sitting ducks for it.
32. Kxc2 - I feel a little relieved at the rook trade because my position was starting to show worrying signs of passivitis.  Although Henry has been forced back it is still very difficult for black to find a way of ingress.  Here comes the Joblock!
34. Kc4 - after putting Henry into a very commanding looking position to deter Nc5 I decided to hit the offer draw button and see if Dave thought my Joblock was effective enough.  He thought it was and kindly accepted my draw offer.  I have a couple of promising looking results in my active games list at the moment.  If only I can pull off victories in those two games then I may well regain my Class A 1800+ status.  Ah well, I hope you all enjoyed the Royal Wedding and this lurvely early summer weather.
interesting symmetry, I also chose not to take
breaking the ice !
there were both knights and the bishop to protect
I chose to triple attack d6 pawn in a future exchange of bishops while i will lose e4 pawn
yep' good one, in case i put the knight on c3 or the bishop on d2 his knight would certainly go for an exchange because is hanging there with no defense ad it will win material !
i have to win back material so d6 is mine :) "it was in my mind" and maybe my thoughts were received by the opponent because of his next move
protect queen, prepare castling leading to double attack on d column and another diagonal for the bishop !
too late, mate in 4 from this point !!
I decided to play this move in a mood for a battle
More breathing space for Bishop
Weaken his Kingside
Piling on pressure to carry on attacking
Probably was hoping i would use Queen or pawn to take the Bishop
This was the last game in the Tournament, and Herr von Bardeleben has to win the game if he wanted to be amongst the prize winners.  he adopted, therefore, an opening which is but little analysed and allows of complications.
Black has by far the best of the end game; his rook is able to take possession of the open file and the f3-pawn is very weak.
Having conducted the whole end game with great skill and accuracy, herr von Bardeleben reaps now the benefit of his superior strategy.   White has to give a piece for the passed pawn.
And here starts the punishing period of it.
An unexpected defence maneuver that lets me defend more, but I choose unwisely, and try to break the pin...
Have to take it back with bishop if I'm to stay in the game...
The knight is un-takeable, for the pin by rook on queen is deadly.
Greed hurts, he's leaving his queen even more open to the attacks by rooks, and leaving his queen in crossfire.
And here comes the deadly maneuver, the killing blow.
I guess I decided against the plan in the previous note and supported my d pawn.
Opening the line for his bishop.  We both miss the tactic Qa5 , winning the bishop.
The white knight seems to be in a good position, so I would like the option to remove it.  This move seems better than f5, leading to something like 8. Bxc6  bxc6 9. Qh5  g6, where the black kingside pawns seem weak.
Winning the bishop.
Escaping the pin.
Protects the knight and prepares Nb4.
Better was f4, avoiding my 19th move.
Attacking c2 and skewering the bishop.
For a minute I thought my knight had been too aggressive, but it can continue forward.
Pinning the king and pawn.
Forcing the rook away first so I can gain a pawn.  30. Rh2? does not defend the pawn due to 30...Nf1 .
Now if 34. Rxd4?, Nf3  wins the exchange for an easy endgame.
Forcing the rook to stop the pawn.
I'm in no rush, so I make sure I can't blunder away<n>the h pawn.
The rook can't stop the g and h pawns by itself (e.g. if white wasted moves 38...Kh4 39...g3 40...g2 41. Rg1 Kg3 42...h2 wins), so the king needs to help.  Unfortunately for white this allows black to capture the rest of his pawns, and with an active rook promotion still is easy.
This seems to be the quickest way to win: If 40. Kg1 g2 41. Rh2 Kg3, the rook can reach the first rank in two moves, winning.  Otherwise a pawn promotes as mentioned in the previous note.
to prevent the knight invading b5 square, I had plans of playing Qc7
brining all his pieces over to the king side. My opponent wanted to get an attack started.
mixing things up a little. This aims to lure my knight away from f6 which at the moment is preventing the queen from invading blacks position.
so we come out of it and black has two knights for a rook and a pawn. blacks h pawn will be hard to defend and the king is a little open but for the most part blacks position is looking pretty fine.
I retreated my king to somewhere where it would have a bit more cover, maybe I could have used my time in other ways.
looking to trade queens and thus nullify whites attack, then maybe I could seek counterplay on the opposite flank.
But if I am going to lose it I am going to lose it on my own terms, this practially forces a queen trade.
rather than trading queens on e7 which will help me bring my king to where he wants to go.
with a discovered attack on the DSB.
So lets take another look at the position, black has two knights for a rook and two pawns. so I am down in material by one point, furthermore my opponent has a clear path on the kingside. so perhaps white has a slightly easier time, however the game is far from decided yet. My position looks solid and I should be able to drum up some counterplay somewhere.
?! another mistake I think. with the final nail in the coffin, this locks up the position completly and basically means the whole game will be based on the g and h files. A better plan may have been to leave the pawn where it was and played something Like Bb8
hxg isn't possible because of the pin.
It's after this move I think that I offered a draw. to me this seemed fairly drawish, my opponent thought otherwise, and rightfully so considering the result.
up untill now I had avoided making this move since white playing a5 would put the pawn on the colour of my own bishop. However it also workd the other way and would make my pawn a target for white. With this the blockade is nearly complete.
I was so confodent of a draw at this point that I had overlooked my opponets entry point on d5. I have to get my king to d6 and my bishop to f6 then it should be a draw.
??????? I can only only put it down to my lack of nutrience causing a momentary lapse in concentration that I played this. this is pretty much what lost it, although much more difficult, things just got alot more complicated. though black can olny play to hang on and white can play for the win. The logical Rh6 would have been fine. then after say Rh3 black simply plays Bg7 then if white tries to swicth to the f file Bf6 and white cannot break through. as long as black has both pawns blocked things are fine.<n><n><n><n>there are many ways for white to win from this point. He could try f6 for one. 54.f6 Rh8 55.Rf1 Rxf6 56.Rxf6+ Bxf6 57.h6! Ke6 (only way to cover both f5 and d5) 58.Bf5+ (or even h7 first and then follow up with this line) Kd6 59.Bc8!which clears the f5 square for white. the black monarch can't cover both f5 and d5 because the LSB controls e5, now lets say black chasses after the bishop. ...Kc7 60.Ba6 and it's game over. the bishop can come to c4 and the king can break through the lines with the bishop tied down to the defence of h8 he wont have enough man power to stop white wreaking havock on the position.  <n><n><n>Of course white chooses a more effiecnt way to win.
This easily wins it for white. Rxh6 doesn't work at all. 54..Rxh6 55.Rxh6 Bxf6 56.f6 Ke6 ( to cover f5 and d5) 57.f7 now any king move opens either the f5 or d5 square. 57....Bf8 58.Bf5+ Kxf7 59.Kd5 and it's a simple enough matter. If black instead of taking the pawn tries Kd6 to keep control over the entry points then Bc8! wih a simmiler theme to what was mentioned before. 57...Bg7 runs into the same problems after Bf5+<n><n><n>I tried Bxh6 but as you will see that was even worse.
...Rf8 would have set a nice little trap, if after ... Rf8 white played Rxg6?? then Rxf6!! would win for black, the only way to stop mate for white would be to give up the rook with Bf5. However the simple f7 would prevent that.
I was very dissapointed to have a drawn game end like this because of a stupid blunder, however I do think I learnt lots from this. And hopefully by annotating it I can learn even more by comments from some gameKnot players who are more expierenced than myself.
I like Bf4 here.  It puts pressure on the black knight.  Black might defend with f6, but that opens up the king's castle.
Black opens it anyway.
There's that bishop move.  But now I'm thinking maybe Bd2.  If black's queen and rook remain lined up, Bb4 would be such a lovely pin.
Ah, MUCH better.  Now the bishop can withdraw to safety.
Has white any tricks to prevent f4 capture of the bishop?
Yes.  Feed the bishop to the black queen instead.  This is not a wise plan, though it must have frightened black into moving the rook instead of QxBd6.
Lovely.  If the king does not move, white can take the black queen (and a pawn) with Rxh7+ (discovered check).
...and the black queen gets traded for a rook.
Here Qb4+ is advised.  This in addition protects e1, so if black keeps the king on the e file Re1 pins the black queen.
As the king ventures out where the white rook can check, the black rook becomes vulnerable.
Black has good central control and with the Dutch is usually trying for a direct Kingside attack.  I think I inadvertently drove his Bishop to a better square.
White tries to exchange off some of the attackers.  Black has more space, however, and better pieces.
There are no good continuations here for White, down the exchange and a pawn.  White's King is restricted and there are plenty of files for Black's Rook to create havoc.
Ne6 trades off the Knight for Bishop, but still leaves Black an easily won endgame.
The passed pawn on the h-file wins easily.  Black has three passers and White cannot stop them all.  If Black makes the mistake of advancing his King too far, White's c pawn can sneak through.
I resigned here.  Black would have to blunder badly (like moving the King to f4) to lose this endgame.  The e and h pawns are too widely separated for White to stop.
Missing an opportunity to win material by 8.d6.
We have now transposed to a Benoni but I was playing it like a K Indian! The bishop should have gone to f4.
Karpov gets his king out of the center and completes development and is now ready to take advantage of better mobilization. I think Spassky probably should have played ...Rd8 and ...d4 to try to get play against the white king, or 11...e5, to attack the bishop.
Karpov takes advantage of the black queen's departure to forcefully give Black the isolated queen pawn. Because his pieces are somewhat passive, the IQP turns out to be a liability rather than an asset.
Karpov begins trading minor pieces and improves his knight in the process. Note that 16. Nxd5?? would be a blunder, due to 16...Nd4 17. Nxe7+ Qxe7 18. Qd3 (Qe2 Rc2) Bb5 19. Qxd4 Bxe2.
The other recapture, 17...bxc6, would result in "hanging pawns": the black pawns on the b- and c-files have no support from other pawns.
Karpov pins the d5-pawn to the rook and starts to load up on the weak pawn.
Spassky places his knight on the e4 outpost and attacks the pinned knight. Is he starting to get counterplay?
Karpov prepares to load his heavy pieces on the weak pawn.
The Alekhine's gun on the d-file has Black tied down to its defense, but Karpov will need to open a new front to win the game. The usual way to win a pawn, e3-e4, does not work at the moment because d7 is protected 4 times. But the passivity of Black's pieces will ensure that Karpov will have the advantage when he finds a new plan.
With the threat of f5 winning the bishop.
Karpov will force the e6-bishop away from guarding the d7-rook. Note that because Black's pieces are in a bind, there are no problems with pushing the pawns in front of the king.
Forking the queen and rook.
The black queen is deflected from d3. If 41...Qxb3??, then 42. Bxf6+, so black resigns.
And now i was between that move and Be7....My thought was to attack and play more aggresive than playing Be7 which seems more pathetic (i know it is a good move too)...
And now he made the first mistake....e5 showed me i took the right decision before...he might ignored the threat that was coming from d4....
d4! That was a good move that will give an advantage early in the game being with a knight up for the rest...
b5 looks fine to me...Now i cant move the black bishop to e7 as his queen is pushing the g7 square...
and my brave knight took his queen and now was threatening both his rook and the a2 pawn...
And checkmate with my bishop that during the whole game was sleeping piecefully....That was the game! I hope you like it!!!! Wait for your comments and your rating and please if it's something to ask write it down or sent me a message....I also have to notice in my game that i did not play 0-0 in the whole game, something that is rare for me playing as black...Thanks for reading my annotation...
A Knight on KB3, according to Fine and Znosko-Borovsky, is the best single piece available to protect a King that has castled King-side. So naturally, I drive it away while I have the opportunity.
The best available square. N-R4 would leave it exposed and vulnerable.
An attempt to negate my central wedge.
K-B2 would leave the King closer to his allies, although I'm not sure it would have made a huge difference.
Naturally, I press forward with the Q. My Knight is also ready to join, and the Black King is momentarily denuded of defensive help.
An attempt to reduce the pressure.
The correct move was 17... Q-R3, interrupting the potential discovery. Now I have a mate.
and finally I take his damned bishop!
Black want to cover BSD with a pawn. Now I can try Bxg5 or even Rd1.
I wasn't sure about this move. It solves the immediate problem, but is too quiet, blocks the black queen from b6 or a5, and also weakens c6.
Now 12 ...fg is dubious because after 13.Nxg6 fg 14.Qxg4 black's king's side would be in a mess. The d5 pawn is also attacked.
An interesting decision. White clearly intended to take on g6 and wreck black's kingside. Black withdraws the bishop out of harm's way, but allows white to winkle his king out into the open.
A crucial move. White prepares to open up the light squares around the exposed black king, besides catching up on a bit of development (this bishop has moved once, its black counterpart four times).
This was as expected. This knight was the only black piece I was worried about. It is insufficient, however, to counter all the threats.
For some reason I had overlooked this rather obvious move (lesson: be more objective in analysis, even when things seem to be going well). Fortunately I still had enough tactical resources to press home the attack.
The point is that the black knight on e5 is now overworked, guarding against the mating threats Ng6# and Qf7#. The immediate threat is the simple deflection mate, 22.Ng6  Nxg6, 23.Qf7#. Black urgently needs to overprotect both these squares, and it seems that he can't.
....and mate.
Castling long to both maintain the tension on black's pieces as well as connecting the rooks.  White also has queen and rook on the same file with this move.
Black made a push with the a-pawn before considering king safety and white presses to explode open the tension...
Bearing down on the e-file where black's king still resides.
Breaking open the center with black's king still in the middle.
Black can't castle through check and he resigns. (edit 8/30 - You are correct that black's choices are sub par.  The point is black may consider castling if at all possible and losing the queen, instead of the devastating attack you mentioned with his king stuck in the middle.  He doesn't even have that option, and either way the position is bad for black.)
The Ruy Lopez
Trying to gain some advantage from White's Queen still being in the centre
Black gains the Bishop pair and this a strategic gain in this open position.  I will need to exchange one of them for a knight
This move gives White the option of exchanging the Queen for two Rooks.  Giving that Black's bishop would be pinned and White's two knights are well placed to join an attack, it is an option I take
This defends the d7 square but of course there is another Knight to bear down on the position and renew White's simple threat
Black resigns as he can no longer defend the e7 square.  For example, if 22. ... Qb6 then 23. Ne7+ Kh8 and 24. Rxf8#.  However, there is also 22. ...Qf6 but 23. Nd7 is winning for White
probably the most dangerous line to combat this tabiya.
during the course of the struggle I thought that 14 Nc6 was a good try but this is probably more dangerous.
the threat of Nxg7 has to be attended to.
I thought that this was a wild but unsound sac but there is a tricky point to it!
too routinely played!!  it was necessary to give back some loot with 17... Ne5.
30 Qa5 and it will be hard for black to stop the queenside pawns since the king's rook has a hard time getting into play.
this results in a position in which black will win the "c" pawn but only have his "h" pawn left and will have to win the "h" pawn and advance it down carefully to win.
in many lines white has drawing chances for example stalemate possibilities and allowing the rooks to be traded in which white has a positional draw thanks to black's giving up the knight white can draw by stalemate.  The text hopes to bypass those possibilities and also contains a trap which white unexpectedly falls into.
This seems like a good place to start the annotation.  Instead of 5. f4 leading to the Steinitz, this move betokens the modern treatment of the Classical.  The idea is for White to create a "super-center" with c3, f4, and Nf3.  In these positions, the standard break at ...f6 is not so good as it leaves Black with a terminally weakened pawn structure.  This is a fact which determines this game, even though we leave book very early.  Anand has played this several times with great effect.  For some truly amazing games, check out Anand-Shirov, 2000 and Anand-Morozevich, 2000.
Releasing the tension doesn't help black.  6...Nc6 is better, followed by 7. f4 and either 7...b5, or 7...Qb6, increasing the pressure on d4 in standard French fashion.
Black is clearly a little nervous about the White center, but a capture on e5 after 8. f4 only solidifies the position in White's favor.  Piece development seems more prudent at this stage, in particular, ...Nc6 and ...Qb6, with the standard queenside play.
My pieces are centrally posted and my center is strong.  My short term plan is to deploy the Bishop to d3, castle and lift the queen to connect the rooks.  Not exactly rocket science, but you can see how the mass exchange strategy employed by Black has left him in a passive situation.
Clearing the way for the light-squared bishop to possibly transfer to the kingside with ...Bd7-e8-h5 is pretty common.  Also, the b6-knight can come to c4, which will pretty much force me to exchange my light-squared bishop to keep Black's activity under control.
Taking aim at the Kingside in the event the Black knight chooses not to sink into c4.  The White queen can move to c2 to pressure the Black kingside and provoke a weakness on the light-squares with either ...h6, or an h-pawn push if Black plays ...g6, also keeping in mind possible sacrifices on g6.
I wasn't really excited about Bg5 followed by ...Qb6, and decided to chop the knight with...
No need to allow complications.  By exchanging the knight from c4, I keep the position simple and advantageous for the White pieces.  Black gets the d5-square for his pieces, but I get the e4-square for my knight after I castle, as a bishop capture on c3 would only strengthen my center and then Nd2-e4 would come anyway.  Black also has an isolated pawn on e6, which will be a problem later.  This capture seems like a good example of choosing to use superior technique over complications.
Releasing the pin and preparing Ne4.
Logical play from Black, who seeks to exploit the new d5-outpost square.
Clearing the back rank to link the rooks, vacating d1 for a rook and attacking the c-pawn.  The queen also keeps an eye on the kingside here in case too many of Black's pieces head for the queenside.
Hitting the knight twice, however, I decided to set a positional trap for my opponent.
This prepares to route the d2-knight to e4.  My reasoning is that the open b-file will only benefit the White pieces, as Black wants to use the b6-square for his queen and the c-file for the rooks.  As the Black c-pawn is hanging, I wasn't worried about 17...Bxc3; 18. bxc3 Nxc3; 19. Qxc4 Nd5; 20. Rb1 with quite a bit of pressure on the queenside and a nice outpost on d6 for the knight after Ne4-d6.  I also wasn't concerned with 17...Nxc3; 18. bxc3 Bxc3; 19. Rxf8  Qxf8; 20. Rf1 Qe7; 21. Qxc4, when Black's Weaknesses are more prominent and White has control of both of the open files.
Probably a wise choice, Black is seeking piece activity (a dynamic imbalance) to offset his space and pawn structure disadvantage (a static imbalance).
I thought about Nde4, however, this move gives me some initiative.  Notice how Black does not have this luxury on move 17, as his Queen is not off the back rank and cannot challenge the f-file after 17...Rxf1; 18. Rxf1, with the initiative and maintaining the static plusses in the position.
After the previous forced sequence of moves, I decided against my previous plan of Nde4 and opted for this move.  My reasoning was that if Black was ever going to exchange the d5-knight, I would rather have him take the crappy e3-bishop than one of my good knights.  Again, a bishop swap for a knight is only good for White.
Expanding on the queenside and safe guarding the pawn.  Taking the pawn was never a consideration.  With black having the two bishops, I was trying to keep the position as closed as possible.  Black would have had ample compensation for the pawn.
Not just kicking the bishop, but trying to erect some kind of dark-square influence on the queenside.  Especially c5 and d6!
Forcing the queen back and preventing a swap of Rooks on the f-file.
Not sure about this move.  I wasn't really interested in taking the bishop.
The bishop is off limits after 26. Qg4  Kh8; 27. Nxe6 Qe7; 28. Rf6!! Black can resign.
Here Black resigned as he had enough.  Thanks to my opponent.
Believe it or not most top level GM's have ditched f4 for Nf3. This is because of black's recent successes against the f4 lines. Still the f4 lines remain common in amateur play because most black players have not kept up with modern theory.
More common are 8.h3; 8.Bd3 and 8.Be2. The idea is to test Stalhandske's knowledge of the Modern Benoni. If he is abreast this move should be no problem, Matter of fact black can get some very good chances out of it.
a normal manouever for white in the modern benoni Bf4 lines. White wants to place a knight on c4 where it can attack d6 and defend e4 from a more active outpost.
?!<n>The whole point of 9...Ng4 is to try and prevent white from playing Nc4 easily. 10...Qf6 actually hinders black's development and makes the Queen and knight targets. <n>Alternative variation: 10... Ne5 [=] 11. O-O f5 12. h3 fxe4 13. Bg3 (13. Be3 Re8 14. Ndxe4 Nf7)13... Bf5
Forces that exchange but it does little to clear the air. After the exchange the position is quite complex.
After a series of forced exchanges the dust has settled somewhat. Leaving white with a potentially dangerous majority in the center. But black has better piece mobility and a slightly superior pawn structure but his position is quite passive. The result is semi-equality with better attacking chances for white.
White has managed to hold onto his powerful center.  Meanwhile, black has converted the b-pawn into a highly dangerous past c-pawn. Black needs to get his rook behind the c-pawn in order to simplify into a slightly inferior rook endgame.
Black is down by two pawns and is in danger of losing. However,  black can force the game to a peaceful end if he adheres to the golden rules of rook endgames. #1 Centralize your king #2 control the center. #3 Keep your rook active and cut off the opponent king from meeting up with a pawn. #3 You need at least two pawn advantage to win.
!<n>For the win. Black can no longer capture either pawn and therefore loses. This highlights the importance of adhering to the Golden rules of rook endings.
Black resigns. Both of his pieces are unable to move and are in zugwig
Protecting the king
Protecting the king
Protecting the king
Protecting the king
Black moves the pawn; I think he was trying to open up a path for some of his other pieces. Looking back, I should have done Bxg6+, to which Black would have responded hxg6, and then I could have done Qxh8 and gotten a huge advantage.
Wanting to take the knight
Taking the pawn and checking the king
Moving my pawn forward to try and promote it. (When I made this move, I remember thinking that the rightmost side of the board is the least congested and it has the rook to protect it, so this pawn might be able to make it all the way across.)
I think Black was thinking that the next move would be c4 and then he could get either my knight or my bishop.
I can't seem to figure out what the reasoning was behind this move.
I take the unprotected bishop
I take the rook
Checking the king
Checking the king again and aiming for the pawn
Trading bishops to open up a path for my pawn again
I take the bishop
Probably intending to promote the pawn
I take the pawn, checking the king and deciding to trade my rook for his. Worst comes to worst, he takes my rook and I take his, and then I can concentrate on promoting that pawn.
Checking the king
Black is trying to salvage the game by capturing my pawn with his king
Moving my king to try and prevent that.
Trying to get closer to the pawn
I move my king to try and move it close to the pawn so that I can repel the king
Black will probably take my knight, but at least I'll be able to promote my pawn.
Checking the king
Trying to avoid a stalemate and move my king closer
Moving the king closer to provide support to mate.
Checking the king
Mate. I think if somehow I had been able to keep either my knight or my rook along with my queen, it wouldn't have taken so long, but still... If I were Black and only had the king left, I would have just resigned. I suppose Black was hoping I'd make a mistake and it would be a draw instead.
Opens up the bishop on c8 and defending e5 from my queen.
Knew it was coming. Forces my bishop to retreat.
I take it and look for another plan.
Moving the queen to h3 was probably not the best move. Moving the bishop would have been better. I lost the bishop in this case (obviously). Not great play by me.
Forcing the knight away.
To a good place. If black is not careful, checkmate is near.
Probably the best move, saving the rook, but both queens are lost if taken.
Hoping for the king to eventually move away from the queen.
Bad move for black. Forked a rook and black has a piece disadvantage now.
Coming in for the forked rook attack. I need to prevent this.
The rook on b2 has to be careful now.
Winning a knight and using black's piece disadvantage to my advantage.
Attacking the queen and trying to fend it away from the knight.
Freeing up the bishop and the king. Slowly.
Attacking the rook on c1 and the pawn on f4.
Putting the king in his place.
Trying to win the pawn on f4.
Still trying to win the knight.
It isn't usual to see the knight retreat. This was similar to the previous round where my opponent took on c6.
I thought through this move long and hard. I could not take on e4 right away because of the threat of 9. Qd5! threatening checkmate while attacking the knight. A move like 9. Ba3 would be detrimental to my position, and if I prevent that, there is also Bg5 to be cautious of, since I had lost my dark-square bishop.
Before playing this move I was particularly worried about 12. Bxg5 or 12. Nxg5, followed by 12... axg5 and then another recapture on g5. The white queen would then be free to come to h5 and harass my king at some point. But given the knight on f6 as well as my remaining bishop, queen, and rook, I figured that my pieces would be able to defend from the attack.
And then I could finally grab the pawn on e4 while attacking the bishop.
I simply used this opportunity to get the queens off the table.
A bold move, winning the g pawn and attacking both the bishop and the pawn at f7. I had high hopes for taking on c2, but I guess those hopes were dashed, not that it would matter in the end anyway.
..now I essentially forked the knight and rook, simultaneouly freeing my f7 pawn from the pin and making my king immune to an attack from her bishop.
Note that if fxg6 the white knight would have forked at e6, giving up my material advantage.
Ironic though it was that, in the opening, I gave my opponent attacking potential while doubling up her pawns, I ended up fixing her pawn structure for the sake of taking material off the board. This move also closed up the b file and saved my doubled b pawns from a future rook attack, so it was indeed necessary.
I attacked an indefensible pawn. If Rc1 then the a pawn would fall with check. If c4 then dxc4 and white couldn't recapture with bxc4 since the knight would fall.
I gave up the passed pawn for a rook. I probably could have played better, but I wouldn't be able to promote with the steadfast a1 rook guarding the first rank anyway.
Winning this epic game landed me a 4th place finish out of 44 in the tournament. I could not have asked for a better result, since, if I won in the 3rd round, I probably would have lost the next two. My rating from this tournament went up 281 points, more than anyone else who competed in the reserve section. In doing so well, I realized my true chess potential, and as a result I became more active within in my club and with chess in general. Final Score: 4-1 or 4.0/5.0. Thanks for watching!
A game to look at and see what went wrong.  Or can someone tell me how to get rid of a bishop at h3.  Probably the answer is to avoid allowing the bishop to get there in the first place.
I began with g3 ready to bring my LB to g7 and black went with e5.
I moved my pawn to e4 and black developed his DB to e7.
Now I supported my e4 pawn with d3 and black developed his knight to d6 and he is ready to castle.  I on the other hand have not developed any pieces but I do have my DB and my queen on 2 open diagonals.
Now I develop my LB to e2 and black castles.
I develop my knight to h3 which allows me to castle but I do not have any protection for my knight.  Black then pushes his pawn out to d6 so his LB is pointing at my knight on h3.
I castled but probably should have redirected my h knight to g5 as black captured my h knight with the LB.
I move my rook out of the LB's reach to e1 and black now moves his queen down to d7 supporting the LB at h3.
I develop my LB to f3 and black moves his f knight to g4.
I move my rook to e2 to support my f2 pawn to avoid black's knight capturing it and then harassing my queen.  Black's queen moves back to d8.
I move my rook to d2 to allow the queen to move up better positioned to assist and get involved in the game. Black moves the queen back down to d7.
Now I move my queen up to e2 supporting my pawns and pieces around the queen.  Black develops his knight to f6.
I push my d3 pawn to d4 and black moves f pawn to f5.
I move my queen down to e3 out of reach of the knight and black moves his c knight to a5.
I move pawn to b3 which allows the rook to protect more squares on the 3rd row.  Black moves his a8 rook to e8.
I move my knight to a3 protected by DB at c1.  Black pushes d pawn to d5.
I push my b pawn to b4 kicking the knight at a5 which moves to c6.
I move my knight to b5 and black captures my pawn at d4 and attacks my queen.
I capture the pawn with my knight and black captures my pawn at b4 with his DB.  The DB was at e7 with the rook at e8 and the rook is now attacking my queen at e3.
I now decide to exchange LB's so move my LB to g2 with black's LB at h3.  I do not want the queen to come down so would hope that black may take my LB but probably not likely.  I should instead have moved my queen and can't really say why I didn't.  And now the rook at e8 captures my queen at e3.
Needless to say I still have my LB and will not take black's as I don't want the queen coming down and attacking my king.  So I now develop my DB and allow my a1 rook to access the rest of the 1st row.  Black moves his f rook to d4 attacking my d2 rook.
I take black's rook at e3 and black captures my rook at d2.
I move my rook along where I can protect a pawn at c3 and be protected by the DB at b2.
My pieces are not easy to move into good positions.  The rook has the knight at e2 so i have to watch where I place the rook.  There is a rook at f8 so I don't want to place the rook at f1.  My DB is at b2 blocked by its own pawn at c3 and if it goes to a3 then black's DB is at d6.  I want my LB to stay at g2 because there is a pawn at d5 which I want to check the king with however there has never been a time when I can take it without black's knight being at f6 and the queen at d6.  My knight at d4 can go to f5 but the LB and queen are on that diagonal so its limited.  So I move my rook across to e1 and black knight goes up to c4 as there is nothing for him to capture from d2.  Now he can capture my DB at b2.
I now move my DB onto c1 and hope to find a better position for this piece.  Black moves his c6 knight to e4 attacking the f3 square and g4 square.
I now move my bishop down to f1 protected by my rook at e1.  Black moves his queen to a4.
My pawns are all isolated and my pieces are not helping each other.  I now decide to move my LB to c4 to capture the knight at least there is only one knight now so they can't work together.  I think I see the LB at h3 as not doing anything useful so not worth capturing.  Black captures my LB at c4.  This is really funny because this is the pawn I was hoping to capture with my LB.
I push my pawn to e4 and black moves his knight to d3 attacking both my DB and rook.
I decide to move my knight to e6 nearer to the king although I have nothing to support an attack as yet.  I forgot about the LB at h3 which now proceeds to capture my knight.
In expectation of capture of one of the pieces at c1 and e1 by the knight I move my DB to d2 so as to recapture the knight.
I capture the knight and black's LB annoyingly returns to his guarding duties!
I move my only piece, the DB. to d2 to get on the diagonal and black's queen comes to d1 to check the king and with the rook at f8 I know that the game is up and its time to give in to black's unquestionable superiority.
A solid starting move. This controls the center and prepares for an early attack. In my experience, I have difficulty attacking the opponent.
The point of b6 in many queens pawn games is to push c5 before the opponent pushes e4.
I released tension, but now my black bishop can move farther.
This was an inaccuracy. I can calmly develop further and not be threatened. I can now castle, free my rook on the a-file, and later cramp his queen side up with c3. Best for him was Ne5 following theory to pressure my initiative.
My mistake. White can trade off and then with Qc2, I cannot attack without giving him time to defend. Better for me was O-O, which at least develops more.
5 moves from here and it's CM
Threat to his Queen allowing me to move my intended plan  bishop on g5
Activating the bishop
I have thought a lot about this move and the only excuse is that black tried to defend the knidht, so that in case of an exchange, the pawn structure isn't broke. however, with Nc7 in the air, it is the worst move of the game
An excellent move from white, which brings one more piece into attack without losing material. Here I resigned and this is the move I regret most, as, if you aren't smart enough to win, you still have to be polite enough, to fight until the end and let your opponent mate you.
Black to play!
This exchange leaves me up a pawn with initiative and the center so overall I'm happy the way things are going. Only safe squares for the Black Horse are h7 and g8.
At first I was leery at developing my Queen before my other pieces and got the feeling it was amateurish until I realized it was indeed the correct move.
I was expecting to pick up at least a pawn here assuming my opponent would play 8...d5 9.Bd5 Qe7 ending the threat on f7 and insuring my Knight would be blocked from a great square by my own pawn. Worst move would have been the disastrous 8..f6. Somewhere in between would've been sacrificing the Knight on f6, which at the end of the day probably led to the best position for Black all things considered.
The assault is on! Threatening  fork of King and Rook on c7 while simultaneously attacking the Queen. Oh, and the Queen can't go too far because the f7 square is about to fall into a mating attack. Blacks best bet is 9...Qc5 10. Nxc7+ Kd8 (if Qxc7 mate follows) 11. Nxa8 Qxc4. White would have the strong advantage but at least Black would have a pulse. Instead....
?? Death Knell! Mate assured via 10. Nxc7 if Qxc7 11.Qxf7+ Kd8 12.Qxf8# and if 11...Ke7 12. Qxf7#
...And Black resigned. The lesson I took out of this game was my simple advantage in initiative and space magnified my opponents small oversights into something impossible to overcome. Hope you enjoyed!
(dieselengine9) d4. It presents the most options for an open position from my experience.
(graderguy) Nf6: a look at the GK database shows that this gives the best odds for black. <n>It controls some center squares and clears one spot for eventual castle on that side. The<n> common lines have a fianchetto King side, but I don't always play that as I am really not<n> a fan of fianchetto ahead of my king.
dieselengine9) Nf3: It's not the 'book' move, but it's my preferred response to Nf6. c4 <n>makes me feel behind because of Black's 2:e6 which gets his bishop out and gets him<n> to a kingside castle, and also tends to force queen movement earlier than I'm comfortable with.
(graderguy) e6: Like I said, Fianchetto is not my favored playing style. This move opens <n>up the BS Bishop to development and will allow a rapid castle once it's played. I am looking<n> at d6 for my bishop later, pointing at the h2 square after white castles. White might play <n>b-g5 but I am willing to suffer the pin right now as there are many ways to remove or nullify it..
(graderguy) b6: We are now in pretty familiar territory for me, from either side of the board.<n> I also like the open positions a queen's pawn game can lead to. This puts us in the Queen's <n>Indian Defense. I like the QS fianchetto as it puts the bishop in attacking position on his castled <n>king ( when he castles). I will still be able to get my DS Bishop out and allow for the castle. I always <n>like a knight on f6 when I castle king side. I do have a tendency to forget to defend it with <n>something besides the g pawn sometimes and end up with a torn up pawn defense in front <n>of my king. I often move B-e7 to avoid the getting the knight pinned to the queen. B-b7, B-e7, <n>or B-b4 will likely be my next move, I will be inclined to move the BS bishop to allow for a castle asap.
(graderguy) B-b7: WS Bishop pointing squarely at his soon to be castled king. Allows for <n>c5 in the future, which N-c6 prevents. I keep wondering what my explanation for giving <n>away a minor piece will be later on.. :)
(dieselengine9) Be2: I'm gonna play this hand close to my chess till Dave screws up and <n>gives away a minor piece later on.<n>(graderguy) HA HA HA...
(dieselengine9) O-O: I castle. My pieces are all protected and my opponent has not <n>reached out to attack yet. It's great knowing what Dave thinks, though I feel when <n>he has one of his "fits" and puts THAT in the comment box it's going to be even MORE <n>disturbing than a usual game on his lunatic fringe.<n>(graderguy) I'm gonna show him "lunatic"......
(dieselengine9) Nc3: I couldnt really think of anything better to do that I couldn't still do <n>with this knight developed. I also wonder why N got designated to the knight when the <n>king moves so infrequently. That really has to confuse younger players who are studying <n>both grammar and the game of chess (and it's scoring.)
(graderguy) d5: I have three pieces pointing towards d5, so it seemed like a good time to<n> advance my center pawn. With the B pawn advanced White cannot simply bypass the <n>attack of the D pawn. This also clears d7 for the b square knight if I decide to move it there. <n>I have not yet come up with an overall strategy yet, Need to make a few more moves. <n>My pieces seem to be in decent shape and there is attacking potential with the ws Bishop if <n>white makes an error....
(dieselengine9) cxd5: I thought of resigning. This f**ker I'm playing has three pieces pointing<n> towards d5. With his B pawn advanced I can't bypass the attack of his freshly pushed D pawn.<n> If I screw up, he's going to frickin kill me with his w/s Bishop. All seems lost at this point for <n>black. Instead, I opted for cxd5, trading pawns and possibly a piece or two. This is going to give<n> him ridiculous position. I should know better than to play this sandbagging grandmaster.
(dieselengine9) a3: Limits movement of his black square bishop to twice as many squares<n> as mine can move, hoping to close off the position and last more than 20 moves. My king<n> is getting his affairs in order. He knows this asshat grandmaster will be at his door soon.
graderguy) Nb-d7: After some recent experiences with getting my f file knight raped by weird<n> cosmologists, I am totally into guarding that knight like it's a rare gemstone. This does free <n>the DS bishop from guarding the knight and B-d6 attacking H2 might come into play at some<n> point. I like to keep h7 under guard because _I_ like to attack the other guy there, and I <n>assume he'd like that too! Which may be a horrible flaw in my thinking!
(dieselengine9) Bd2: I couldn't find anything else to do. It may help a little in the oncoming <n>attacks down the b and c file, and may support the B pawn if need be. It's usually this point <n>every game that I kick myself for playing such a high rated asshat so often.
(graderguy) Ne4: All pieces developed. Time to start screwing with Landon! This attacks <n>bishop and knight, so the odds are good he will opt for the trade. That will leave me a <n>pawn past the center line. I can shore that pawn up later with f5 if required.<n>If he decides not to trade, the bishop is history. I will take it in a New York Second!!
(dieselengine9) Nxe4. This is a horrible position, but given the alternatives this was all I could really do. <n>My death is soon to follow. Resignation looms as a possibility.<n>(editors note:) Diesel is a pessimist. I can't help him. His position at this time is not bad; paired bishops, <n>a rook that can take over the c-file, a knight (soon to be) roaming around in my back yard... poor bastard!
(graderguy) dxe4: Well, it's what I wanted, so let's see how it rolls from here. <n>Obviously the Knight will be moving, but thankfully, not many safe havens for him near my king. <n>The tension is broken, as they say, and now the middle game commences. <n>I am looking at e1 or e5 for his knight to land on. <n>In my opinion e1 would be a sissy move, and if Landon makes it, he needs help......
(graderguy) c5: This leaves several possibilities. I am guessing b x c5 or nxd7 . My goal <n>is to open up the long diagonal and clear out all the crap in the center. This is where Landon<n> usually surprises me. Hopefully my queen will end up somewhere decent and safe. Surprise me!!
(graderguy) Qxd7: I'm not killing time. I'm killing Landon =)) .<n>Now we will see some action on the b c or d file and clear out some of the riff-raff. <n>I think the open position there is to my advantage and I have attacking potential with both bishops.
dieselengine9) bxc5: Through painstaking research I have found this position to be identical to <n>Morterford (W) vs Johansensburg (B) in 1780. Morterford used this move to win the game, and<n> I figure my opponent to use the same line as Johansensburg and suffer the same defeat.<n>.<n>.<n>actually I just wanted to bxc5 before he could cxd4. I will figure out what to do once he <n>bxc5 here in a minute
bxc5: followed by dxc5 followed by bxc5... see? told ya c5 would have some action. <n>I'll follow with a rook to d8 to put pressure on the bishop and queen. At least that is <n>where I am looking now, funny how our perceptions change after the pieces are _really_ gone!
cxd4: I see white going down a pawn here. I think it would have been better to take <n>the exchange on c5 rather than this. I foresee a possible move of the ds Bishop by <n>white to open up his queen on the d file. I plan on doubling a rook behind my queen in that case.
Qd5: attacks that miserable bishop and puts my queen in front of the ls Bishop pointing <n>at a mate square if I can just get one pawn out of the way. I hope the dipchit doesn't see<n> it, but since I'm TELLING him, I suspect he will. But Landon surprises me all the time.
(graderguy) Bxb4: Seems like a fair trade. I'm going to want to get my rooks involved soon. Maybe a5 next?
(dieselengine9) ra5: a lame attempt and shooing away a queen, plus I decide to find a new supplier for moldboards.
(graderguy) Q-e6: Ok, screw the D file. This sets up a potential discovered attack on his <n>queen or pins the pawn to the queen if he takes the d pawn. Next stop may still be d6 for my rook.
(graderguy) Q-g6: still pointing at the king with bishop and queen, and now have protection back on the d-pawn.
(dieselengine9) Qb3: have to protect my pawn and rook. This will also keep things even<n>  if dxe3, and gets my queen out of the revealed attack from his rook.<n><n>(graderguy): and apparently he did not see the beautiful position this allows him if I attempt <n>a pawn exchange @ e3, he would have rook, bishop and queen all pointing at <n>f7. what an asshat!
(graderguy) Rd7: have to protect f7. Pondering moving Kh8 later to free up the rook <n>and allow the f pawn to move. My eye is still on g2.. :-)
(graderguy) d3: tightens up the d file by allowing the e pawn to protect, I' rather have <n>taken the white e pawn, but it looked like there were too many pitfalls in that line. <n>I may move Ra-c8 next to prepare forr d2 and potentially R-c1. <n>But who knows what Landon will do... not even HE is sure!
(dieselengine9) rg5: time to point some firepower at the king and shake things up a little.
Qb2: it protects d2 and allows for Rc1 to either trade off dave's final rook or to lock <n>his bishop in place to protect it.
(graderguy) f6: I have to protect against the mate in one. This attacks the Rook, <n>and might gain me a little time and space. Rc4 looks promising for later.
(dieselengine9) Rd5: attacks the bishop, and will have a nice home on d4 if needed.
(graderguy) Ba4: Attacks the rook and guards the space my passed pawn is heading for. I expect him move the rook to a1. At which point I might want to move Rc2.
(dieselengine9) damn that bishop. Qa2. unpins my queen from my b pawn so rc5 can attack his remaining rook.<n><n>(editor)Surely Diesel notices the sweet discovered check when he moves the rook. My move must address that!
(graderguy) h6: My king needs a flight square in order for me to utilize my rook anywhere <n>besides guarding the back rank. I also need to dislodge that rook from the D-file to advance my pawn.
(dieselengine9) Rc5: I'm honestly lost, and it looks pretty hopeless for stopping that pawn <n>promotion. I'll resign before I give this asshat that much satisfaction, but for now I'm going <n>to try to get him to trade his last rook.
(dieselengine9) Rxc2! <n>yeah, I added the !, I added it in respect to everything and everyone that is good, <n>everything and everyone that is right...in otherwords...everything ANTIgraderguy. <n>f*** that D pawn, thats what I say. f*** graderguy and every D pawn he'll ever have.<n> This puts us back even in material, but it really takes the wind out of graderbitche's sails.<n> That's worth 3 or 4 points at least.<n>(editor) I don't think he meant for all the asterisks to show up in his comment, I think <n>he was trying to say something about my "famous" d- pawn and my "fabulous" play.<n>I even did some minor grammatical corrections, but he'll never notice...
(dieselengine9) Qa5. I forgot where I was or what I was thinking after a long race <n>weekend. I was tempted to take that pawn, but I had a bad feeling something bad would<n> be in store if I took it.
(graderguy) Qf6: I can't let my f-pawn go just yet. This also guards A1 and wouldn't it be <n>awesome to get my queen (somehow) to f3? Rook to a1 wouldn't suck too bad either.
(dieselengine9) rc5. if it's that valuable, it warrants an attack.
(graderguy) Rd2: This pins his f pawn to the king and will allow a check if he takes my f pawn.<n> It might also lose me the game. if only I knew what diesel was thinking! I see him <n>having a wonderful mating opportunity if he can get his queen on f5 and check with the <n>queen on the back rank.
(dieselengine9) Qa6. moves the queen and keeps me in play for pressure on his king.
(graderguy) qb5: hoping to trade queens and win the b pawn. Maybe.

bishop wants to go kill the queen even if it costs his life, but antony won't allow him
The king is forced to murer the white queen with his bare hands and nothing else
bishop defends king with his life
King cannot muster the strength to destroy the bishop, so he retreats
The white king is locked up in the kingdom
i dont like his pawn at d5. i was thinking of something to get rid of it. this pawn is now big headache for me.
good attack. see, if i capture dxe5 then he would advance his pawn at d5 to d6. smart opponent.
i moved the knight to d6 to block the movement of pawn.
i made a battery before him. but computer analysis says it was not my best move. computer suggests LSB to f5 threatening his queen.
i moved my pawn to defend threat of his battery
i cannot allow his pawn to move any further.
ofcourse,i didnt want to exchange my most advanced pawn. so i moved further one square.
i didnt think much while playing why he moved this pawn. but he did that for a purpose. his plan was to threaten my queen by his DSB at f4. such a good opponent i am playing with. my best move here is to defend it with DSB to e5. i didnt see his plan at all. so definitely i didnt defend it.
very late to defend it. i didnt this to defend it but was a blunder or a mistake.
he captured my DSB. i couldnt capture it back because if i did. i give much advatage. how? suppose i capture it back with my queen. then my queen is under potential discovered attack. he could then move his LSB to capture my castle pawn at g6 and later h7. so he could destroy my castle.
only option is to move to safety. but i did a big blunder. can you see it? <n><n>if he move his pawn it would threaten my queen also it would threaten my rook at a8. double attack he could do. so my choice of square to move to safety was so poor. a big blunder.
he exchanged his bishop for my rook.
managed to bring his material advantage just to a bishop difference.
Black gains a tempo here because of the position of White's B.
Both Black and White are fully developed.  Now the maneuvering begins.
If Black plays bxc4, he will isolate his a-pawn and also give White's N a nice spot on c4.
Now Black is the one who gets the good square.
Black wins a pawn with a discovered attack on the N.
Discovered attack on the Q.
Now Black is up considerable material--at the cost of an exposed K.
It's to Black's advantage to trade.
Retaining the bishop since it might have some prospects on the b1-h7 diagonal and it stops White's LSB from going to d3.
? White returns the favor.It is best off delaying the capture.I think the best move is 32.Rg1.Although after 32...f2 33.Rxg5 Nxg5 34.Bxe7+ Kxe7 35.Kg2 Ne4 Black can draw with best play.
Defending the pawn.
A blunder that throws away the win.fortunately my opponent doesn't see it.
Black must lose his rook or be mated.
was not the best move, better was Bd2
if i took the pawn on b2, it would get trapped by Qb4
White has no respect for black's ability, shooting for the four move checkmate, and bringing the queen into the fray so early in the game.
Ph6 is the more common response to this unusual move.  White can establish dominance of the center by trading queens.  On the other hand those who open with the queen tend to be less versatile with the other pieces--a trade might benefit black in the long run.  Qf6 is not in the database.
This leaves Pg5 undefended.  The bigger problem here is that white can get that knight to d6+, seizing the rook at e8 with a fork.  I like Nf5.  This way black threatens NxPd4, ending up with the bishop at b3 or possibly forking the king and e rook with NxPf3.
at this point the knight is safe and cannot be harmed as it is on an outpost
a risky move, it could have got sticky if he had taken with the kight
Pg7 is considered a "poisoned" pawn.  With this particular move, white's black bishop (Bf4) is exposed to attack by e5.  Black would probably deal with the g7 threat first, of course, giving white time to mitigate the risk.
Black chooses to take the knight first.  White's black bishop remains at risk.
Even better for black.  16 Qh5 Be8 and the white queen falls into darkness.
Be6? Putting it to my king bishop right away in a very risky manner.
Now with all the pieces on good squares, and the Black king and Queen at risk, it's time to move in.
Rxg7! and Black resigned. With mate threats and the loss of a Queen coming up , there was no point in taking the rook.
Aiming to get the Black King to safety before he commences the dismantling of the 3 Stooges taking centre stage.
The centre is ordered by Duke Wellington to join battle and disrupt Black's smooth operations.
A standard maneuvre here, exposing e5 to 4 attacking Black units. Black does not want to exchange Queens with 10...dxe5, 11.Qxd8 yet, trying to keep some tension in the middlegame.
Preserving my e3 Bishop. I did not like the looks of instead 11.exd6 Nxe3 12. Qxe3 dxe6.  White's centre pawns is no more (=> success for Black's strategy) and Black, in turn, has now his own 2 centre pawns to steamroller at an opportune moment.
Black complicates the game with this h6 Bishop sortie and occupies a potentially dangerous c1-h6 diagonal, pinning the f4 Stooge against White's King + Queen and thus preventing the f4 pawn to defend his central buddy on e5.  MINEFIELD #1: Note that Black cannot win a pawn with 11...dxe5, 12.Qxd8 Rxd8, 13.Rxd8+ Nxd8 as the simple 14.h3 regains the pawn with roughly equal further chances.
Only decent option, as Black is [MINEFIELD #2] threatening 12...Ngxe5 and the f4 pawn cannot retake, the very idea of Black's 11...Bh6 earlier.
This blocks the c1-h6 diagonal and protects the last remaining f4 Stooge, as well as putting some evil White designs onto the d6 pawn. (MINEFIELD #3: Obviously 14.Rxd6 was not a sane option.)
Black develops and protects his backward weakness.
Adding more attackers to d6, and supporting his namesake. Now Black cannot play 15...d5 as 16.Nxc5 snatches a pawn without any danger for White.
With hindsight, an error, but it is admittedly hard to recommend a viable alternative for Black. f6 allows  ........
....the White-squared Bishop to smoothly join the attack.
Here (1) 16 ... d5 fails to Rxd5, (2) 16...Kh8 fails to 17.Nf7+ and upon (3) 16...Kf8 White's 17th move reply would also have been ....
.... 17.h3. This move required some cool-head and accurate calculations if White does not want to lose the plot.   17.h3, apart from counterstriking the g4 knight, also intends opening up the h-file for the dormant Rook on h1.
Black does the expected and lances the knight off his warhorse.
Opening up the h-file, but White, planning move 17.h3 had to reckon with the following Black Bishop sortie .....
White, for the moment, is on top of the position as Black's reply 19...Bxg5+, 20.Nxg5 Bxd1, allows the nasty fork 21.Ne6+!  This pesky knight ensures -- after the forced further exchanges of Rook and Bishop on d8/d1 respectively -- that White stays 2 pawns up with an excellent position, so Black tried ...
I *did* say 'temporarily.' Black is though still +2 pawns up. The h1 Rook is doing its intended duty by protecting the pesky little 'un on h6.
ACHTUNG! MINEFIELD #5: White has to be awake, as the natural looking 21.Kxd1 recapture allows 21...d5, saving Black. Bd5 stymies this idea, as well as pinning the c6 knight to the rook.
The Bishop sells his life as dear as possible.
Black defends f7 and has the sly idea [MINEFIELD #6] to exchange his f8 rook and gain some upper hand thus:--  23.Nf7+ Rxf7, 24.Bxf7 Rf8 and despite White being a pawn up, the position is quite drawish with no clear win in sight for White.
By simply returning to the a2-g8 diagonal, White hems the Black King in the corner and renews the capture of the c2 Bishop. BLACK RESIGNED HERE, realising after withdrawing his c2 Bishop White replies Nf7+ and apart from winning the exhange, the endgame is hopeless for Black. Notice how the h6 pawn, in covering the King's g7 escape square, now in turn stands on the very same square Black introduced complications with ...Bh6 earlier.
My opening was pawn to b3 and black moved his pawn to e5.  I want to fianchetto and attack that e5 pawn.
I moved another pawn to d3, coming out quietly but with protection and no sacrifice for black.
Black comes down the h file with pawn to h6.  Black may be preparing for on his attack on the king side.
I bring out my DB to b2 accessing the diagonal.
I move my pawn to e3 allowing my queen to get access to h5 diagonal.  Also I now have places for my knights to develop safely.
Black develops his DB to b4 and checks my king.
I move my knight to c3 blocking the check on my king and developing my knight with my bishop at b2 protecting my knight.
Black pushes his d pawn out to d6 to protect his e5 pawn.
Now black decides to attack my e2 knight with his LB on g4.  I don't expect this to affect white too much as the bishop can be knocked back quite easily.
Black could have taken and doubled my pawns on the h file but instead retreats to h5 but I may not be finished yet with that LB.
Black's LB moves again to g6 and I think I am probably looking better in terms of development as black has had to make 3 moves with his LB and I have gained development whilst defending.
I now move my LB out to g2 to access a diagonal to a8 and allowing my king to castle.
Black pushes pawn d6 to d5 which again wastes a move.  Perhaps better would have been to make that move at the start and then he could have been moving his g8 knight out with that last move.
I move d3 to d4 giving me a chain of pawns and attacking his e5 pawn whilst the pawn is protected by the knight at e2..
I capture the knight with my queen and I now have black's DB at b4 which is vulnerable and likely to be captured by my queen if not moved.  This may force the DB to capture my knight.
I castle long which brings my rook to d1 opposite the black queen at d8.  There is a pawn between us so no immediate attack threatened.
Now black moves his queen out to e7 to allow his king to castle.
I move my pawn f2 to f3 to prevent the knight from moving down to e4.
My pawns at f3 and h3 are protected by my LB at g2 and I move my rook over to f1.  I am not sure if I should have moved to e1 as that is the file which the queen is on at e7.  The f1 square is protected by the LB so believe this move to be better.
Black moves his LB back to h7.  I am not sure if this is to retreat so that I forget about him, which is easy to do, and then they shoot out and attack when needed.  He is still pointing at c2 the square above my king on c1.
I move my f1 rook up to f2 to protect the c2 square from the LB.
Black completes a pawn chain with c6 which protects d5.  However he has weakened his king by allowing access to the dark squares on the diagonal f4 to c7 with the king at c8.
I push my d1 rook up to d4 taking control of the 4th rank.
Black moves his f6 knight to d7.
I move my pawn b3 to b4 protected by the queen at c3 and rook at d4.  The black queen is at e7 and there is only a pawn at e3 protected by my queen.
Black pushes his pawn g7 to g5.
I push my f3 pawn to f4 attacking the g5 pawn.  I have the rook at f2 protecting my pawn.
I capture the pawn with my rook and I now have 2 rooks on the 4th rank.
Black moves his d7 knight to f8 to attack my rook by going to squares e6 or g6.  The e6 square would attack both rooks.
Now the rook has moved from f2 I feel my king would be safer across on b1 so that the DB can access c1 square to defend.
As anticipated in my previous comment black now moves his knight to e6 to attack my rooks at d4 and f4.  I say that now but I am not sure I saw this coming in the game.
I move my queen to a3 thinking to attack the king via the 'A' file as only pawns preventing this.
So black moves his a7 pawn to a6 preventing my queen from attacking the square at a7.  I now am on the same diagonal as the black queen at e7 with my pawn at b4 between us.
I push my b4 pawn up and attack the queen looking to exchange but I am protected if she takes whilst she does not have a defender.
The knight does what he came to do and steals a rook at d4 and is attacked by my LB at b2.  Also my rook at f4 is attacking the knight.
Black moves his d8 rook across to e8 and attacks the queen.
I move my queen over to f7 and capture a pawn whilst bringing my queen and rook together on the f file.
Black moves his rook down to e3 and captures my pawn.  Black can check the king on the 1st rank but I am not worried.
I now take the knight on d4 with my f4 rook and I am able to block the rook on e3 should he decide to check the king.  But this may not be needed.
Black moves the rook down to e1 and checks my king.
I move my DB to c1 and block the check.  Black's LB is still at h7 quietly waiting.
Black brings his h8 rook to e8 to join with the e1 rook and take control of the file.
My rook at d4 can only move sideways so cannot immediately act with my queen on f7 to attack black's king so I move the rook down from d4 to d2 beside the king.
I captured black's queen and I have the bishop pair and rook, while black only has 2 rooks.  Black is short on fire power and therefore cannot bring his other rook down to join his e1 rook as this would be captured by my d2 rook.  Also he may be leaving it at e8 as my queen is at f7 and it is the only defender on the back rank.  So he pushes a pawn to d4.  He may be thinking to use this to give him protection if he were to come down the e file with his other rook.
I move my LB to f3 in case black should decide to come down with his other rook it will provide some defence.
Black does bring his e8 rook to e5 using his pawn as protection.  The rook has only one white pawn at b5 which he could take.
I decide to attack the rook at e1 and move my d2 rook down to d1.
Black moves his rook over to c5 and checks the king.  Leaving the pawn at b5, he may regret that.
Black cannot afford to lose his rook on e1 and moves it to the e5 square.
I quickly move my b5 pawn up to b6 and out of black's clutches.  Black's c5 rook is unable to do much as there is a black pawn at c6 so it can only go sideways whilst black's e5 rook can move up the e file to act in defence of the king.
I went with Qc7 using my pawn as defence and checked the king.
King moves to a8 and with Qc8  and pawn at b6 its checkmate.
An alternate line for Black is 11...Qa5+ And after the forced 12.Bd2... Comes 12...Qc7
(?!) According to thorough GM & IM analysis, the wrong path. Black should have played 13...Nxe5 and limited the aggressive nature of White's position on the kingside.
(?) Too far. White is fully mobilised and is now able to - and must! - attack.
(!) The aim of this move is to disrupt the kingside. 15...fxg6 leads to 16.Qxg6+ Kf8 17.Rxe6 With the threat of 18.Nf5... Black cannot rely on a swap of queens either after 17...Qe8 since 18.Nf5! Qxg6 19.hxg6 Nd5 (19...Bb4 20.c3 Ba5 21.Bd6+ Kg8 22.Re7 OR 19...Bd8 20.Bd6+ Kg8 21.Rde1...) with the following 20.Rxe7+! Nxe7 21.Bd6 Re8 22.Re1... with decisive threats to follow.
(!!) A fantastic tactical punchline to the position! This was the only way to continue attacking in this position.
Black has no other (rational) defence. If 16...Nxf4?? Then 17.Nxg7#. 16...fxg6 leads to 17.Nxg7+ Kf7 18.Qxg6+... pending 19.Nxe6+... Lastly, 16...exf5 and 17.Nxe7 Nxe7 (17...Nxf4 18.Nxc6+ Kf8 19.Qa3+... pending 20.Nxd8...) and 18.Bd6... 1-0
(!) 1-0 Beliavsky's candidate for an immortal game against one of the best chess players never to make World Champion. Larsen didn't castle, and as a result had to spend several tempi in passive defence to deflect attacks - hence ruining his development and any chance of winning.
4...not so crazy about the trade...the Caro-K is kind of passive-y, but a little imbalance is to black's advantage.  Retreating the bishop and allowing the trade on g6 is not bad...Fischer always said the doubled pawn formation was almost impossible to attack...sometimes the open h file comes in handy.<n><n>7...Why trade the good black-squared B for White's bad one?...also the trade hands W a tempo...how will black ever get counterplay...he is already behind in development and opening the game will help W, not black.<n><n>8. I might have played N x d2...looking at c5 which is where B's break and counterplay will come...clamping down on the Q-side will reduce B to a waiting game<n><n>11. W has space, and no weaknesses, and better development...this is already a struggle for B<n><n>12. the g4 push  creates an ugly hole on f4 for W, if B could sink a knight  in there, then he can stop W's K-side attacking possibilities. B will have to be careful to guard the h file, maybe playing g5, K up, then bringing the R and Q back to oppose W's buildup there.
15...B should now be winning...sometimes having a pawn advantage in one sector means using them,  even in front of the K...otherwise the pawn "disadvantage" really means more open lines for W who wants to attack here anyway...so B maybe should be trying to make his pawn advantage felt in the center....paradoxical but passivity can be fatal...fight for space
22. Now W threatens a rook lift to h3, in a move or two...how is B going to counter this...not so easy to see how.  B's pawn at e6 impedes his K-side defense, and W owns the g5...d8 small diagonal...so B's defensive options are meager
23...too slow....need to weather the K-side attack before thinking about counterplay
25...too late...the pin, after the check on the h file is going to lose the game for B
kings knight might result in a response like this, but it weakens kings side for black.  If black was worried about losing the pawn, Nc6, Qe7, or Bd6 would have done the job and developed a piece.
but he beat me to it, and moved his first significant piece but it was only to the 2nd row.
now this may not have been the best plan, but here's my thought:  If he doesn't bite at the bishop than I take a free pawn,  If he does take it, read on...
the other option resulted in checkmate
he's going to survive for awhile on that diagonal
taken! now I will pin that queen to the king... what?  their not lined up?
pin.  I chose the king side rook because with Qe8 the kings only escape is the b file and queens rook is still available to strike from there.
oh yeah, now that's it.  Kind of a short game, but an interesting attack.  remember it started with that sacrificed bishop. ok, who wants to play?
? <n>Examined in my book are 4... Nf6 5. e5 d6 6. d4 de5 7. de5 Ng4 8. Bf4 Ndb7 9. Qe2 (with the idea of Qe2) and White has far superior development. <n>4... d5 5. e5 c6 leads towards a line that is reminiscent of the Fisher Variation. <n><n>Here f6 could look to a possible g5 push, but presents Black's knight with only the weak h6 square and g5 gains little.
instead of d4 because now the e4 pawn is defended and the knight can move to d5.
Black has already given White enough compensation for the pawn. 5... d6 6. Bxf4 Nc6 7. Qd2 (with the idea of O-O-O)  =
Attacking the vulnerable queen-side, but Black lags in development. the pawns on c6 and f6 deprive the Knight's of their squares whereas the awkward queen placement and pawn on d7 lock in the bishops.
A weaker move, Be2 preparing for castling is better, as is Nd2 allowing the queen to come to f3 with threats on the weak Black king.
Black wants to develop and is eying the weakened b4 square.
Seems to lose a pawn, but Black's bigger problem is development, trading the bishop trades away his only good piece.
To averse to trading another good black piece for a weak white one.
Looking to open the file, perhaps slightly better is 14. Rfe1, but as White starts to break open Black's fragile position many moves fit the bill.
! Defending the bishop and eying h5. 17.... b6 fails to 18. Bxb6<n>The weaknesses in Black's open and undeveloped position are starting to tell, 17...Kf8 is probably advisable, 18. Rbe1 bg4 19. Bd3 Qd7  -
Giving White time to set up a fierce attack.
Black resigns in light of a many lines to mate after Ne7 then either Rxe7 or Bxe7.<n>The position to start the mate in six is puzzle 8435.
This ugly move is necessary before developing the King Knight, if Black wants to (try to) hold on to his advanced pawns. Not being forced to spend a tempo on this move is one of the advantages of 4...g4.
?! I don't like this push as much as I would like e4-e5. The text creates a hole on e5 and gives the Black Bishop pretty much unlimited scope on the long diagonal.
For an opening in which White sacrifices a pawn for extra space, his position sure is cramped. He needs to expand on the queenside, but the placement of his Knight and Bishop are preventing the freeing pawn moves he needs.
Pinning the Knight, and hoping to induce 12.h3 Bh5 to keep the the Bishop in action yet out of the way of an eventual ...g4 push.
?! This move was really unexpected at the time, but it's actually a kind-of okay way of transferring forces over to the kingside to defend against Black's mounting assault, assuming White uses the next several moves efficiently. I think 13.Rf1 and eventual Kh2 is more straightforward, though. White's already committed to the kingside; he might as well try to get comfy there.
Perfect spot for this Knight--not only threatening to jump to h4, but also prepared to replace the other Knight on e5 to keep the pressure up. This is the critical moment, now. Black's forces are all prepared to bust open the White position; White's pieces are cramped and misaligned. The attack is on.
The now-isolated h-pawn and the backward f-pawn are Black's new targets. The next several moves are designed to lock White's pieces in the corner where they'll be least effective. Watch how each move forces White's replies; pulling the Rook away from the center and removing the defense of d4 for a powerful check from the DSB.
Mission accomplished. All the defenders have been removed, forces are in place all around the WK, and now the attack can begin in earnest.
Normally exchanging a powerful, active piece for a passive one is not a great idea, but in this case Black not only has the chance to eliminate a critical defender, but also wins at least one more pawn by removing the Knight.
We're twenty moves in and the WK really doesn't have much of a castle to speak of anymore. There are an awful lot of pieces leveled at him, but not enough for a forced mate if White plays carefully.
The White King must avoid e2 of course, since ...Bxf3+ would win the Queen.
The next part of the plan will be to keep the WK on f1 while vacating h2 and maintaining the initiative. In this way, Black will be threatening ...Nh2+! with a discovered attack on the WQ. For as long as he threatens that--which can be a long time, thanks to the misplaced Bb3 that cannot reach the kingside--Black will be able to do as he pleases while White is forced to spend time covering himself.
Mission accomplished. As a bonus, with the Queen on h4, White can no longer play Bxf4 to relieve some of the pressure. Now, with plenty of time and tempo, Black can bring additional forces to bear.
A last-ditch effort to create counterplay down the long diagonal, but it is not enough.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is the first of two games when I get into a reasonable position with a Master and an Expert and then I end up overplaying my hand.  In this game, Dave apparently walks into a knight fork, but he then showed me that things are not always what they seem.  Dave hit me with an even bigger stinger from the Wicked Witch of the West.  How does this happen?  Well, it is a case of looking at the Gameknot Analysis http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17205702&fb=1&rnd=0.547893998411963 and the commentary below.  The game starts with the Reti Opening which provides a lot of flexibility to white.
12. exd3 - Dave solidifies his pawn structure on the queenside.
12. ..... Rb8?! Dave gave the following comments to this move.  12 ..... 0-0 was probably better 13 Bf7 may be worth a look 14 Nec6 is probably better and Bxb2 on move 15 gave you better chances.
17. Rb1 - after this move there are just too many black pieces en prise and not enough white!  After a final tot up I saw that there was no way I could avoid being a piece light so I decided there and then to wave the white flag.
This game was perhaps not the most exciting from an artistic point of view, but there was a lot of tension and fighting spirit. The quality of play was higher than in most of my games, with no side making any serious mistake.
The bishop is a little exposed on this diagonal, but it prevents black's d5 push for the moment. For instance, 7.Be2 0-0 8.0-0 d5! is unpleasant for white.
To counter the threat of Ng4, white had to play either f3 or h3. Entering the Yugoslav attack with 9.f3 is probably the most critical, but it can be very painful to play white, at least in a game with less time on your clock. I used to think this h3 move was a good practical choice, but after some games, including this one, I've changed my mind. Now I believe the Maroczy bind is a better practical choice against the accelerated dragon if you want to avoid the complications of the Yugoslav attack.
A novelty which I had analyzed extensively beforehand. It doesn't look natural at all to give away this bishop, but there is some logic behind the move. Eliminating the f6 knight takes away some pressure from e4. White had to depart with his last bishop, but it would have been badly placed anyway. Now he is hoping to use the extra tempo to start an attack on the queenside. He is also trying to prove the claim that two well placed knights in the centre can be just as strong as the two bishops.
White is using his pawns as spearheads in a desperate try to create weaknesses in the black camp.
The black position is now so solid that he can play this move without having to fear for his d6 pawn. His queen will now enter on the kingside.
Further weakening the kingside, but it was very hard to defend with the enemy queen on f4.
On 28.f4 gxf3 29.Rxf3 Bxe4! was a killer. Now white is pretending to threaten it, but it's unclear if such a loose move is ever good.
It was possible to capture on b6. Black doesn't really care, since he has a serious attack on the kingside and the white pawns are going nowhere. Still, it might have been objectively best.
It is noteworthy that both Rybka and Fritz think white is significantly better here, when in fact he is struggling for a draw. After having easily parried white's temporary threats, black is now intending to push h5-h4 with a decisive kingside attack. I think I managed to find the only way to save the position.
I had to go for this and hope for the best.
This is the best try, because now the white king has to take a walk. The position takes on a forced character. Both sides managed to find the best moves.
At this point the game was drawn more or less from mutual respect. Play might continue 58.Rxd1 gxf3 59.Nxf3. The white king will flee to the kingside and there are no real winning chances for either side.
up two, and time to completely dominate the board
this was an honest mistake on his part, and it ate up 30 seconds on my clock trying to figure out his devious scheme. I found none so i took the queen.
a good game, but it was just me assuming what they would do. I probably made some mistakes along the way for this person's moves after 26, but it was obvious I was going to win this game
This was a game where i had to draw with 2 whole rooks up ahead.
I'm not sure why i did this, it is not right in the Sicilian for black to take control of the center.
Not letting black play, Rb8 with the a pawn hanging.
Forced to take it.
The standard response, developing the lsb outside the pawn chain.
The start of White's exploitation of the exposed position of Black's Bishop.  White gains tempi to establish a formidable territory on the kingside.
?!  This is mainly the result of me mis-remembering the line (which is just the first game in Kotronias's book).  Looking quickly through the book, I can only find a few examples of Ng3 being played early by White and none of them are in similar positions to this.  The objective is to prevent Black from playing ...Be4, disturbing White's KR.  However, it does invite Black to disturb White's pawn structure.  Better was an immediate 7. h4, when, if Black plays 7...Be4, White can play 8. Rh3 followed by Ng3 to chase off the bishop.
?! Another dubious move.  As Eddie said, Black should play this line like a Nimzo-Indian, only swapping the B for N when pushed to.  This exchange does weaken White's queenside pawns but Black fails to follow it up to exploit the weakness.  Better was 7...c5.
I usually refrain from swapping off these bishops until I have to (or it's too late!)  However, on this occasion, I felt that it was a good gain of tempi to swap off a B that has made one move for one in which Black has invested 3 already.  The swap would also develop my Q to a good square.
White castles behind his far-flung pawns in order to accelerate the attack by supporting the f-pawn to advance.  With his queenside in disarray, castling long was no more attractive than this and leaving the K in the centre would encourage Black to exploit the weakness on c3 sooner rather than later.  The risk of this strategy is that, in attacking with his kingside pawns, White over-stretches and his King is exposed to lethal fire from Queen and Rooks on the open files thus created.  Alternatively, Black gets Queen and Knights behind enemy lines and wreaks havoc.
This move momentarily gave me concern that the N was about to come to c4 but I soon decided that that was nothing much to worry about, so I continued on my merry way.
! The position I had been aiming for, threatening to advance the f-pawn again and open lines to Black's uncastled king.  If Black castles kingside, it looks like he is walking into a pawn storm (which look more frightening than it really is if you analyse it).  Black sank into a long think ...
!? White presses on with his strategy.  Also possible were 15. Ba3 and 15. Be3, inhibiting ...c5 but inviting Black to play ...Nc4, when the bishop either has to move again or be swapped off.
White aims either to swap pawns here and thus develop the bishop to a good square or further advance to pawn to secure an outpost on f7 for his rook.  I now had 57 minutes to my opponent's 34.
!  White pins the N against the Q and, by threatening to capture on g7, ties Black up in knots trying to defend it.
?! Look at Black's pitiful rooks, stuck in the corner.  I thought ...Rhg8 was better, aesthetically at least, though White could have responded with 19. Qh7.  Perhaps 18...c4 to push the Q off that diagonal before moving the rook to defend g7 would have been better, also fixing White's weaknesses on c3 and c2 to enable a swift counter-attack with an appropriately timed ...Qa4
It was finally time to do something with this bishop, which was preventing my rooks from coordinating with each other.  Black wasn't about to oblige me by swapping on g5, so I decided to go the other way, attacking c5 and skewering it to the N on e7.  Now 19...c4 20 Rxe7 cxd3 21. Rxd7 Kxd7 might have been interesting, though 20. Qf3 would have been sounder.
Black releases the pin and tries to shoo the annoying rook away.
!  No need to double rooks on the f-file.  Take aim directly at the King!  It was about time that I occupied this half-open file, which had been unattended since move 8.
...c4 was urgently required to prevent White's next.  The attack on White's Q would have given Black time then to move the knight safely.
I hadn't "seen" this but, in fact, it isn't much use.  While it appears to simultaneously defend b7 and attack the Rf7 it can't actually do both.  White can ignore the attack on the rook because of the mating attack on b7
Don't mind this. A push to f4 reopens the diagonal and secures a grip on the e5 square.
Basically forces the exchange with Black's queen now at e7.
Black can now play dxc4 if he wants, but it's only an even trade (Bxc6)
Preparing to double the rooks on the c-file. The threat of cxd5 soon becomes something for Black to be concerned about.
Finally breaking the menacing of this rook by White's bishop on the a8-h1 diagonal, but now Black loses a pawn.
Black's c-pawn was pinned before this move, and remains pinned after.
Although this bishop was not under immediate duress, White decides to retreat it back to g2, in order to advance his d-pawn.
Beginning a transfer of the rooks from the c-file, where they have done great work, to the e-file, where they can create back rank issues for Black.
With his knight maneuver, Black has the White d-pawn overmatched--it is attacked three times and only defended twice. But Black absolutely cannot yet take the pawn on account of 26. Qe8+, which would win at least the knight. So he clears room for his king.
White trades queens. As it turns out, the d-pawn really is weak, but White decides to trade it off for Black's a-pawn, which will also give White one rook on the seventh rank, and possibly two at some later point.
Black tries to save the a-pawn first, but this move fails to a one-move tactic.
Black's chances go from slim before to none now.
By creating this, I am hoping to learn some better moves from the veteren players and showing off a mediocre win against a player under 1000. It's been a while since I last played on gameknot....
My method for chess at the moment is to try to get as many pieces as I can. This may not work so well in higher chess matches, but it tends to work decently in the lower leagues. This move is an attempt to save my pawn, if he chooses to take it.
I knew that the right side of my board was covered by a row of pawns...it would be hard to try to attack in that situation.
I've seen this used many times, and I thought I'd give it a try. This makes it hard for bishops (mostly) and other pieces to get close to the main part of my "fleet".
This was a multi purpose move. It prevented that bishop from ever coming near my rook, and protected the pawn above the queen.
I didn't think it would be wise to move my knight back to where it came from. The only other logical choice was here. Unfortunatly, my lack of vision cost me.
Was this the right thing to do? I wanted to try to gain a pawn after losing a knight to try to make the "score" more even. But I'm not sure if I saw that bishop.
As I said before, I wanted to gain back some pieces to even our score.
This is where I actually started thinking. You see now that the bishop is not protected. If I move my bishop to the spot diagnal to the rook, I could scare it off and take down the rook. That would easily make up the loss.
It just depended on weather or not he cared about leaving his bishop alive, or saw my tactic.
I don't understand this. He appeared to have seen my tactic before, but now he seems oblivous to the fact I can still take it down. Perhaps he didn't see my move before, or wasn't paying attention this time around?
It's a easy mate I'm trying to build up to, as the knight will support the queen in checkmate. I was fairly sure he would see it, but he had been oblivious in the past.
If I wasn't paying attention, I may have had to take a taste of my own medicine.
The pawn stops the queens attack, and further brings more pieces on my attack on the king. This pawn actually helped me get the mate.
I was planning to move that pawn (diagnal to the rook) to scare of the queen from the area of my king. I needed something to protect the knight though. I liked this because I made him think I was castleing when in reality I was not.
My move I was planning for...
I didn't want a knight helping the queen get a mate. He was too close. I had to destroy it.
I think this was easy to predict.
I could use my strategy from earlier in the game and take another rook.
All I need to do is move the bishop (with the rook protecting) and I've got a rook.
I assume he wants to move the pawn diagnal the bishop, move the queen, put my king in check and take the rook. When one uses a move very often, they aren't likely to be fooled by it. I'm not going to let him take advantage of me, especially at this stage.
I'm not scared of the queen putting me in check if it moves directly vertical to the king.. All I need to do is move one space to the right and the bishop (at the other side of the board) will support my position. Too bad black was too late to move his pawn out of the way for his bishop to take my rook. And look! I can get his king in check once the queen moves out of the way!
Too bad he is too late to make a legitamite attack on my bishop. At the very least, it gives black's queen some support.
I thought this over a bit, and the best move was to take the knight.
By doing this, the rook is protected and I've taken down yet another value piece.
Thinking back on it, was this the correct time to move his king, or should he try attempt a last chance attempt on my king?
Do you not remember the pawn I talked about? It forms support for the other pawn to strike. And the king can only move to two spaces...both checkmate.
He chooses the path through the pawns. This is not as ovious a mate if he were to move toward my rook. There was nothing else he could do.
Checkmate. My opponent was good at times, but he was inconsistent in his defenses. I will have to play him again this mini tournament, and I know what moves I'll be maing. Please tell me your opinions on the game, and better moves to make in the future. Thanks for your help.
White stops my counter attack on the queenside. Since the d & c pawns are fixed and my e7, d6, c5 pawn chain points to the queen side; you then attack on that side.
Knocking off the bishop
And here I missed e6, one of the crucial moves in forming a bennoi formation. But I never play it!
12. f4...Neg4
I play a gambit to open the a1-h8 diagonal and to activate my bishop. The King's Indian can go for a long time so it's best to start the attack.<n>(Or 14...h5 15. f4...Neg4)
Moving the Knights in order to free my bishop
Now I have the bishop pair
Now I had to regroup and I was going to play e6 but never got around to it
As Black I prefer Petrov to Ruy Lopez and it is one of the main lines I play.
Adding pressure to the c knight in a pin against the king.
I think that White is better if they take my knight on c6, causing me to double up some pawns, as this play allows me to double and isolate his c pawns completely, which could cause some trouble later on.
Threatening my knight, protecting the c3 pawn, and developing some threats against my kingside.  I probably still would have taken the knight on c6 instead.
I considered d5 to see if White would let me post my knight up the board, but opted for this play to trade my knight for a bishop.  Long term I think d5 was a better play, but I don't think I lose much by doing this trade.  If possible I'd rather not have an open board and face off against two bishops.
Getting my rook to an open file...
My last was not quite a tempo, since it also helped White develop.
Freeing up a path for my LSB and seeking to capitalize on my center pawn advantage.
I like the initiative.  White's c pawn is isolated and alone, and if Black is willing to trade a good b pawn for a bad c pawn, then it's to White's advantage.
Removing the rook threat and preparing to advance my own c pawn.
Seeking to protect the c pawn.  It is sometimes difficult to see the best moves in open boards like this one.  If he leaves his Queen where it is, c5 is an obvious follow up and grants a tempo move.  I might have considered Qd2 or possibly even Qa4 instead, however.
As it is no longer protected, time to strike while the iron is hot.  Now Black has three connected passed pawns.  If White cannot disrupt that pawn chain, any one of those pawns will get traded for a piece down the road.
This play is a mistake on my part.  I didn't analyze the board well enough.  Instead I should have moved my queen to either d7 of d5, to connect my rooks and give me more center power projection.  I allowed White to do a power play against my King with <n>20.	Rxe8	Qxe8<n>21.	Be5	f6<n>22.	Bxd4<n><n>As soon as I clicked send I saw my mistake.  :(
This move was unexpected by White.  I am assuming it was designed to build pressure against my King by a follow-on Rh8.
Seeking to get my bishop actively back in the defense, and seeing if there are any chances to keep my center pawns.
Now I finally lose the center pawn I threw away in 19 ... c4.  While I am still ahead and in effect winning the game, the prospects are not as bright as when I had the three passed pawns.  That pawn at f5 is going to be trouble for me if I don't have sharp play.
Seeking to finally get my queen centralized and get my rook into the action.
Now White is materializing some potential threats with Rh3.  White should also have seriously considered Bc3, to get his bishop out of immediate queen threat, and have the potential to control the f8 square with Bb4.
Getting my rook into the game and moving to the open e file.
This move was a mistake in my opinion.  I am assuming that the idea was Qxf6 and a pinned King.  Other moves worth considering are Qf2 or Bc3.
I seriously considered Re4 and should have played it instead as it ensured more material gain.  What I was looking at as a response was <n>27.	Rg3	Re4<n>28.	Rxg7+	Kxg7<n>29.	Qxf6+<n><n>I think I would have been fine after a more detailed review, but I opted to play Qxf5 to remove the f pawn threat and give me a little more breathing room.
Blunder Mate 7.  I expected White to play Rf3, which would have seen me play Qb1+ in response to start working my pawn down the board.
Black showed some good thinking in game and was able to leverage pins and set up some strong threats.  I think he is doing well overall and should continue to rise in the chess ranks.  Thank you for your comments and good luck in your chess endeavors.
My move here according to book is 4. cxe5 and it makes a great deal of sense to me but I was unaware of the standard continuation and the game is into the unknown for me now.
Black has a slight developmental advantage now but has lost the light squared Bishop
I wanted to keep open the possibility of the Bishop pair and did not play 8. Bd2 offering an exchange.
Generally in the Queen's Gambit Declined it is best not to take this pawn before White moves the Bishop to d3. I gain back my Tempo lost by retreating the Queen and develop a piece into a strong position now that Black's only central pawn is pushed forward
The Bishop doesn't have the e7 square anymore
This gives me the Bishop pair and further fortifies the d-pawn. I thought 11. ... Bd6 was probably better
Preventing my Bishop from getting to the b5 square and eventually taking the Knight and doubling Black's pawns. I wasn't particularly interested in such a minor gain for the loss of my Bishop pair and think this was a further waste of time.
I'm hoping to get my Queen to either a4 or b3 threatening to penetrate the Queenside
Offering the Queen trade as my Queen on the seventh rank is extremely dangerous.
Now the Knight is going to have an extremely difficult time penetrating into White's defensive area and with my material advantage Black decided that it was time to resign. There are no immediate threats but it will be very difficult to prevent White from using the Rooks to force a trade losing Black's last effective piece. I was pleased with my play in this game particularly because I was coming off of two games where I played relatively poorly.
A reasonable move, in keeping with controlling the center.
My opponent firmly in the center, now I take a minute to decide what it is I wish to do. And I have a plan; I will castle, and try to prevent white from gaining more space while keeping the board has complicated as I can, which is not what I usually do, and then I'll look for a way to wrest the initiative away from white by causing as many threats as I can, if he doesn't keep me on the defensive. Most games, for those who've seen my annotated games, I try to squeak out a small advantage and turn it into a winning endgame. Not so this one! Soon the position will become very fun.
I make the best move here, that Fritz likes. It forces white to admit that his seventh move was a mistake.
Although not one of Fritz's top two choices, it is not a bad move to see how white will respond before trading bishops or castling. Plus, I don't absolutely have to trade bishops, although not doing so on my next turn may end up costing me a tempo.
This move is not one of Fritz's favorites either, but it's no blunder. Better was the bishop, so the knight would have the f3 space available.
Better was Be6 or Bd7. But I wanted either of two things: to provoke pawn advances on the Kingside, where the white king protection will prove weaker later, or failing that, to keep some pressure indirectly on that diagonal. Now whether or not that is wise in this position is debateable, and probably not such a good choice, since the bishop won't be really that active until things change. I am assuming white will castle kingside. You know what they say about making assumptions... ;)
Whew. Got away with one there. Not a good way to play, but in Blitz this happens. White still has a slight advantage here, but soon I hope to change that.
...and this move really surprised me. Will it take white too long to get his king behind the pawns? Immediately I castle next...
And now it is black with a slight advantage according to Fritz.
Now this is interesting to me, because white sees he can mount a threatening attack in the center. But does so before getting his King in a more safe position. Is it worth the risk?
After a brief think, I decide to see if I can keep the white king away from a1, thinking I'll be able to defend adequately.
I thought about moving a rook to pin the knight here. But now the game is getting complicated, and I did not like the white bishop move to a6 followed by the h file rook moving to e1.Things might just end up getting simplified, but I want more. After thinking some, I decided to let my queen be chased a little.
But instead of Re1, or other moves Fritz happened to like, white thinks to add his own pressure, but it's not real. The knight can still be pinned if but for a minute. And here I begin to see some interesting possibilities involving a queen sacrifice by me. I don't expect my opponent to miss it, but it will further complicate the board, and so I think, why not? Usually in Blitz I don't do that, because it's too easy to miss stuff. And of course, more accurate would be a6, leading to the eventual loss of the white d pawn, or worse for white. But it's Blitz, I don't think of that during this game, occupied with thoughts of creating interesting possibilities with discovered check on the white king. So instead...
Finally, white begins to think about his king protection and getting another threat going by advancing his pawns. He would do well to trade off a few pieces by Bb4, but chooses something else...
There is better for black to do here, but I simply respond with...
It's funny; we are both missing the little things we can do to gain advantages around the a through d files, and are wasting time maneuvering on the f through h files here. That won't continue long. I really just wanted space for my bishop to retreat so I could keep that diagonal under pressure. I'm done messing over there; I don't even care if I lose that h pawn at this point, because doubled white pawns on the h file will take a while to become a threat, and will be weak besides.
And now my attention is elswhere. I believe white doesn't have time to do anything good for himself over there, and so I begin to think again on what I can do to cause trouble for white's king after the brief distraction.
And now I decide here, after having seen this position some moves ago, to take the knight with the rook. I should have used the a rook, but oh well.
Alas, white gets greedy and doesn't really look at the position. The mate in one is not hard to spot here, and I had been aware of nearly this exact position for some moves now, not expecting to see the opportunity to make the mate happen.
With the escape square covered, and two pieces delivering check, the king cannot escape. Although this game was filled with several minor errors, it was still fun to create a complicated position, and play it inasmuch as it was. Here's hoping you enjoyed the sharp positions!
he opens up the black bishop for some reason,  the king side seems real srtong and I have no pieces developed.
I really don't like my pawn hanging out there by itself in the middle.  the only support would seem to overdevelop the queen .
he does the anticipated move, maybe giving me a slight chance to recapture some tempo (whatever the f*** that is)
I thought about Nf6 but wanted to open up my black bishop towards the middle, maybe not the best move, but I did it anyway
not exactly the way I wanted to clear out my kingside castle, but I hate the fact that he has his bishop there.
I take with the N to make it possible for me to castle
I really should have castled then I think. but my kingside is now strong
I didn't want him to Ng5 to attack my bishop, so I pushed here istead of castling
to me,  this was a weird time for him to do this,  I really didn't give a rip about the bishop for Knight swap, so I FINALLY castle
he applies some presure to stack another set of pawns.
I don't see any advantage to stacking more pawns, so I try to go for a swap to get the pressure off my weak side
I alleviate some of the pressure,  I can't overlaod the queen
I bring in more support,  I don't want to give up any more pawns.  I thought about a5 and decided against it.
I am thinkinig I need to get his queen off my weak side...  I don't know any other way to do it... ssoooooo
This is another chance for me to get the momentum,  ....i mean  yeah  he had to support his pawn at c4.....
first things first.  I can't take h2,  that is a death trap, I go ahead and bring the queen to safety also thinking I may get the pawn back.
it looks like he is loading up to come straight down the middle  and why not,,,  I would
well  a swap... his king is partially exposed,,,  I ahve a place to hide my king...  so I take a swap here..  I can't think with so many pieces anyway.
it doesn't   he gets to develop the knight if I do...
I go ahead and tak the pawn  hoping to get his queen off base a little...  I am figureing on moving my knight to get it in the fray.
I don't have a good place to put the knight right now.  so I stall by putting him in check.  I thought about Qh5 , but I wanted to shove the king to the middle, which is where I want to attack
he pushes it toward the middle, but I didn't think of that ,  it limits his knights mobility which has been suffering the whole game. (move 12)<n>I looke at this a while, focusing on the knight rook and king fork if I take c4...I think about putting presssure on c4  either with my  queen or ra4....
! -- Secures the draw. There's no shelter from the storm of Black checks.
Usual development - preparing rook to e1 and Queen to c2 to increase pressure on e4 (which will eventually follow)
Black wants to castle too
Developing another piece - more pressure on e4
Aligning queen with the bishop on d3 - preparing attack on h7 once the black knight is removed.
which white is trying to use - developing bishop with a tempo
has to move. White has advantage in terms of space.
Preventing black knight from developing to g4 - white want black to stay in that "compact" state.
Since attack on h7 is not going to happen, moving queen to a better square protecting the bishop
Surprise - This black bishop can become quite strong on this diagonal. Also it is a black king defender
... so better to remove it.
Black also doesn't mind to open it up.
keeping black's white-squared bishop diagonal closed. Pawn on e5 is weak.
protecting b5 square  -both knight on c3 and bishop on d3 wouldn't mind to get there!
Supporting pawn on e5 and bringing another rook into the game. Mistake - should have played Rc3. White queen is overloaded - protecting 2 pieces at once (knight on g5 and bishop on d3)
White's pieces are better developed - pushing pawns forward with the idea to open up the black king more
Fatal mistake - this also happens to me - when analysing different ways to respond you forget the obvious - the queen is still under attack.
can avoid the exchange.  22... Qc5
black should avoid the bonding of the pawns. not too late with 27... a5. if 28. Kc3 then 28... Rc8
2. f3 - unusual line.  Not the best move because it takes away the best square for white's king knight and more importantly opens up the Fool's Mate Diagonal (e1-h4).  The Dentist must now watch out for a queen check on h4.  Better was 2. e5 (main line) or 2. Nc3 or even 2. d3.
3. ..... Nxe4 - hmm, this is gonna be like Damiano's Defense in reverse.  The main line of Damiano's Defense goes like this. 1. e4 e5, 2. Nf3  f6?! 3. Nxe5 - it is best to decline the sacrifice by playing the Macgregor-Chigorin line with 3. ..... Qe7 - otherwise if the sac is accepted then this leads to black either losing the exchange, losing 5 pawns or Copping Old Matey - do you still wanna accept this sacrifice?  Well, with colours reversed the Dentist did just that!
5. Ke2 - if 5. g3 then The Dentist will drop the exchange by Qxe4+ (nasty, nasty queen fork!)
7. Kg3? - this is a mistake according to the gameknot analysis.  GK suggested d4 here, although it gives up a pawn at least that move does open up a diagonal for the white dsb which will crucially defend the square f4 from a very nasty queen check there.
8. ..... h5 - a mating net closes in on the WK.
11. Kg2 - The dentist played this move and then realised horror of horrors that he was about to be Freddied by the move Qf2#!  He then resigned the game on the grounds of unavoidable mate - I think he is yet unaware that Freddy expressly forbids resignation on the grounds of unavoidable mate and frowns upon any resignation whatsoever.  After this, The Dentist bravely challenges Master Freddy to another game, I will soon be annotating about how he fares in Game 2 - well, he loses but he does put up stronger resistance next time round - watch this space.
d5 starts off the attack and the sac...
The bishop invites the king out to play.
The bishop gives up its life in order to draw the king completely into the open. Black was trying to find shelter with ..f5. Now perhaps..bf5  isn't necessary, but I found a long mating net. That seemed a pretty sure thing. On the other hand, if the king can avoid check for just one move, the black queen will probably insert herself into the situation and white's attack will be halted. <n><n>Here is what may happen.<n><n><n>(black to move)<n>1.	e4	b6<n>2.	d4	Bb7<n>3.	c4	Bxe4<n>4.

Notice the count.  The Queen and the Bishop attacking the Knight who has only one defender.  If you had retreated your Queen to d3 instead of e5 you would not have this problem.
If you had taken the Bishop with the Rook you would not have lost the Rook.
-0.54/18 12

Forking the king and rook and threatning c2.
Signals the Yugoslav Attack variation. In this variation of the Dragon, white often aims to play f3 first to prevent any ...Ng4 ideas to trade off the DSB. Then white will play Qd2, O-O-O, and Bh6, removing the vital kingside defender. After all this, he will launch a devastating pawn storm with g4, h4, etc., opening up files to the Black king. However black shall not simply sit back and let this happen, and he wants to play moves such as Nc6 and Bd7 to develop, and then Rc8 (utilizing the half open c-file), move the queen to the queenside and then play b5, looking for counter-play on the opposite flank. This almost certainly leads to very dynamic and fun games, where it can end up being who gets to the king first!
!? I sacrifice my lesser than bishop to try to blow open White's defenses and play for the win. Now might I say this line is probably not sound at all, as with good defense White will come out winning once Black's attack fizzles. But this line requires a decent knowledge of the theory that follows, and very natural moves often end up getting rolled over by Black's fast attack.
The critical position. I have 2 pawns for the piece, as well as a great pawn chain, and I am now ready to exchange off White's dear e3 bishop. Plus development is extremely easy, and soon enough, my attack will hopefully run as a smooth engine.
?? Nononono, my opponent did not consider carefully enough the dangers of this position. Surely he didn't think I was going to sacrifice my piece for merely 2 pawns! Here White should have tried 11. Nb3!, which gets out of the powerful a1-h8 diagonal my "dragon bishop" is radiating over, and regrouped from there. However, now I get to play a nice tactic which all but seals up the game. See if you can spot it!
This move seems silly, as 1) exchanging when you are down material is rarely a good option and 2) now White can challenge my control of the strong diagonal. How will I achieve any counterplay now?! Well you see, at this very moment the a1-h8 diagonal isn't quite the most important one, and diverting White to that diagonal allows me to take the one he previously occupied.
!! One of the great points of this piece sacrifice is the knight on g4 now supports the bishop possibly coming to this diagonal, and in this case it does so in a convincing fashion. With the queen pinned, my win is virtually inevitable.
Bringing my pieces into action. Simply being up material isn't enough to be able to kick back, enjoy a beverage and forget the game! No, you must use your advantage and bring out your extra pieces to the fight!
White is forced to exchange off this knight for one off his bishops. When you are up material, it is often good to exchange material and then go into an endgame, where your material will be significantly more pronounced than in the middlegame.
A decent attempt to try and get some sort of play, now he hopes I take this pawn, opening up dangerous files to my king.
One of my students challenged me to a game. Although the game is a bit one-sided, there is a nice finish to the game. See if you can spot it! Black is a beginner, and doesn't make the best first move
OK, black to play. What is the quickest way to win?
Limiting the influence of the would-be finachettoed bishop and attempting to control the center, also d5 or c5 were both possible
This develops a piece and prepare for castling as e5 wastes time and inceases the influence of the finachettoed bishop.
Mistake, now white exchanged his bishop fo a knight without gaining any advantage, if it was afte a6 then this move wouldn't have been too bad.
Now white has blocked the way of his own fianchettoed bishop!
Really poor move, Ne2 was better, after that I can't take the pawn. Now white is in trouble!
Mistake, white closed the situation with no advantage for him, cxd5 was far better and then he could attack through his half-open c file!
Bringing force to the combat zone, and I was thinking I could play Nxe3 aftewards which puts the white in serious trouble
Good move, This attemps to win a rook fo a minor piece!
clearing any obstacles in my way to the mate!
White is helpless now and the mate is soo, it just a matter of How to execute it!
Clearing the way fo my rook to step in
Now here I was considering sacrificing my queen for a quick mate, 27. ... QxNh3 28. Qxh3 g4  29. Kh2 hxg3  ... etc, but I realized that the white's king has a safe spot [f4] and I needed to control it.
Up a pawn. I need to drive home this advantage.
This game is very instructional. We must follow the basic guidelines of chess to win.
Get a pawn in the center.
Castling not for safety, but to develop the rook.
Now I want the two bishop advantage. I need to trade this knight for one of his bishops. In the endgame play will be on both sides of the board. A bishop can easily watch both sides of the board whereas a knight cannot. With Bishop over knight and a pawn up the win would be very feasible.
He seems to want to help my plan.
This is to force the knight to a less inactive square, even if for only a move, and to activate my other rook.
I have achieved the two bishop advantage. The won game is nearing. Now if I could trade a bishop for his bishop. And get the rooks off the board. The win will be much closer.
Attacks c6 and centralizes my Bishop.
Now his d pawn is isolated. A good pawn to attack.
Notice this also shift one pawn to the kingside for a 4 to two advantage.
This move might seem strange. I have planned and planned to have this advantage and now I want to trade the Bishop for the knight. However Iam up two pawns now instead of one and the knight serves as counterplay.
Instead of getting a Q and chasing his king around to mate I want to mate him quickly.
Just to break the pin on the knight.
It seems best to take as retreating allows the pin. Also, this is my bad bishop and his good bishop with the current pawn structure. I didn't want to take the knight with the bishop since he could plant his bishop on b5 and cause minor irritation.
Defending the pawn and prevent Nd3.
?? This loses the knight. b6 was better to provide an escape square.
13. ... Na4 was another possibility
Getting the knight to f4 is good. Black should probably castle though or push f5 and storm my knights
This is better since my d pawn cannot be taken. Try to find why.
! Where can black's queen safely move? There are other bishop moves by white that trap the queen.
Better to take with the queen to threaten the knight.
Against this I'm at a total loss, so I improvise. Sometimes I try to fianchetto the lsb in b7, but it is not really a confortable game. So I tried something different.
Now, if I allow c5, my game gets really cramped, so I have to get my dsb out quickly.
This assures me to exchange bishops, and not fear white's dsb to threat my knight on f6. This makes me able to prepare calmly the e5 break (or the f5 one).
Uff, so it seems that cxd will help me to develop. But I wanted to play solid, and the semi open c column can become a kind of problem for me. Nxd4 allows inmediately e4, so...
I didn't want to lose a tempo, but I still wanted to force the dsb's exchange.
Ok, now I can move it, since no Qxb2 is in sight. And this threatens Nxg3 at once.
Tempo to develop.
If Nh4, g6, and after the exchange, play for defending the 2 pawn's chain. Affordable, but this is better for me.
If f3, e3, Nd4, defending the advanced pawn. I'll probably lose it, since I have not castled yet, but...
...but I wanted to take advantage of my own free semicolumn. And if d5, after cxd my rook can get into the game again.
Renewing the threat. Now white has to lose a pawn.
THIS is the pawn I win, in the long term. True is that white has Ra1, but white cannot play d5 since I can take at ease, my e pawn is defended by the rook. Probably white could have tried something, but I cannot see the danger. Ra1, Kd7 and my king comes on time to defend b7. Not Rb2: if Ra1, Rb2, Ra7, Bc8, Nxc6 (b7 would be pinned).
offering bishop exchange with the idea of BxBe6,fxBe6 and then black can advance d5
The queens exchange works in black favor thanks to the favorable material and positional advantage
black gives up his white square bishop to preserve his two menacing pawns
white should have left the Rook where it was to help defend the back rank
I initiate the exchange because I think it will end in my favor.
This move was actually my first "mistake" according to the computer analysis, which favored "d4" instead.  At my level, I disagree that this was a mistake, and I actually think that this was one of my pivotal moves.  The computer analysis shows that the best response to b6 is qb5+.  However, that doesn't give white any obvious gain (Bd7 response), so few players at my level would choose that.<n><n>I like my move and would use it again because of the powerful threats against white's queen and knight (which I eventually took).  I thought that white would likely retreat, and I would move pxc5.  Instead, white fell for the bait.  That put me at -2, but I quickly responded by taking white's knight and pawn and pinning white's king and a1 rook for the entire rest of the game.
In my opinion, this was my worst move of the game.  The computer analysis labels it as a mistake in favor of "Ne4".  White could have advanced to b7 to win my bishop, but neither mrshtaba nor the computer analysis picked up on this. <n><n>Anyway, in the end, this move was essentially just a wasted move.  I think that I should have castled or moved the bishop to b7 instead.  I wanted to focus on the right side, and I don't think that Ne4 would have progressed to mate as quickly.
I am not worried at all about what is going on on the left side of the board.  My knight is playing the crucial role of eliminating the threat of the advanced pawn in addition to dislodging either white's knight or b1 rook.
White just blocked off his only escape route giving me mate in 2.  However, the alternative (Kd1) would have given me a 13 point lead.  With those alternatives, the best thing is probably just to hope your opponent makes a mistake.
We've reached what is basically every King's Gambit's player's nightmare; black is simply better, and it's hard to formulate a plan for white.   The text is pretty much a waiting move; the knight is unable to get to a square from where it can target f7, so the bishop will likely be better deployed on the b1-h7 diagonal.
Aiming to support an e5 push without ending up with an isolated e-pawn.
13. Nxg5 is refuted by ... QxN, and the knight on h5 is covered.   So I go with the pawn break I'd prepared the move before.
Swapping off should benefit the player behind in development.   I don't think black can allow white to start the trade (16. NxN PxN); the pawn on g3 may be too weak.
Aiming to put his second knight in on g3.   It's not entirely clear if g3 is that great a square for the knight though.
Again, white needs to get some space to play in.
!   For the rook, white will get a pawn wedged deep in black's position, and I will of course recoup the knight at my leisure.
?   23. Bf6+ Kf8 24. Qc1! is the best way to continue; the gameknot line ends with white up a queen and two pieces for a rook!   It's an interesting line - 24. ... RxP (to give the king a flight square) 25. Qh6+ Ke8 26. BxB Bf5 (for both sides, the pawn on h7 is more valuable than the exchange (BxR)) 27. BxR BxP 28. QxB Ne3 29. Re1 NxP (a desperate attempt to get counterplay by opening up the white king's position, I assume) 30. Qh8+ Ke7 31. Bd6+! KxB (PxB isn't possible as it's double check) 32. Qf6 Qe6 33. RxQ+ PxR 34. KxN.
Fritz doesn't like this, preferring instead to get the knight involved - 24. Bf6+ Kf8 25. Ng5.   Hard to argue against that, in fairness.
Looking to get the rook involved via h1
Finally playing the move Fritz had been calling for for the past few moves.   27. ... Kh6 loses to Rh1+, 27. ... Kf8 loses to BxB, so the only option is to give up the exchange.
Black gets a pawn for the exchange, but white's rook has another file to play on, and black's king is dragged more into the centre.
Looking to enter the game via h4 (rather than h6, where there seems to be nothing after 30. ... Kg7)
Obviously not interested in a swap when black's king is where it is!   31. Qg5+ Ke7 32. Qg8 is the threat now.
? Again, not the most accurate way of continuing the attack.   Gameknot prefers 31. g4!, opening up the g-file; the rook is eyeing g8, when black must lose material.   So for example 31. ... QxP (other moves allow the likes of Qg5+ and Rh6+) 32. Rg1 Qf5 33. Rg8 QxP 34 RxR and black can resign.
Unpinning the knight so it can take part in the game.
Not sure what the purpose of this move was; gameknot recommends the logical ... Qg6, attempting to swap queens.
? A blunder, says gameknot, but still enough for black to call it a day here.   35. PxB, which I had been considering, is better; I'd missed that after 35. ... Qb1+ 36. Kh2 Rh8 37. Qf6 that ... RxP is check.   White is still winning, but there's plenty for black to fight over.   35. PxB covers white's back rank, and means black has to deal with the threats of h8=Q and Qd6+<n><n>Still, at my level, it's too much to ask for an attack on gameknot to be perfect; this one was fun, and the analysis instructive, so that's enough for me!
The holy bishop makes a call!
The "key" of this opening. If something takes my Knight, I take with the pawn. While it seems to make my bishop useless, it provides me with a strong "disturbing element" that allows me to attack the kingside. In fact, the best strategy for black is to castle queenside.
Now, the black bishop is bothering me, yes, but my guns are pointing at the enemys heart.
This bishop won't do anything, here, but I have to prepare the run of my forces across the 1 row. Also, it means that a future f5-f4 would be almost impossible for him.
Anyway, this entire line is not the best for white, and in fact I am inferior now.
Things you have to do in order to speed up the attack. To move the queen would have been too slow, since it has no good square. Now, it can go to h1, and the other rook to g1...
Nice, isn't it? RxN, RxQ, and if QxN, Qxh6, Qh7, Qxf8 winning.
black emerged from the opening having equalized the game, a symmetrical structure, less space, but a better light squared bishop, after some exchanges black was able to make a pawn break and convert in to an endgame with R+3P vs B+N, with two passed pawns and a pawn majority on the opposed wing white had trouble coordinating his pieces in defence of all threats so finally black achieved a win in a well played game
to contest the pawn centre and play Nc6 after my c pawn push
to open some lines for my light squares bishop
?! it turns black's job easier...
white chooses to further simplify the game by exchanging queens
with the king on c7 I control d8, d7, d6 on the open column
white diverged from the previous game I found, Mossin, Ao - Braathen, Tom, Sweden, 1993 (1/2-1/2), were white played Be2, with f3 white might want to free his knight from defensive tasks, by adding another defender the e4 pawn, but then he closes his light squares bishop and condemns it to defence, my light square bishop is better as it can get in front of my pawns to attack some white objectives, plus my knight is also better as my c6 pawn denies whites access to b5 and d5, while I can try to place my knight on d5 after playing e5 to protect it
the idea is to induce white into playing b3 further closing in his light squares bishop, plus before trying to play e5 I must exchange the dark squared bishops
now I'm prepared to exchange one of the rooks, and keep the other one in reserve
now I've considered playing Bh6 to exchange the dark squared bishops, but then white has f4, so I decided against it, h5 also gets me some more space, plus with my light squared bishop in front of my pawns and my plan to exchange dark squares bishops it might help in limiting white's light bishop action
the idea must be to block my h5 pawn to avoid it to gain more space
now I prepare c5 and Bd7, I play Kb7 to avoid both Nd5+ and Nb5+
I missed it, now I have a week e7 pawn to defend, white threatens e5 forcing my knight to move and then Bxe7 with a comfortable advantage
now e5 is pointless, and I can return to my previous plan, but first I'll get white's bishop out of the way, or capture the h pawn in the process
opens the h8-a1 diagonal for my bishop
now aimed at g3 and the h pawn might fall after f6 to remove the defending bishop
forcing Be1 by means of the threat Bxh4, as Rh1 abandons the d column to my rook
here my opponent offered a draw, I was tempted to accept but then I can play some more moves without risk of losing the hypothesis of a draw either, plus I have some strategic point to test:<n><n>a) I can now profit from a better bishop<n>b) my knight is also more active, I have some outposts in c5, e5 and even a possible outpost on d4 after playing e5<n>c) by playing e5 I'll improve my pawns by placing them on a dark square, plus I have an attack objective on white's h pawn, that may be exploited after some pawn break<n>d) maintaining the c6 pawn defending against Nb5 or Nd5 is also an hypothesis as it keeps white's knight more constrained
opens the d column, and prepares Ne6-d4
frees the e pawn to advance to e5, and allows Ne6 afterwards
?! the rook on doesn't improve its placement on d2, on the 1st rank it can move faster from wing to wing, I think my opponent just doesn't want to commit to any pawn advance or any other piece move
blocks white's e and indirectly the f pawn, and controls d4 and f4
from now on I decided not to advance my c pawn any further as it restricts white's knight activity, and so I need to get my king back on c7, a dark square, were it controls d8, d7 and d6, releasing my pieces for attack purposes
prepares the pawn break with g5
first I was a bit frustrated I could not see a way to profit from white's king and rook placement, so I decided to abandon c5 so I would not get any bad thoughts about some sacrifice that allowed me to play Nxe4, but would let me down in material
with white's knight on e2 and the king on c3 I started again thinking of c5-Nd4 to get an excellent outpost or a passed pawn if white decides to exchange knights
all my pieces are in active positions and here we go for a pawn break, white control the d column but can't get his rook to easily shift from on side of the board to the other alnd his knight is concerned about blacks possible Nd4-c5
the only good move white has to pin the knight
but then I temporarily sacrifice a pawn to block white's bishop
and I get the pawn back and opened up another column for my rook to get in white's camp
? white needed to move either the rook or the king to avoid the tactics that follow
a temporary sacrifice of the bishop and white has to chose between:<n>a) Bxh3 Nxe4+ Kc2 Nxd2 Kxd2 Rxg3 B moves and Rg2+ and black gets the rook and two pawns for his bishop and knight<n>b) Bf3 Rxg3 Nxc5 Rxf3+ Rd3 Rxd3+ Nxd3 and we would enter a B vs N endgame were black have to fight hard for a win<n>c) Nxc5 Rxg3+ Nd3 Bxg2 Re2 Bf1 Rd2 f5 exf5 e4 wins the knight
and I get three pawns and the rook for my two minor pieces
zwischenzug before Rxh4 to gain a tempo and advance the e and f pawns a little further, if Nf4 I'll win a piece with Rxh4, if Nb4 I have the possibility of a5 with tempo
after moving his bishop white might be tempted to play Kd4 but loses to c5 a double attack on king and knight, both knight and bishop are somewhat restricted... my plan is to use my king to add further support to my connected pawns
and the knight is further restricted by this move
adding support to the third rank with tempo
again the restriction of the knight is under way and black has fixed the queen's wing pawns, and only the knight is able to attack b6, it would take three moves and the knight is needed defending the e and f pawns, so black's king is free to move foreword in support of his passed connected pawns, I expect Nf5 and reply will with Ke5, also possible is Nb5 with the idea b5-c7-a8, but by then white had lost too many tempi with his knight away from the centre...
a square further closer to my centre pawns
and now the pawn advance is unstoppable unless white decides to sacrifice pieces to get them
forced to defend c5 and support e4-e3-e2, now if Nb8 I can't play e3 or I will get mated with Nc6++
Although the position is heavily simplified and material level, Black has a number of important positional advantages: the outside passed h-pawn, the more active knight, and time to centralize his king before White will be able to do the same. The h-pawn is especially important in knight endgames, because knights have great difficulty dealing with rooks' pawns.<n><n>As usual, Black starts by bringing his king into the centre, in this case to the excellent outpost e5.
Every pawn move creates a weakness,  and the text gives the Black king a penetration square on b3. White's choice was motivated by the fact that after 39 Nh3, there is 39 ... Nc2+ 40 Kf3 Nb4 41. a3 Nd3 42. b4 Ne1+ 43 Ke2 Nc2 winning material. However, Keres points out that White can instead play 40 Kd2! when 40 ... Nb4 41 a3 repulses the knight. It is still far from clear that 39 Nh3 would have saved the game, but it probably offe rs slightly improved chances thereof.
45. Nf2 Nf4 would actually reach the position given in the note to move 40.
Dvoretsky makes the very sensible suggestion of 50. b3 here, to prevent the queenside pawns being fixed by<n>the move ... a5-a4.
White's knight raid has somewhat disrupted Black's piece formation, but has not changed the essentials of the position. Black re-establishes his pieces in a secure central arrangement, and his h-pawn is ready to advance further.
See the note to move 39. Black fixes the weakness of the enemy queenside pawns. Now White always has to worry about the black king entering via b3, or the black knight landing on c4.
A typical endgame subtlety. Nimzowitsch plans to play the moves ... b5, ... Nc6+ and ...Kc5. However, he realizes that the knight check is best delivered with the white knight on h3, rather than f4. This is shown by the variation 53 ... b5? 54. Nf4 Nxc6+ 55. Kc3 and now the otherwise desirable 55. ... Ke5 walks into 56. Ng6+. In order to avoid this, Nimzowitsch sacrifices a tempo, by advancing his b-pawn in two moves, rather than one. "Do not hurry!"
This is the decisive mistake. As the note to move 53 shows, the white knight is useful on f4, because it prevents the black king coming to e5, in view of the fork Ng6+. White should therefore retain this resource and instead play Dvoretsky's recommendation 55. Kc3! when it is not clear if Black can win. He can retain some pressure with 55. ... Kc5 (55 ... Ng6 56. Nxg6 h3 57. Nh4 h2 58. Nf5+ Ke5 59. Ng3 Kf4 60. Nh1 Kxe4 61. Kd2 is drawn) 56. Ne6+ Kb6 57. Nf4 Ng6! (such deflecting sacrifices are a typical idea in knight endings) 58. Nh3 (58. Nxg6? h3 and the knight cannot get back to stop the pawn) 58 ... Kc5  Dvoretsky), but it is still not 100% clear if this is enough. Extending this line, a sample variation is 59. b3 axb3 60.Kxb3 Ne5 (after 60 .. .Kd4 61. Kb4 Kxe4 62 Kxb5 the white a-pawn is too dangerous) 61. Ng5 Nc4 62. Ne6+ Kb6 (62 ... Kd6 63. Ng5 is no help, since 63 ...Ke5 runs into 64 Nf3+) 63. Ng5 Ka5 64. a4 Nd2+ 65 Kc2 Nxe4 (the last chance) 66 Nxe4 Kxa4 67 Ng5 Ka3 68 Kbl and the ending is a draw. There may be improvements in this line, but it is certainly clear that White has excellent drawing chances, whereas after the text, he is lost.
56. Nd3 Ke5 57. Ke3 Na5 is an illustration of the comment in the note to move 51. The black knight arrives on c4 with decisive effect.
Desperately passive, but after 60. Kd3 Ne6 he would have to play 61. Kc2 anyway, to stop the enemy king coming in to b3.
White decides to go after the apawn, in an attempt to create some counterplay. The alternative 61. Kc2 is<n>met by 61. ..Kc4, and now the attack switches to the white e-pawn (two weaknesses!), e.g. 62. Kd2 Kd4 63. Nf2 Ng5 and the h-pawn marches forward.
Now Black trades his a-pawn for the enemy e-pawn, and, more importantly, wins the white knight. In this last phase, we see the helplessness of a knight in trying to defend against a RP. The proximity of the edge of the board means that the knight has too little room for manoeuvre.
The centralized black knight is ideally placed, both denying the squares f4 and g5 to its opposite number, and also stopping the enemy b-pawn. 66 b6 Kxh3 67. b7 Nc5+ is the main point. A beautifully played ending by Nimzowitsch, and one of the most famous knight and pawn endings in chess history.
Offering the exchange
Threatening to open the e-file with f5
I open with Grob's Attack, one of my favorite openigs. It leads to a complicated, tactical game.
This aggressive move means Black is trying to win quickly, and willing to leave himself exposed to a counterattack if he does not.
I have to develop aggressively to slow Black's attacking potential, until I can get my King off the open file.
I hope to induce the exchange of Queens.
Black does not cooperate, and the Queens remain. If I could have induced the exchange, I would have played for an end-game.
With the Pawn position on the King-side, I deem it safer to put my King on the opposite flank.
Black feels differently. He places his King in a somewhat vulnerable position. However, I haven't worked up much of an attack.
Black elects to preserve his Bishop. With 15...Nd7, he could have chosen to plant a Knight on c5 after the exchange.
The first piece exchange leaves my pieces in a more aggressive position. My Bishop is beautifully centralized.
I move it to a square where I won't lose the minor exchange.
Now I make the exchange. I still want to play for an endgame.
Now I win the minor exchange. Next goal: remove the heavy artillery.
Black himself sets up the Rooks coming off the board...
Now I have at least a draw. Ahead a Bishop to a Knight, I just have to not blunder.
I centralize the Bishop.
The Kings get involved, as they should. I need to centralize my King, too.
This seals it. The Pawn position is locked and neither side can break through. If Black's King retreats with 38...Kd6, I follow with 39 Bxd7 Kxd7 40 Kf1 Ke6 41 Kg2 Ke5 42 Kf1 Kf4 43 Kf2 with the Opposition.
Black bows to the inevitable. A draw is agreed.
when black plays an early ...Nf6 I try to aim for the Keres attack with f3 and g4.
following my plan to play g4 so black should be active in order to avoid g4.
Kasparov vs. Grischuk it when as follows 7... Nc6 8. Nb3 e6 9. Qe2 Qc7 10. Be3 b5 11. O-O-O Bb7 12. h4 Rc8 13. g5 Nd7 14. Qf2 Nce5 15. a3 Qd8 16. Bd4 Nc6 17. Be3 Nce5 18. Bd4 Nc6 19. Be3 Nce5 20. Bd4 1/2-1/2
This is more flexible than 9. Be2 because the queen can float over to g2 to support g4-g5. It also threatens Be3 gaining tempo against the black queen.
an attempt to win the exchange on d5 if black is squeamish about exchanging on d5.
Black gets a very good knight but at the cost of d-file and the forever, lingering threats on ...e6
black has not else good
Black's best chance for a draw is to simplify down to rooks and pawns. My goal is to simplify down to king pawns. I am banking my winning ideas of my advantaged king pawns.
White has emerged from the opening with a clear advantage of space. So here is what I have learned from Alekine and Karpov. 1) bind/limit- force your opponent into a never ending cramped position. Forcing your opponent to make further weaknesses to create room to move. 2) Bind some more- use your superior piece position to force your opponent to sacrifice material in order stay alive 3) open lines to the kings with pawn breaks.
I am predicting that Drzemik wants to play ...Nc6. So Bd3 hits at the light square weaknesses around the king.
again when all else is equal play a move that limits your opponents options. For example I can not prevent black from playing Be6. However, with the queen on f4 the Bishop has to stay on e6 and the f-rook has to stay at home. Plus Black also has to be very careful of any attacks on the g-file.
White has added superior pawn structure and central dominance to his space advantage. This is more than enough for the win.
limiting black's choices now both ...Qa5 and Nb4 can not aid in the defense of ..f5
Here comes the h-pawn and nothing can stop it.
entombing the black king in a chamber of light squares. Now for those who are reading this from our club I wrote a thread on successful pawn breaks against the castled king. In that thread I posted a diagram of a basic position of where black had played the f-pawn. In this basic pattern the key to a successful attack is controlling the a2-g8 diagonal. And guess who controls it.
Black losses a pawn and is forced to play 28. ...Rxd1+ because if white is allowed to play Rxd8 it is lights out
black is forced to take on b3 in order to keep up.
black tries to hold onto the material balance but I now have a past c-pawn so I go to exchange the queens
forced if 4. ...Rc6 35. Bg6+ and black has to give up the rook to avoid mate.
Now in Rook-Bishop-Pawn vs Rook-Knight-Pawn endings you need a one pawn advantage to win. So either f5 or b3 is gone but black can not defend both. So in a nutshell the game is over.
for the win!
black gets the c-pawn but the white king with make is way unmolested to feast on g7.
My decision to play f3 didn't come without a price.  I could have played Nf3, but that ultimately leaves my pawn structure unsound, unless I maneuver Ng1 to d2; and that could leave my kingside vulnerable.  My goal with f3 is to disallow ... Ng4 or Bg4, and to allow my Knight to post on a strong g4 square.
This will keep black from moving h6, forcing my bishop to either attack or retreat. This also helps to reduce the temptation of black from moving Qb6, then ... c4, exposing my kingside and a weak b2 pawn, (not to mention my kingside is quite undeveloped at this point.)  This position allows for a huge attach on black, but I need to be careful about how I move.
Here, I begin developing my kingside, with an ultimate goal of posting my knight on g4.
Here it is . . . h6.  This forces my bishop to attack, (as a retreat to h4 would cause g5, forking my bishop and knight.)  I am beginning to see how bad of a move Nf4 was.
Black pushes his pawn to g5 like anticipated and proper.  So far, black is very well developed, and has the upper hand on position, (my only saving grace is my pawn structure here.)
Since I have ruined my kingside, and black has easily and deftly created an opportunity for an attack, I decide to move my knight to d3 with a goal again of posting it on g5 or e4.
Black is now using his momentum to deftly take advantage of my increasingly difficult situation.  The only good to come out of this will be my rook seizing the a file.  I may be able to eventually seize black's d6 pawn from the queenside and collapse his pawn structure.
However, after 16. axb5 axb5 17. b4 c4, I must move my knight to f2, lest black post his queen on b6, and I will not be able to castle . . . at least for a while.
However, I move Nf2 and castle, and he begins an attack on my kingside while guarding his b5 pawn.  It isn't looking good for white.  g3 keeps black from posting on f4, but may allow an attack on h3 from black's bishop.  Given white's situation, at the time I thought this was the best move I could have made.  Black's move to h5 also pins my knight on c3, guarded only by my queen.  It will take a couple moves I do not have to unpin it.
Instead of capturing f5, I move my pawn to f4, forcing black to retreat, or support it with either Be8, (which will remove 1 support on b5), or Qe8, taking him longer or even impossible to post his queen on b6.  My bishop is now attacking black's knight, and creates a little forward momentum for white.
This isolates my d pawn, but now black cannot move his pawn to g4, for it will be attacked by my bishop on e3.  This also creates an avenue for my knight to become more active on e4, (as long as Qb6 is not a problem.)  I could have chosen to move fxg5, but this would allow black to develop better with hxg5, then . . . g4.
Instead of retaking my pawn black makes an excellent move gxf4!.  Now I must take his knight.
I'm rushing again.  In an attempt to unpin my knight, free my queen to move, and allow my knight to move more freely, I move Ne4 too soon.
Now I must move my knight back, but I plan on threatening black's bishop with g4.  I have given up on my dead f5 pawn.  Now both of white's knights are pinned.
I forked black's bishop and rook with g4, but cannot follow through as gxh5 would put me in check.
Considering the situation, I am willing to trade rooks.
Black declines the trade, and I bring my a1 rook into the game.
After 29. . . . Bxg4 30. hxg4 Rxg4+ 31. Kh2 Be5+, the situation is not looking good for white.  My kingside is completely exposed.  My best defender here is black's h6 pawn!
Black moves his rook out of trouble.  But after Ng4, things start looking a little different.  There is still a threat of a mating attack from black's queen and rook, but my situation doesn't look quite so dire.
Black accepts the trade, and moves his queen into position.
I happily trade rooks, and black's queen looks exposed to me from this angle.  With a little support from my queen, I could possibly place my rook on g1 pinning black's queen.  However, black is too cunning for that kind of amateur move.
I must keep my queen very close to my king for the rest of the game to avoid mate.  My plan from here is to use my advantage of a knight to force black's moves and gain another pawn, and ultimately promote my d pawn to a queen.
after 43. Rf5, my knight is now in a good position to threaten and support the promotion of my d pawn to a queen.  Black is now on the defensive.  However, I must keep the momentum strong, else black support and promote his c pawn.
It was a good idea for black to move his rook to e7.  He foresaw white's pawn on d7, and wanted to be on the correct side of the action.  However, this check is forcing black's queen into a very tight position.
I considered Ne8, but this leaves me with a greater advantage.  If black chooses to trade pieces, I will promote my pawn and checkmate black.
One of black's only mistakes in the game.  I have pinned black's rook, and now it is not looking good for black.
A good move, but it allows me to promote my queen.
After 50. d8=Q Qe6+ 51 Kh4 Qe1+ 52. Ng3, black resigns.  A battle fought long and hard, this victory had not come easily.
I do play the Abdicatalan on occasion, not overly used to attacking it though
At this stage white prob has the better development. I'm also concious that the Baron probably remembers some comments I made on another annotation and is gunning for me big style *grins*
That was a surprise to me, I expected him to do summat about the d pawn.
Now he has an isolated pawn and I'm wondering what I can do about it....
Forced to swap a bishop for a knight....yeah sounds good to me.
Can't rem why I did that, although having played the next move I can... I was trying to be sneaky and advance the pawn hoping Baron might forget about the knight on h3.
Trying to shift the queen..
Decided on this despite it being quite risky imho, it seemed like the right thing to do. Baron can't do qxp cos of the bishop and I doubted he would sac the knight to try and crash through the centre.
Very tempted to do pxp either way. However the prophetic words I put on the other annotation came back to me, give Baron time, not space!
I thought it worth giving away a half tempo to continue pressure on d4.
Bad move in my opinion. I think that was Baron getting frustrated and hopeful. Worried me initially but the more I looked at it the more that seemed like a mistake. The only place the knight can go is back unless he wants to sac it.
q-a2 might have been an option but he chose to do the sac. And I soooo nearly muffed the next move.... luckily it wasn't otb cos my finger was on that bishop ;-)
But fortunately I hesitated long enough to see the mate! Despite the forced opening I'm very proud of this one. I managed to curb my natural instincts and play to Barons weaknesses. I suspect now however I'm in for a hammering next time ;-)
Hi everyone!<n><n>Here is another game in GM Cyrano's MT where I have been playing against the big boys, this time a Master with a rating close to IM level.  I end up in a position where I have a rook against 2 pieces.  Boy those two pieces proved to be much more lethal than a rook.  In fact, all black's remaining pieces swarmed around Henry who, sadly, got stung and suffered an anaphylactic shock.  So how did this happen.  Well before I start, here is the gameknot analysis: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17836549&rnd=0.9027691620956812
9. 0-0 - and Henry tucks himself away on the kingside.  Alas, this will be where Henry will meet his doom later on.
13. Qf3 - hitting out at the knight on d5 and Glenda is also fixing her beady eye on f7.
14. Bc4 - pin and another piece attacks f7.
26. .... Rg8 - now comes the black rook.
He resigned as he has to give up his queen to my two knights.
A bit risky due to the bishop eyeing down the a7-g1 diagonal but I can't resist Vienna's Gambit
Giving the queen something to think about
For the attack!
Weakening move, now I can conquer the center and go on with my attack
Already considering mating possibilities, here I thought about exchanging my d5 knight with opponent's g8 knight and then stick my bishop and queen into d8 and e7. It didn't work exactly as planned and here I was looking at an unpleasant move from my opponent
I didn't expect this but felt that I can even sacrifice the d5 knight to fuel the attack if 11. ... fxe4 and 12. ... Qxd5
Rash decision, had to play 17. ... Bf5 to block the mate
And more messing.
Bizarre, and hilarious.
And this is where it becomes hilarious to me. Messing with him truly starts.
Trying to bait him into taking the bishop, then I take the pawn, pinning the king to the queen with the rook.
Idiocy or genius. Hard to tell.
More fun to come if he takes the bishop.
I asked him if he wanted me to finish it or to mess some more. He picked mess.
I'm expecting the king to take, resulting in me forking his bishop for no gain.
And then that happened. Meh. Changes not much.
And now I'm forking pawns. Comedy. Gotta be careful not to mate or stalemate here.
The Black Knight eyes f4, an important battleground in this game.
Black starts to roll a king side attack. I'd gladly give up my bad light squared bishop for this knight.
Seeking to open the Q side. I've got nothing to look forward to on the k side except fending off a black attack. My attack looks to be slower, so I better get going on it.
Black is all about the king side attack. I have no real plan yet, just trying to pick up small advantages. At this point I own an open file and have two knights in a position with a closed center. I have a bad light bishop I'd love to exchange.
If black exchanges, I'm getting rid of his good bishop, leaving a slew of potential homes for my remaining knight (b5,c6 and f5), and b7 is wide open for my rook.
A retreat to c8 might be in order to get my rook out of the 7th rank.
Black has to open the king side, but I'd be thrilled to put my knight on e4, to pressure the backwards pawn on d6.
Qc6!! Pressuring d6. Black is forced to exchange. I can afford to break up the center because my knights are ready to jump in to gain control (Nc3-d5). My hope is to win the a pawn and drive my a pawn to victory.
Hoping eventually to trade off the rooks so that Black can't penetrate to my now weakened queen side and to give my knights room to dominate. If he brings the knight over, the f5 pawn will be weakened, and create a great home on e4 for my knight. And recapturing my passed f pawn will prove difficult.
Black sees the d6 and bishop fork coming.
Before jumping to e4, its important to hem in teh bishop again and prevent counterattack.
Black's knight is still of little use, black chooses to let the d pawn go to stop one of my two passed pawns. I have no intention of trading my powerful knight for his bad bishop.
I've got the king side locked down -- black has no more play left there. My king heads to the a pawn.
Black's king is blocking his knight, and my king is able to head straight over to the a pawn while black struggles to come up with useful moves.
The black c pawn is ready to drop.
Black is setting up to take my g pawn.
Once the black knight eats my g pawn, he'll need to get to e1 to do any further damage, but my knight will prevent that.
Hmmm..the annotation seems to be following a variation here and not the real game. 52.c6 leads to problems as you'll see following the next few moves. in the actual game, i played 52.Ne1, offering to sacrifice my N. Black wisely avoided the sacrifice because then his N would have been too far away to catch up to my advancing c pawn. Instead, black sent his N back to the center, but I advanced my a pawn and he had to resume his attack on my g pawn which did eventually give him two connected passed pawns but I queened and got back to defend just in time.
this is to avoid a f4 and also targets the black knight
i am new at chess and tring to be better<n>i really be grateful if you share your opinions
Bringing the queen to the battle.
Bishop in fianchetto. clearing the way for castle.
Traps black's bishop but black is able to defend that bishop. According to what drunken_rabbit said this moment was the most difficult in the game he had to plan a lot to defend the bishop.
Attacks Black's bishop at a2.
It was time for white to plan for an attack on black's kingside by Rook f1 but he decided to defend using Ra1.
Not a very good move ends to 15...Qa5 16.Bc4 Bf6 17.Qc2 Qa3  which increases the pressure on white's king.
It seems to be easy for black to see the mate in 6.
Black defends nicely.
I rarely play the king fiancetto but the centre is very crowded and I don't want to further that. Besides I like closed up king-sides and open queen-sides.
The second step in the fiancetto. His king is already safe so I want to geet a move on.
I'm fine with leaving the b4 pawn unguarded because I can sense a push down the centre. And I'm worried about the d4 square.
I can sense that he is keen to attack now. I have to be careful.
At this point black resigned. His knight is trapped and it is one of his few developed pieces. It seems that he thought it was a pivotal piece and he couldn't afford to lose it.
By playing 4...Nf6, Wollner avoids some of the terrifying tactics of the Danish proper. At the time, this was considered a fully viable mode of defense. Wollner, perhaps understandably, was reluctant to grab that final pawn. Today, theory claims that Black can wend his way to equality by giving back the material in a tactical counter-trick, as follows: 4...cxb2 5.Bxb2 d5 The first pawn is given back. 6.Bxd5 Nf6 7.Bxf7+ And now, the second. But hasn't Black gone too far -- isn't he dropping his Queen here? 7...Kxf7 8.Qxd8 Bb4+ The counter-trap: Black regains his material. 9.Qd2 Bxd2+ 10.Nxd2. "Theory" judges this position to be equal. That may be true, but it's worth pointing out that the position is also very sharp, with substantial pawn majorities for each side. Some correspondence players have recently resurrected this variation as a winning attempt for White. It demands accurate defensive play from Black, because White's pawns advancing on the Kingside "bite" faster, thanks to Black's exposed Knight and King. In this side line, there's one other move also worth considering. When Black plays ... Nf6, White need not liquidate but can instead play for central domination by accenting his development: 7.Nc3 Nxd5 8.Nxd5 One of the many interesting points in this line is that Black cannot force an exchange of Queens here, thanks to a very clever tactical shot: 8...c6 ... apparently forcing the Knight to move, but -- 9.Nf6+ White pulls Black's pieces forcibly into a fork! 9...gxf6 10.Qxd8+ Kxd8 11.Bxf6+ ... and when the dust clears, White is the exchange ahead

Rules are made to be broken -- not often, but on just those occasions when genius rises to the occasion! Charousek has no intention of giving up his perfectly good Bishop for the Rook on f7. Instead, he has spied a fascinating feature of the position. We saw that by delaying the development of his Queen's Knight, Black has reserved the possibility of Nbd7 defending f6. But Charousek has seen -- and brilliantly exposes -- the dark side of Black's delayed development. <n><n>The following combination is made possible because Black's Queen is undefended!<n>DO YOU SEE HOW??
This pulls the Rook away from the eighth rank. Now the d-pawn is pinned against the undefended Queen. Hence:
Only this move is a just followup to the Knight sacrifice. Black's N/f6 must move (or he has lost material for nothing), and White will push this pawn up to e6.
Now the point of the sacrifice is becoming clearer. Charousek is not simply attacking the Rook: he has also used the P/e6 to cut off the defense of Black's Knight on the light diagonal from c8 to g4. In a sense, this is a very sophisticated double attack. Wollner is no fool: he realizes his position is desperate. So he immediately plays for the counterattack.
But now, how to meet the threats at h2 and f2?
The only move! Charousek displays not only great attacking elan but also defensive savvy here. Consider the alternative: 13.h3 Nxf2 Now it is Black who has the attack, with a sacrifice on h3 threatened (in addition to the obvious ..Nxd1).
Wollner realizes that he is now on the defensive, and he tries hard to cover the weak e8 square. But Charousek is not to be denied!
This intensifies the pressure: Charousek now threatens to sacrifice a Queen on e8!
Wollner finally develops his Knight, lending his Rook's defensive aid to the beleaguered e8 square. But Charousek has realized something tremendous about this position. His Rook, sitting at f1, is on the same file as the enemy King. "Yes," you say, "but what of it? I often get my Rook on the same file as the enemy King -- but my own pawn blocks the file, so what's the use?" Youth and genius do not lose heart for such trifles. Charousek now sacrifices, not one, but two Queens to achieve the ultimate opening of all remaining lines!
One of the finest sacrificial conclusions on record. Not often does one get to sacrifice two Queens to force checkmate before move 20! Talk about efficient piece deployment!! It doesn't get better than this! Years later, Kester Svendsen wrote a wonderful short story entitled "Last Round," about an old master who has tried for 50 years to create a work of art, the perfect game. In the crucial final round of a World Championship tournament, he trails the mighty Russian Rolavsky by half a point, and they are paired. Svendsen weaves his story around this as their game. "I have always a slight feeling of pity for the man who has no knowledge of chess, just as I would pity the man who has remained ignorant of love. Chess, like love, like music, has the power to make men happy."-- Siegbert Tarrasch.

Hi everyone!<n><n>I have my own version of events as to what happened at the Battle of Naseby which occurred on the 14th of June 1645.  The Royalists were headed by King Charles 1 (my opponent's name is Charles btw) and his cousin Rupert of the Rhine - they were called the Cavaliers - on the opposite side were the Roundheads headed by Oliver Cromwell.  In my story I am going to use some artistic licence of the conversations on the battlefield.  King Charles takes the field with his troops - he and his men are armed in white - his missus, the staunch Roman Catholic, Henrietta Maria has been practising sorcery along with her faith.  Therefore she is known to the Roundheads as the Wicked Witch of the West.  Now Oliver Cromwell was far too busy with administrative paperwork in London and setting Government Targets so he enlisted others to do his dirty work.  Henry Thomas Fairfax and his wife Glenda (who has also dabbled in Sorcery) have drawn the short straw.  They have been provided with two castles, two horsies to ride on, two clergy, Frenchmen by the name of Fou Lenoir and Fou Leblanc and eight footmen - I am one of those footmen, I am the a pawn.  I end up 3 squares shy of promotion to a queen but that is as far as I get.   All of Cromwell's Army are armed in black. King Charles and Queen Henrietta have also been prov

King Charles and Queen Henrietta have also been provided with two castles, two horses to ride on and two unnamed clergy and eight footmen. Henry and Glenda have now arrived at the south side of the battlefield at Naseby and will head due north to fight King' Charles Army.  The first white pikeman (a pawn) makes his move to Sector e4.

1. ..... e5 - I take my place on Sector a7 and I say to my neighbour, Gareth on Sector b7, ah so we have arrived on the battlefield at last, I can't believe that I a woman should be roped into all this. Gareth turned round and said ..... Ah, stop moaning, at least Glenda thinks you have the know all to fight a battle after she saw you kill a roundhead the other day. I then said to Gareth that I Joanne had no choice as I was ensuring my chastity for my beloved husband, Ian.  Well good luck to you Joanne said Gareth!  Anyhow, the battle has started and our friend John has just moved to Sector e5.
3. Bb5 - here comes Bishop William Laud ....... ssss!  Gareth nudges me and I now have to move up one square to Sector a6, point my staff at the cleric's belly and say "Halt who goes there!".
6. ....... b5 - Gareth, what are we fighting for here?  Goodness me, Joanne you have led a very sheltered life in your mannor house with Glenda!  Don't you realise just how much Income Tax, VAT and Council Tax we have had to pay recently?  I will tell you, King Charles has doubled it - this has got to stop, Joanne, this has got to stop!  Now, I must advance to Sector b5.
7. Bb3 - Bishop Laud again retreats to Sector b3.
9. ..... Nc5 - both horsies are coming over to our patch, I wonder what is going on?  We want to get rid of Bishop Laud, Joanne.
12. ......0-0 - Glenda whispered to Henry, time to tuck yourself away in our fourposter darling, the open battlefield is not for you, besides, you have a nasty cold, here is a potion to ease your comfort.  Don't worry, Gavin, Austin and Justin will shield you by standing on Sectors f7, g7 and h7.
14. Qd3 - a dark shadow comes over us all and suddenly we are feeling very cold despite our armour.  Suddenly we hear a nasty laugh and see a terrifying apparition from the sky.  This apparition has the face of a skull, a cloak and a scythe.  Beware it said, I am the Chessic Grim Reaper, I am Old Matey!  Look to the White Witch on d3!
22. Bb3 - Bishop Laud now attacks Haldup on Sector d5, can he survive?
23. Qxd4 - sigh, I Joanne was right, Turstin does perish to the Wicked Witch.  Now Fou Leblanc must stay on Sector e6 to stop that footman on e5 opening up a nasty line for that evil Henrietta Maria.  No, Henry does not want any truck with Catholic queens.  Neither do I said Gareth, my great-grandfather was burned at Smithfield Market by that horrible old Catholic harridan Bloody Mary.  Sorry to hear that Gareth I said  I comforted him with the words - still, since Good Old Queen Bess drove back the Spanish Armada we have not had the Spanish Inquisition set foot in this country.  Now I will see if I can trap Archbishop Laud.....
28. ....... axb4 - my beloved companion Gareth has just been slain.  I am all on my own.  Glenda's gentle voice soothed and comforted me.  You are not alone, I am right behind you and so is Fou Lenoir.  We will not let you be taken by Queen Henrietta or Bishop Oates.  I feel a bit better but I long for my companion.  I see that Haldup is still on d5 but the c column separates us and it is very hard for me to strike up a conversation yet alone for us to defend each other.
32. ..... Rc8 - hmm, now Bishop Laud moving to Sector a4 has allowed our remaining castle to challenge the enemy castle.  Both castles now explode before my eyes.
46. ..... g5 - Justin and Austin have moved to Sectors g5 and h4 to evade Bishop Laud.
48. ..... Be6 - After King Charles retreats so does Fou Leblanc.  It is now the 11th hour of the 14th day of June in the year of our lord 1944.  Now King Charles holds out the olive branch and Henry takes it.  I said to Fou Lenoir, why did not Fou Leblanc go to Sector e4?  Fou Lenoir said, aha, you are right, we are all fools.  Fou Leblanc could have taken the white footmen on Sectors g1 and b3.  Haldup comforts me with the words that King Charles would be taking us to a hostelry just up the road called The Royal Oak.  There would be plenty of opportunity for some illicit entertainment in there.  Some wonderful Strongbow ale, some mead, some nice wenches and best of all somebody giving a Karaoke style rendition of Paul McCartney's Play the Pipes of Peace and Boy George's War, War is stupid etc... I think the songs are perfectly appropriate and I am really terrified of facing Oliver Cromwell cos we have not won the battle but Haldup assures me that there is a giant oak tree in the back of the garden to hide in should he come calling.  Now Joanne, just have a little mead and chill out will you?  I accept the mead and in front of a nice warm fire I fall into a contented sleep with Haldup's arms wrapped right round me ....... in the meantime King Charles keeps his head ...... for now.
Black is in what's like a zugzwang position here.  He can't <n>develop the [Queen's] knight because the pawn is hanging, <n>the bishop is blocked because of the Queen.--Fischer
more pressure with the rook!
black defends with the rook!
Now an exchange sacrifice as well!!! Morphy sees that he can bring the other rook into the attack!!
Black breaks the pin on the knight else the queen is dead meat!
forking the queen and king
And then the finish!!! A queen sacrifice!!!! the knight must take!
Bobby Fischer said 1.e4 was "best by test" but is it really? According to the GK world database 1. Na3 has a 54% winning percentage and Black has not won a game!<n><n>so I had this tournament begun with 1. Na3 instead,Black would never win. There's some food for thought ;)<n><n>ok back to the game...
attack the e4 pawn and target f7
?!!? White spices it up. You dare to attack my Queen? I'll take it. Most of the time this logic does not work but here it certainly makes it interesting
The first move I made but this might as well be included in it because there really isn't a reason to not take the f-pawn
This is where the pawn on c6 changes the identity of the game.<n><n>In the last 2 annotation projects,Black has had the luxury of playing 8...Kc6 which is considered to be the best move. However,Black is now unable to move his king to c6.
to avoid the possible fork on e6.
striking back in the center and hoping to remove the defender of the knight on g5
I have to admit White's position is pretty nice. But Black can face the future with confidence.
funny how now the f4 pawn gets in the way. If I was able to play 19.Rf1 White would have the makings of a deadly attack
Black has to stop the threat of 21...Qf3 but the computer gives this as a mistake and gives 21.O-O which I will have to agree with seeing what happened later
the critical juncture
?? the game-losing blunder as Freddy and the computer pointed out 26.Rhe1 was necessary to survive
Maintaining the tempo, and making the opponent respond to my move
Queen pawn follow up allows for the removal of the e5 pawn, via a pawn for pawn trade
Bishop maintains the tension in the middle four squares
Black is directly challenging the centre four squares but is at a disadvantage, the pawns only attack the black squares and there are limited follow on options with blacks setup
Pawn takes pawn to attack the bishop with both the pawn and the queen.
A wasted move, that allows for the promotion of my bishop to directly threaten the queen, causing a temporal advantage
This move surprised me. As a result the d5 knight has a choice, push forward for the fork or withdraw to c3 to threaten the queen and protect the e4 pawn and king.
Queen withdraws, maintaining attack on e4, but with the pawn on e6 this is a non event threat, if black's next move was pawn to f5 it would change the tempo of the game. It would cause the re-direction of effort from aiming at the A side to aiming at the more vulnerable H side, kings weak side.
Bishop promotion combines the queen thru to bishop synergies. Allows for king side castle and protect f2 with the king and rook.
I don't see the point of this move.... It doesn't allow for new lines of attack or threaten me to require a response. This in context with the ability to castle king side means minimal effect
Returning knight to d5, limits movement of black and reopens the c7 fork. Need to wait for pawn push to d6, this enables queen to e2. To drive a pin from b5 through the queen onto the king.
The possible pin is mitigated by the pawn to a6, bishop to b4 threatens the black c5 bishop, while being covered by the d5 knight. Three obvious moves 1- black Bishop takes the b4 bishop 2- the a pawn is moved forward to move the white bishop 3 - d pawn move to support the black bishop
Opportunity to setup the queen-king pin, promote my queen, and also protect from the attack on f2, or setup knight to get behind the h-side pawn line
Push knight forward to increase the complexity of the attack....
A pawn to move my bishop.... Promote queen to enable the pin, sacrifice bishop for the queen.
Temporal advantage, take queen then take bishop
Queen takes knight, blocks possible castle to a side. Expected move pawn f6 to f5 to attack the queen and open up the knight.
Block in h side, also enables the queen to attack the g7 pawn.
Queen to g6 or to g7<n>G6- check, k to d7, q to g7 check either knight to e7 or king to c8.<n>G7- allows for Q to press h8 then h7
Everything was telegraphed at this stage, so the bishop had to move
now the threat was here...but I was happy with Nxe5 and swap queens....
So I just protect my d5 pawn, rather than risk a Benoni reversed with d4-d5. e7-e6, also supporting the d pawn with e7-e6 is also perfectly playable, but blocks in the Bishop on c8.
The logical square for his Nb1.
Now 0-0 is the natural move to play. After the game I looked up this position on the Gameknot databases. 9...0-0 is the only move on it. However, I had my idea, so I went with it.
This seems crazy, to block in my Bg7, but I want my Bc8 on e6, and I don't want him to be able to attack it with Nf3-g5.<n>What do you think of the move f7-f6 dear reader? Would you have played it? Or would you have played 0-0? Or something else?
He told me afterwards that the idea of this was that he could play b2-b4-b5 without the fear of me playing d5-d4 and Ne7-d5-c3. At the time I was pleased to see this move, I didn't think it achieved much.
And this is a thematic manoeuvre. If Qd7 he replies with Nc5 and he exchanges off my Be6 and end of attack for me!
So instead I prepare to give up my other bishop for the knight.
And I finally get Qd7 in.
Now of course, if 0-0-0 then he plays b4-b5 and my Nc6 can't move, and I lose knight for pawn - too big a lose for my liking.
Again this is quite thematic, doubling on the c file. If I let him, he can play a3-a4, b4-b5, and after my knight on c6 moves, Rc7 is strong for him. I considered 17.....0-0-0 and came to the conclusion that my king would be under great risk for instance O-O-O 18. a4 Kb8 19. b5 axb5 20. axb5 Nce7 and my king is looking very draughty, with White having both c and a files to attack down. So I decided to just get on with my attack. I'd love to play Be6-h3 here, and exchange his Bg2, which is a good defender. However Bh3 18.	Bxh3	Qxh3 19. Rxd5 drops a pawn. So I decided on another move.
After an interesting skirmish in the middle game featuring some inaccuracies on both sides, this game wound down to a R+N v R ending. In researching the internet, I found that the stronger side can rarely win, but that the best move for both sides is sometimes far from obvious. So, of course, I was anxious to feed this into the GK analyzer (the only computer program I have available) to see if it could find better moves in the ending.
Now it is Black's turn to err. I must have had the optical illusion that I needed to do something drastic about my d pawn. The computer gives ... h6 with equality.
This drives the Knight to where it needs to go anyway. The computer prefers 19 Nh3 h6 20 Nxg5 after which hxg5 seems to fail to 21. Qxg5+ Kh7 22. Qh4+ Kg8 23.Bg5
Again, driving the Rook where it wants to go! The computer gives Bg5
Now it is Black's turn to return the favor by driving the Bishop where it wants to go! According to the computer, Black retains a slight advantage by ... Re6, but after this move White is better.
This seemed wrong to me at the time, but it's actually quite good. It virtually ensures that White will eventually win Black's h pawn.
Black needs to exchange as many pawns as possible.
After the mayhem, Black has only one pawn for the Knight. But he only has to eliminate one White pawn to achieve his goal!
The computer likes Ng4 better, but in the line it gives Black eliminates the pawn anyway and achieves a draw.
Since Black's King is out of the corner and there are no Knight forks in sight, the draw is not that complicated. Black's strategy is to keep the Rook far from his King to avoid any forks and harass the White King with checks.
The british grandmaster John Nunn is 51 years of age, but in the next game against the 21 year old dutch grandmaster Jan Smeets, he shows he can still play...Taken from the fourth round of the NH Chess tournament played at Hotel Krasnapolsky in the heart of Amsterdam.
According to Nunn, he was trying to play the opening 'safe' in this tournament. This explains the chosen setup, wich actually gives white only small chances at getting the advantage.
!? White was trying to provoke 24...Nxh3  25.gxh3 Qxf3 26.Qxd7 Nxe5 27.Rxe5 Rxe5 and it would be unclear postition. It seems black should have taken the challenge, because in the current position he'll soon be overplayed by his opponent.
! Threatens to take the defender on g6 followed by Rh4 and black can't stop the mate.
Black clears the seventh row, so the queen can become involved in the defence. But there's more....
!! Threatening a queen sacrifice: 33.Qh7  Kf8 34.Qh8 ! Nxh8 35.Rxh8 mate, or if black tries 32...Nxh4, white plays 33.Ne7 ! Qxe7 34.Qh7  Kf8 35.Qh8 and it's also mate.(leaving white a rook and two pieces behind in material!)  1-0
Black prepares to dominate the d4 hole.
No rush to open the position by f5
Strong move - black plans to rid himself of a weakness at d5 by playing c6 thus forcing the knight to retreat with loss of time.
Attempt of counter play on the kingside
cxd5 cxd5 and black does not win a piece.
White tries to gain a tempo for his kingside attack.
Black stalls the queen rook battery on the h-file.
Gaining e5 as a outpost for the knight.
The rook is strong on the 2nd rank.
Unpinning the Knight now every piece is involed in the attack.
In my opinion white has an advantage here despite the pawn deficit.
?? This allows me to take his pawn, and fork his rook and pinned bishop.
?? And he fails to see it.
Again, his only move. I had to think for a while to find the sacrifice, but in the end I did.
Right on.  White will want to move the rook to g2, or black will play Pf6 and dine on horse.
But this move is much sweeter.  Queen for rook.  White will want to trade on black's 8th rank to keep the h rook in the corner.
Black continues the main line of the kings indian planning to bring the bishop to g7 giving the king a large amount of protection when castled.
Continues development, again I would play c4, and plan perhaps to set up an assault on the queenside.
A second move for the bishop, against opening principles, although it moves the bishop to a more natural square, and frees whites position.
White is now set up to push the e-pawn to get the pawn centre, black could have prevented this with a pre-emptive d5. However one of the tactics of the kings indian defence is to encourage white to over expand, then counter-attack the over stretched pieces. For this reason black castles to safety, and can now think about developing the queenside.
Doesn't assult the centre yet, black decides to bide his time and let white over commit. This move releases the bishop to d7, however I feel b6 to fianchetto the bishop to b7, or c6 to support the d-pawn in an advance to d5, would have been better. Nothing wrong with the played move though.
Played to unbreak the pin on the knight. White can either retreat or capture the knight. My instinct would be to retreat, as I value the bishop over the knight, and I see no precise tactic to win material or position by taking the knight. Also I feel black has weakened his king by playing the move, and the pawn structure in front of the black king is already weak from the early fianchetto, white could take advantage of this by keeping the bishop attacking the now weak h-pawn.
Black finally attacks the centre, and releases his white squared bishop, however he has to be careful, as generally the more developed player benefits from open lines.
Black now looks to take advantage of the overstretched white centre, by threatening to move his knight into c5, a strong outpost for the knight, and if not then the knight is well positioned to swing over to the kingside to support an attack or defend.
Defends the pawn, this is better than moving the king forward as now the knight has a square to move to on the kingside
A surprising move, and one that fundamentally weakens the king, with no apparent advantage to doing so as white cannot put a bishop on g2. It could be to give the knight a square to retreat to if white plays Nh4, however again there is no advantage to playing this.
Black continues to organise his forces, and his position, though initially weaker now looks to be stronger.<n>1) Whites centre pawns are overextended, and c6 would be problematic<n>2) The pawn structure in front of both kings is weak, however black is stronger as he has more pieces to defend it and no obvious way in. White however has a major white square weakness, and will need to be careful<n>3) Whites bishop is blocked in, and has little mobility, blacks c8 bishop looks far more active, and can easily move to attack the white position
It now looks like white hopes for a kingside attack, and wants to open blacks kingside with pawn exchanges. This is a big mistake, and will lead to his downfall, black will now use the weak white squares to attack whites king before white gets any chance to lead an attack
White decides to trade his out of position knight for the well positioned bishop, and following the forced recapture by the knight (16...Qxg4 17. dxc6 bxc6 18. Bxc6 wins a pawn), white can move the bishop away from the attack of the pawn with a tempo, attacking the well placed knight.
Moving the knight to a good position to oversee any battle for the centre with the pawns. Also with whites exposed kingside black won't want his knight being traded off for the bishop, as less material reduces the chance of a successful attack.
White continues to expand on the kingside. This is a move i would hardly even consider, with such an open king white would be better to plan an escape route with possibly 18. Rfe8 allowing the bishop to move to f1-g2 and allowing the king to run across the back line in case black moves in behind the over extended pawns
The first of the exchanges, the backward e-pawn has to defend both d and f pawns which is impossible.
taking the pawn back but leaving the f-pawn undefended. Better would have been fxg6 hoping to make the position rather messy and difficult to calculate, the played move is very easy to play against.
A careless move, white gets distracted and attacks the queenside, overlooking the much greater threat to his kingside. A simple reatreat of the queen to f2 may have given him a fighting chance of defending.
The pawn cannot take the f-pawn as white will lose his queen, and black is now able to push the pawn through to g3 helping the queen set up checkmate threats.
Picking up an extra pawn, and keeps the queen lurking near the king. My instinct would be to trade queens and force a winning endgame, however black hopes for a checkmate before the endgame.
Winning the exchange, but leaving his king very vulnerable, black won't mind losing the exchange as he now has good winning chances.
Unable to block the threat white grabs the material, however it looks very bad for white even if he survives the coming attack black has passed pawns on the e and h files, so white will certainly lose an endgame.
Another blunder giving black an easy checkmate, but anything else allows Nf4  winning the queen and inevitably the game.
A good finish, black didn't prolong the suffering prefering a quick decapitation. Always the best way as messing around to win material can lead to a downfall.<n><n>Feel free to message me with any comments / improvements to make to the annotation.
Time to trade knights.
?  What?  Black doesn't have a white bishop.  Why move the king, and why to a BLACK square?
I lost my queen but black has a good position, f8-g8 then my king is safe. But white's bishop and h1 rook is out of play. Also white's king position is open to attacks
I go for bishop and knight here, Gain a bishop and knight against 1 knight
nice move indeed! White will try to exploit the fact that black isn't developed and in fact with this energetic move will hinder blacks activity in the future!!!
not accurate. In my opinion 7..Bd7 was the right move. If White takes the pawn on b7 the black can develop with 8..Nc6 and get a much better play than in this game!! By trying to save the material i lost the positional fight all together!
developing the bishop and covering g7 for the other bishop to come out if he has the chance. Other possibilities were 10...c6 covering b7 and preventing Nb5. But finally i realised i had to develop my pieces. If 11 Nb5 now 11..Bb4+ and if 12Kf2 then 12..Na6 and the c7 pawn is protected plus I've developed two of my pieces!!if 12Nc3 then I've simply developed my bishop and theres no threat to c7.
Black has done ok until now. hes under pressure but hes exchanged some pieces, developed a bit and trying to make his king safer.But here comes the big blunder on my part.
i resigned here. Its not just the material lose. Whites attack now comes and there's no way out!! But what i wanted to show was in fact not my blunder here!! Blacks position even at best moves was still pressured a lot. That came as a result of Whites energetic play, not letting me develop properly and creating threats all over. i responded well up to a point but is hard to play this positions and probably i would have made other mistakes along the way. White on the other hand had a much clearer path and would be much more easier for him to find his way.
I made sure my black squared bishop was past the d-pawn before I advanced it. This is pretty basic, but ti's important nonetheless.
Trading a knight for no reason? I don't see any advantage to this. That was before I noticed it exposed my king if i captured it with my pawn. however, that could be easily copensated.
This isn't a good move, but it's probably the best he had.
Before I made this move, I thought of whether I should do this, or Qxd1+. I soon realized that if he makes his king safe, and plays Qg4 again, then Rg8 saves the threat and (if White's not careful) could win the queen.
This is the stronger of the 2 possible moves, but (like 20.Qd2 Qxd2+ 21.Kxd2) now he can't move his queen to g4 with tempo until his king moves again.
This was done because it allows both of my rooks to move to the b-file with tempo, and it pins the d pawn. He doesn't have a safe way to stop this, so I'm probably going to win unless he surprises me.
He wastes a move and fails to remove the pin on the d3 pawn.
I am now able to deliver checkmate in a few moves.
Needed to cover the f5 square and the h3 square.
8. Na4.  In this position, I have seen no alternatives except for 8. b4 and 8. Ng5.  Na4 has the potential to kick up a lot of harassment by White on the Queen side.  But I was already beginning to think about a flank attack on the other side.
10. dxe5.  I had hoped for this move, so I could initiate some serious pressure on White's King's Knight, starting with a diversion of my Rook sacrifice.  It is true that I saw no immediate positional or material compensation for the Rook, but more of that later.<n><n>Probably his best choice here is 10. Nc5.  I would then have to decide if I should deflect my Queen with 10...Qc8.  Then 11. dxe5 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Nxe5 13. Qf4 c6 14. Be2 would happen, and the King side action has vanished before it even started.
10...Nxe5.  Of course!  Now the pressure heats up on the King side.  I briefly considered 10...Ne4  11. Bxc6 bxc6  12. Qd3  Qd7 13. c4 Bxf3 14. gxf3 Ng5 15. e4 Rxe5 and thought there might be a slight advantage to Black.  But nothing as forcing as what happens after 10...Nxe5.
11....Nxe8.  I did not want to deflect the King's Knight backward like this, as it should be a big part of the King side action.  So I came close to playing 11...Qxe8, but chose to keep the Queen in all the action first.
12. h3.  A fairly serious oversight, I think.  This merely precipitates what was coming in any case.  So he probably needed to consider 12. Nc5 Nxf3+ 13. gxf3  Bh3 14. f4 Bxf1  15. Qxf1 b6 16. Nd3 Nd6  17. Qh3 Nc4 with a slight edge to Black.
14....Qh4.  The immediate threat now is 15...Bg4 16. f3 Qg3+, etc.   I think my choice to recapture the Bishop with my Knight (with 11...Nxe8) was the best choice now, as my Queen could not post here on h4 if I had recaptured with the Queen.  A lot of threats are now available to Black to force mate, depending upon where the Bishop and Queen end up.  <n><n>I did not bother with 14...Bxf1, as the Queen and Bishop are needed to do the job.
16. Nc5.  Probably a blunder, but I see no good alternatives here.  I thought he might try 16. Qf3 to protect the f2 Pawn after my 16...Ne4, and I then planned 16...Ne4 and either: (i) 17. Nc3 Bg4 18. Qg2 Nxc3 19. bxc3 Bxc3 skewering one of the two Rooks, and hopefully the King's Rook so that ....Bxe1 puts more pressure on the f2 Pawn, or (ii) 17. Rb1 Re8 18. Nc3 Nxc3 19. bxc3 Bxc3 20. Rf1 b6 21. Rd1 Bg4 22. Qxd5 Bxd1 23. Qxd1 with a strong edge in space.
This is not atall a good move, since my intension to castle 0-0-0 is clear, and frequently white will follow up with a pawn storm in the king side. This move only helps the pawn storm.
goes with the motif of the opening, black will try to use the open c file to attack. in this sense blacks opening is more attacking since he already have a half open file to mount the rook and the queen.
axB will help black to open the rook file
necessary, since the rook sac at this point is very thematic in sicilian, and leads to a universe of tactics
my old plan to open the king side a little and take advantage of the uncastled king.
to stop the pawn to get to the 7th rank I think, But better still is Bf6
? but there is no better choice to save both the king and the knight
I could have taken the c5 immediately, but I thought it is better to pose threat than execute one. Qxc5 Kc7, Qd5 fxg5 will reduce some pressure off the black due to the cancellation. but instead Bf3 keeps the mating possibility alive
so black gets the bishop to keep the material balance intact after I take the c6 knight
I will leave bishop at the moment and advance h7-h6 this will prevent a move to g5 with f3 knight and also stop c1 bishop coming down any time soon andallow me to freely move knight out onto f6.
there's that move to allow the bishop an extra escape route. d3 is next i think. if this is the case then i'm gonna try and get my queen on a5 though this will probably make him castle
ah yes thought so. do i move queen now i wonder. i imagine this is to free bishop and strengthen pawns. hopefully now i have prevented his bishop from doing too much harm for now. The only problem now of course his bishop is going to d2 so queen might have to wait.
ok. I'm making play for d5 here and hopefully take control of the centre. looking to somehow get queen ona5 bishop c8-e6 then npawn on d5. Only drawback is he could do bishop for bishop leaving me with a weakened defence. i'm going to try and look at a way to defend e6 with another piece now though moves obviously dependent on opposition
ok. I did see this move. hoped he wouldn't so should have expected it. i think this is to win d5. don't think it is to attack knight as it is guarded by queen. I suppose there is a threat of the fork with queen and rook but i don't see a threat yet. probably mainly an attack e7 and c7 restricting my movement and blocking my pawn movement too. (git)
well bishops where i wanted it but not much use now for my plan. I'm hoping this give him something to think about. This will prevent a move to b5 with bishop ( though not a lot of use in that move ) i want his knight away from here. cant take it yet as he has pawn on it. i think bishop d2 or castle
knew about this earlier. this is to open me up
aah this has cleared things up now. I assume this is to attack king with queen...in a bit of trouble now i'm going to have to....
going to try and castle queen side..Thankyou g7 pawn under presssure here. hoping to get away.
Trying to get me to take him hey. if i fell for this it would mean fork....Nice try.
retreat to stop me taking bishop
i think here he is trying to get me to take this pawn so he can take my pawn which will be on b4. This will give him a clear run down the board attacking a7 pawn with rook. I think the next move would to push his pawn ( which would now be on b4) down to threaten knight on c6, forcing me to move it then bring rook down and capture a7 pawn opening up my defence.
5remove the threat of my queen coming down to f2
i assume this is just to remove my bishop and help releave some pressure from arround the f2 square
moves away from my pawn and threatens my rook. i think this is more just moving the bishop than a planned attack
move rook out of way. want to try and move queen and pawn now and look at getting rook on h line queen on g or h. looking at trying to apply pressre at the moment and see if i can force away through
i 'm thinking this is to attack e6 ? Not to sure about this....maybe this is going to be reinforced with his rook ??
well thats stopped an attack on e6 so i think this is to take b5 a3-a4 next ?well at the minute it is looking as though he still wants to attack down this side of the board for checkmate
i'll ignore this at the moment i still want to move my pawn up and get queen and rook over to h/g side
The Sicilian Dragon is one of my favorite weapons as Black, as it has a reputation for being one of the sharpest of openings. A moment's slip for Black can allow a quick win for White...
The immediate ...Ng4 fails to Bb5 .
In the Dragon, White would love to trade off Black's powerful bishop, as once this happens, his attack often proves decisive.
This bishop, which will play crucial roles on both offense and defense from this square for the rest of the game, must be preserved.
Shredder says that I should have played 13.e5 here, giving the line 13.e5 dxe5 14.Bxe5 Bc6 15.Qf4 Nd7 16.Bxg7 Kg7, in which I've accomplished my goal of trading off the dark square bishops with a good position.
I'm going to accomplish my goal anyway.
Shredder likes 17...Be6 better, and this makes sense, as it keeps f7 better defended and also threatens to trade off the important bishop on b3 should the knight on d5 ever move.
Fishing for holes in Black's defense. The pawn on g6 is weaker than it looks, because it is not actually defended by the f7 pawn due to the pin from White's bishop.
Now White can add the backwards pawn on d6 to his list of advantages.
I wanted to keep the bishop on b3 to keep c2 solidly defended.
Defending the g6 pawn with the f7 pawn by stepping out of the pin from the b3 bishop, and clearing some space for defensive purposes. However, the king is far from safe; the rook on h1 stares directly at it, with the queen and possibly the other rook ready to join the melee at a moment's notice.
Here, better use the Rook ant cut the Bishop !
Still, Black side is worrying about the defenses of the King, closing the path of the Bishop..
Here, sacking the Rook to get rid of a pawn. The defenses of the White king is fading away...
Black side is tightening everything and try to capture White King.
A mistake. If 32. Ng3 ... , then Black side has more work.
Hi everyone!  I have recently been annotating games based on chess blunders and some of the types of blunder we all encounter in our chess careers.  But why do we blunder?  Do they come from a clear blue sky, e.g. as a result of lack of concentration or poor board analysis?  Or does our opponent put us under so much pressure that we succumb and make that irreversible blunder?  In this game, Freddy does put the squeeze on.  Even though I am a pawn up for the best part of the game I still end up right in the mire and eventually lose a piece - I play on - more on that one later, but at the end ..... guess what ..... I get Freddied for the eighth time in my 18 games against him!  Ah well, on with the game.  Freddy starts off with d4.
5. Nxf3 - I decided to take on f3 to ensure that I was a safe pawn up - but with Freddy when is anything safe as far as I am concerned?  Freddy takes with the knight developing a piece.
7. Qxf3 - this is the downside of exchanging that bishop for the knight, it brings the Wicked Witch of the West onto the f file and white may have a ready-made attack on both wings as a result - so Henry will have to look out for himself wherever he goes!
11....... 0-0 - I choose the kingside for Henry.
14. Rad1 - Freddy centralises his QR and the pressure is on - look how aggressive his pieces are.  I decide to exchange knights but this does not ease the pressure.
22. ..... Nf8 - this steed goes to f8 to protect the e6 pawn and he remains on f8 until he is captured some 20 moves later.
47. Ra6 - threatening mate on the move - I can now only avoid it by resorting to checks and then somehow getting my rook onto the back rank.
48. ........ Rg2?? - Rg8 would have put a stop to Old Matey but I would have dropped my queenside pawns and then that remote a pawn may well have crowned.
51. ...... Rg2+ - now follows a series of checks which Freddy's king manages to evade.  It has to be said that even when a piece down, an active rook or queen can keep you in the game in the ending because of the possibility of perpetual check - the perpetual can also grab a few enemy pawns.  It did not work here because Henry was constantly in Old Matey's shadow.
54. Kc7 - mate is unavoidable and can only be delayed by sacrificing my rook.  I am in no mood to do this, rather I feel like taking whatever I can from Freddy before he can deliver the blow.  It comes immediately after I take the pawn on a2 because Freddy set up a conditional move to put me out of my misery quickly.  It can be all so easy to crumble under pressure.
White dares black to take the bishop.
A dare black wisely declines.  The bishop is not in jeopardy--black would be foolish to trade knight for bishop and allow white so much power concentrated on the weakened fortress.
Big oops.  While black wants to keep the white king from crossing the e file (to attack Pd2), the pawn was safe.  When you threaten a piece, where will it move?  In this case the obvious spot is Bc4, which captures the black rook.
I think I like Rb1 or Bb3 better.  While black can defend both pawns from Bc3, white needs to get rid of a black pawn.
Black cannot defend d1, the king seems better served blocking the advance of black's g pawn.
If the black king advances black will lose the bishop.  Bc3 pushes the rook, but the black bishop must remain on the diagonal protecting the d pawn.  If white trades the rook for the bishop and pawn, black stands a slim chance of winning or at least getting a draw.<n><n>White's pawn and bishop protect e3 through h3, a line the black king cannot cross.  If black can trade the bishop and pawn for the white rook, white should be able to force mate (with a lot of moves) with the free moving bishop.
Oops again.  Black repeats the rook mistake with the bishop.
ok, that leave the center empty, it doesnt cancel the pressure on d4 and the white ing is quite discovered. By the way, there is no more risk for a f6 knight position so ...
in order to pin the f3 knight. My plan is this : Brcause anyway i know that i will die, i whant to have some fun playing more agressvely, so i diced to intent a bishop sacrifice 9. ...Bd2  10....Qc1   11...Bg4   12.h2/h3 g4xh3 13.g2xh3  Qxh3!   Of course this is too long to prepare and to easy to anticipate for such a good player like my oponent. But it will be fun anyway ! remenber that this is just a blitz .
i fell so sad, it doesnt work ! and i'm now missing a paw and he is going to push the center and surely try to have a advanced paw, this happen very often whith good oponents
in way to pu it in c5 to stop the c4 paw progression and maybe to do all a mess in white camp from c5 (?)
preparing to cancel the pin pressure, but it seems no thing more !
yes ! this is the wining move ! the queen has to move, but where ?
now the c5 knight will start his good job going to e4, Nc3xe4 Nf6xe4 and thea1 rook is threatened ...
not enought, first Ne4 c3, the queen have to move then i take with the same knight the e2 bishop, the queen has to take it an so i win the d4 knight !
win the rook
but i win the bishop ! now i'm +5, the game could go on, but white resign.
?! Nc6 is most of the time a must before doing the fianchietto. Now black is entering into a lot of complications.
?! cxd4 then Qxd4 lead to a lot of complications. I'm trying something different.
Qa5+ then Qxc5 could have been a solution to prevent the exchange of the queens. But I would have lost a lot of tempo.
Now white have a big advantage but he has everything to prove. Without the queens, the game turns into slow maneuvers like some variations of the berlin defense in the ruy. In this position, white have some tempo and black must quickly defend his position. The threats will come fast. I don't think that this opening is any good for black finally.
Bd6 was possible but I wanted to prevent to move my bishop again because of a further e5. My rook gonna be harder to develop but I don't care at this point of the game.
! Forcing the bishop to go to c1, white's attack is completely annihilated.
White left at this point. If 37.exf5 Kxf5 white have to sac his Rook to protect himself of Re7#. Even without taken it, black still have a big advantage. Like in the tale of the rabbit and the turtle, the rabbit have too much took things easy instead to go right to the goal. The turtle finally won slowly.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Right now, I Jo Stevens, am sitting in Coach Ion's Classroom on a stool near his desk, with my back to the class with the Dunce's Cap on.  The reason for this is because I had to go pawn grabbing again - didn't I?  I really should have learned from this game with Freddy, the Headmaster - OMG, if he sees me in the corner, I had better think of hiding a few regicide manuals under my gym pants and trousers lest I get summoned to his study!, that game is: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/the-sodium-attack?gm=28475 in which I was punished in full for my "greed" although one must note that in both cases I lost or was about to lose a pawn and I thought I would regain the pawn, unfortunately I did but at a price.  One has to say, however, that the motif Ion used was similar but a little different.  Ahh well, here goes.  This is the King's Indian Thematic Tournament organised by fatcat, a member of the Master Mater's Coaching Club.  I will comment again on move 5 because although that is part of the MT setup that f4 move deserves some comment .....
5. f4 - this move has advantages and disadvantages.  It's strengths are twofold.  This pawn controls e5 and g5 and is also used to break up a fianchettoed position.  This pawn moves early on in the opening in The Bird's Opening, The Pirc Defense - Austrian Attack, The Robatsch Defense and the Sicilian Dragon/Naijdorf as well as the King's Indian 4 pawn attack.  Ok. White has an impressive pawn centre, but it can be punctured.  The drawback of the f pawn moving, however, is that it opens up the Fool's Mate Diagonal - e1-h4.  Here is how a 1650+ player came a cropper against The Dentist on that diagonal:-  http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/fools-paradise?gm=15408.  That diagonal can be exploited in the opening.  Another diagonal that black can take advantage of is the g1-b8 diagonal after white has castled short by means of his queen or dark squared bishop.  In this case I do castle short and Ion does take advantage of this with his dsb as you will see.
10. 0-0 - I castle long, there is another advantage about moving the f2 pawn up two squares and that is that the knight on f3 is protected by my king rook so my castled position will not be broken up should Fou Leblanc and Glenda decide to move off the d1 - h5 diagonal.
12. a4 - a recommeded move holding up a pawn roll on the queenside.  Trouble is my pawn is weak on that square and it will drop off later on.
14. Rxe2 - I decided to recapture with the rook.  It does have its merits in a sense that it prepares a doubling on that file but in my case it did critically weaken my back row.
17. ....... fxe6 - knight trade - now, just observe summat, that e6 pawn, displaced from f7 opens up the f file for the black rook.  If that happens, beware, Ion now has a target, which will be apparent four moves down the line.
21. ...... Bd4!! - here is the punishment!  Note I talked about that g1-a7 diagonal earlier on, where black can land an annoying check on a king that has castled on that side.  Here is the check.  Now how do we get out of check.  There are only two options here, block or move Henry.  1. Blocking with Rf2 drops at least the exchange and walks Henry into a pin after the resulting Bxf2+.  Option 2, Kf1 walks Henry straight into a pin on the f column.  Option 3, well, no obvious pin, but look - the knight will be pinned because Old Matey just lurves those back rows and I will certainly cop it if I move my knight after Ion pushes his pawn to g5.  Nh3 will not help as the g2 square is doubly attacked by the dsb and the rook when it lands on f1 to give check, so Rxg1 will be mate, sss-shh-ugar!
24. Ng6+ - I try and get some semblance of an attack going by opening up lines to Ion's king - sadly, the Wicked Witch of the West will ensure that Glenda cannot take full advantage of his denuded king.
26. Rh3+ - would it have been better if Glenda had gone to that square and not the rook?  You the Inquest Jury decide!
29. Re7+ - I manage to get a rook on Ion's second rank, normally a bone in the throat is a good thing, but it achieves nowt here.
31.  h3 - I would love to send my remaining rook up the board to join his colleague on the 7th rank.  Trouble is, that bally back row is the bane of my life in this game.  First I must either, a. Move Henry or b. Move a pawn in front of Henry.  Neither of these two necessary options contribute to me counter-attacking Ion on the 7th rank.  Look at Ion's king - now all I need is a second rook on that 7th rank and it will be Ion staring Old Matey in the face.  Before that can happen though .....
31. ..... Rd1+ - Ion can get in that vital tempo which can put a spoke in the wheel.  I am now forced to exchange one of my rooks.
40. ...... Nd3 and goodnight from me, as I will be a knight and two pawns down (equivalent to a whole rook) and Ion has those lurvely black passers on the queenside to boot I feel it is time to draw the line, so I wave the white flag.   Ah now, time for some prep - better have a go at doing some puzzles for Coach Ion.  So, what lessons have you learned from this game?  Anyhow, hope you have had a good read - bye for now - Joanne
? Knights on the rim are rather dim!
? Okay, I'll open the center, because after dxd5 it's O-O-O for me!
I had to struggle to keep my face straight at this oddball countergambit.
castled incase there was something i was missing, and to make it look like i slipped up and didn't guard my queen
only 1 spot to move to and my bishop is safe there forever
he is trying to push pawns even though none of them can get past mine..
This game was part of a mini-tournament, "Derman's sicilian  XXI". Not surprisingly if you know the name, this was the starting position.  The idea of the Sicilian is that White gets a developmental lead and tries  to attack in the centre or on the kingside, while Black seeks counterplay  on the queenside and the c-file (which is usually opened soon).
?! Yes, the queen is a very  powerful piece. But to get her out so early is risky, to say the least. She can  now easily come under attack, and because she is so powerful, you should  try to keep her on the board, unless you get very good compensation or can  deliver checkmate. That's why this is not a good move. Better would be  3...cxd4, exchanging a wing pawn for a central one and opening the c-file to  attack.
I think this is the best  move, because 7...Bh5?! 8.g4 Bg6 9.Ne5 and White already gets his kingside  attack going while he is still able to exchange knight for bishop if he wants  to. (Usually an N for B exchange is good for the side that loses the N,  especially on an open board)
? A mistake, Black should try to undermine White's plans. My computer  (Fritz 8) gives 8...a6 to deny White access of b5 and prepare ...b5 for himself.
? Black shouldn't care about that little e6 pawn. Now White  has a clever (but rather simple) way to win material:
? Another mistake. Better  was 12...Qd8, 'only' losing two more pawns: 13.Qxc5+ Qc7 14.Qxa7. Now Black  will lose a piece and a pawn instead.
Unfortunately for  Black, the only way to keep his rook is to sac his knight.
My computer found a  nice variation here: 18.Nb5! Rxc4 19.Bc7! Qxc7 (the only way to prevent  mate on d8) 20.Nxc7 Kxc7 and White won't have any problems to convert this into a  win, with so little material on the board.
?? Another big mistake by  black. The next move must have been a surprise for him...
! A  knight sac. Of course there's the threat 20.Nxb4. If 19...Q5, White gets a devastating attack with 20.Ne7+ and if 19...Qb5, White can threate unstoppable mate with 20.Qe5 and Qc7# to follow soon. (I didn't actually calculate these lines)
??  Another blunder. Of course White can just take the pawn and maintain the  threat. But he has even better...
! There's the queen again. Black has to  get the king out of check and cannot save his own queen anymore.
And with some smart manoeuvering she also wins the rook. Actually the  checkmate would be delivered faster without taking the rook, and of course the  queen plays an important part in that line again: 24...Kd7 25.Qd6+ Ke8  26.Qe6+ Kf8 27.Bxh6#. Unfortunately for Her Majesty, Black resigned and ended her  pleasure. Still she was very proud of this game. She had taken two bishops, a  knight and two pawns and helped her teammates to take the enemy queen. Thanks for  reading this annotation and I hope you enjoyed it. I did enjoy playing this  game, but next time I'll show you a more exciting gone.
? I was expecting e5, breaking into the center...
? I also didn't understand this move. My opponent wasted a tempo by moving the rook back to f8. She was probably changing plans, and aiming for an f5 break later on.
? And yet another mistake. I was figuring Ne8 was to prepare f5. This allows me to play Qh6 with possible mate threats. Better would have been Kxg7 to block off h6.
Good defense. A not so smart move like f5 would end in Ng5 and black is in a world of hurt if not mated...
Now the f6 knight is pinned down to defending h7, so any attacks on the knight will win it.
Preparing e5, winning the knight. This can not be avoided
hehe... black moved his rook from f8 to e8 to f8 to e8. This time it is all he can do to keep from getting checkmated.
Trading queens would stop my attack, and so black goes for it. Now, I have to decide to trade and win with my knight vs. pawn advantage, or to continue my attack with Qh4. Although trading looked tempting, I decided to continue my attack.
Have to get rid of the pesky knight first...
Checkmate. This was a very good game for me, and a nice way to finish off the tournament. I finished the tournament with 3.5/5.0, and tied for second place, unfortunately not winning anything because of a three way tie for first... My rating jumped up to 1571 after the tournament. I will try to post more of my better games as I play more tournaments. Adios!
an original approach.  though white never did anything with the horse during the game it could have gone to c2 after c3 and went places from there.
9 c3 was probably the best try.  Weaker was 9 0-0-0 a6 10 c3 b5 11 Bb3 b4 12 cxb4 cxb4 13 Nc4 a5 with the threat of ... a4
11 ... Qd4 is defended by 12 Qc3 so black decides to go with the text looking for active play.
the possible mate on g2 creates some nice tactical possibilities for black.
here black can not be too aggressive.  18 ... Rd4 is ably met by 19 Ne4!
one might wonder if this was a mouse slip since 21 Rac1 was the logical defense to the knight.
I don't want to defend with d3 or Nc3 because I am planning to take over the centre with c3 and d4, and moves like d3 or Nc3 interfere with those plans.
Not a good move. Black has moved his knight twice in the opening, which wastes a tempo, and he is ignoring my threat of d4, which will give me a tempo. Gaining tempi are very important in open games like this.
I am adding another pawn to my centre, and Black will have to trade his strong e-pawn for my less valuable c-pawn, because moving the bishop immidiately will lose a pawn beceause h3 drives the knight away from the defense of the e-pawn.
I offer Black a pawn. This is somewhat risky because you should only complicate the game when you are losing, and I have a pretty decent position here. But I am good at complicated positions and was confident I could beat him in one.<n>If Black hadn't accepted the pawn, my plan would be to play a3 Bb2 Qb3 and then advance my central pawns.
A positional mistake, giving me a slight advantage.<n>For compensation for the pawn, I have a new open diagonal for my bishop, and an open b-file I can use later to help me with my attack after I play h3 and advance my central pawns.
I activate my bishop with a gain of tempo.
I am threatening f7, and the only way to defend it is to take the agressive knight.
Black could've defended f7 with Ng5 if his knight had moved to h7 instead of g8, but then I would simply play h4, attacking the only defender of the f7 mating square. And Black could've also defended f7 with Nh6 if he hadn't made the terrible h6 move earlier. But other than the what-ifs, the only other way to stop mate in 1 is to sacrifice the queen.
My bishop on a3 is really what killed Black, because it stopped him from castling to defend mate on f7. But it was Black's one faulty 3.h6 move that led to these complications, because it gave me a lead in development, allowing me to get an initiative in the centre, driving Black's defensive pieces away. Just look at the knight on g8, which isn't even developed, yet it moved 4 times in the game.
My opponent cuts off all retreating squares making my life easier. It did take me some time to figure out 5. Bg5 was no longer the best move. If you see a good move, always look around and try and fine one better.
Preparing to fianchetto and castle. The Bishop on g7 looks weak to me because of my strong pawn structure blocking the diagonal
Relieving the pin
Preventing the pin. I went long side castle here because my Bishop on g5 prevents my opponent from long side castling and my king side attack is already rolling
Now, saving the knight allows me 13. Nxc7+ and the fork
Perhaps hoping to trap my knight after Nxa8 and only lose the exchange
This was another case of holding my horses :-) and not immediately taking the rook but looking around for a better move
If 15. ... Nd7 then 16. Qe8#
My opponent made some blunders here but what allowed me to take best advantage of them was looking deeper into the position for a better move than the one that first occured to me.
The Caro-Kann is my favourite defense to the king-pawn opening.
Not 4. Bd3 Bxd3 5. Qxd3 Qb6! 6. Nf3 Qa6 and Black gets a good game. This plan for Black was Nimzovich's idea.
?! dubious, sacrificing the "minor exchange" - bishop for knight
The black king is safe on f7 for the moment.
Perhaps I should have kept the bishops on the board, since Black's bishop is pretty bad compared to White's light-square bishop.
Prevents Ke6. Now White can march his king to f5.
I am starting annotating this game as it is a very tactical and interesting game. <n><n>I have looked through countless variations, many leading to checkmate and others to much material gain, but overall this game was very enlightening to me. Showing the power of inititaive and piece placement over pure material.
Preferred by me over Bb5, Bc4 allows many more tactics and sharp fights in the opening compared to the Ruy.
The main difference in this and the fried liver is the opening of the e-file, allowing white to use his rook early in the attack.
!! Ok. If I had not looked at this line before the game I would have never come up with this move. <n><n>The point is after dxc3, both the e and d files are open and black cannot defend eventually against the numerous mate threats. Looking at this position is a very good exercise for tactics!
A sign Black has messed up in the opening. Black has to concede a piece and leaves white materially equal and with a devastating position and attack.
I have calculated a lot in this position and I believe this position is winning for white. It really is a great position to study from with all the tactics against the black king. I was ready for basically everything Black could have played. I spent a lot of time looking av variations, some probable and others not so probable, but it really was a great game to refine my tactical skills.
?? Walks into a forced mate. The other option of Nxd5 is not pretty either though <n>12. Nxd5 13. Qxd5+ 13.Bd6?? 14. Qf5+!! 14. Kc6 15. Qb5#<n>12. Nxd5 13. Qxd5 13.Ke8 14. Qf5+!  14. Ke8! (not Kc6 Qb5#, not Kd6 Qd5#) 15. Qf7+ 15. Kd7 16.Bg5! And Black loses the bishop on e7 with a very dangerous attack to white, note also that 16. Re8?? loses to 17. Qe6#
?? Even worse. White misses the forced mate after 13. Nf6+!! clearing the d5 square for the queen. If after 13. Bxf6 then 14. Qd5#. If after 13. gxf6 then 14. Be6+! (the move i missed) and then if 14. Kd6 then 15. Qd5# and if 14. Ke8 then 15. Qh5+ 15. Kf8 16. Bh6#
I calculated this variation and found it to be quite favorable for white, not forced mate but very favorable. This variation tempted me into calculating these variations, when instead If I had looked harder I could have found the very pretty forced mate a move earlier. Note the interesting theme of not taking material. In fact 14. Kxe7?? loses the game after 15. Bg5+ and the King will get mated on the open board with the two bishops and Queen. Note also 14. Nxa1?? 15. Qd5+! and if 15. Kxe7 then white mates with the similar pattern as before, and if Black moves 15. Ke8 trying to hide behind the white knight then white wins with 16. Nxc8 and the mate with the two bishops is unavoidable. <n><n>Thus the strongest move in this position is the very odd 14. c6! attempting to run away from the white attack through c7. I calculated this variation beforehand also, and found that not winning material is the best option (such as Qf5+ forking the knight and king). Instead the best move is the interesting 15. Bf4! stopping black from running away. Again in all the variations where black gobbles material he finds that his king is quickly mated in the middle by the two well placed bishops and Queen that slice into the Black position. This position really is so pretty to me, White having superb development and a strong attack and is willing to sacrifice the material lead for the pretty mates with the two bishops and queen.
?? A bad move gobbling white's worthless rook on a1 and deactivating the knight. White now has mate by force. I was very proud of myself for calculating all the lines beforehand and seeing there was no way for him to escape mate after Nxa1.
? The last error. Black could try to hold on after 15. Ke8! but still white wins after 16. Nxc8 16. Rf8! (16. Rxc8 17. Bg5+ 17. Ke8 18. Qf7#) 17. Bg5+ 17. Rf6 18. Qe7+! 18. Kxc8 19. Qe8#<n><n>But this variation requires no calculation.
The two bishops and Queen brutally rip apart the Black position. The game is not over yet although it is forced mate. I wanted to annotate the game as soon as possible so all the variations were still in my head, sorry if my opponent sees this. <n><n>A great tactical game. Both of us missed a stunning knight sacrifice leading to forced mate, but I was able to get out of the opening with a strong material and positional lead which enabled me to sacrifice my material back for a winning attack. A very interesting game that had me laughing at all the funny ways white could win, I suggest people to check out other possible Black replies I did not show in the game and see the amazing replies white has.
So I push.   Black has to be a bit careful about ending up in a French-type position - not necessarily because of the position itself, but because it can be different to their usual games and they mayn't be aware of some of the traps
And I push.   The point of 2. c3 is to be able to retake in the centre with a pawn and retain the balance in the centre.
And I take now.   I don't know if the transposition 5. cd Nc6 6. Nf3 is really any different, or if black has another fifth move to play
I develop the bishop with tempo
And black retreats; this is often not a great square for the knight, and in some games, it can be undermined by a later a4-a5 push, when maybe a7 or b7 end up as targets for a queen or bishop respectively
And I develop.   I'm not worried about losing the LSB as the queen will cover the same squares from b3 in the event of an exchange.
Maybe slightly ahead of time - I think black usually transposes the 11th and 10th as played in this game.   This move holds the pawn, but gives black light-squared weaknesses, which a bishop or queen on b3 can try take advantage of.
So I develop the bishop.   White often castles late in this opening; I'm not under any pressure at the moment, and development is more important.   The bishop here is keeping an eye on b6 and a7, as per the earlier note
And I take back.   Black is going to find it a bit hard to develop his kingside - 12. ... e6? 13. de - and maybe 12. ... Kf7 is the plan here.
I castle now, and bring my h-rook into the game
And this is a mistake too; I'd even seen 16. Rfc1 Bc6 17. PxB bc with pressure, and ignored it.   Not an auspicious start!
Black's queen runs...though Qd7 is slightly better, says Fritz.   Qd6 allows the reply 18. Nc4, when the knight on b6 is going to be removed, and white may get some counterplay as there's a few pieces pointing at the black king after 17. ... Qd6 18. Nc4 QxP 19. Qb3 NxN 20. RxN
Black gives his bishop a route to the game
And black takes now.   I'm three pawns down - and Fritz scores it -0.3.   The compensation?   Lots of open files towards the black king.
Black moves the queen away
This has to be wrong - and is.   Black nabs a fourth pawn, and gives me a fourth open file to play on.   Again, 24. Qc4 is the reply
I play this though.   I'd like to think in an OTB game, I'd have played some moves differently!
Surprisingly, this is a mistake - Qa2 was the only square to go to, as will become apparently shortly.
25. ... Ka8?? Rcb1 and black can resign
Here, Fritz gives the amusing defence 28. ... Qb4 (or Qd6) 29. Ra1+ Qa3 30. Rb1 and a draw by repetition!   Black offers his queen to defend the knight, and I can't take as I'm a rook and three pawns down already.
29. ... Rd6 was another option here.   But after 30. Qc4+ Kb7 31. Bc5 RxN 32. Qb5+ (not 32. BxB as 32. ... Qd3 forks queen and rook!) Kc7 33. BxB, I've a strong attack.   33. ... Rb8 is a tricky reply, however, when I can't take the queen because my back rank is weak - 34. Ba5+ Rb6 35. Qa6! is the only way to keep the advantage.   Appropriately, the a7 pawn is the weakness now - again as singled out in the opening, even if at this stage, that's just a pure coincidence.
Again, the only follow-up - forking mate and the queen.   Here, black has to admit the attack and give up his queen - 30. ... Qa5 31. NxQ BxN 32. Qxe6, and I've a queen for a rook, bishop and two pawns, and Fritz says I'm not losing, though black would have plenty of opportunity to prove me wrong over the board.
And for a change, I spot it.   Black can't recapture because of QxP#, while 31. ... Bc5 - maybe black's original plan - is met with 32. Qb7+ Ka5 33. Qa7#
This allows a similar mate to the one just described - black's only defence was to cover b7 by 31. ... Rb8, but I still win with 32. Qc4+ b5 33. Qc6+ Ka7 34. NxP+ RxN 35. QxR and the bishop is gone next, and the win will be trivial
And I pick up the bishop and queen, so black resigned.   Aside from the fun tactics (and the embarrassing misses on my behalf!), I found the couple of lines Fritz picked up on that I simply hadn't considered to be interesting - moves where I reckoned there was only one plan of action, and was completely blinded to a second, better, plan as a result.
Or 7...exd5, 8. Ng3 with an eye to 9. Nf5.
His best hope, but it ruins his pawn structure and opens his kingside to attack.
He probably should have interposed 10...Bb4+, 11. Bd2, Bxd2, 12. Qxd2, gxf4. At this point, white needs to choose among 13. Qxf4, 13. d7 and 13. dxe6. I'm partial to 13. d6, Qg5, 14. g6!
This couldn't have been played earlier because the black queen backed up the bishop. Now the bishop must die.
And black resigns.
Not 15... BxP immediately because of 16 QR-N1.
Black initiates maneuvers whose object is to reduce the mobility of the opposing pieces and deprive the Knight of operational bases.
If White now wishes to keep his Bishop in the center he must concede control of the Q file.
On 34 R-R1, 34... K-K4 followed by P-B5 ch and Black's Rook will gain the seventh rank.
This is one of the more interesting games I have played here at Gameknot.  It starts from a quiet, double-king pawn opening and becomes a double-edged game with attacking possibilities for both sides.  Most of the action is created when we castle on opposite sides, leading to a bit of a race to the king.  Enjoy!
The typical move for white here is Nxe5, leading to Nxe5 and d4.  I've played that variation before, but I like moving the bishop to g2 better.
The bishop on g2 seems to be hampered by my e-pawn, but later in the game, when the center opens up, the bishop could be very powerful.  Whatever disadvantage comes from the bishop's lack of mobility early is made up for later.
This pin could be uncomfortable, but it allows me to get my king to h2, which is where I want it.
This to me is a crucial move.  With the kings on opposite sides, the potential for full-scale onslaughts on both sides of the board emerges.  This game turns into a race; however, with my development, I'm ahead already.  Also, notice that my g2 bishop is potentially a very good piece if I can open the center.
The d4 knight and c5 bishop (that shouldn't still be on the board!) are black's two most active pieces.  I'm looking to trade them off and maybe crack open the center.
My opponent did the trading, and I was happy to oblige.
My opponent here seems to want to storm the pawns as well; however, his queen is out of position to assist in the attack, and my attack will come too quickly.
Beginning the attack with a gain of time.
a5 for him here doesn't work because I can still advance to b6 and break open his position.
Allowing my queen into the attack and possibly opening up the center for my bishop.
I believe that my opponent moved here to try and bring his knight back into the defense; however, this move is probably the worst blunder of the game.  Better is Qd7 followed by Rdg8, trying to spring the king.  With this move, however, my attack is able to come full force.
Bringing the queen in...if he'll allow me, my plan is Qc6 and Ra8#.  At this point, I was trying to envision a number of different mates.  I knew that my position was really good, and I spent lots of time working on different mating combinations.
The queen is just brutal on this square.  His king needs to retreat to d8 and e7, but those squares are occupied.
Here's where I missed the forced mate.  Ra7 here wins the game.  After Nxc6, the king can't get out fast enough to escape from my rooks.  I didn't even consider Ra7 during the game.  I had planned to play Ra8 and Rb1 to finish him off.  There really isn't a way for him to escape here, so me missing mate wasn't too crucial.
For some reason, I still thought that I need my queen to finish the game off, so I declined the trade here.
My opponent bails me out here.  Qe8 allows his king to escape to d7 and e7.  I think he had hopes of a draw here, but I quickly saw my mistake and put my queen back where she needed to be.
Loses the queen and leads to mate shortly after.  I think the pressure of defending finally got to him.  Qxc6 is the only acceptable move here.
Forced to take the rook and lose the queen, and he still has mate problems.  The game was definitely over at this point.  Black resigns.<n><n>This was a fun game to play and to analyze.  I hope you enjoyed sharing it with me.
And I play my favourite Samisch system
I put my trust in devlopment. I saw on the Gameknot World Database that Qd2, Nh3 and Nge2 are actually more common
I indicate a willingness to transpose into the Maroczy Bind, if he exchanges on d4.
9. Qd2, and I think he was afraid I would play Bh6 and exchange off his lovely dark squared bishop, so he moved his rook so that he can drop his bishop back to h8 if necessary. However in some variations of the King's Indian, the rook is better on f8, to support f7-f5.
So I decide to advance on the King side. His a6 rather put me off queen's side castling - he can sacrifice a pawn with b5 and get some open files against my king. I was thinking of putting my king on f2 - especially as he had moved his rook from f8.
His e5 took us out of the Opening Databases (not that either of us were using them at the time of course. With my king still in the centre I felt best to close the centre, although I did consider exchanging pawns too. Nb6 looks a dreadful move. It blocks the advance of his b pawn. I think he wanted to give another square to his Nf6 (another downside of Re8 was that he now has less squares for that Knight.
I decide to play h5 before he gets in with h5. I am not sure why he plays Bf8
My Bd3 is not a good bishop, blocked by my own pawns. I decide to exchange it. He correctly protects it with his queen. Maybe I should play Rh4 here, but instead I decided to complete my development with....
So I grab an open file and prepare to move my Nc3 over to the king side.
and it is soon sent back. I think he wasted 2 moves here. b3 was a move I wanted to play anyway, to free my queen up
and he finally starts his counter play. Again I looked at the sacrifices on g6 and h7. At the time I didn't think they worked, and then a move or two later, when it was too late, I realised they did! See http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=33318
and another little puzzle has arisen. White to play and mate in 2!
this was wrong black move, ignoring the treat coming on f7
i just need to castle, doesnt matter the bishop
At this point I expected an open game with a Queen exchange coming soon by ...Nxd5, 8. Qxd5
but I won't allow that... I'm going to force his knight out of the way to prevent him from taking the c pawn and taking my rook
Attacks bishop and covers the f7 square, but blockade his own d7 pawn.
Keeping the bishop
Qd1 was better for development, but I wanted to support my pawn on e5
..and probably wanted to extend the pressure on my black bishop via Re7 in the next move
Sicilian Defense, still the first choice of Grandmasters vs 1. e4 . Perhaps it always will be!? What do you think? Can you guess, or already know why it is such a popular choice for GM's; and others too? I'll tell a few of the reasons: #1 It "tests" the opponent thru all phases of the Game. First is the Opening itself which has reams of theory written on every variation conceivable. The breadth and depth of this theory gives an opponent ample opportunity to err in the very opening, and still can produce improvements aor TN's (Theoretical Novelties- Basically a substantially untried move which one hopes is no worse than present theory, yet new and different. It might even be slightly inferior but produce such complexity that a well prepared player may feel it is worth playing). The Middle-Game: Here too there is plenty of room for Improvements and novelties and simply knowing or playing the variations better than the opponent. And finally the End Game comes, if the opp has not yet succumbed. And it makes for a certain type of endgame as well. It will almost certainly have "unbalanced pawn structure" which is considered much less drawish than balanced wings. Also many Rook or Rook + Minor piece endings will occur, giving a player of the Sicilian a chance to put extra study and experience in them to good use.
Most common by far. One might try Ne2 instead in blitz to see if the opp will stop and think. However they could play 2...e5 then keeping it a Closed Siclian. So I prefer the straight forward Nf3
Possible is such as 3...e6 intending to meet a 4.dxc5 move with Qa5+ then recapture the pawn on c5. Its just different for blitzing.
This is the point where I consider it a true Fischer's Attack, for the Bb3 choice was his trademark.
I like g4, to meet an ...e5 by Nf5 and recapture with the g4 pawn if taken there.
Whoops~! It just went Scheveningen on me. And rather a Kere Attack I believe, but didnt have time to look it up before moviing :)
Of course I did all the "I move Rook, he move pawn, I move Rook ... I move Rook, before playing Rg1. So its time to proceed is all. Tho BL can play e5 before b4 and would have stopped this Rook lufting idea. But he didnt. And now I can passive-sac the entire West 40 if need be. Or use d5 and that entire diagonal if he should try to play ...e5 at this point. I didnt calculate that to any particular win, but proceeded with confidence that WT's needs would be met in that regard.
An interesting game against a good player, for Ajun and I have traded a number of past wins. But the peculiarity of the attack brings the victory.

? I don't like this move - Black is putting a lot of support behind a pawn push to d5, but he could have played that now! I'm seeing something like 3...d5 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.Bf7 with reasonable chances for both sides. The more pressing concern with that pawn is that it blocks the natural square for Black's knight [though to be fair, that problem is sorted out quickly enough...]
A temporary pin on the bishop, who has to defend the b2 pawn
I remember choosing this move over b3 because I wanted White to keep ahead in the development race [at this point, I actually considered Black a little better... though to be honest, there really isn't any attacking chances for either side right now]
? I guess Black wanted to follow through with his plan to take the pawn, and I had missed this move, but I easily found a refutation tp Black's plans...
crushing! all of a sudden, White has three threats - the knight threatens the queen on d4, the queen threatens the bishop on c8 and the knight threatens to win the rook with Nc7+
?? Black sees two threats (though Nc7+ can still be played) but misses Qxc8+. Now, Black is in for a world of hurt... I think best for Black would have been 9...Qc4 10.Qxc4 dxc4 11.Nc7+ Kd8 12.Nxa8
...but still leads to a heavy loss in material - Black resigns. I't slways pleasing to get quick wins like this sometimes :)
now the situation has changed : i dont care about the b2 fianchetto, i'm just going to attack e4xf5...Qh5+...etc
ho ! another surprise ! the danger was Qh5, so the only good answer was, at less, Kh6 in order to use it after in f7 protection....Yes idj, but then fxe5...is not so better, isnt it ?
not enought, i have the f4 paw
still not enought...i will take the knight and propose queen exchange...
My first mistake. Now, black can spread a powerful attack with B4, threatening Nc2+. I can parry it with Bd3, losing a pawn... and the game's coherence.
Black doesn't see it, plays this unforced move (better was e6, if not Nb4 as said).
I don't care about NxN, KxN, so to join the Rs... and Nxe5 is not possible yet for black, so the "point" behind Qe7 has not came to anywhere. My move threats two pawns (Nc6 won't be defended after Qxb7, so the pawn is not poisoned). (quick quiz) Can you see how to defend both pawns?
Only move that defends both. Now I have to prove my ability to switch target from the kingside to the queenside.
Threatening BxN, disrupting his pawns. Black can't use B or N to defend. Which would be Black's best  and natural move, here?
Not this. Natural move, but it happens that from here, black's fate is almost inevitable. Due to the sac and the Qe7 (bad) idea, Bdsb is trapped, and so is Rh8, while white has it very easy to penetrate on black's white squares, due to the poor position of Bg6. Note that, normally, this B is very powerful, but here he is just targeting nothing (I can't play Rb1, ok, that's all!). Nec5 instead, Qa3, Na6, and after Q's exchange, black can take a breath. Or NxN, KxN, d4, threatening dxc3+ or dxe3+...
...but this seems to recover the piece. But for... (can you find the correct combination?)
The key is f6 is weak, and if I can take it with check, I would have tempo to free my lsb.
Again, if you answered Ne5, you were right. But this is crushing, too. Note that black can't propose the Q's exchange (which would lighten the pressure). Not now.
First decision point: I decided to stay on familiar ground, even though I'm now convinced that the Nimzo-Indian is a much sounder defence.  As yet, I'm not sufficiently familiar with the Queen's Indian and Bogo-Indian to risk ending up in one of those, so I stuck with the King's Indian.
I'm usually suspicious of playing ...h6 to push a bishop away, since the pawn can become a target after Be3 and Qd2; but in this position I felt that I should put the question to the B while my N was still unpinned, planning to defend the h-pawn with my King if necessary.
The first surprise and quite a pleasant one: the h6 pawn is unlikely now to become a target.  On the other hand, the B is still aimed at my Q, so I need to be careful how and when I move my e-pawn and Nf6.
?! Played after some thought but probably wrong.  In the KID, Black is usually OK playing ...e5 without fully supporting it but not in this position with the B on h4.  Thus the motivation was to support ...e5 with this N.  I didn't want to develop it to the more aggressive-looking c6 because it could be immediately pushed away with d5.  Now, in many variations of the KID, Black tries hard to provoke White into that advance, solidifying the centre so that Black can work around the edges, but I couldn't see a suitable home for the N after 7...Nc6 8. e5.  Black's other possible N development is via a6, which again doesn't directly support ...e5 but does lay claim to b4 and c5, while leaving Black's lsb scope for development.  In this game, my lsb doesn't get to move till move 18, something that preyed on my mind throughout the intervening period.  I could have deferred decisions on the N's development by making a pawn move such as ...c6 or ...c5, ...b6 or ...a6 or ...a5.  7...g5 was considered briefly but I felt it was too risky: White could swap B or N for 2 pawns and then use the half-open files to launch a withering attack on my K.
A sensible move, possibly preparing 0-0-0, possibly just Rd1.  With the Black N on d7, there is no risk of it coming soon to b4 to harrass the Q.
With White's pawn still on d4, his N could still occupy d5.  I'd seen in my game against Paxton-Doggett how devastating that could be, so I decided to prevent it while I still had time to, especially if I managed to get ...e5 in.
I decided to get the Q off the d8-h4 diagonal before launching the e-pawn.  The main drawback that I could see was that, after 0-0, White could oppose the Q with Re1, making it risky to advance the e-pawn and provoke multiple exchanges.
Played in anticipation of needing to advance the c-pawn and not wanting to allow Nb5, attacking the then-undefended d6 pawn.
White prevents the pawn's further advance and possibly prepares an advance by his f-pawn.  I could also see that the N was probably aiming to go via e4 to d6, which looked like a nuisance but I felt I could live with it.
A bit of a waiting move with ideas of possibly advancing the b-pawn and developing the lsb to b7
Not the N I'd expected to move there but perfectly logical.
Played quickly.  Now I thought long and hard about how I was going to deal with the N that was sure to come to d6 now.  Eventually I decided that I could just live with it and play around it.  If White wanted to swap his good N for my bad B, so be it.  Otherwise, I just needed to avoid the white squares with my Rooks and keep my Q next to d6.  So then it was a question of seeing what else I could do and I noticed that the pawn move had given me the d5 square, so...
! Now I could see relief from my cramped position.  I could advance the f-pawn, move my other N and finally move my lsb.  I could also budge his Q if I liked with ..Nb4.
! Black chooses the moment when taking en passant is not feasible because it would leave the Nd6 undefended.  This now prevents White from pinning the Nd5 against Black's Q with Bc4.
! Unexpected but strong, aiming for a5, whence it will threaten c6 and thence b8.  Once more White's R dominates the d-file.
Another waiting move.  White explained after the game that he was suddenly worried by the possibility of Nf6 moves, followed by ...f5 and ...g5 and ...f4 trapping the Bh4.  I have to confess that I hadn't really considered this.  I was still trying to unravel my pieces and not yet thinking about the typical KID kingside pawn avalanche (see move 17).  With all this worrying, White had now used up nearly 20 minutes more than me on the clock and ours was the least advanced game in progress.
Now I was considering trying to gain a pawn with 20...Nxd6 21. cxd6 Qxd6 but soon rejected that idea because of 22. e4!, pinning the N against my Q.  However, I could also see other advantages of this retreat, such as once more allowing ...f5 and, possibly, tempting White to swap on e8
The only move to save my Q, trapped as it was in the centre of the board.
A desultory attempt to improve this rook, hoping eventually to double somewhere, if I could do anything about White's pesky prelates.
! I hadn't expected this though.  Now my rook will have taken three moves to do what it could have accomplished in one.
Fnally something more constructive from Black, though I had my doubts about releasing control of f4.  These were outweighed by the perception that White's dsb was now offside on b6 and that my Bg7 could finally have some freedom and influence on the game.  In a few more moves, this pawn might be able to fork White's Rooks!
I had long been expecting this as preparation for White to occupy d6 with his Rook.  In the cold light of day it does look odd, though, to give up this active B for Black's enfeebled N.
The rook returns where it was 6 moves ago.  The main purpose of this move was to make 30. Nd6 less dangerous.
Another mysterious move to my back rank.  Clearly my Q has to move but I could see no ulterior motive, so...
Now I swap off my newly active Q: seems illogical, but I couldn't see anything better at the time.  Afterwards, Dave suggested 31...Qb2, when Black can hope to hoover up the pawn chain but risks getting his B trapped.  I hadn't considered it at this point but did consider and reject that strategy soon after.
The only move to protect both c6 and h6 at once.
Another mysterious manoeuvre by White.  It was difficult to find a constructive plan for either side around here.
Black defends h6, preparing to move the Rf6
Black's King move was just in time!  The rook has to move now.  I didn't want to swap off, giving White a protected passed pawn on d6, so ...
A gesture against the a-pawn but I didn't expect to be able to take it and get away with it because of Rb1, Rdd1 and Rb3
Better to recentralise and harass the advanced rook.
The last recorded move on my scoresheet.  I didn't bother getting Dave's more up to date sheet.  Suffice to say that Dave retained control of the d-file, preventing my K from penetrating the queenside, mopped up one of the loose kingside pawns and prepared to march his own kingside pawns to promotion.
If g5, Qxh6.
Yes. My target is there. How can I get to it? Not easy! I would have gone for Qb4 at once!
He plans to liberate his position by playing e5. I can't allow it.
Clever, now I can't castle. I can't move my c pawn, or Qb4+.
Now I am a pawn up, with more space.
...with the idea to play Rg3-Rg7... after the move, realizing the fork...
Instead of answering with a central pawn like e5 or d5, black plays c5 attacking the d square, preventing white to play d4 immediately. Off course playing 2.d4 is still possible but if I were white I would follow it up with a pawn sacrifice by playing c3. This ends up in: 1.e4-c5 2.d4-cxd4 3.c3. Black can now accept the sacrifice, but I never do, because white creates a lot more space on his queens side. It's not a disadvantage, but I prefer a more enclosed type of game and I'd rather not give away too much space from the start.<n>As for 3.Qxd4, it's just a bad move. You do not want to expose your queen too early in the game and certainly not when the other player can develop while attacking it.
You can off course decline taking the pawn and follow up with 3....-Nf6. But you'll end up capturing it in the next move anyway, so just capture it at this moment.
Najdorf variation. My personal favourite.<n>The idea behind a6 is that black wants to play e5 eventually, to chase the white knight off the d4 square and gain position in the centre. However playing it right of the bat, without a6 is not a good idea. White can play:<n>5....-e5 6.Bb5-Nbd7 7. Nf5-a6 8.Bxd7-Qxd7. With 6....-Bb7 the outcome is the same. White has a much stronger position at this point. A lot of space first of all and pieces that develop easily. In fact white only needs to castle and develop Bc1. Whereas black still needs to make space to develop his bishops. Still it's being played and I believe it's even a variation, but I don't know the name. I wouldn't recommend it though.<n>By playing 5...-a6 black prevents in fact any piece from taking position at b5. Which is positive because Sicilian often ends up in a race between white and black. White attacking the kings side. Black attacking the queens side. 5...-a6 prepares that attack for black
Number of choices for white here:<n>6.Be3 is usually followed by e5. This is the main line and the easiest for white since he only needs to get the queen out of the way to d2 to castle on the queens side. Off course he will first need to move the knight from d4 to a more passive square. The attack for white continues then by playing f3 followed by g4. I believe that when you don't play the Dragon Sicilian, you shouldn't be to afraid of the pawn storm by white on the kings side.<n>6. Bg5 or Bc4 is followed by e6. The only reason I can think of, is that both moves gain a certain control over d5. Bc4 directly, and Bg5 by pinning the knight.<n>You don't want that square to be weak in the first opening moves. So you play e6
White feels b5 coming and moves his bishop out of the way. A common played move at this point. The bischop also remains it's aim at the kings side for a later attack.<n>Trying to prevent b5 by playing a4 is not a good option, I'd say.<n>It would result in: 7.a4-Nxe4 8.Nxe4-d5 9.bxd5-Qxd5. White has now 2 knights in the centre, but no pawns and those knights can be easily chased by playing f5 somewhere down the line.<n>Black also has an incredible amount of space to move around.
b5 is also possible at this point.<n>But white is going to play f4 and Qf3. So you want to have played b5 and your knight to c5 by then. <n>White's idea is to push the pawn on the f-line further up the board. You want to be ahead of him with your pawn on the b-line. Playing Nc5 also keeps pressure on whites pawn on e4.
Standard play. I wouldn't play f3 to be followed up by g4, because you're going to be late.<n>Black will push more pieces out like Nc5 and also move up the pawn on the b-line.
By playing Na4, I'm obligated to capture the bishop on b3. However I was going to anyway, since I would like to play e5 further down the line and I'd rather be rid of this bishop aimed at my kings side and the unprotected d5 square.
Again moving my pawn in a better position while attacking one of his pieces. He looses a tempo while I gain one by developing a piece. Remember I'm far behind due to the pawn play in the beginning of the opening.<n>Whites pawn on e4 also becomes weak and as for my weaker pawn on d6: it is not under any attack at the moment and can be easily defended.<n>The f5 move has opened up an extra line for an attack on my kings side. So I decided to postpone going for the castle.
Developing a piece and attacking the e4 square at the same time.<n>Sometimes chess does not have to be difficult. Develop your pieces into a strong position and make your opponent loose tempos by keeping the pressure on his weaker points.<n>If you don't see the attack immediately, position your pieces on easy defensible squares, and wait for your opponent to create the opening. Off course this is situation dependent. If you wait too long your opponent has an advantage in the end game
Prevents c5 and more importantly prevents cxb4.<n>If played it will be followed up by Bxb4+ gaining another tempo
White starts to think about defending rather than attacking. Usually a good sign.<n>Although I think white could have played this stronger.<n><n>Nevertheless. Black has a lot of advantages. Open c en d lines for the rooks. A bishop on the dark squares that can easily move around and attack the kings side. A pawn on the e line that isn't blocked by an opposing pawn.<n>White doesn't immediately have an attack.
Moving my knight to a centre square and adding more pressure to the attack on c3, plus defending the pawn on b4
Bxc3 would have been better. White does loose the bishop in exchange for a knight, but with the pawn on c3, whites bishop no longer has a line to the right side of the board (from blacks perspective)<n>Opens up the b-line as well for my rooks further down the line.
Bad move. I was afraid of castling and loosing the pawn on e5, but if I would have given this a little more thougt I would have spotted:<n>23. Kf2-0-0 24. Nd7-Rfe8. 25. Nxe5-Bh4+ 26. g3- Rxe5
Black finds himself in a position where he has blocked himself somewhat with his king and pieces around it. And with white moving up his pawns on the board, he will soon be in a position to attack again.
The idea is to start up an attack by use of the open b-line.<n>White can play a rook to b1 for the exchange, but black will come out stronger:<n>26. Rhb1-Rxb1 27.Rxb1-Bd3 28.Re1- Rb8 29.Bc1<n>White can now only think about defending and black has an entire open a-line for the pawn to advance.
According to me white is stalling here. Trying to get all his pieces out of the way of the Rook on b2.
So white moves it out of the way. Where he should have put pressure on Nd5 by playing Ra5.<n>White never prevented me from doubling my rooks on the b-line. <n>And by moving the bishop to e1, I don't even need Rab8.
Putting pressure on Ne4, which has to move since it can no longer be defended. This allows me to play e4+
I should have played g6 here, but I was hoping he didn't see the mate that was coming and I got lucky. <n>When playing g6 you are actually preparing a mate by playing, Ne3 followed by Ng2.<n>And there isn't much white can do about that. Except giving away more material.<n>Possibilities are to play 32. Nb7-Be5 33.Nd8-Rxd8 34. Nxd8-Kg7 35. Bg3 (or else mate in 2 by playing g5 followed by forced Kh5 and Nf4)- g5 36. Kh5-Bxg3<n>It's not a done deal yet, but black controls the e1 square to promote his pawn. <n>Also whites rooks aren't contributing much to the game. And black can easily clean up the pawn on c3 which gives him even more advantage.<n>Obviously white also still needs to be careful of not being mated by Nf4.
Dr. Treybal, as black, occupies the center with pawns, in a classical style. Meanwhile, Reti tries to undermine it from the wings, a typical hyper-modern strategy.
Also feasible is 8 ... Qxd5 to avoid the isolated pawn. If then, 9 d3 O-O 10 Be3 Qh5 is roughly equal.
18 ... Bd4, the only way to save one of the bishops.
On 24 Qd5 Kh8 the bishop on e5 is immune owing to the mate threat on the back rank by Qb1.
The bishop is again untouchable, owing to Qf1#.
Trying to force Queen back, if blacks DSB goes to g7 then this will mean whites DSB isn't pinned by potential loss of rook and b2 pawn.
offers exchange... not something I really want to do as would release tension. I can't stay there as would lose pawn in the combination and centralize his Queen.
Still attack the bishop with a revealed attack. I want to rid blacks DSB's reduce the outposts for his knight and hopefully overwork his superior piece with my minor pieces..
Decided to head here over Nxe4 as I can win pawn later and here my knights can support each other after N(b)c3, also b knight won't be pinned supporting pawn and and pawn will defend developed knight. <n><n>Most importantly it restricts black and maintains tension.
Looking to win pawn and double rooks on e file.
Head here as puts bishop on same diagonal as King and may allow chances to pin/discover attacks. Plus theres nothing doing on the h3-c8 line
Where is blacks knight heading? I'm trying to take away his outposts, my rooks are there to be forked but he can't there (I think but if I can stop him getting forward it will mean the knight can't spearhead an attack!)
unfortunatly my subtle creative attack doesn't yield a free piece!!
If I can get my Knight out of the way, Rook to a8 wins the game for white...<n><n>Of course black has to oversee it and not defend against it (so chances are slim)
Blocks the diaganal bishop wants to work on, plus it forces knight away.
I'm looking to open that diagonal
Bring Knight into the action knowing that it leaves my King and the base of my pawn chain weak. I was very unsure about what would happen here, had a nasty feeling that the Queen would go on a rampage and eat all my pawns and the game would slip away, but I had to attack...
I wanted to exchange and get rid of Blacks rook although I thought that my knight and rook wouldn't be able to compete with Blacks Queen and would end up been outgunned.
I'm thinking my best bet here is to rid the g pawn then cocentrate on promoting a pawn and restricting black that way.
That's it I didn't think that anything else would give me a chance, esp as I've lost the last few in the tourney didn't want to take the chance and I have respect for Bob's play and was happy to draw (even though he does have poor taste in football teams!!) <n><n>Thanks for the game Bob.
Sometimes in chess material advantages do not mean a whole lot and the Tarrasch Defense proves this point. In exchange for the isolated d-pawn black gains space free development and attacking chances. This game features perfectly the key characteristics of well coordinated pieces in tandem with superior mobility that are trademark Tarrasch.
In this line of the Tarrasch white seeks to retain his pawn advantage. However, just like in the Queen's Gambit accepted it is wiser to give it back the extra pawn for rapid development.  I consider this an inferior move that in the end creates serious holes on the queen side especially on c3. <n><n>As it turns out I have played this move myself to a winning advantage. here is the link<n><n>http://gameknot.com/annotate.pl?id=29189
the proof of the shakiness of 6. b4 is that white thinks it is necessary to support it. Although at this point it is not in any danger so the move is a bit of a waste of tempo. I kinda like the idea of Bb2 myself
This is a bit of a risky move, however I felt that with my king tucked away it was time to deal with the chief reason why my queen side pieces were not developed(b4!). With ...a5 I bust open for use the h file and create some time and space to take advantage of the fact that whites king is still in the centre.
I am not sure this is the best diagonal for this bishop. I prefer 9.Bb2 where it can keep an eye on the a1-a8 diagonal
with the queen deflected to a1 the black d5 pawn is can breath a bit easy now. This is a good thing because it gives me time to play Nc6 now.
black is down by a pawn but has the initiative for it. Black has two threats one is to advance the d pawn and the second is to capture b4.
12. Qb2 would have prevented this nasty thrust. Black's IDP is a double edge sword it is both his weakest point but if not respected(like in this game) it becomes his most powerful weapon.
the only way to take the Knight on b4. However I have a nice tactical plan in the event of Qxb4
In exchange for the knight black has gained excellent mobility, a supported past pawn, back rank threats and dominance on the queen side.
This prevents white from castling and makes it very difficult for white to bring his rook into the action. As a result even though black is technically a minor piece behind he is practically two pawns to the good because of the lack of communication between white camp.
hinders mobility of the white bishop, places the pawn on a safer square and opens the a6-f1 diagonal for the light bishop.
??<n>Often times in chess mistakes are not outright(i.e dropping a piece) rather are the result of small positional blunders. Here the Bishop does prevent the checkmate on f2 but it also takes away a escape route from the king. Therefore it can not be the best move. I was expecting...<n><n>22. Bxa6!(the only way I see to ensure the draw) Qxf2+ 23. Kg4 Qxg2+(black has regained some material but does not have enough for the win) 24. Bg3! (the bishop returns home to assist in the defense and the game is drawn)
?? Valeriuzaharia needs to rein in his horse because he is getting ahead of himself. <n><n>To me the most logical defense was...<n>25. Bh4(taking away the checkmate square and giving back an escape square) Be6 26. Qd2 Qa4 -/+ black has a winning edge.
!! the power of this move is in the fact that after white moves his queen the knight on e5 is just about dog food.
!! seizing control of the important e5 square and creating a mating net around the white king
Go further mighty pawn and clear the f file and strike fear in the heart of the enemy king!
This is best. There's no good way for Black to maintain his pawn on e5, and taking with the Knight (3...Nxd4 4.Nxd4 exd4 5.Qxd4) leaves White's Queen on a very strong central square without an easy way to drive her away.
4...Bc5 or 4...Nf6 are far and away more popular, and safer. This is too early to bring out the BQ, and furthermore she's blocking the King Knight's best square.
A good developing move, defending both the Knight and the f2 pawn.
Black piles up on the Knight.
White still has adequate defenses, though he's forced to take the c3 square away from his QN.
? Black has nothing to gain from this exchange. At best, he'll give White a formidable center and a developmental edge (7.Bxd4 Bxd4 8.Qxd4 Qxd4 9.cxd4). Better choices would have been 6...d6 or 6...Ne7, to simply continue development.
?? Hugely, Black overlooks the threat to his Queen.
Black could resign, with a mere Bishop for his Queen, but chooses to fight on--it's still early in the game, and there's plenty of time for White to make mistakes.
Finally, Black starts to pay attention to his other pieces.
This is probably the best response Black has to offer. 16...Nd5 would defend b7 momentarily, but loses to a tactical shot because weak Black castle is so vulnerable. (e.g. 16...Nd5? 17.Nxf7+ Bxf7 18.Qxf7 c6 19.c4 and now the Black Knight falls, since moving would allow 20.Re7 and mate soon to follow.
! White stays the course, continuing to hammer at Black's weak King by pointing more pieces at f7.
? It's not clear what Black is planning, but it sure isn't "keeping his King safe". This lets White force the exchange on e6 and further grow his advantage.
Black gets his King out of the way, letting the Rook defend the g-pawn. Bear in mind that it only needs defending because of all the weakening moves Black made in the first place!
Black defends his Knight, and begins to put some indirect pressure on f2.
Black prepares to double.
This may not be ideal, but I like it--White gives his King an escape square and threatens to open the h-file for use against the Black King.
Ooh, not good. This loses a pawn to 24.Qxh3+ Kg8 25.Qxe6+. Not to mention, it opens the h-file.
? There was no need for this. Now the WK is on the open file. White ought to have simply picked up another free pawn while maintaining his checks: 27.Qxg6+ Rg7 28.Qe6+
Unpinning the Rf7...
?? White wants to release his Rook from guard duty, but it would have been easier to simply give up the pawn. This allows the Bishop to cut off the King's only escape route...
? Loses a pawn to 33.Re7+. Black should be trying to get his King into the game with ...Kf6-f5.
Black is apparently unconcerned about his queenside pawns. To be fair, White doesn't seem to care about them either.
Better was 39.f4 (Black can't capture it since his g-pawn is pinned).
?? For some reason, Black is intent on putting his King in the most dangerous corner he can find. It looks like he wants to play ...Bg3 to threaten White's Rook... but why? That doesn't actually accomplish anything. Black should be focused on getting his King to an active square, not back here where it can't escape from anything. 40...Kg6 was far better.
Threatening mate thanks to the BK's ugly location.
?? Black overlooks the mate threat. 41...g4 was called for.
Well-spotted by White. This was a game, I think, about dealing with mistakes. Black gave up his Queen early and seemed to panic as a result, making a lot of useless moves and unable to come up with a plan. White gave his Queen up to a nice tactic later, but didn't get nearly so flustered, and continued to simply look for a victory with his other pieces. It's a good lesson to learn.
As it was, I simply played what was natural to me, as if Black had played d6 instead of e6. I expect the usual pawn trade...
!? But am surprised once again! Obviously my opponent likes to deviate from the norm, but that's not to say that this move is ruinous... it does, however, allow White to take advantage of the fact that d4 pawn hasn't been snapped off yet...
..with this move! White advances his pawns to force the Black knight to move once again
Perhaps Black might have been better with the pawn exchange at this point, but the knight would have had to move anyway. This move does not lose the game, but the black knight on e7 assist's in Black's loss later on
Checking after the game, I find that this game leaves the database with this move, the three other alternatives being d6, c4 and dxe6. Perhaps d6 might have been best here to put the cramp in Black's position, but that would have been a completely different game from this one.
Ignoring the tension in the centre, Black prepares a kingside fianchetto, with good reason too - the black bishop will have a good scope on the a1-h8 diagonal
? but Black chose the wrong pawn to defend it with! 6...d6 would have saved Black a lot of heartache for sure! With this move, I saw that b5 would be a pretty place for my knight. I also note, however, that it's not an outpost as Black can kick away the knight with a6. However, when looking through this line, I realise...
Smothered mate, and notice that it is Black's one developed piece that helps contribute to this! I'm pretty sure that most of you reading this have seen this kind of thing before, but it was the first time I was able to pull it off! The beauty of it is that there was no way to stop a knight jump to d6 [other than to sac the knight], so even if Black had seen this move, the best he could do was 7...Bg7, and even then 8.Nd6! is a powerful move. [and White would have ideas to further ramp up the pressure with a move like Ng5] There is also another beauty in this last position - all the material is still on the board! :) good game!
Most of the time I replied c5, It's very rare I used e5. But e5 is the most logical and solid  reply from black
My opponent continued his development according to widely accepted opening theory. Nf6 control the e5 and influenced the d4 square, and as well the normal development of of one of his minor pieces for the purpose of  king castle.
I played my favorite Najdorf variation, the fave of Fischer and Kasparov. This move gives black queen bishop free development and to restrict white pawn advance in e5 square.
I can play Nc6 which is the usual reply from black. But  I want to try other possible variations.
Maybe his first objective is to remove my queen bishop, since no one will pin his knight in f3 and as well his light square are much more defined and objective than my position.
centralizing his queen and also restrict the advance of my g pawn, most of the players agree 6. Nxd4 is the logical move
I'm worry to play 7..e6 here because white is still postponing his castling in kingside. I think he want a long castling, The purpose of this castling, his queen rook supporting his queen attacking my d6 pawn and as well preparing for kingside attack. atleast my pawn at this moment it is supported by e7 pawn, so I decided to fianchetto my bishop and then king castle.
White start to break the center, which in my opinion was to premature. I think the most accurate plan for white is start to advance his h pawn and preparing to exchange his bishop against my bishop in g7 or vice versa, and then shift his forces in kingside
just intended to pin the pawn and the white queen, but with loss of my two minor pieces in exchange of a rook. If 10.. Ne8, white continue 11. Bf4 then 12. Rhe1. Either my move white still has slight edge 10.. Nh5 I admit is too risky to exchange my two minor pieces against rook!!
Not 12.. dxe5? resulted to one piece down.
So white decided to simplify and move to endgame, on the other hand this is my favorite part of the game.
So now at the first glance its much easy to handle the white position, his first objective is to exchange my other rook and then shift his two minor pieces to harass my two pawns in queenside which give him a two passed pawn. generally two minor pieces has an advantage against a rook.
It restrict bishop's activity.
Now he starting to advance his pawn. It's a very difficult task for me even to equalize here,  but I have two powerful rook atleast to compensate, he has an advantage his king is much near than my king.
I'm starting to move my king to participate in battle, before white overwhelm the queenside.
with the intention to create a pass pawn and threatening my a7 pawn
Its take a time for me before making this move. My plan is to remove all of pawns in queenside leaving only white c pawn and then shift the game in kingside  because I have a couple of pawns. My queen rook watching the queenside and my other rook supporting my plan in kingside  by pushing all of my pawns with the help of my king.
I want to stay my rook in d file, I don't want to give his king a chance to move via d2
white he want to remove my rook's command in d file so he like to exchange.
I accept to exchange the rook
He totally committed his king to support his two minor piece in queenside but neglecting the kingside. It's not too late,  his move should move 25. Ke3.
Aside from advancing my pawn it restrict the f and h pawn, these two pawns soon will be the target of my rook.
Aside for the intention of 28. c4 it support his f2 pawn and move his knight in kingside.
I can play Rh8 but I' still wait his king to advance near my rook and also looking for the advance of my a pawn to exchange atleast with his b pawn.
just only for tempo, to distract his bishop in diagonal g1-a7.
To create a passed pawn in g file and the harassing his knight to stay away from my g pawn. I let white to capture my pawn in a6
to stop my pawn advance in g2
The best move that I made. If we both promote our pawns to queen,  at least my king has a shield  against the queen's check.
White should avoid the e5 and d6 square because it will skewer his queen after I checked his king.
I'm preparing my king move to f3 then push my e pawn, my queen cover the f file for white queen's check. And after f3 I can cover my king by pushing my pawn to e3. My queens check intention is to stay away the white king.
White decided to exchange our queens.
giving a chance to advance his pawn in 7th rank
The strategy for the series of these checks, here is to pressure white to put his king in c8 then giving a chance for me to advance my king.
White resigns. If 57. Ka8 then 57.. Kb7mate. If 57. Kc8 then 57...Qg8 mate..It's a very big win for me, a very difficult endgame, and I acknowledge white for this game, one of my best.
Ugly as it is, 12.a3 (stopping b4) was probably best.
Englund Gambit.  I have not played against this before.  According to Wikipedia, the idea is for Black to move into a tactical game and away from the closed d4 openings.  I thought the game definitely had more of an e4 character, so I think it succeeded at that.
Black is down a pawn, but has an extra tempo to compensate.
Black puts the extra tempo to good use here.
I'm not sure if this is the best square for the B.  g5 may be a better option.
Black sacrifices the B to open White's K.  White needs to get reinforcements to the Kingside as quickly as possible.
I think this was an oversight.  Black was thinking about his attack and didn't notice his N was hanging.
This forces the exchange of Qs.  If White can defuse the Kingside attack, the position should be won easily.
I was looking at saccing my bishop.
Let's take stock of this position: Material: equal, but white has the bishop pair on an open board. White has a slight edge in material. Piece activity: I think white is better. Presence of threats: Black is much better, with a massive attack on f2. Pawn structure: Black has doubled pawns and two pawn islands, white has no doubled pawns and one pawn island. White is better. Overall, I think that if white can survive the coming attack then he'll end up on top.
! Good, this cuts down an attacker on f2, and he has the choice to take with his knight or his pawn.
Unleashing my queen and rook battery on f2.
? Not good, he is under attack, he should try to bring his queen over to help defend.
A good spot for my knight even if it blocks my queen and rook. Although white is not actually being attacked heavily enough for him to worry, he should take some defensive measures.
Suddenly, there are multiple threats on the board. White's queen is doing a fine job of defending though.
?? Allows my queen to go to h5 with disastrous results.
! I am proud of this move, it forces his king into the corner where he is helpless.
I am now up by three pawns and have a powerful attack. But if white defends accurately he might be able to pull through. Of course, I would be up by three pawns and would probably win the endgame.
Pins his bishop and puts him in another perilous position. This is my second attack, and if it doesn't manage to break through then I'll have to content myself to just exchanging and trying to win the endgame.
!! I finally find it. To prevent a lethal discovered attack white must swap queen for rook. White resigns. Ordinarily I don't care if my opponent resigns, but I kind of with I could have played this out to mate as it seems really interesting. Oh well it's his choice.
To avoid the annoying Qh5. But I miss a tempo to prevent f6, so here it comes...
Freeing the black diagonal to the queen. My way to play this opening (this time) was awful. I have to go back to natural moves at some point before (probably g4 should be delayed).
My queen is free now to move, and exchanging only gives my rook a good square against Nxf7. I bet I could survive to the black squares' attack. But in fact, to exchange bishops would heve been infinitely better.
!? To untangle his pieces, white sacrifices a pawn. Qc6 is pointless now, so better try to relocate the queen.
? Ba5 and I would have to take away my queen, chased by the rooks... a disaster. But with this blunder, black gives me chances.
The queen's exchange would give me a bad pawn's structure, but I preferred it to Qc7 for some strange (and probably wrong) reason.
I decided to exchange, but I was wrong again. Rc1, and if Rb2, Rc2. A nice tangled position, probably full of traps I can't see...
Thank you, black, your bishop's pair was much stronger than mine...even if I am left the useless (by now) dsb.
What else? But now, Ng6, BxB, NxR, Bxa7, Ra8, Bc5 seems to hold, even if it leaves the black knight the possibility to escape via g6. But black should have gone for it. Instead, he played...
This was another mistake, as it gives him facilities to attack my doubled pawns.
Having to lose a pawn, I'll lose it at my condition...
Black cannot win the knight with d4, because of KxN. Black timeoutted here, a pity. The simple b5 wins, because white is so tangled he cannot avoid to lose the knight and the game, deservedly. :-(
This does two things. #1. It keeps me equal and #2, even better, the King has to take it.
Free path to the Knight on e4 and prepares for a winning line.
Pins the Knight to the Queen.
I try castling Kingside, a rather wise decision.
Black is trying to torment my Knight, but even worse, prying open my Kingside.
Without going for the pawn, I safely take the Bishop with the h-pawn. Here, I thought that the Bishop would take my Knight via 9...Bxf3.
This isn't the best idea, but it isn't the worst.
There's a problem now. That Black d-pawn is indirectly pinned to checkmate.
I take with the King. I didn't want to lose my Queen's momentum on the third rank.
If I have to get off of the third rank to protect a pawn, I would.
If my Queen is so tempting, why not put it on e3?
This isn't the mate in 1, but it counts as a mate in two. I just wanted to take one more piece.
Sometimes, you have to admit that a move/tactic is bad, even if you don't feel like admitting it. Whatever you do, don't try the tactic on move 4, even if you are playing it as White, because it becomes a nasty position to terminate unless you're opponent makes a mistake. Do not count on trying to get everything, it only makes a position harder to deal with and once again, look out for any possible move that you're opponent can make because some of those moves can be used as tactics.
Trying to trap my bishop
Preparing to develop his DSB
Before I take his bishop I want to bring my rook into the game.
A friend and team member suggested giving the Marshall a try as Black against this..... Thanks Jim)
Not sure about this as it helps Black to build up the attack.... perhaps Nd2 was better.
I take his Queen and he resigns..... (if 20. Kxf1 then Black wins with Bh3+, 21. Kg1 Re1 ++)<n><n>Thanks for looking...... enough encouragement for me to give the Marshall another try.
! This caught me by surprise and provoked a poor response.  Normal moves at this stage include 6...Qc7, 6...Ne7, 6...Qa5, to which I usually respond 7. Qg4.
? A move borrowed from the Advance Variation that is inappropriate here, with the Queenside already so seriously compromised.  The White King will have nowhere safe to go.  I was losing faith in the planned Qg4 by now, and thinking more about bolstering the centre, with 9. Nf3 to follow.
! Black spots the opportunity to occupy f5 and attack the misplaced, and now undefended, Be3.  He may also have hoped to provoke g4, which I baulked at as being one pawn advance too far.  I think it would have been preferable to the mess that followed, though.
! This increases pressure on d4 and attacks the undefended B.  I didn't want to defend the B with my Q because that would have left the Ra1 undefended ...
This retreat enables the B to cover all the squares attacked by the N and maintains defence of d4 but has a serious negative consequence ...
!  This premature-looking foray exposes the dire weakness of White's Queenside.  The Q can't defend c3 because the Ra1 would be left undefended.  The Bf2 can no longer come to the rescue and a K move would give up hope of castling.  A rook move would not prevent the loss of c3 and would also leave a3 undefended.
?! I felt that this was my best hope of attaining some sort of equality, as at least the pawn wouldn't be a further worry after the fall of the c3 pawn.  In fact, it just invited the other N to the party.  Given the lack of attractive alternatives, I can't quite dismiss this as a total blunder, though.  Perhaps 11. Bd3 would have been best, preparing castling, but, after 11...Qxc3+ Nd2 12. Ne3 would have been embarrassing.
I was determined to get some counter-play somehow.  With castling out of the question, I had to activate my rooks and defend my pawns if possible.
!  Black doesn't worry about his development yet as he can still exploit White's cramped position with the threat of ...Nc3, forking Q and B and thereby probably winning the B and mating.
Fortunately, I can chase Black's Q away in the nick of time.
I had not overlooked this move but had decided it was preferable to the aforementioned scenario.  Now I had to decide which pawn to defend and how best to free up my cramped position.
Now, if ...Qxg2, I can counter-attack with Qd4, having lured Black's Q off the black squares.
Sensibly, Black retreats to a commanding square and renews the threat of ...Nc3.
My longer range pieces are now acquiring greater scope for activity, though not enough to reach equality yet.
Black prevents White's threatened attack on the Q.
This connects the rooks on the 3rd rank but also allows the N to come forward without giving up the a-pawn or interfering with the KR's ambition of a full frontal assault on the newly castled king.
Perhaps a premature advance of the pawn but it does prevent Ne3 and establish a further claim to c3.
Providing a good square for his B, on the long diagonal where my R is exposed.
Again improving the position of one of my pieces while attacking Black's R and preventing the B from immediately occupying the long diagonal.  My rooks are also reconnected.
! Threatening to win the newly advanced h-pawn.  For the first time, my young opponent displayed some uncertainty.
Black counter-attacks.  If White captures en passant, it looks like Black opens more lines towards White's K and Black can defend the h-pawn by recapturing on f6.
I didn't want to give up my B's central postion and felt that the open lines could also benefit me.
Now I want to eliminate the key defender while the other R is blocked off.
! but this dampened my optimism.  I can't take the pawn as my rook is attacked and now Black has powerful connected central pawns and can develop his B to any number of good squares.
The pawn couldn't be defended effectively, with the B on g6 also attacked by the Q, and I felt that the capture on f5 was less dangerous than on f4.
Black continues to harrass White's Q and interfere with his plans.
and now the N has a lovely outpost close to White's K, tying White to the defence of g2.
?! Having shown some signs of uncertainty over his last few moves, Black picked up his Q to move it here, then returned it to g6 and let go again.  Soon after, he moved it here anyway.
? Wrong square, as now K and undefended R are both on White squares.  I can threaten mate with a N move but that threat is easily warded off.  What else can I manufacture from the threat?
At last I'm ahead on material with mate in one threatened.  All I have to do is round up Black's central pawns and the win should be easy.
and Black resigned.  I had 21 minutes left on my clock; he had 34, reflecting the fact that I'd been under the cosh for most of the game.
Well, me too I like to open with this knight. Fischer said d6 was the best continuation, giving the oportunity to pin quickly the knight with Bg4.
Thinking about to follow with g5, protecting the f pawn and threatening the king. I still prefer to do directly g5. When playing the king gambit, the tempo is so much important.
Thinking to move out my bishop, but by doing so he is losing tempo.
Well I was thinking about a way to move away my knight or my bishop to attack f7. If black exchange it will give me this oportunity + it will give me space on the e line.
I like going to b3 with my knight it give most of the times some nice places to go.
? Well played too quickly here and forgot about the bishop. Rc1 would have been better I think.
Now Black got a passed pawn on the center and some of my pawns are pretty weak now.
? Well the knight just need to take it.
Threatening my queen and my rook, no choice to take it.
!! This side of the field is completly unprotected and the b line is freed. I don't think there's a way for black to escape the mate at this point.<n><n>If bxa6, then Qxa6+ followed by Rb1#
If Kb8, then Qa6 then Qa8#.
Black's advantage to trade.
Another open game.  I'd like to just play out my opening along the lines of the database and put my proper thinking cap on when things start to play out differently.
That's bold! My little game with his e pawn needs to be put on hold, and I'm starting to regret it.
If he plays Bxh6 then I'm in danger of checkmate with my king exposed and his queen and knight attacking.
If his bishop comes in to strip away my defensive pawns, then this allows my rook to defend the f6 square. It also threatens his very dangerous knight.
I may have a problem... If he takes my bishop with Nxc5 then his queen will start gobbling up my pawns.
Time to resign
I liked this move, trying to get control of the h2-b8 diagonal, and also supporting the e5 advance, although I was expecting a move like 6.c4 to follow.
Another supporter for the e5 advance, and with the option to maybe play b3 later on the game.
Another one, Its time to advance the pawn.
This bishop move looks kinda awkward, I think he was doing a good job on d3, I knew he wanted to form a battery along the b1-h7 diagonal as soon as he played this move.
And here is the battery, but its useless unless he find the way to get rid of my knight at f6. But a move like 12.Ng5 could be hard to deal with. when the only defense against it would be g6 if I don't wanna lose a pawn.  Maybe best here was 11.Re1 followed by his own advance of the e pawn. I was thinking now to play h6...
but i instead decided to advance my pawn, preventing any kind of threats along the b1-h7 diagonal, and freeing the scope for my bishop at c2
And here comes the sacrifice, only because i was able to get rid of the white knight at f3 I was encouraged to go ahead and do it.
If the king goes back to the back rank Qh4 would be the end of the game. Or if instead 14.Kh4 I would have then played 14...Nd-f3 and now I have a discovered check with my bishop at c1.
of course the knight cannot be taken, it would lead to mate. just an example. (15.Kxg4 Nf8+  16.Kh5 g6+  17.Kg5 h6+ 18.Kxh6 Qh2+ 19.Kg5 Nh7#) its mate in every variation, so this following move is the reason I thought a lot about Qc7
again what else? all white pieces are on the back pretty far away from the king, unable to defend, unable to attack.
Ok. Now I want to occupy the half open file with my rook.
Now if he takes the pawn Rg8+ will follow. For example 24.Kxg3 Rg8+ 25.Kf2 (if he doesn't want to get matted) Qh4+ 26.Kxe3 (the only move) and now the simple 26...Qg3+ with mate to follow. So in order to prolong the agony he would have been forced to play Qg4. (I created a mate in 6 puzzle of it, you can check it out if you want)
And now this move was the final blunder allowing me to penetrate in white position even further
Black resigns at this point everything went downhill for him after my 11th move.  By the way this was not the best move... the best move here was 32...Rg1+  33.Ke2 (and only then) Ng3#.  Anyways, not the best chess but thats how my brain works. I hope you can get something out of this game.
The Ruy Lopez Opening. White threatens the defender of e5 in an attempt to gain an advantage in development and tempo.
Although this blocks the DSB, it ensures that a knight will remain on c6 if I capture. The DSB can always be fianchettoed later.
Breaking my pin of the knight onto the king.
I contest the centre and try to open up the position a little.
An attempt to attack the knight, but is dxe5 better?
Developing the DSB and preparing to castle.
Forcing an exchange.
I don't want to do Bxg5 or Nxg5 because it opens up the h-file.
Preparing to do b4. Probably not such a good move.
Attempting to open up the position.
As Pete said, Qb5 is better because I get more possible squares to move to.
The pressure is mounting on my kingside...
Already taking the game out of the normal lines. Since my opponent has a higher rating, I assume he wanted to throw me on my own resources.
Up until now, both of us have simply developed on natural lines. The game gets its first conflict here, as my opponent has to choose whether or not to capture the Bishop.
The exchange leaves me with a central Pawn mass and an open file for my KR.
Both my Knights are now on fine outposts.
If White were to be foolish enough to play BxN(Q4), I could play ...BxB and incidentally pin his undefended QN to his QR. But unless he makes that blunder, this B will remain inactive for a while.
With my B threatened, I now have to exchange off my Knight if I want to retain the end-game advantage of a B vs a N.
The positional maneuvering begins.
The unassailable base of my Pawn chain is now QN2. White has no way to access this square.
Now I'm up a Pawn. With my Bishop stuck in the corner for the moment, that probably isn't a winning advantage in and of itself, but it means I can pressure White by threatening exchanges.
Now I'm up by two connected passed Pawns, and if the major pieces go the endgame win will be a snap. White must seek complications.
Now that White has lost his aggressive position, I need to trade off the Queens and mop up in the ensuing endgame.
Forcing White's hand. The Queens must exit the board.
The Pawns are in position now to coast home to the 8th rank.
White bows to the inevitable. After 61... P-B6 and 62... P-B7 a Pawn promotes. So White resigns.
Asking questions (ah, the club jergon!) to b2.
One of the less recommendable answers, because it makes me easy to develop and reach equality. No real threa on the black diagonal (not while the c pawn is mobile), but I have space to manouver. Now, if I lose time by freeing my lsb, maybe - just maybe - I miss the chance to cause him some problems.
Of course, if Be3, d5 and this B has to move again to become useful.
? I'm still dreaming of an attack on the black diag, so I make this lsb going out of the d2 coverage. But it was just a bad idea, since white can easily answer c4 - I'm giving him the occasion by allowing my N to be threatened. True is that in order to play it he has to play a3 first, and I can try the Qa5 attack where if b4, Nxb4, etc, since a3 is pinned to the R.
...so this is my "plan": to attack on the kingside (the original purpose of black's asset), but with the disadvantage of having the Q almost useless on b6, and my own Qside far from being able to develop. On the other side, white has more or less the same problem: he has to castle just under my advancing pawns, and his minor pieces can be harassed - soon or later. If I play d6, Bd7, o-o-o... he will do whatever he wants (like c4. Fortunately for me, he assumes that Nb4 is still very powerful, but he can easily move his lsb from d3, or play a3 and make c4 a threat.)
Now, it was my chance. Unfortunately, g4-Nh4 kind of blocks my attack, and h4 was not possible due to Nxg5 (h4 but the lsb can move. I can get rid of it, yes, but not much more (I could see!). But now it's my chance to play the "wonderful"...
Noah's Ark in sight. If h3, f4, I'm not scared by Bg6+, Kd8.
This pins my own f pawn, but I dont' have to move it necessarily. I'm doing this because I want to keep my R on th h column, in sight of a possible sacrifice (Nxg5). Moreover: I can play on this lsb by harassing it with d6, and It will be lost for white. In return, I'll have to waken my e6 pawn, which is very dangerous in this asset. The advantage of doing that: white, as far as I can see, is in no position to cause a serious threat on e6 in few moves. My lsb will become active without even having moved from his home square. My R is trapped, as his. A R on the 7ºth will always help my K...
No risk, no win. I think I can hold e6. But I was wrong: now white has Bxf4, and if exB... Nxg5, hxN, Qxg4!?...
Here, white realizes that he has 1) b2 threatened, 2) if dxe5, it just opens a future line for my lsb and give action to my Q. 3) Rxe5 was just losing the exchange... so he thought it was smart to play...
I have to be careful. If Rxg2+, Kh1, Rxf7 (say), white has Bh5+, etc. If pieces are exchanged, my own caged pieces and exposed K may become a factor...
! If Kxc6, Bf3+ and the game is over! But thanks to my R on g7, my K is safe for the moment. OF course, a direct cxb7, Bxb7 is winning.
The best for the white Q. Now, with few seconds on the clock, I was so confused about how to take the best advantage of the position, that I made a fatal mistake.
...and now what? I feel I have missed the right combination. Here, Qxb2 seems decisive, since if KxN, Rg1#. BUT white has Qxe4+, and I can't play Bd6 or QxR... and if Kxc6, Be8+... AAAghh!!!
...and now I can't see how to continue the attack. True, I can take the Nb1, I can risk something like a5, but he can now give me check on f7, and he can take my Bf8... too risky! I can still lose this!
? My plan is to make him land on a black square, or something, so to save my B and prevent him to harass my K. Yes, I can win the Ra1 (Qc1+, Ke2, Qxb2+, K moves, QxR), but this leaves my B and my K in a very difficult position - or, at least, I assumed it was! So...
I can see no mate, and he has to take care of f2.
Curiousely, if I exchange Q, he will have the same chances as me. I have lost too much, I have to accept my fail, and get to recover the material while I can.
Seconds on the clock. I can't lose this by time. Bd6 was easy, but I needed simplification...
It was not a great game, from both sides. But I kept on and managed to save a difficult game (after a sound blunder!), and stressed him too much to the end.
Pawns away from the center. The show begins.
To Ng5, Bf5...
Planning the strong queenside castling, that in one moves build a strong central pressure.
Now, e3 is met by d3. Here, I am already thinking about Nh5, planning a sacrifice in g3. But I have no need to force the situation so early.
White cannot take the pawn because I win a tempo attacking his queen.
Again, Nh5 is ok. Or e3xf2 first, of course. Probably it was the best plan, but I couldn't resist the tempting...
Qxg3 is nice, since if f2xg3, NxBe3+ and I recover the queen. But still it is not enough to guarantee a win.
Not my favored response to the Sicilian, but definitely playable.  There are a number of good lines from this position which offer exciting play.
To give natural development for my bishop and allow for an eventual center push.
I was expecting g3, or bringing out one of the knights.  This pawn structure is one that certainly seeks to control the center, but I don't like giving potential homes to knights by creating a vacuum on both sides.  If I can get a knight to d4 (and keep him there), he will be powerful.
An unexpected incursion into black territory!  I was a little taken aback by this move as it was completely unexpected.  However, I felt that I only had one response.
Now there is double pressure against his e pawn.  I'm curious what white was thinking to accomplish with the early assault, however, to the point, now white has two choices for defense: Qe2 or d4.
This seems like a more natural play, since it brings another piece into the game and doesn't abandon the c4 pawn to itself.  Also since white is probably looking to fianchetto his bishop on g2, this protective move will offer more playable options for white.  I think the queen move was the better of the two choices.
And now white has to take, since it is 3 against 2.
This move also surprised me.  Perhaps white saw the chance to go Bc3, giving him strong attack lines to the king?  However, I believe that white's priority should have been castling before thinking that far ahead.  Better to protect your king while you can.  Since my king is already castled, I can start probing white's defenses for weakness and go on attacks of my own.  wmaes is a very good player, so perhaps he has something up his sleeve?
I believe that this move was a mistake for the sequence that is about to unfold.  I expected Bg2, in preparation for a castle, but now things are about to get ugly.
I thought white might move up his knight, but there is a certain logic to bringing in the bishop.  However, as soon as this move was made I saw a possible way to get white to lose his castle.  My hand was forced to take on c3.
Now for an attack of my own.  White has two real responses here, Bg2 or the path he chose, Ne4.  If Bg2, Qe5+ offers some rich possibilities for black.
Another check allowing my queen to get to safety and protect c5.
I was expecting Nc3, but perhaps white is looking down the road to an e/f pawn march and wants the knight handy to play defense.
supporting my c pawn and giving a place for my bishop to develop upon, namely b7.
Since my queen is on the same back rank, I can protect the bishop, and if white takes, he gives me a prime diagonal of power from which to attack.  I think f3 is a viable response and should be given serious consideration.
Any other rook move would lose material, but what about f3?  It would allow the king to go to f2, and give some breathing room for the coming storm from my hungry pieces.
in preparation for the assault on white's king, who is conveniently boxed in to his spot by a queen and a knight.
Decision time for white.  There is a lot of power projecting into his king's turf and there are a couple of possible responses.  My expectation was dxe4 or f4.  I also wondered if white might try Nxe4.  dxe4 would be followed by fxe4+, and f4 would be followed by e3!, likely winning the knight, and opening a hole for a rook to wade in, supported by a knight.  When your king is being pressured, it is best to avoid open lines of attack.
Nf3?! is totally winning for Black, because after cxd4 Nxd4, Black has an extra pawn in the centre, my pawn on e5 is weak, and Black is ahead in development.
At first glance, Black's position may look better, since he already has a knight developed, and his pawn structure is more solid, but I like my position, because I have a lot of scope on the kingside for my bishops, and in the French, Black often gets a cramped position and can't do anything.
Adding pressure to d4.
This doesn't lose a pawn, because after 7...cxd4 8.cxd4 Nxd4? 9.Nxd4 Qxd4?? I have 10. Bb5 !! winning the queen by a discovered attack.
This stops a future Bb5  and threatens to win a pawn, however, I decide to finish developing while Black is busy winning a pawn or two.
Now Black is up a pawn, and may win another, and it seems as though I don't have any compensation, but Black's position is somewhat cramped, and I can gain tempo attacking Black's queen.
I offer Black my e5 pawn.
Threatening Nd6  Nxf7  and of course Black can't take my knight because of my discoverable attack on the queen.
Tempo.
If Black declines the rook sacrifice, then I will eat his position alive.
What compensation do I have for the rook?<n>I already had development compensation for the pawns, and now I can gain more tempo with threats against Black's queen and king.
Any other move allows me to win my rook back with Nc7 , but now Black's threatening MY rook.
If the king had moved from c8 to b8 instead of e8 to d8, then I have Nc4  discovered check winning the queen.
Takes away the threat on my rook with tempo.<n>If Qxe5? then Nf7  wins the queen.
Takes away the threat on my rook with tempo.
Taking the rook will only complicate the game after Qxd3. And I can still win the rook eventually.
I can win the rook with Bxh7, but I'm not comfortable trading queens when I don't have many pawns on the board for the endgame. I choose the best way to win the rook while keeping my pieces active.
I simply move my rook over and now I have dominating control of the a2-g8 diagonal, without even having a bishop on it!
Just look how I went from being DOWN a rook, and used my more actively placed pieces to win TWO rooks, leaving me UP a rook.
I was actually a little annoyed that Black resigned here. Even though I will use my superiorly placed pieces and extra rook to tactically crush his underdeveloped position, I would've had fun doing it, and just being handed a win isn't as fun. It's the thinking required to win the game that's fun, not the win itself.
From here my strategy was to use control the half-open e-file for a attack
D5 here was better as I lead in development so therfore I must try to open up the game
D5 again was better because if the e-file opens I would simply just dominate the game
Black resigns as mate will soon follow with 15...Qd6 16.Bxd6+ Kxd6 17.Rad1+ Kc7 18.Bxa8 b5 19.Qb7#. This is just warm up annotation,latter I will go in great detail on strategy
More challenging (and more book) immediately is 6. f4, swallowing up a ton of space on the K-side and setting the table for the stereotyped strategies to follow, with White playing a positional game based on space control and a K-side build-up as Black tries vigorously to break White in the center and on the Q-side, even if it's at the cost of a little material. Playing cautiously in the Closed means Black will often drift into a cramped and passive position; tactical energy and nerves of ice are called for, and Black must be willing to risk an attack by White to get his fair share of the position.
I consistently borrow this idea from the Kings Indian when I play the English as White (especially in my pet Nimzovich-Flohr variation), and in the Closed Sicilian as Black. Here, the steed is heading for c7 (or c2 in the English) where it will buttress the center and stand poised to assist in a Q-side counter-attack.
One good h-file sortie deserves another. The text dissuades White from castling right away. As we'll see, it dissuades him from castling toward his KR at all ...and White always wants to castle on the K-side in the Closed variation because Black's counter-attack always roars up the Q-side.
White could have played pawn to a3 on his last move, and probably should have. Too late now!
! Nice! White means to have h5 for his Knight, with pressure on Black's K-side.
!? I was forseeing a need to run my King to the other side of the board. 18. ...Kh8 just set off my "spider-sense" a little too much, although it's probably fine strategically.
! Black looks hard at the position and decides the roll of the dice is justified. This Exchange sac is a deliberate positional sacrifice: Black will gain a tempo by reattacking White's KR, and the huge hole at f3 beckons the Black Knight like a lover. The timing of everything in Black's game from now on must be Swiss-accurate.
Forcing the Rook to move now.
Black walks a razor's edge, but for the moment everything is holding. White has to *prove* he can win this.
White speculates a pawn in the hope of ripping open a center file for his attack.
Black is threatening to add his a-pawn to the storm glowering on the Q-side's horizon.
! Not 31. ...ed4??, giving White the open lines he desperately needs. But the text once more forces Black to stand at the edge and look into the Abyss. ...Remember what I said about needing nerves of ice?
Now Black has a pawn within Queening distance - *if* he can survive White's attack!
To stop Ra6+.
! Black continues to play for more than a draw! It's amazing that White can't find a way to convert his advanced g-pawn.
The text sets the stage for the capture of Whit's threat on g7; but there's a devious positional trap lurking within the obvious intent.
Black threatens mate on the move. Now White has to force a trade of Queens, weave his own mating attack, or lose outright. ----- Water123 says here that White can force mate by playing 45. g8=Q!, and he's absolutely right. Both players in the game missed it, probably because it's not the easiest mate to spot when you have under a minute on your clock; but it's there, forced every inch of the way. The full sequence goes 45. g8+Q! Bg8  46. Rg7 Kh5 (Kh6 is mate after 47. Qf6 Kh5  48. Qg5)  47. g4! Kh4  48. Qh2 mate.
It won't help. Black's cleric is on the perfect diagonal: it holds *everything.*
The Exchange Slav
Forcing the bishop to either retreat or take the knight.
I decide to take the knight because it decreases white's control of e5.
After several minutes of calculation I decide that it is safe to take the pawn because Rb1 is impossible and Qd6 can be met by Qb4.
Kicking the queen and bringing the knight to c5.
I was worried about Qxa2 losing the queen but I think I may have been okay after Ra1 Qb3 and I will be able to retreat my queen. Even if white wins back both pawns on the queenside the position is equal and as this play is nearly 200 points higher than me a draw is a very respectable result.<n>Alternative variation: 14... Qxa2 15. Ra1 Qb3 16. Nc5 Qb6 17. Rfb1 Qd8 18. Rxb7 O-O 19. Bxa6 Nb8
Bringing my king to safety.
The only move to safe my rook.
Bringing my rook to attack the bpawn. If I can eliminate the bpawn, then the game is an easy draw.
Excellent move because the only way I can win the white pawn is to get rid of the knight.
I push the king to the side of the board.
Cutting off my king on the seventh rank.
I want to play e5 to undouble my pawns.
Defending it.
Rxc5 leads to a loss after dxc5 Ke7 Kf4 Kd7 Kxe4 Kc6 Kc4.
I take the opportunity to get rid of my doubled pawns.
I bring the rook behind the dpawn so neither it nor the epawn can advance.
white to open up a row for the queen
black counters with horse to protect pond in center position
white forces a trade with black to open up center board
black moves queen up to backup bishop and possible check and attack at whites front row.
black beats him to the castle! :)
Mainline moves for the Winawer variation. I follow it up with Nf3, which allows me a few options for attack, which include a kingside assault with the h-pawn, dxc5 to open up the bishops for attack to secure a4, or a4-Ba3 to secure the queenside.
I adopt some moves from the Winawer Advance Variation and develop the kingside bishop to b5, then to d3. I move the a-pawn first to secure the queenside.
If black did Bxa4, I can commence an exchange thanks to the rook and a3 bishop.
Here I make sure to put some pressure on the kingside as well by moving the queen.
I remove bob's knight and go ahead with the exchange as it is far too close for my tastes.
Get my queen to safety.
Now it's my turn to threaten the queen.
Happily accept a bishop-knight exchange.
Bob further chooses to continue the exchange bloodbath, which is fine by me. I tend to not be afraid of exchanging major pieces on principle, especially the queen, since fear leads to more blunders in my experience.
I make sure some pressure remains on the queenside though.
I secure the kingside for now.
Another exchange occurs here. Also fine by me.
Like I said, I'm not afraid to exchange my queen. In this case, it is more than advantageous for me since I can stop the king from moving from rank 8. This will be crucial for me later.
I pin down bob's rook, his greatest threat. I use my bishop to twist the knife in the wound.
A bad move for black, as he should be doing Kf8 to free up his movement options, or attempting to resolve the pin that I have made. Meanwhile, I am free to use the pin to my advantage using my bishop.
And this is a turning point for me, as it not only gives me his knight, but a threatening mating position. If Bob moves his rook from the 8 rank, he will lose the game.
My plan is to use the bishop to further speed up the mate.
Here is where it gets Interesting.  With a pawn threatened i could easily move my rook to g8 to block but lose my ability to castle on my defensibly strong side.  Castling to block pawn would also be bad idea because of  8. 0-0  , 9. Bh6...  and then its just all sorts of trouble for black.  so instead i look for a way to equalize after giving away the pawn. and saw this move.
What the pawn move did was limit the queen's position (eventually) and free up my pieces to chase the queen.
This is why 8.d6 was important.  Qh6 for white would have lead to repeating Rg6, because I'm stubborn like that.  Unless theirs some other attack that i'm not seeing for Qh6.
Equalize and attack. Queen has three open squares left h6, g3, and d3.  g3 would lead to rook back on the g-file, h6 would lead to Nf5.
Trap complete for a pawn a rook and a knight fairly even trade in my opinion
Pull ahead and pressure open pawn
Now here i should have taken with Bishop instead as it would attack the h4 knight and block rook from pressuring queen.
And the blunder that ended the game.  Should have moved to King to c8 to prevent fork.
? Now blocking the Knight in the "g" in favor of another passive development of the same Bishop.  Nf3 with a mind to castling seems preferrable; f4 may also have some promise (restoring White's claim to the center).  b3 could also be considered for its prophylactic effect on the Knight.
Nice threat, but with Black having the tempo you're open to a zwischenzung, a la Nxf3.  Then you lose a Bishop for a Knight (I prefer Bishops, because at three squares distant they can cover all of a Knight's forward motion), and Black is still free to guard c7.
?  Bf4 was the correct answer here.  The Knight finds itself pinned against the weak c pawn, and White is free to castle long into the open file.  Also, removing the Night from g1 allows Nxf3, doubling and isolating the f and g pawns (and slowing your development, although with each player already having attempted a lone Knight rush, I don't think development was foremost in anyone's mind here).
?  Although it parries the immediate threat, the Knight at d4 is neither secure nor does it solve the problem at c7.  Pieces in the center normally need to be attacking, or one risks being overloaded.  a4 seems like a safer bet, since Black now has an arsenal of potent responses - c5, e5, Bc4, O-O-O.
White is in a conundrum now, having lost the Knight and being forced to retreat from the center because of the influence of the black Bishop.
Using a tempo to defend a doubled pawn seems to me, in this case, a poor choice (especially since it also impedes the Bishop).  f4 doesn't save the pawn, but it might get a good trade out of it - and develop that Bishop simultaneously.  It might also be time to accept the lost point and spin the wheel by doing something [seemingly] random like c4, Nc5, or O-O.
I would have ignored the attack and castled straightaway, possibly allowing your King to guard the f pawns and definitely centering your Rooks.
?  Missing the fork.  Black's attack also illustrates the problem with trying to defend doubled pawns while short on pieces: overwhelming attacks.
Not helping.  Not that there was much to be salvaged by now, but for what it is worth Ne4 was probably best.  If the Bishop traded in for your Knight, it would center a pawn and possibly allow your "c" Bishop to see some action.
Alekhine's Defense can get tricky very quickly since it seems like such a dumb idea that many players don't run into it often.  I don't really fault your lack of opening theory, but always remember to develop a solid position rather than running after fleeting hopes.  Although the enemy Knight can be attacked, don't do it if the attack damages the gradual maturing of your own position.  Although your pieces can be defended, be willing to retreat if you are facing a substantial counterattack.  And above all, grasp, hold, and defend the center with pieces!  Get your Knights out early, and your Rooks centered.  And of course, be ever hopeful - in this world you will have tribulation, but we follow One who has overcome this world. [John 16:33]
To protect the king but may be a failure, giving white one tempo.
The position didn't suit me. It' rather equilibrated but black is stronger in the center, black has a lack of mobility and the black bishop is blocked on f8
to protect b2 and c2
white's attack preoccupates me and my plan to stop it is to trade both knights and the bishops
To protect e3 so that the e knight can move on f5 to attack the bishop
At this point I felt relief. The danger seemed passed and I was quite satisfied of myself. The b open file is still dangerous for black but white's pawn structure is far inferior. If I can trade the pieces, the game's end is for black.
To be able to double the rooks on f file or 7 line
The queen and the f7 tower seemed sufficient protection  even in case of 23 Qb4, so I decided to double the towers on the file to prepare a counterattack. It's probably the losing move because I didnt car of c3
This move was foreplanned and seemed ok to me : protection of b2, menace on e5, aiming at a4
It still seemed ok to me, dangerous but I thought I would stop the attack
The pawn trading seemed ok, anyway I couldn't prvent white to take in a3
At this point, I saw the problem in c3 but it was too late
As for material black'still allright and can double the towers but c3...
time to clean up the center, probly to early, but i like it.
trying to get the center ALL to my self
rook is a goner anyways so at least try to clear my king
White grabs the strong center and black plays the logical continuation of his first move.
Preparing d5 and/or b5 and making a home for the queen on c7.
The pawn at h6 is in danger of 13. Bxh6. This knight move defends the pawn. The knight can be driven away by 13. h3, but then it simply captures with 13. ... Nxe3 and without the DSB, white has no attack on the black pawn at h6.
Probably not my brightest move. I think a day or two had elapsed and I had lost track of white's threats. In any case, black is now about to lose a pawn.
adding pressure to the white pawn on e4.
22. Nd2? was a small blunder. That knight was the only piece defending the rook on e1, and with the knight gone, the pawn at e4 is pinned and is no longer protecting the pawn at d5.
Now the white queen is defending the isolated rook on e1, so the black LSB must retreat.
White tried to chase away the bishop, but to no avail.
And now black has gained a pawn.
Ah, well, had to do it anyway. Maybe white planned this when he chose not to play 33. gxf3, though at this point, piece exchanges favor black with his material advantage.
No point saddling a rook with the onerous duty of defending the pawn on a7 when there is attacking to be done.
There, two rooks on the 7th is twice the beauty. White's knight on h3 is in trouble. 38. Ng1??? is suicide (38. ... Rh2#). 38. Nf2 and 38. Nf4 simply lose the knight. And leaving it there will lose the knight after 38. ... Rh3.
White chose to win a pawn for the doomed knight.
Nope, he didn't see it, and now it's game over. 41. Rf5?? loses to an almost forced checkmate, beginning with 41. ... Nd1!. Look at those three black pieces working together like a well-oiled machine. White can survive, for the short term, with 42. Re5 Rxe5 43. Rxd1 Rxd1+ and now the white king escapes, but faced with a lone king against two black rooks, white would have a hopeless endgame and will soon be checkmated. All other continuations lead to checkmate with black playing Re1# or Rxd1#, though white can stall for a while with a series of rook moves.
Black wants to get his king to g6 where white's rook on the 5th rank cannot give check.
And now black wants to get behind his pawn.
46. Ke7! is the winning move. Not 46. ... Ke6? allowing white to escape the checkmate with 47. Re8+ and 48. Rxe2. Now white has no safe checks. All he can do is throw away his rooks.
If not many people play it, it may be because it is not good
I choose the Closed Sicilian, because I'm trying to learn the Grand Prix on the White side of the board.
It's more usual for Black to develop with ...g6 and ...Bg7, since White tends to get a very strong hold in the center. This is certainly fine, though.
?! Not many games in the database for this move, but I had recently had success against another player with this setup and I wanted to see if it was just a fluke.
The one game in the World DB with this line continues 6.Bb5 d5 7.exd6 e.p. Qxd6 8.Ne5 Bd7 9.Nxd7 Qxd7 10.O-O and Black managed to hold a draw through a very complex endgame.
I like 6...d5 better. White is likely to trade this Bishop for the Nc6 anyway; there's no need to provoke it right away.
?! Black opened up a spot on g7 for his Bishop, so he should place his Bishop there. The text allows White to activate his Knight with force:
The Knight retreats to guard f6; the only way to avert both threats.
This move is thematic in the GPA; White's Queen prepares to shift over to f2, g3, or h4 to aid in the kingside attack.
I think 12.exf6 e.p. was playable here, but I wanted to go for the invasion and keep Black as crammed as possible. Plus, I was having delusions of getting my other Knight to d4 and trying to win the e6 pawn.
I did a lot of thinking before this move, but eventually decided to go with it because it messes with Black's position even more. The only satisfactory way to defend the pawn is ...Kf7.
Around here, my opponent declared that it would be a miracle if he survived at all! While I agree that Black's position certainly leaves a lot to be desired, I don't know if it's quite that bad yet. White needs reinforcements of some kind if he's going to break Black's resistance. As I have the spacial advantage, I look for a way to switch flanks to take advantage of my superior mobility.
This seems like the most reasonable choice to me. It blocks off the diagonal to my King (though I'd like to get him to h1 soon anyway), attacks c5 to overwork the Be7, and connects my Rooks.
Black's kingside is gnarly, but it's still a tough nut to crack. The Knight can't move, but the Rook can still be brought up to defend g6. Meanwhile, White needs to reorganize his own forces to make them useful again.
? It took me a long time to decide on this move, and in the end I overlooked the obvious. The intention was to prepare for d3-d4(-d5), but I completely oversaw that Black can simply take the now-defenseless pawn at d3! Worse, after 16...Qxd3, White is suddenly hard-pressed to defend both his Be3 and the pawn on c4. The only compensation is that the Queen will no longer support the Black dark-squared Bishop, and White may be able to gain time with Rad1 at some point.
Intending Nh4 and Ngf3, but probably a queenside switch would have been better: White has more space, so he should use it to create attacks on both flanks that Black can't adequately respond to, instead of hitting where Black is already fortified.
Probably 21.Ne2 was better, to begin a queenside mobilization. The text invites 21...g5, gaining some space and hitting the weak f4 pawn with tempo.
Trades make it easier for Black to defend. I do think 21...g5 was playable here.
White pushes for an open line against the Black King.
? This is where White really starts to go astray, I think. I made this move with the intent to move Rh3 and bear down on the h-file, but it had been much better to simply proceed with the original plan and break open the g-file with 26.gxf5, where 26...Nxf5 can be met with 27.Qf6+ Rg7 28.Rxg6 Qxg6 29.Qxd8+.
? Black should have taken on g4 immediately, to half-open the f-file against White's backward f-pawn. Moreover, this move prevents the BQ from defending g6 down the e8-h5 diagonal, so that when White plays Qf6+, Black must respond with ...Qg7 rather than ...Rg7 (if Black interposes with the Rook, gxf5 Nxf5 Rxg6 is very strong). After ...Qg7, White has g4-g5, creating a strong point and eventual passed pawn on f6, and allowing (eventually) a Knight to jump in on e5, striking at all of Black's weaknesses.
? I was too preoccupied with my flawed plan, and couldn't see how strong 27.Qf6+ was here, but that was the correct move.
Black puts the question to White: exchange or no? Of course White isn't really threatening f5, since Nxf5 exf5 would gain tempo for Black. The real threat is Ng6+ once the g-file is open.
This seemed prudent. Black doesn't want to recapture with his h-pawn, as it's needed to defend his King, and he mustn't recapture with his Queen because of a deep combination that wins a piece for White...
?? All of White's wildest dreams have come true. I believe this *should* win for White now, thanks to the Knight check on g6 and the unprotected status of Black's Rd8. Black needed to play 30...Nxh4 here, because now White has: 31.Qxg5 hxg5 32.Ng6+ Kg2 33.Rxh7+! Kxh7 34.Rxd7+! Rxd7 Nf8+ and White regains the Rook, with an extra Bishop to his name. Unfortunately...
?? I had gone on vacation around this time, and completely forgotten about the combination I was to play in this position. Now Black has time to consolidate on the open g file with ...Rg8.
? 32.Rhd3 was better; the text indicates how fixated I still was on the kingside attack.
Still thinking about this Kingside attack and not at all about defense, I was planning to relocate to d2 or c3, but I overlooked...
...Rg4. Now it's Black with a strong attack.
?? This is the final mistake. My Queen trade offer comes too late; necessary was 34.Qf3. Now Black picks up an extra Rook.
No particular need to exchange now
White decides to retake with the rook and pile up on the f file
I want my light squared bishop on c4, and eventually on b3.  should i be moving my bishop now, or is Nc3 fine?  i don't want to delay development on protecting middle pieces, but i also don't want to provide black the opportunity to keep my light-squared bishop off of that diagonal.
i figured that i'll lose a piece if Qxd5, but it'll open up the e file for my post castle rook.<n>either way, it's not looking good.
not used to having blunders like this.  just want to get her to safety
e6 is weak, if i can out number the attack
probably not the best move, but i see an opportunity to go up one more in material.  it will leave all my pieces away from the attack, but thought i'd try it.
if i move cxd3, it's mate with Bxd3..Kg1...Re1!
Forcing black to give up his queen
The king is really strong there
He forced me to move, and given his moves, the d3 square is where I wanted this bishop anyways.
He realizes this and loses position and a tempo.
In this position there's nothing he can do to save the game.  He can prolong it 1 move by Qxh2+, but i take QxQ then zip up to h7#.  Game over.
And that's the game, thanks to the trusty clergyman on d3.
? A weird sacrifice but I was banking on the fact my opponent would play...
Deflects the queen off the f7 square
this was the first mistake.  Black should NOT have castled, as his king was much safer in the center.
there is no defense at this point.  Black has opened the KR file, and now he must pay the piper.
Black resigned, as there is no way to even slow down the inevitable mate at h8.
Each of the moves is very dangerous. White wants to mate me thanks to its control of the h file. <n>My response to that was to attract the Queen and basically win the Queen on my back rank
I decided to take hold of the centre
my pan here was a6, exchange and then knight tob7
not taking the exchange
now the knight is helped by the rook
completing the exchange
i had seen this earlier but did not want to play it to early - wins  a rook
there is no way to defend this rook
Forcing Duras' Knight to retreat.
Forcing the exchange of Bishops.
Duras intends to counterattack.
Sacrificing the Pawns in order to get his Rook on the 7th rank.
The game hangs in the balance. Cohn plays for a mating attack.
Duras has to make forcing moves of his own.
Trying to find refuge from the checks so he has time for ... Q-N7 mate.
Defending with tempo: an attack on the Queen.
Continuing the pressure.
Forcing Cohn to interpose.
Foced if he wants to preserve his Queen.
With Cohn still having a mate in 1 if Duras lets up for a moment, Duras presses the attack.
Cohn resigns. If his King moves to the KR file, 49 Q-R8 ch wins the Q. If he plays 48... K-B4, 49 Q-Q7 ch wins the Q. An incredible attacking sequence by Duras to conclude a remarkable game by both men.
Blunder. Bc7 or Bf6 was needed. The Analysis board and Flip were needed to avoid a blunder like this.
Qxd4! brings in the Queen
I sac my bishop to bring the white king out in the open.
! Now I must lose a piece, as I can't protect my knight anymore
I wonder if this was the best move. Any suggestions, readers? In any case, I develop my bishop and attack the white queen
? Pins the bishop to my queen, but nothing much else
!! I activate my rook into the deadly fully open f file AND I unpin my knight
The king is forced to go in the h1-a8 diagonal...
The white king must go into the h1-a8 diagonal AGAIN!
0-1  For those who wondered, if the king tries to escape through the f file, he would have been mated quick enough by Nxh4+ Ke1 Rae8#, activating my other rook as well.<n>Please feel free to comment and rate
The usual set up for the Caro Kann Advance Variation. 3...e6 leaves black cramped.
4.Nf3 is strong also and leads to both sides fighting for the c file.  4. Nc3 announces a king side pawn attack on the black's light bishop.
6...h5 is also common and maybe a bit sharper. I am looking to get my c pawn rolling rather than open it up  just yet.
10. BxN? leaves my light squared bishop quite strong, but he has now given me a tempo.
With his king side pawns advanced I am not planning to castle king side, so I can live with retaking on g6 with my pawn if he exchanges bishops.
My development is lagging and I need to get the bishop out before i can get out my N on g8. Exchanging on d4 leaves white's Q on d4, preventing my bishop from getting to b4, which would continue to doom my g8 knight.
White can't retake with the Queen due to the d4 fork, and now his queen side pawns are in bad shape.  White is able to get some strong play down the b file, but eventually must abandon it to protect his K side.
We now have a B vs. N game, and white's B will find it difficult to move around because of his pawns.
The doubled pawns on c file mean there is no future for my N on that side of the board. 18...h5! will lead to a permanent homes for my N on f4 and h5 in particular and some fixed white pawns as targets.
To prevent castling so that I can contest the b file.
White's rook will need to stay on the h file to defend his pawn. I am trying to open the f file for my rook. I don't want to castle because I need my K to protect my e pawn and be available to stop penetration of his rook down the b file.
White recognizes now that my N is the better piece and hopes I will exchange it for his bad bishop (and undouble his pawns as well).
Having g6 available to my N was crucial throughout the endgame. If his rook penetrates on the b file, my N can stay on f4 and protect g7, otherwise my K and Rook are tied down to its defense.
I now have the f file and the stronger minor piece. White works in the next sequence to create a passed pawn to offset my advantage.
29...Nxe5? 30. Bd4 and my g pawn falls. Rb7gives me flexibility to double on either the f or b files and keeps his B "bad."
I can't afford to give up the b file because my a pawn will fall and probably my e pawn, too, and that would lose the game.
Avoiding Nf5 , forking King and Bishop and taking the  b pawn shortly after. I have avoided occupying g6 with my pawn because it allows my N to use it but also to protect it from f5.  On g6 it is more vulnerable to white's rook.
A key move. I might even award myself a !  His far advanced, protected passed pawn looks bad for me, but my h pawn is equally dangerous.  I'm preparing to get my rook behind it, which will force him to abandon his a pawn.  Then my strong knight will begin to exert winning pressure.
Making a run for it will draw his rook back to his king side.  I held my breath through this whole next sequence! Leaving the pawn on g6, protected by the N, was essential.
Taking my N is not helpful because my rook and king break through and combine to create another passed pawn.  I worked out many sequences here, and they seemed favorable to me.<n>If he took the pawn with his K, then we would exchange rooks on the h1 square, leaving his K even further from the center. He was smart to avoid that.
White resigned as Nf5 forks the King and B.  But white would still have been able to draw (or even win!): I have to trade my N for the passed pawn (if my N roams I can't stop the passed pawn and protect my e pawn), as my e6 pawn is weak and I can't get my K around behind white's pawns.
The Alekhine's Defense. It's been 20 years since I played competitively or read a chess book. I seem to recall my understanding of this defense was to build my 4 center pawns up by chasing the black knight - this was considered strong for white. Maybe I am just remembering poorly; I've forgotten a lot in 20 years. In any case, 2. e5 is the main line.
The Two Pawns Variation. c4 is a good square for a pawn, threatening the center and relatively unassailable by black pieces. And the move gains a little tempo by chasing the knight off of d5.
Heading to the Four Pawns Attack - as said earlier, I thought this was how to handle the Alekhine.
My center has already crumbled somewhat and black has a big edge in development.
Black's development continues to outpace mine. My queen is "developed" as it were, but she blocks my king's bishop, so in essence she un-develops the bishop. I am not liking this approach to handling the Alekhine.
The development stands at 4 to 2, and I'm purely on the defensive. Yuck.
I liked my opponent's 11. Nd7? (I think it earns a ?) because it let me exchange my precarious e5 pawn and when black recaptures, it will leave him with isolated f and h pawns. Maybe I'll end up with some decent compensation here with black's weak pawn structure. Even better, by capturing with 12. exd6, I expose a bishop attack on the long diagonal, so black cannot immediately recapture at d6.
Black exchanged bishops, but now his king's rook is en prise at h8. He still cannot recapture on d6.
Sneaky. The queen on b2 defends the pawn. I have to admit, I was hoping my opponent would overlook that. Regardless, this move lets me attack one of the weak isolated black pawns, and combined with my queen, seems to open some interesting lines of attack into black's home along those long diagonals.
I just know black is itching to play the royal fork with Nd3 , but my bishop way over on h7 denies him the square. Still, taking the knight gets his queen further into play, and I don't want him to take my knight on f3 and isolate some of my pawns. Also, he might just chase away that far-flung bishop and get his royal fork. So castling seems a good solution.
Oooh, 19. ... Nxc4 was very clever - I didn't see that coming. Now I'm a pawn down again, but my queen is ready to discover an attack against the pawn on h5.
Black might want to trade queens, but that works for me. It lets me get ahead in material.
I am dreading Bxc4, but the bishop is currently pinned. Gotta watch out for it though, if black unpins his bishop. Or, I can just kill the bishop. I am also unmasking a rook attack against the pawn on f4, but while the black queen is threatening my rook on a1, I cannot play my f-rook off of my back rank.
I hate running my queen out of the backfield when black's queen is so close to my under-defended and cornered king. Still, it looks safe, I need to balance the material before it is too late. Besides, I'm now building up an strong attack along the e-file, threatening black's queen with a rook and when she moves, either my knight or rook can take the bishop at e6 while his only pawn defender is pinned by my queen.
Oops. Black's move, 23. ... Ne5? was a blunder. That bishop only had one defender - the queen at e3. The pawn at f7 is pinned. And now the Knight has a new attack planned at c7 - black needs to see to the defense. And I still have Rae1 in store to force the black queen to move, whereupon my rook or queen can take the knight at e5.
24. ... Rh8? was another blunder. I pondered whether I wanted to play 25. Nc7  or 25. Rae1, but finally concluded that, while the latter wins more material, it runs the risk of losing the bishop at h7, and the former leaves the possibility open that I can play both. For example: 25. Nc7  Kd7 26. Nxa8 Rxa8, 27. Rae1 Qmoves 28. Qxe5.
Black resigned. Apparently black concluded that he could capture the knight at a8 but then lose his knight at e5, leaving him down by a rook and bishop (and then the pawn at f5 will certainly fall too), or he could save his own knight, but then he his only defense against 27. Bf5  and 28. Qxh8 is to play 26. ... Ng3, which still loses: 27. Rad1  Kc6 28. Qb5# or 27. Qd5  Ke7 (or Ke8) 28. Rae1 and black's queen falls or 27. Qd5  Kc8 28. Qxf7 Ne7 29. Rae1 Qc5 30. Rxe7 with too many checkmate threats for black to counter.
(probably expecting 8. Bd2 when 8...Qb6 leads to the normal position with attack on b2 and d4 squares) A developing move like 7...Be7 was better.
Too many queen moves by Black. It now blocks the b6 square from the knight on d7 and also moves away from the open c-file. 11...Nb6 was better when the knight heads for the c4 outpost.
White over-protects d4 and allows Black to launch a queen side attack with 13...a5
This routine move opens the king side and allows White to launch a vicious attack
White's pieces are aggressively placed. So Black tries to exchange pieces to weaken the attack
Just in case there is any uncertainty with regards to the rules of this popular game, here is a summarised version of the 'Blide Verpoinian Chess rules'<n><n>___<n>1.1 Nature and Objectives:<n><n><n>All pieces behave in the same way as they do in conventional chess, moves alternate as usual.<n><n>The objective of the game is to capture the opponent's 2 rooks (not including promoted pawns) whilst avoiding checking the opponent's king. As soon as the opponent's king is checked, the opponent wins the game. If no move can be played without checking the opponent's king, the game is a draw.<n>___<n>6.1 Special Rules:<n><n>If either player hesitates just as they are about to make a move, the opponent is allowed to cry out 'Maggot-Moose' and they will be rewarded with a free legal move of their opponents pieces. The words 'Maggot-Moose' must be said articulately; 'Magga-Moose', 'Maggom-Toos' or 'Mag-Moose' are not acceptable.<n><n>If a player temporarily leaves the game for any reason during play, it is acceptable for the opponent to slyly move pieces around at their discretion.<n><n>If for any reason, either player leaves the game before it has finished and doesn't return within exactly 5 minutes, both players must be roasted and fed to the spectators.
Alfrom Namanamic Safeway, (playing as white) a chess-prodigy Kweedite from the Purple Ocean had been tournament champion for the last 4  Olympics and was particularly hoping for another win so he would hold the record as the only Kweedite to win 5 consecutive Chess Championships (This was Safeway's final year before his Phorphism - a Kweedite tradition where the first-born in each family must sacrifice themselves to the Phortanak Sharks in return for peace among Purple Ocean races).
Lord 'pawnonator' Jabborg (playing as black) was a newcomer to the Championship Chess scene and a favourite among the young chess audience (particularly Verpons). He had a controversial chess style - at the time, a respected only-recently-retired chess analyst commenting on one of his games, had remarked; 'his moves are stupid, his tactics are stupid, he's impatient and he's an outrageous cheater - If he gets to the final I'll retire'. This tournament was said to have been the first he had ever entered and won his first game against Garl Trowlaph (no. 4 in the Wackyworld chess standings) with an astonishing 600,000 to 1 odds against him.
And so, the 2nd black missile is fired;<n><n>Knight to e2 as expected
With another torpedo on it's way and the 'corner-fort defense' now in place, Safeway would likely begin to develop his remaining pieces
Safeway chooses to reinforce the corner-fort
According to chess records; it was noted that, after this move, Jabborg had very quietly begun muttering incoherently, his head had lowered and his intense chess-board-gaze was now cast on Safeway, almost as if he was gazing deep into his Kweedite head - other than a slightly vacant look, Safeway didn't seem distracted and so play was continued.
A very surprising move for Safeway - he's not usually known to move pieces that many squares in one move (particularly as his sitting-down-reach only facilitates moves as far as the 4th rank). <n><n>He had had to lean on the table to manage this move
Also noted in the chess records was the fiasco that erupted after Jabborg's pawn reached the final rank; with the pawn sitting on C1 and Jabborg continuing to stare at Safeway's head, the referee asked 'to what piece will you promote?', Jabborg immediately turned his gaze to the referee and  grunted in his thuggish tone 'What did you just say?', <n>the referee repeated 'which piece are you going to promote to?',<n>'I wanna promote to pawn' said Jabborg, <n>'that's not allowed', 'it's allowed if I says it's allowed', 'well I'm sorry but you have to choose between a rook, knight, bishop or queen' (the nervous phrappenite had begun to sweat), Jabborg's brutish arm had picked up the referee by his wings and threatened 'I don't think you heard me right mate, I promote to a pawn otherwise I'm going to promote you to a friggin sack of phrappenite body parts'. Before anyone got hurt, the Moonlagoom Hall staff-abuse stewards had intervened and after Jabborg settled down, he reluctantly promoted to a knight.
During the commotion, Chess records say that Safeway had suddenly jerked as if he had woken up from a trance and prior to this move, he was staring at the board in disbelief and insisted that Jabborg had hypnotised him. After the referee shrugged his shoulders and gestured to continue play, Safeway angrily grasped his d1 rook and violently swiped the newly promoted knight off the board, off the table and landing, with a loud 'clang-clang-splatch' in Jabborg's spittoon (Jabborg was rarely known to be without his spittoon - he was a regular grophacco chewer)
Feeling offended, Jabborg responded by grabbing the f7 bishop and, using his other hand, violently flicking the white queen off the table and smashing into a portrait of the 1st ever Kweedite chess champion 'The great Alphrom Saph', knocking it off the wall and falling to pieces on the ground. It was known that at this moment, Safeway stubbed out his gropherette, rolled up his sleeves, rubbed his hands and embarked on the most aggressive play ever known in Verponian chess history.
Safeway thrusts his rook into the opponents territory taking a bishop casualty.
A poor move, Jabborg was beginning to show signs of panic.
Jabborg was now down to 1 rook
Feeling vulnerable, Jabborg sweeps the other rook to a8 - <n>a desperate attempt to erect a corner-fort
For the sake of a pleasant interlude to this intense annotation, it may be of interest to know the origin of the expression 'grophworthy' -<n> a term derived from the Gopite/Draphenium hybrid mineral 'Grophenite'; now and again, Wackyworld's clouds turn a yolky colour due to an infection from a vapour-eating parasite known as Loshtophitus. Fortunately, a government-paid agency known as 'A Whiter Wackyworld' are responsible for directly administering 'Grophenite' into clouds when symptoms first emerge and the parasite is rapidly dissolved. For as long as 80 years, common citizens from the Graw City would point a finger to the sky at a yellow cloud remarking 'that cloud's grophworty', over the years, the expression was adopted in many sports including, cloud-surfing, cloud-skiing, cloud-jesting, cloud-chestnuting, cloud-chess and eventually chess.
Safeway, presumably feeling very confident, uncharacteristically allows Jabborg to capture his bishop. Jabborg had now built his corner fort.
The end to a succession of weak frantic moves by Safeway, now he reluctantly disconnects his king from the corner-fort
At this point, the game had reached a state of equilibrium and both players had now begun to collect themselves.
With both players reluctant to attack with their corner-fort resources, the game was apparently going nowhere. At this point, the referee suggested to both players that they take a break and then finish the game with a 'Habbajoop duel' - Jabborg and Safeway enthusiastically agreed and adjourned to their respective dressing rooms. The referee then activated the Moonlagoom Hall tannoy (which is also connected to a speaker system in Moonlagoom park) and announced that the game was to be decided by a 'Habbajoop duel' and a 5 minute intermission would take place.
During the intermission, the chess records explain that after the referee had set-up the board to habbajoop formation, there was curious discussion taking place within the audience - many spectators were asking each other if they knew what a 'habbajoop duel' was. The sympathetic Phrappenite referee decided to use the tannoy to explain the rules and use the chess board (which was projected on a wall in Moonlagoom hall as well as clearly visible to spectators outside via video screen) to demonstrate the nature of the game.
Thanks to a squoppulant scirbe present at the game, the referee's exact words were recorded; 'The rules to Habbajoop dueling are as follows; both players must use only their own knights and attempt to 'Joop' or 'Sandwich' 1 or both of the opposing knights whilst avoiding capturing any of the knights or checking the opponent's king -'
With Safeway and Jabborg returning from their dressing rooms, the referee rounded up his explanation; 'knights can only joop within the b7:G2 grid and players must make their moves immediately after their opponent has moved - only a split second delay is allowed, as soon as a player has been 'jooped', they must present their rook to a1 (if white) or h8 (if black) so that the opponent's king can capture and that colour will win the game!'
To any Verponian-Habbajoop-duel chess students who may be using this annotation, it may be helpful to use the annotation window (click the small window symbol) and rapidly click 'next move' between moves 109 and 127 to simulate the actual game which took place between these 2 chess titans.
Both Jabborg and Safeway were on their feet (Safeway stood on his chair) rapidly making their moves, one spectator present at the game had said 'their hands were a blur!' another spectator had likened this part of the game to a table-tennis match - particularly safeway, as he had to occasionally jump to achieve his moves.
Jabborg stays close to his king for protection
Safeway can't joop vertically because it would be outside the grid.
In the heat of the game, Safeway misses an opportunity for the diagonal joop on e3
After this move, a huge cheer had gone up in the audience, Safeway had gloriously punched his arms into the sky and Jabborg was just staring at the horizontal joop in utter disbelief.
Completely gutted, Jabborg, with a sulkish facial expression, reluctantly moved his rook to h8 (so that Safeway can capture the final rook and win the game - as the rule dictates)
Safeway, with a gladdened look of relief, calmly stretched from his chair to the other side of the board to capture the rook_____ But as he was about to, Jabborg suddenly, very violently kicked one of the legs of Safeway's chair causing him to come crashing down on to the chess board and seriously injuring his left shoulder! Lord Jabborg quickly stood up and roared; 'MAGGOT MOOSE!!!'. Jabborg (still stood up) viciously hurled Safeway off the chess board and after plonking the white rook on a1 -
Capturing! The spectators in Moonlagoom hall and the audience outside were stunned into silence. Lord Jabborg (holding up the recently-captured white rook in one hand and the Krompoborg trophy in the other) was staring out to the audience with a victorious mad glare laughing like a maniac. His evil laugh was apparently heard as far as the Graw City outskirts and a commentator of the match had likened his powerful winning-player manner to the intimidating personality of a political dictator. 1 month following this game, Lord Jabborg had become mayor of Graw city, 1 year later he had become president of Zaltang and 6 months after that, the Verponian race had declared war on the Purple ocean and many races (particularly Kweedites) had been chased out of their homes, separated from their families, brutally tortured or even destroyed. Good game!
White usually disdains this capture and plays 10. 0–0–0, thinking to get on with the traditional kingside offensive, but it is interesting to see what happens if he does play the obvious move.<n><n>Putih biasa tidak mencaplok di sini dan bermain 10.0-0-0 rotasi panjang, untuk memperoleh serangan dari arah sayap raja. Akan menarik untuk melihat apa yang terjadi kalau dia main langkah tersebut.
Completely logical. White seeks to exploit the weakness on the a2-g8 diagonal.<n><n>Masuk di akal. Putih segera menyerang kelemahan di diagonal a2-g8.
Superficially, 14...Nxb3+ to knock out the light-squared bishop is tempting, but it is not clear then where Black’s queenside counterplay is coming from. If he cannot conjure up something, he might simply get mated on the kingside. This is an occupational hazard of playing the Dragon, of course. As Nigel Short put it in the commentary room: “Dragon players don’t really mind getting mated”, though one could hear Dragon expert GM Chris Ward in the background saying “oh yes, they do!”.<n><n>Memainkan kuda mencaplok Gajah di b3 cukup menggoda, tapi hitam tidak yakin bisa memperoleh bantuan serangan dari perwira-perwiranya dalam tempo singkat. Kalau gagal, hitam bisa saja terkena skak mat, tapi ini adalah tipikal pembukaan Sisilia Naga. Seperti kata Nigel Short dari ruang komentator : "Pemain Naga tidak pusing terkena skak mat", walaupun GM Chris Ward, pakar Naga, terdengar menjawab "....nggak... (kami peduli)"
18 Nxe6? Bxb2+ 19 Kb1 Rxf3 20 Ng5 Rxe3! 21 Qxe3 Bf6 gives Black a very useful attack for the small material investment. Besides which, White doesn’t want pawns, he wants to give mate.<n><n>Variasi di atas, hitam memperoleh potensi serangan yang baik dari sedikit kompensasi materi. Selain itu putih tidak menginginkan bidak, tapi serangan skak mat.
Forcing the exchange of queens more or less guarantees that Black will not be mated on the kingside.<n><n>Memaksa pertukaran Ratu menjamin hitam tidak akan terkena skak mate di sayap pertahanannya.
The endgame is a very different story. Black is already a pawn up and has further white pawn weaknesses to target.<n><n>Di permainan akhir ceritanya cukup berbeda. Hitam sudah satu bidak unggul dan juga potensi menggali kelemahan di susunan bidak putih.
Nigel might have resigned around here ordinarily but he sportingly plays on to a more clear-cut conclusion for the benefit of the big crowd watching.<n><n>Nigel bisa segera menyerah, tapi dia dengan sportif terus bermain sampai ke bagian yang lebih nyata kalahnya, demi penonton yang ramai mengikuti.
Both advanced pawns can queen and ‘buy’ a rook but Black has a back-up supply of potential new queens, of course.<n><n>Dua-duanya bisa mempromosikan bidak jadi ratu, dan tukar dengan benteng. Tapi tentu hitam punya bidak cadangan yang lebih banyak untuk menang.
usually, sticking to my opening plan, I want Nc6, but off the line now and I've seen some big guns put the knights "on the rim."
back to the gruenfeld ideas, fighting for d4 and breaking up the center
the Q must retreat now.  before moving the Q, white could have at least pretended to be concerned with development and aimed at q-side castling.
black has found a chink in the "armour" such as it is
hmm, is e4 better here?  it certainly forces me to act whereas now I keep the target in my sights, breath, squeeze..
yeah, yeah, yeah...we'll just see about that.  With the exception of the a-rook, black is developed and the king is fairly secure.  White's king practically wears a bull's eye and has three pieces looking quaint.  white still has space and arguably a better pawn structure.  even though this grabs a pawn, 17. Bd2, 18. 0-0-0 might have proved better for white.
The master 2B also said to bring in reinforcements for the attack.  This rook is happy to take charge of the d-file.  This is instead of trading Bs on c1 and does indeed leave b7 hanging, a lovely spot for la dame, as mentioned in another game.
the R puts pressure on e2 and this can be followed with ...Rfe8.  The poor knight isn't such a big gun on a6, but black has enough initiative and more space.  there are a couple hanging pawns but there is only one thing that matters now:  the death throes of the black K.
I would like to share with you my good chess friends about how to win easly in Kings Gambit.I am not a weak player who wants to show his real strenght,I just want to show how beutiful this opening is and what great game white gets for sacrificed pawn if he will play it correctly.<n>-----------------------------------------------------<n>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_knight%27s_gambit<n><n>"White offers a pawn to divert the Black e-pawn and build a stronger center with d2-d4. Theory has shown that in order for Black to maintain the one pawn advantage, moves must be made that seriously weaken the position of the Black pieces. King's Gambit is one of the oldest documented openings as it was examined by the 17th century Italian chess player Giulio Polerio. It is in an older book by Luis Ramirez de Lucena The King's Gambit is rarely seen at the master level. Black can obtain a reasonable position by relinquishing the extra pawn at a later time and consolidating defensively."
Nf3 look very natural preventing Qh4 ,developing the pieces.<n>There is also Bc4!? and after Qh4  Kf1 and whites King cant castle anymore but black advantage is low and after Nf3 he will have to move his queen and white will have good lead in development and advatage in the center.remmember that black CANNOT even think about the attack becase you have all your pieces out and he dont you lead for the sacrificed f4 pawn .All attacks that I saw have created big problems for balck.
I think blacks another good move was g4 trying to defend the pawn<n>and after immideate h4 g3 leads to many interesting ideas like Bc4 sacrifising the knight or Ne5 wich i would like to play.
taking the center and threating to return the pawn on f4 and have a good game
moving the pawn twise!?That just isnt the blacks idea the best move was g5 and after h4 g3 Ng1 Bh6 it is still playble for both sides.However this move is actualy a waste of tempo.
Removing the Queen and continuing to develop
defending the pawn isnt good and leads to very nice move...
...Nb5 now queen cannot defend both c7,f4 pawns and she must go away
exchanging the queens removes black from having countergame chances.Beacause the both queens are pinned the c7 pawn is unprotected so there is realy a threat.
...and the pressure just growing
Qxe2  Bxe2 Kd8 defending the pawn but complitely bugging the development<n>and white gains a strong initiative now Ne5 is a threat or castle queen side and white is better here and Nf6 sacrificing the pawn but sliping out from being passive but still white is good here and black has some problems. c6 leads to big troubles after Nd6
A natural developing developing move and all is good (at least he thinks that way).<n>So now black is ready to take the knight in f3 but he forgets about another a more dangerous white knight.
Be6?? Kd8 would hold the game and not lose it.now it is time for forced mate!
After Kc8 Bxd6 it is unstopble to stop the mate with Bd7 and Rd8 looses to Bd7 ! Rxd7 Rf8  Rd8 Rxd8 mate.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is a thematic tournament that I am taking part in and another game against the Master Mater.  I did not get Freddied this time but he did have me all bottled up at the end and I ended up resigning the game on the grounds of ruinous loss of material as I would drop a knight just for starters.  We pick up the action on move 6 because the first five moves are forced.
14. ....... Qh4+ - I did consider taking on e5 but to do so against the Master Mater, especially as he has the Wicked Witch of the West and his dsb on the board would be sheer, utter folly, almost crying out to be Freddied (and he will gladly oblige!).  So, I figured out that the only chance of regaining my pawn would be to force a doubleton on the kingside, but not with the Witch on the board.  So, I saw a queen check.  Either he blocks on f2 or Freddy displaces his king and Glenda sits in his arc.  If the Witch blocks on f2 and then QxQ+, Kxf2 then surely the exchange of Fou Lenoir for that knight on e5 bears some logic, especially as Freddy just lurves those horsies of his?  I then figured that I might find some way of rounding up that e5 pawn and restore parity .....
17. ..... Kg7 - ...... firstly though Henry must go to g7.  Firstly to defend the knight on h6 and secondly to create an escape square on g8.  That is the second stage of my plan to regain the lost pawn.  However, Freddy is not a Master for nothing and he sure finds a rabbit in the hat to put a fly in my ointment.
20. Nxa4 - what has happened here?  After a pawn trade and a rook trade the a column is opened up for a rook.  Yup, Freddy uses this opening to disastrous effect for Yours Truly.
20. ....... Be6 - Fou Leblanc develops at last.  This aim is to blockade the e5 pawn and then start piling up on it with Nd7.  Sadly that knight does not get to d7.  You will just see how ......
31. Rb7 - this is the stuff of nightmares.  There is no way I can avoid losing a piece and the rest of my army is tied down.  I therefore feel I have sufficient grounds for resignation as the material loss coupled with the passivity is ruinous.  Therefore I would prefer to wave the white flag than suffer further torture.  So I make the jammy so and so's weekend by handing him one rating point.  I am now playing him as white and I hope I can do better - I will never give up until I end that losing run against him and I don't care how long it takes, but when I do it will be a big event when the Genie finally arises from the bottle - cheers and bye for now.  Joanne
Now with no bishops left, it's up to the rooks...
...and remove in exchange for mine.
...and my sole survivor creates a diversion for the rook...
...and my rook is able to cover...
...and move in for the kill.
???? Scared to lose your bishop? What about the knight?
An unexpected continuation.  White clearly plans a Queenside fianchetto attacking Black's potential kingside castled position.  How should Black respond?  He can either choose to oppose the finachetto with one of his own, either Kingside or Queenside, or to develop his bishops centrally.  2...d6 will contest the e5 square and release the wsb.  2...e6 will lay claim to d5 and release the dsb.  Other possibilities were 2. c5, contesting the d4 square and postponing the question of where to develop the Bs, or 2...d5, laying claim to e4, or 2...Nc6, contesting d4 and e5.
I opt to contest the long dark diagonal immediately with my own dsb.  I realise that this could be risky but I feel the need to play combatively.
This pawn's second move may appear to defy opening principles but by attacking the N it forces Black to move that N a second time and prepares to break up Black's castled position, so it is quite justified by the concrete considerations of the actual position on the board.
?! defending the B OK but this move is less flexible than 5...Nh5, whence it would also defend the B but it could also have been left there to block the h file if I'd chosen to recapture with my K.  My posture at this stage is entirely defensive: hardly my intention when choosing to fianchetto kingside.
I preferred this thrust to 10...e5 because I preferred to keep f6 covered by a pawn.  If White takes on c5, I recapture with the N and I preserve my pawn structure, White having loosened his bind on the centre.  If White pushes forward to d5, he leaves me e5 for my N.
threatening to create an open file down which White's QR can join in the attack from the flank.  e7 looks very vulnerable to such an attack.
I decide that I can't allow the Queenside to be opened.  I can't allow White's R to come down the a-file to threaten e7.
exploiting the pin
but this effectively stymied that hope.  The N has nowhere to go, so Black has to defend it with 38...Rh7, when it too has nowhere to go.  White can sweep up Black's errant pawn either by pulling the Rg8 back or swinging across with his K.  Recognising that I was lost, I resigned.  very well played by my 13-year-old opponent.<n>PS My ECF grade is 124, his is 136.  I've been converting these to ELO by multiplying by 8 and adding 650.  I've been told by Paul Trewhela, also of Banbury, that I'm using the wrong conversion equation but I'm sticking to it for now as at least I'm being consistent.
The most common move in the Gameknot and World databases. I had no idea what to play so I listened to them. (Not a good strategy, generally speaking.)
Black captures away from the center and offers a trade of queens.
Trying to prevent ...e5, although Black is going to be able to play it if he wants to.
Instead of 12.Rc1, I maneuver my queen and rook onto the open file.
Releasing the bishop on d4 from the pin (e.g. 13...Bxc3?? 14. Qxd8!)
Wanting to maintain the battery and not sure what else to play, I make this rather pointless move.
Finally connecting his rooks, so I make the bishop trade.
Now I have to worry about the possibility of a shattered pawn structure.
Avoiding any discovered attacks and realigning the queen and rook, as Black must continue to watch his back rank.
Un-pinning the Nf2 and now Black's Nd4 is in trouble.
Black sees fit to finally give his king luft. 28...Rxe1 and 28...Rxd2 both fail to back rank mates! After mostly reacting to Black, at this point I feel like I have an initiative. But how to use it?
Black wants to keep as many squares for his knight as possible, but this allows the bishop to be shut in with f4-f5, and, for what it's worth, reintroduces back rank ideas for White. Anyway, I was expecting 30...Bc2.
The plan here is to meet an eventual ...f6 with Bc4.
A stupid move. For some reason, playing around on the analysis board I thought it would be more difficult to win with the f-pawns on the board.
Black goes for the c-pawn to free his queenside pawns, but abandons his h-pawn. He needs to stay in the vicinity of the h-pawn. White can't exactly make progress if Black does that, but now White regains the advantage.
Clearly I must get my king in the area of his pawns! And look how far his king is from my pawn still! Actually, this move blows the advantage. 'Pushing the passed pawn' is the correct play. And when Black plays ...c4, Bxc4 is the correct reply as White is going to win the queening race and even control Black's queening square while doing so. But now Black's king is fully capable of getting back to the h-pawn if needed.
I offered a draw, which was accepted. Strangely, the GK computer changes its assessment of the position from +1.05 for White to -8.23 with 52.Kd2, but since it's the last move of the game, there's no explanation. Did White really go from a win to a loss in two moves, or is the computer being wacky? (What is clear even to me is White's best case scenario is now a 'bishop and wrong rook pawn' ending.) As for the rest of the computer analysis, it finds the play on both sides rather sharp through move 20, and declares the rest of the game pretty much a mess of errors. The computer's analysis is at http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=21568775&rnd=0.8942676745355129
Here shows the danger of the Lolli attack. My opponent blundered but my attack was still going to be quite strong and he discovered that this Lolli wasn't very sweet.
I decided to play the Italian game. While considered toothless it still has some dangerous lines if black isn't prepared for them. It however has been overshadowed by it's big brother the Ruy Lopez.
Two Knights, Not seen much over the board because black needs to be quite accurate in his defence however common in correspondence.
?! Preferred is Na5 this is because of Nxf7 (The fried liver attack) and d4 the Lolli.
Same as played by Fischer. This is now a combination of the Lolli and the Fried Liver attack. The Lolli Liver?<n>Fischer-Snuske continued:<n>...Kxf7 8. Qf3+ Ke6 9. Nc3 9... Bb4 10. Bxd5+ Kd6<n>11. Bxc6 Bxc3+ 12. bxc3 bxc6 13. O-O Be6 14. dxe5+ Kd7<n>15. Rd1+ Bd5 16. c4 Rf8 17. Qh3+ 1-0<n><n>However my opponent missed something.
Black resigns however I planned on Kxf7 Qf3+ and then I had a variety of lines which I will post once I find them.
I decide on a bold strike to the center.
I hoped the black queen or knight would capture the pawn so I could follow with Bb5 to pin the piece against the king.
But black did not oblige with Qc6 but instead took pawn to pawn. I expected black to respond with Ne6 to move the knight to where it could project power into the center of the board.
I know this leaves the knight on c3 vulnerable to a queen attack, but I plan to move that knight to a4 when that square is safe.
Now it's safe to advance the knight to a4.
Move queen to safety in case black advances the d pawn.
I thought Bf6 was questionable. Maybe black planned to advance the d pawn and take out my e pawn, which would allow the bishop to claim my rook at a1. I would have move the knight to f6 instead since that would accomplish two goals: attack the undefended e4 pawn and allow the king to castle.
Now I can get black's a pawn for free and force black to give up another move to protect the queen.
Black must think I am after the e5 pawn. I considered that as a possible target of opportunity for this queen move, but I had another target of opportunity in mind. I like dual purpose moves.
Now with two rooks lined up, I best move the knight out of the way. And get the knight to where I can put it on the front lines.
I moved the bishop here, so I could move the knight to b7 and fork the two rooks.
Time to march the pawns.
Looks like black really wants to stop the b pawn.
I considered moving the f pawn up to support the e pawn. If Bxc5 followed by bxc5, then the rook could take the e pawn for free. I decided that another pawn push would do more to make black worry. Chess is a psychological game after all.
Give black something to worry about.
I like this little symmetry with the rooks and pawns. But the positional symmetry hides a tactical asymmetry. On one hand, if Rxb6, then cxb6 and now I have a pawn supporting the a pawn. I can them move my queen to a6 to both threaten b7 and Qxc6. Putting both pawns on the 7th row would guarantee one of them would become queen. On the other hand, if I take black's rook with Rxb5, I could then pick off black's pawn on b5. It would mean giving up the pawn on a7, but I would still have the c pawn to guide to the 8th rank. Nice how the positional symmetry hides a tactical asymmetry.
This is interesting! Black doesn't take the bait to exchange rooks, but instead makes his king vulnerable.
I follow with Qa6! This allows me both threaten the pawn on c6 and threaten to trap the queen with Rb8 and threaten check with Qb7! Three options for a single move!
Black took the pawn which allows me to choose the tactic that ...
... traps the black queen! The queen has 3 moves and they all lead to capture! Black resigned at this point.
If White decides to trade bishops on g6, I will recapture with my h-pawn, and my h8-rook will have an open file to shoot down, increasing his activity. Also, my d6-square may be weak, but at least I'm using it to pressure my opponent by placing a bishop on it.
White dangerously uncovers h2 for my diagonal battery. However, if his next move is 13.g3... , then he is safeguarding his position. Furthermore, he could be aiming at 13.c4... followed by 14.Nc3... for improved position. Another possibility is that he's simply defending the f4-square, vulnerable to my Ne5-f4.
I can now try to focus an attack on the White king.
My plan is to manoeuvre the knight to f4. If bishops are swapped on g6, I open up the h-file voluntarily. If we trade knights on f4, I will try to swap bishops on d3, and then advance my f, g and h-pawns towards the enemy king.
Rendering the d3-bishop poor (and indeed my g6-bishop), but also allows a potential movement of my own bishop by Bh5-g4-h3.
White decides to stump my a3-f8 diagonal battery, but also shows possible intentions to march at my king with his queenside.
I dominate the kingside light-coloured squares. I also have control over the a8-h1 diagonal. Now I must secure f4 safely. However, you also see how my f3-bishop prevents 19.f4!... which would complicate my stance.
If the premature 19...g5? then 20. Ng6... +/-. Nonetheless that variation is playable, but risky - and with the advantage White would gain - damaging to Black's dominance on the kingside.
20...cxd5 would potentially allow 21. Bb5... Also, e4 is now secure and an open file for my rooks has appeared.
It can be seen how I have essentially moved the f-pawn to the d-file. Also, an advance of my g+h pawns would suffocate White's counterplay. The only downside is the sudden passive nature of my d6-bishop.
White dominates the dark-coloured squares, limiting my bishop. This is an advantage for White, whose knight can hop into my own half should he chose. White's last move allows his previously anchored c-pawn to advance further should he wish to limit my queenside.
This allows me to exchange my passive piece for his, which is much more active.
Now, either king has the potential to invade the other side, and it is possible for both to achieve this.
If 43...Rxc3? then 44. Rxc3+ Kxc3 45. d5... 1-0 If 43...Rxg4, the White king would dangerously rejoin his pieces.
(?) I fail to make the most of the position. If I had been patient, I would not hide behind the pawn and instead played 54...Kc3 - forcing eventually to make the enemy rook move, allowing me to promote on e1. I have squandered a win.
Solid play from both sides led to a drawn endgame. However, White made an error by gifting me an advance into his half of the board with my king when he played 40. Rh5+?... However, I replied with an error of my own on move 54 with 54... Ke1 and gifted a draw to White.
Hi everyone, here I get into a reasonable position in the endgame and with a draw in sight guess what - I go and blow it again.  It has to be said that a skillful bit of camouflage on Freddy's part was a contributory factor in my blundering in this game.  I kick off with e4.
12. exf5 - I decide to take on f5 in order to give Freddy an isolani.
16. Bg5 - I decide to pin Freddy's knight to his rook.
18. ..... Be7 - Freddy breaks the pin.
27. Be1 - to stop the possibility of a bishop sac on b4.
31. Kd1 - Freddy had this to say about my king move:- "What about 31. Bd2 and try to exchange or lock in my bishop..."
33. Kb1? - and Freddy had this to say about my move to b1. "I would have moved 33. f6 or Bh4"
38. Kc2 - the only way to hold on to the c pawn.  Freddy surprises me with b4.
41. ..... a2+ and # in 4.  Notice that this is a decoy.  Henry must capture but the c pawn now crowns.
Solosky-Canal Variation is a good alternative for white if he wishes to avoid main line stuff. I used to play this years ago as a surprise weapon on OTB play.
Deciding to develop the DSB on the g7 diagonal is a very good idea here because it is extremely difficult for white to shut it in. I am planning to setup a hedgehog formation which I love to play as black.
When white plays Be3 in the Sicilian he almost always wants to play Qd2. Especially if black has played the Fianchetto. The reason for this is that later on white can setup all kinds of tactics on f6 and h6 with the support of the king pawns. But here this maybe a tad too early because this blocks the escape route of the DSB.  Allowing black to play his next move. <n>Alternative variation: [better is ] 10. f3 O-O 11. Qd2 Rc8 12. Rad1 [=]
?!<n>allowing black to get in the advantageous ...e6 with inattentive. <n>Alternative variation: 11. Nd1 b5 12. f3 Nxe3 13. Nxe3 [=]
??<n>This a typical mistake, white ignores the attack on one piece only to put two in danger. It is kinda like a rescue mission gone bad. Where the rescuer ends up needing rescue too. <n>Alternative variation: 12. Nc3 Nxe3 13. Qxe3 O-O 14. Rfd1 Rc8 [⩱]
A big "x" marks the spot with the D4-knight right in the cross-hairs
I am not so much as attacking the DSB but rather the f4 weak point. Can you see how?
its Little bite inaccuracy move:5... Bb4 better was 5...Nbd7. because of after 5....Bb4?6. Bd3 O-O 7. Bd2 c5 8. O-O dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nc6 10. a3 Bxc3 11. Bxc3 Ne4 12. dxc5 Nxc3 13. bxc3! and whits position better.
the whites DSB is blocked on c1-h6 diagonal because of pawn e3 which blocked by the black knight on e4, i decided to develop the bishop to much more use full place like a3, this is long and very effective for the white DSB to move . white now all most developed all he's Pisces while black still behind with he's development .
black wishes to close whits LSB long diagonal and trays to exchange one of the bishops followed by 11...dxc4.12.Bxc4-Nxc4.13.Qxc4.....  but still black must finished he's development .
now , white takes advantage of he's space , by forcing the black knight to retreat to passive position which we saw in the game , 17.e5!-Nd5.18.c4!-Nd7(18..Nf4 was leading to 19.Qe4-Ng6 another lose of tempo . according to whites space and center control , white can maneuver he's Pisces to more stronger position while black still struggles with him self by standing behind with he's development .
black wishes to open the c8-a6 diagonal and try to start any kind of contra play on the queen side but does he have enough time to do it .
the beauty is if 27...Kxg7.28.Nf5+and the black queen is trapped after 28...exf.29.Qxe7 and black under heavy attack.
tow Pisces scarifies leads to un stoppable mate in 4 moves ... ..
and black resigns : after 32...Kh7.33.Qxf5+Kh8.34.Qf6+-Kh7.35. Qg7# and if 32...Kh8.33.Qxh6#  i hope you enjoyed the game !!
Al loves the Dutch, though technically this game never quite becomes one because White plays his d-pawn to the 3rd rank instead of the 4th. Had Al played 1. ...f5, I would have pounced on him with 2. g4!?, the Krejcik Gambit with which I've trounced him several times from within the context of an English pawn formation. Old dogs can, apprently, learn new tricks: Al's more circumspect here, waiting until I've committed both my KN and g-pawn in a way that makes the gambit impossible to play. ...Sneaky booger!
This move is virtually thematic with me, from this and any closely resembling "White Dragon" pawn formation. The Knight is off to c2 where it helps support the center and a Q-side pawn expansion. The move also uncovers the long diagonal for White's King's Bishop, another de rigueur theme for White in the fianchettoed English.
With the text Black pursues a strategy almost exclusive to the Dutch. And now if 9. Nb5 Bd8 followed by a push to c6 and Bc7, with an almost ideal defensive shell for the middlegame - in other words, exactly the sort of closed game Al prefers. So I didn't even consider 9. Nb5. ----- In some ways, as I remarked to Al during the game (we were talking on the phone while playing), our strategies became for a while a case of "I'll ignore you if you ignore me," as, as if by unspoken agreement, we each pursued the opening pretty much unmolested by the other.
! Black wants to play ...f4, bringing the QB to bear against White's K-side. This response to that threat puts the question to Black's rather hasty aggression immediately, while simultaneously setting up White's own pawn-push to f4, stoppering up the attack on White's K-side which frees the first player to probe for weaknesses on Black's Q-side.
Black sets up for a pawnstorm, preparing a push to h5.
Double-protecting the a-pawn before playing the break. Black's pieces have very little useful to do: White has a meaningful space advantage, while Black's K-side pawnstorm is mostly for show without his Queen to help facilitate it. It's a funny position - almost a sort of "inside joke" that only Al and I would understand right away: even though the fully closed position seems to favor his defensive style, the tactical breaks and chances all belong to me at the moment.
Playing to g7 wasn't much better, with White's dark-squared Bishop looming on the other long diagonal, and a nasty break in the works after White plays his f-pawn to f4. However, at least ...Kg7 didn't block the h-file for Black's Rooks, which is what I was playing for.
Now the file becomes available for White's Rooks instead, if Black insists on prying it open.
?! This is dubious. White should let Black do all the pawn exchanging on these files, a step farther than the reach of Black's Knights. The correct move was 28. Bd5! reopening the threat of 29. a6!! After working up a winning position, White is now doing his best to throw it away through passive waiting moves and ill-advised pawn exchanges. ----- Let that also be a lesson to you, chess beginners: always look for the most forcing moves that will give you an advantage, however small or large it may be, and then play them. Dithering has its place at times; but generally one should never dither in chess unless circumstances *demand* it.
But there's no sting to it now. The correct move is STILL 29. Bd5!
Is there a better move here? I can't find one, although I certainly don't like the text because it allows White's pieces to spring to life again.
White's position is hopeless, and he resigns. What a shocker, from squandering a won game at move 27 to suicidally engineering a complete crash-and-burn by move 45, thanks to Black's absolutely beautiful swindling move and just one second of inattention immediately following it. This is truly what we call snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. ---But most of the credit has to go to Black's fighting spirit; he never gave up. Great game, Al!
The Sicilian Defense is probably the strongest response to e4, since it stops White from creating a strong centre with d4. The move 1...e5 also does this, but it simply matches me in the centre, while c5 creates more imbalances.
Against Sicilian, Baker usually plays c3, or the Morra Gambit (d4 cxd4 c3), but I didn't want to play one of his openings since he would probably crush me due to having more knowledge.
This move has a lot of purposes. It defends the c5-pawn, it opens lines for the bishop to develop, it prepares a d5 pawn advance in the future, and it also controls the important d5 square.
This is Open Sicilian since I am opening up the centre. Most variations are good for Black if White does not reclaim the d4 square.
The most common continuation for Black is Nf6, and I cannot attack his knight with e5 because of Qa5
Nxc6 just strengthens Black's pawn structure by allowing him to bring a pawn closer to the centre. It's better for me just to develop a piece.
Forcing the queen to move again
The purpose of Nc6 was to get the queen to b8 where it will control the b-file after ideas like a6 b5 giving Black good queenside play.
This is usually the best square for the bishop in all Open Sicilians. Although in some variations, the bishop goes to g5 depending on how Black plays.
Baker is initiating his plan to play b5 and gain space on the queenside, so I had to think hard about my next move.
In order to beat Baker, you have to think like him. Baker's specialty is sacrificing pawns and/or pieces to gain lots of attacking potential, so here I sacrifice a piece to get an attacking initiative.
This move was good since it gives Black an extra move to play Ba5. I was a little disappointed since I was expecting Ra4, where Nc7  Ke7 c4!! intends c5 threatening Qd6  where I have a very strong attack on the weak dark squares for compensation for the piece.
Now Black has three minor pieces, for the price of his queen and a pawn, a roughly even trade, although I'm  1 in material count, the material is too imbalanced to say who is better here.
Not Be5 because of f4 h5 Qg3 h4 Qg4 Bf6 e5 and Black's bishop can no longer defend g7.
Nf6 would've attacked my queen, but Qf3 is simple and Black's knight on f6 is subject to attack by pawns like g4-g5
This move is better now that d5 has been played, and Black has no a-pawn to harass my bishop with.
Breaking the pin.
I wanted to castle queenside here and attack Black's kingside with my pawns, so I played a4 to stop Rxa2 after I castle, and also to stop a b5 advance in the future.
It seemed awkward that Baker would move a defender away from his king. Maybe better was dxe4 Qxe4 Nd5 where at least Black would free up some space in the centre. But then again, Baker knows he's better than me, and maybe thought he'd win through my mistakes. So I intended to make accurate moves throughout the rest of the game.
Now Black cannot free up space with dxe4, and I control the weak f6 square. The pawn structure somewhat resembles a French Defense now.
This is another strange move by Baker. I realized that he probably wasn't playing his best, and this was my chance to finally beat him in a tournament. Na5 was probably Black's best move.
Now my attack can pick up steam due to a couple of pointless moves by Black.
Baker's idea to trade pieces to weaken my king's position was good, but my kingside attack is too fast.
Had Black tried preventing this with h5, then g4 is a simple way to forcibly open the kingside.
After axb5, Black has Ra1  Kc2 Rxd1 Rxd1 and my attack is stalled, while Black has much more counterplay on the queenside, so I had to make a very important decision right now.
I ignore the piece and instead continue my attack, now leaving Baker with every single one of my minor pieces, at the price of only his queen.
I was hoping for Bxa4, because I can leave my rook hanging and play Rxh7, since Bxd1 loses to Qh3!! with an incredibly strong attack and threat to play Qh6 which mates. Be8 is a defending move, and Black didn't want to waste time taking a pawn.
This stops the effects of Qh3 because now if Qh3, then the dark bishop can get to f8 to stop my attack.
Now getting the bishop to f8 is a terrible idea because of Bc5 Qh5 and I have a new threat of Rh8  (Kg7 Qh6#) Nxh8 Qxh8#<n>Black needs to activate his forces on the queenside to get counterplay.<n>I think Kf8 was the best move, but I still have a strong attack after f5, and Nxe5 is losing because I can leave my queen hanging with f6!! threatening Rh8# so Black must play Ng6 to defend h8, but then I can simply play Rh8  Nxh8 Rxh8#
Stops mate since he retreats to e7.
The final blow in my attack. Black's king is cut off from escaping, so there is no stopping Rh8  Nxh8 (Kg7 Qh6#) Rxh8#
Threatening to sac for mate on f7, even if Black plays Ke7.
White continues to avoid initiating the pawn exchange, as that will allow black to un-double his c-pawns.
Black decides to play for space, and pushes the pawn.
Black opens a lane for his bB, protects the weak doubled pawn, and has brought his king-side N into the fray.
if black plays 15....BxP, then 16.Re4 (pinning the B), and black must decide between delegating his Q to guard duty, or pushing the f-pawn forward to support the B, leaving the K vulernable to check from white's Q at h5, forcing black to move his K into the center of the board, or push the g-pawn forward, causing further weakening of possible king-side castle.<n> <n>black opts to retreat.
better would have been 22....Ra8, forcing white to respond to the threat to his Q.
black cannot play 24....Rd7, hoping to win the N since 25.Qb8 has devastating effects - black cannot intercede with his R because d8 is controlled by the N!
black has 1 recourse, and white has sealed the victory.
i like posting games with the nimzowitsch defense, i dont think ive faced a black oponent who used it once in my 200 games on this site. it also allows me to save some of the games i want to remember possible lines since im a free to play player ><
why i decided to post this game is this is a very Uncommon response i get to my opening which i think lead me to having a great game, since im used to playing vs the 3 most common/aggressive responses (d4 or nf5 or bb5 or even a rare Qf3)
i always love offering the check here lol instead of retreating the queen, i am a gambler at heart and the games where my oponent blocks with either bishops is the ones i love.
i have to say i face Queen most of the time.  white bishop block the other times. rarely a block with the knight and even rarer with the black bishop, this delighted me cause now he had no way of immediately blocking my knight on the c6 from coming up.
heres a bit more gambler in me was wondering if he would do bishop or knight but was still hoping pawn. the objective is the black bishop all along i was hoping i could achieve it without a cost on my previous move but that wasnt hidden enough.
time to cause some disruption break his pawn line and get the bishop at a cost of my knight and im breaking this board open so thats perfect to trade knights out for his bishops.
yet more surprises. he doesnt decided to cut the bleeding and maybe trade out queens he blocks with what i love the bishop!
no need to waste my bishop and this diagonal is by far my favorite for my white bishop
i felt my oponent had a very retreating playstyle it was time to also retreat and i wanted to finish development, allow my black bishop out and possibly castle
time to open up his little hiding hut!
he pretended he wanted to kill my white bishop all along so i would keep moving it. but hes going for my rooks. i have a hard time believing he anticipated a queen side castle but if that is so i almost fell for his plan, so the wiser move here is to let him eat with his knight if he wants and look for a more aggressive line,
my plan was to get my black bishop behind my queen use my rook in the open file the knight would create if he takes the  white bishop. but his plan was my rooks he saw i figured it out and retreated
by far i dont think this was it lol as the knight will continue his party. so rare i get to pawn hop undefended in a game with so many pieces left.
i was surprised he didnt take with his rook there. but then i see why he didnt take with his queen before he atleast also wants to be able to get the rook >< silly me i was a bit over confident maybe there was a way i could of salvaged a piece but at this stage i was happy getting the queen.
my thought here is gain the check so i can eat 1 pawn and also i want to stay away from his knights until my rook is free,
i guess his objective is my pawn and to confront my rook. but all im looking for is to free up my rook lol so this is fine.
i wonder if blocking with the knight might of been better with the hopes of connecting his rooks and bring them in to defend his king, might of been a better avenue.
after this i saw alot of checkmates can you? hes got alot of moves he can do to gain time but i dont know if he can come out of it on top, all replies are always appreciated and theory craft. i tried creating a puzzle from this position it took forever so obviously there is many ways to survive but he could only keep falling apart but the checkmate could be stretched out more than 20 moves. <n><n>im wondering if there is a short way i didnt see in the puzzle (which i just gave up on to just come finish the game and see which move he would actually choose lo).  in this game it took the minimum amount moves too.
his longest way to surive is to block with the knight and lose his rook. but he kept refusing to lose pieces
my oponent went away for the full 3 days at this stage i just set up the conditional move
This was a rubber match against an opponent I had already lost a game to.  I have specialized in the Scandinavian, at about the club player level.  The Scandinavian, also known as the Centre Counter, gives Black the initiative on the first move.  YouTube has videos on the opening.
This is the variation that I like least.  White could also try Nc3, Bb5 or Bc5 and c2-c4 in hopes of holding onto the pawn.  These usually give Black more initiative.  Here, White gives the pawn back and continues his development, also opening lines for the c1 Bishop.
This is what I don't like about this variation.  Black now loses a tempi, especially if the N retreats to f6.  The "book" recommends the following move by Black.
Now, if c4-c5, then the N gets a fine outpost on d5.  But the Black N on b6 is marginalized, somewhat, and White has a commanding center.
Black wants to develop in a way that also gives a threat, and nullifies the power of the N on f3 because of the pin on the queen.
White would have been advised to play Be2, breaking the pin and preparing to castle.
To free the f8 Bishop and prepare for castling.  Black also eyes the f8-a3 diagonal
Preparing to castle and also preventing any intrusion on g5.
e5 is a good outpost for the N, but it is supported by a backward pawn.  It also leaves its defensive post on f3 and encourages the following exchange.
Black doesn't care for the e5 Knight.  It is like a bone in the throat.  He wishes to exchange his bad Knight for White's good one.
Black builds pressure against the backward pawn.
Black tries to prepare a little combination, based on the fact that the backward pawn on d4 is pinned.
Clears the d file for the power of the Q & R and forces White to recapture.
Black keeps the B on the same diagonal as the enemy King.  c7 is also a safe refuge for the Bishop should the situation arise.
This basically took the rook out of play.  A one piece attack is doomed to fail.
Had to stop mate on h7
Attacks the a-pawn.  Puts pressure on c3 (with a rook shift to the c-file contemplated).
Double attacking the Knight, and pinning it to the Q.
Not a standard response to the Dunst Opening. The usual response is 1...d5, which occupies the center and threatens to attack White's knight if not blocked.
Black moves his knight out of harm's way. The knight now has an advanced foothold from which it can attack White's back rank in one move.
Pins Black's knight to the queen.
Attack's White's bishop, forcing it to retreat.
Renews the attack on White's bishop while freeing Black's knight from the pin.
? Blocks the check and attacks the checking bishop.
? Again gives Black the opportunity to take advantage of the situation by playing 9...Nb5.
? Recaptures the pawn and attacks White's bishop, forcing it to retreat.
Moves the bishop to safety.
Black attempts to box in White's bishop on g3.
Moves the pawn to a protected square. The pawn is now twice protected and twice attacked. This square, b5, becomes an important focal point and remains so for the entire duration of the game.
Instead, White advances a pawn to attack b5 a second time. The knight is still within her grasp, though, as it is pinned to the king and cannot escape.
? White responds by moving her queen to a position where it can simultaneously avoid capture and protect the rook. However, this hangs her bishop at a4. A better response to the fork would have been the more aggressive 17.Bxb5+, which would have forced Black to defer the execution of his fork while he responded to the attack on his king.
Black finally moves to free his knight from the pin, which relieves the threat of check.
White finally captures the knight at b5. After the dust clears, Black has a material advantage of a rook and a pawn against a knight.
Black continues to bring his own forces to bear on the focal point at b5. The pawn there is now attacked twice and protected twice.
Attack's Black's rook, but hangs the pawn at f4.
Brings additional firepower to bear on the focal point at b5.
An aggressive response to the attack.
Blocks the check and renews the attack on White's knight. However, the attack cannot be executed, as Black's bishop is now pinned to the king.
! White moves the bishop to the only safe location. Although the bishop is unprotected, it cannot be captured because its attacker is pinned.
Frees Black's bishop at e5 from the pin, which threatens White's bishop at d4.
! Black notices that the White king's movement is constrained; if Black's rook could make it to e8, the king would be in checkmate. Black cannot execute this idea yet, but he positions his rook to take advantage of the situation should the opportunity arise—which it does.
?? This is the move that loses the game for White. Black can now play 31...Bxd4+, capturing White's bishop, checking the king, and opening the e file to present a serious threat of checkmate. White has no good response to this. A much better move would have been. 31.Qd3.
! Forks White's king and knight. White cannot respond with 32.Rxd4 because black could then checkmate with 32...Re1#. White is forced to move her king:
Black sees the checkmate and takes it. The king is now immobile. (The e file is attacked by Black's rook, the f2 square by Black's pawn, and the g1 square by Black's bishop.) All White can do now is ineffectually throw pieces in the queen's way.
The Swiss local plays the French defense. :-) Of course, there's no such opening, to the best of my knowledge, as the Swiss defense.
If the Q moves off the diagonal, White wins a piece with BxN BxB QxB.
The immediate threat is Bh6 winning the exchange at least and damaging blacks pawn structure if I lose my DSB. This also prepare f4?
The knight would've been annoying on f6. This forces the knight to move and white will lose a pawn or the exchange.
Capturign the knight on f5 is no threat. White would actually benefit if I did. He would probably grab a pawn on f5.
I had calculated something along the lines of this where white tries to force a perpetual if I exchange DSB's.
This is a fun game, where we both queen a pawn, and end up with 4 queens on the board. It is also a bit of a mystery. I lose, but the post-game computer analysis (PMCA) doesn't highlight any mistakes by me. So where did a go wrong? Read through with me dear reader, and see if you can help me find out where I went wrong!
This is the obvious follow up to Nge2, now that she can't double my pawns.
So the Bishop retreats.
As my bishop can't go to e2 or d3, I plan to develop it on g2.
And now my talented young opponent is a pawn up, but it is debatable whether or not she can hang on to it.
And she prevents an unpleasant pin on her knight with Bc1-g5. Up to here we are following moves in the Gameknot Opening Databases, but h6 appears to be a new move. maybe a reader with a bigger opening database can confirm or refute this?
Now if she takes on c3 I can also take back with the pawn, and my rook will have a lovely open file.
I have to be very careful now. If I am not careful, she will play Nb8-c6-d4 with an overwhelming position.
Again, hitting one of the pawns which would support that knight if it ever got to d4.
In this open position, probably the bishops are better than the knights.
and she re-enforces the knight on d3 with her knight! Both sides' knights protecting each other in the centre of the board, next to each other, like this make an unusual configuration
OK stop! Black has two ways of recapturing on e5 - knight or rook. Which is best and why?
Nicely timed by my lovely opponent! If I take e5, she can now recapture with the bishop. So I have to recapture the bishop.
And now she removes the other half of my cavalry. My last move had discovered an attack on her bishop.
She attacks it. Now if I take the pawn, I was a bit afraid of Qb8 and her penetrating on the b file. I thought on c5 my queen could protect my weaknesses better.  Maybe just dropping it back to b4 was better. What do you think dear reader?
PMCA gives this move as a mistake by her, but I find that hard to believe! It says Qd3 was more accurate.
Her king has to move off the bank rank at some stage.
brigadecommander: yes that's the one!! For a moment i thought it was just my imagination. I tried to find it but could not. Thanks. Ours is better!!!
By playing very accurately, black now has a winning advantage, proving that she is not just a pretty face. My problem is that she is about to exchange off to a won king and pawn ending.
I temporarily stop her king advancing, but the truth is she has now got me right where she wants me. I can struggle and try to resist, but it is hopeless really.
Now my pawns on e5 and d6 fall like ripe apples and I am just three pawns down. Against weaker opposition I may play on, but I knew she wouldn't mess up this position, so I resigned.<n><n>Many thanks for reading!

Up until now, it has been a standard Yugoslav Attack 9.Bc4 variation. This move is certainly not a great one, as the b and a pawns hardly ever join in Black's attack. Better was 9...Qa5
The main alternative is 8 ... h6.  A typical continuation is 8 ... h6 9 Be3 Be7 10 f4 Nxd4 11 Bxd4 b5 12 Qe3 Qc7 13 e5 dxe5 14 fxe5 Nd7 15 Ne4 Bb7 16 Nd6  Qxd6 17 exd6 Bg5 18 Qxg5 hxg5 19 Bxg7 Rh4 (Short-Anand, Dos Hermanas 1997).
So far, nothing new.  White has disrupted Black's kingside pawns, and Black's counter will be ... 0-0-0, evacuating the king to the wide open spaces of the queenside.  As it turns out, this has consequences in the endgame.  We're following Leko-Timman, Wijk aan Zee 1995.
Black's last two moves have created tension in the center, and White should release it immediately with 18 exd5 Rxd5 19 Rxd5 exd5 20 Bxc8 Rxc8 21 Nf4, maintaining a small advantage because of Black's fragmented pawn structure and exposed king.  Instead, he takes aim at e6 and his pull evaporates.
White appears to have pressure against e6, but it's an illusion since 20 Nxe6 Rxd1  loses a piece.
The only move.  It's necessary to restrain the Black pawns, so the queen can't leave the e file.  The position is dead equal
The logical continuation, which forces Black's reply since  23 ... Bxd8 24 Nxe6 Qd5 25 Nxd8 Qxd8 26 Bg2 hands White a solid plus.  The second pair of rooks disappears, and Black's control of e5 is weakened.  After the following exchanges Black's weakness on the dark square complex b6, c5, d4, e5, f4, f6 and g7 will become apparent.
Since it's pointless to attack the e pawn, White decides to neutralize Black's bishop pair by blockading his central pawns and occupying the long diagonal with his bishop.  Lifting the blockade will mean more exchanges, which favors White.
White can't be allowed to dominate the diagonal.
This move may seem odd, but it has a clear objective:  controlling e5 without giving Black control of the a8-h1 diagonal.  Allowing Black to capture on g2 would deflect the queen from the e file; but capturing on b7 would bring Black's queen to the long diagonal, threatening an unpleasant check on h1.  The solution is to place the bishop on a square protected by the knight on e5, so that 27 ... Bxf3 can be met with 28 Nxf3, retaining control of the key central square.  White has no advantage, and his first priority must be to restrain Black's passed e pawn.
Only the queens are left and the White queen has arrived on e5 with check.  After 31 ... Kb7 the game will still be dead even, with Black's central passed pawn balanced against White's secure king position, the exposed position of Black's king, and the possibility that White may create a passed pawn of his own on the either wing.   White, thinking he'd frittered away his advantage with 19 Nf4, offered a draw that Black refused.
Already, the geometry of the position is making itself felt.  The Black h pawn is a potential target, but even more important is the a1-h8 diagonal, particularly g7.  White's queen plays an important defensive role on the hot diagonal by covering b2, c3 and d4, and if she can arrive at g7 with check the Black h pawn will be lost unless Black can interpose his queen.  This limits the Black queen's mobility  On the queenside there is nothing but open space around the Black king, and if White can force a pawn to a5 then b6 will become dangerously weak.  Black could prevent this with 32 ... b4, which may have been a better option than the move played.   Or he could force a draw with 32 ... Qh1   33 Kb2 Qxh2 34 Qxe6 Qxg3 35 Qxf5 Qg7 , but he seems to have overestimated the strength of the passed  e pawn.
White's queen now covers a4, b4 and b6 as well as the a1-h8 diagonal.  White can play this because 34 ... Qh1  is met by 35 Kb2 Qxh2 36 Qd7+  Kb8 37 Qxe6.  Now 37 ... Qxg3 walks into 38 Qb6  Kc8 39 Qxa6  Kd7 40 Qxb5 .  This invasion of b6 followed by a series of checks will recur later in the game and in a number of possible variations.  Black is still not in trouble, but White has a small edge.
Since Black has chosen passive defence, White begins a series of pawn advances that increase the pressure on the Black position.
Even so, it's hard to say if this was the best move.   36 g4 Qf7 (36 ... fxg4 37 Qxg4 e5 38 Qe4  Kc7 39 Qe3 bxa4 40 Qa7  Kd8 41 Qa8  kc7 42 Qxa6 axb3 43 Qa7 ) 37 g5 bxa4 38 Qb4  Ka7  39 Qxa4 e5 40 Qc6 f4 41 Qf6 Qc7 42 Kb2 also appears strong; but fixing the Black a pawn and controlling b6 seemed more appealing, especially since the advantage obtained by 36 g4 doesn't appear to be decisive.  The real trick for White will be to advance his g pawn to g5, creating a fast-moving pawn majority on the g and h files.  That threat cuts both ways, because it also means Black has to be very cautious about pushing his f pawn.
This is stronger than 37 Qf6 because it keeps an eye on b6.  White rightly avoids 37 b4, which would cripple his queenside pawn majority and weaken his king position.  Should Black later attempt (or be forced) to exchange queens, variations might arise in which White's ability to force a passed c pawn would be decisive.  And, once the g pawn reaches g5, Black could only exchange queens if it meant the immediate queening of one of his central pawns, since White could then force passed pawns on the c and g or c and h files, against which the Black king would have no defence.
37 ... Qc6 was also playable.  37 ... Qxa5 loses material but would probably have resulted in a draw after  37 ... Qxa5 38 Qxe6 Qd2 39 Qf7  Kc6 40 Qxh7 Qd1  41 Kb2 Qd4  42 Ka2 Qf2 43 Qh6  Kb7 44 Kb3 Qd4  45 c3 Qf2  46 Kb1 a5.  Black has liquidated the threat on a5, broken up the White king's pawn cover, and threatens to create his own passed a pawn--all at the expense of a single pawn.
This maintains White's tiny edge and sets Black some problems, since now after 39 g4 there's no pawn on h2 for the queen to capture, as in 38 g4 fxg4 39 Qe4  Kc7 40 Qxg4 Qxh2 41 Qxe6.
Or 38 ... Qd1  39 Kb2 Qd6 40 h5 Qc6 41 Qd4 Qc7 42 g4 fxg4 43 Qxg4 Qe5  44 Ka2 Qf5.   Black has no real counter play because of his weak pawns on a6 and h7 and his unwillingness to exchange his e pawn.  If his queen strays too far, White either captures the e pawn or invades b6.  If Black pushes the f pawn, White's g pawn reaches g5.
Black meets the imaginary threat of 40 Qa8  by moving his king onto a less favorable square.  Now, when the White queen finally penetrates to b6 it will arrive with check and the a pawn will fall, also with check.  It's probably worth noting that it's been 9 moves since White's queen arrived at e5, and Black's central pawns are still on e6 and f5.
This push had to be made sooner or later, and it's more effective now than it would have been a move or so ago because after 40 ... fxg4 41 Qxg4 White's queen is preventing a check on d1 and threatening to win Black's h pawn (42 Qg8  and 43 Qxh7 ).  Black is forced to either defend the seventh rank with his queen (41 ... Qd7, 41 ... Qe7) or, slightly better, bring his king to c7; but after 41 ... Kc7 42 Qg7  Qd7 43 Qg1 Kd6 44 Qb6  White has a strong, although perhaps not a winning, advantage.
Black finally manages to advance one of his central pawns, and it immediately lands him in a lost position because White's g and h pawns will advance much faster than Black's e and f pawns.  The best defence was 40 ... Qe5, forcing the exchange of either the g or h  pawn:  41 g5 (best) Qe1  42 Kb2 Qxh4 43 Qe3 Qe4 44 Qb6  Qb7 45 Qxe6 f4 46 Qd6  Qc7, with an advantage for White; or 41 Qd1 fxg4 42 Qxg4 Qe1  43 Kb2 Qe5  44Ka2 h6 45 Qb4 h5 46 Qf8  Kb7 with a slight edge for White.
White's kingside pawns must advance, but which one should take the lead?  41 h5 Qd2 leads to an instructive variation in which the White queen creates havoc by first seizing the a1-h8 diagonal, then visiting g7 and b6 (with check):  42 h6 Qe1  43 Kb2 Qe5  44 Qc3 Qe4 (the White king catches the f pawn after 44 ... Qxc3  45 Kxc3 Kc7 46 Kd2 Kd6 47 g5 f3 48 g6 hxg6 49 h7 f2 50 Ke2) 45 g5 f3 46 Qg7 f2 47 Qf8  Kc748 Qxf2 Qe5  49 Kb1 Qxg5 50 Qb6  Kd7 51 Qxa6 Qg1  52 Ka2 Qc5 53 Qb7  Qc7 (53 ... Kd6 54 Qxh7, and the White c pawn is defended) 54 Qxb5  Kc8 55 Kb1 Qc3 56 a6 and White wins easily.  Black does a little, but not enough,  better with 41 ... Qd4:  42 Qc6 Qd1  43 Kb2 Qd4  44 Qc3 Qe4 45 g5 f3 46 Qf6 Qe3 (46 ... f2 ) 47 g6 hxg6 48 hxg6 g2 49 g7 Qg4 50 Qd8  Kb7 51 Qb6  Ka8 52 Qxa6  Kb8  53 Qxb5  Kc7 54 Qb6  Kd7 55 g8Q Qxg8 56 Qxf2 Qg7  57 Kb1 Qg4 58 Qa7  Kc8 59 Qb6 Qe2 60 a5 and White wins.  On the other hand, 41 g5 Qd2 42 Qe4 might have led to a wild and woolly four queens shootout (See note to Black's next move.).
Black can offer more resistance with 41 ... Qd2, since from d2 the queen threatens White's a pawn, defends the pawn on f4, and is ready to give check on e1.  Now 42 h5 can be met with 42 ...Qe1  43 Ka2 ( 43 Kb2 Qe5 ) Qxa5 , so White's best try seems to be 42 Qe4, attacking  the e6 and h7 pawns and preventing 42 ... Qe1 .  Since 42 ... Qxa5 43 Qxf4  is obviously bad for Black, he should once again opt for active counterplay with 42 ... Qd1  43 Kb2 f3.  The f pawn is now too far advanced for the White king to stop, so White is no longer able to seize control of the a1-h8 diagonal by interposing his queen on c3, and after an exchange of queens he'll lose the race to the queening square unless he can force h4-h5 without allowing the f pawn to advance.  White's best try is 44 Qf4  Kb7 45 Qf7 , when at least one of Black's pawns must fall with check:  45 ... Kb8 (45 ... Kc8 (or 45 ... Kc6) 46 Qex6  Kc7 47 Qb6  Kd7 48 Qa7  Ke6 49 Qxa6 ) 46 Qg8  Kc7 47 Qxh7  with a clear advantage.  Black now has two main choices, interposing the queen by 47 ... Qd7, or fleeing to d6.   After 47 ... Qd7 48 g6 f2  (other moves are too slow) 49 g7 f1Q 50 g8Q Qf6  51 Kb1 Qxh7 52 Qxh7  Kd6 53 h5 we have a position that illustrates the true nature of White's enduring superiority:  even after the "exchange" of passed pawns White's secure king position and outside passed pawn give him a winning advantage. 
44 Qf4  Kb7 45 Qf7 , when at least one of Black's pawns must fall with check:  45 ... Kb8 (45 ... Kc8 (or 45 ...

Black can't achieve perpetual check and he can't play 53 ... e5 because then 54 Qg6 forces the exchange of queens and 54 c4 forces a second passed pawn against which Black has no defence.  After 47 ... Kd6 48 Qa7 (Qh8 Kd7 49 Qf6) Qe2 49 Qd4  Ke7 50 Gf6  Kd7 51 g6 f2 52 g7 Qg4 53 Qf7  Kd6 54 g8Q Qxg8 55 Qxg8 f1Q Black has once again queened his f pawn only to find that White has a winning advantage because of his secure king and outside passed pawn.
Black can't achieve perpetual check and he can't play 53 ... e5 because then 54 Qg6 forces the exchange of queens and 54 c4 forces a second passed pawn against which Black has no defence.

This appears to be designed to hold back the g pawn.  43 ... Qd1  44 Kb2 Qxh5 45 Qb6  Kc8 46 Qxa6  Kb8 47 Qd6  and Black's busted.
Anyway.  As advertised, the White kingside pawns advance much faster than the Black pawns on the central files.  After 44 ... hxg6 the threat of Qb6  and a passed pawn on h6 will be too much for Black to overcome.  The Black queen can't keep the White queen out of b6 because an exchange of queens leads to a new White queen on h8, and once the White queen reaches b6 with check the game's as good as over.
The h pawn can't be stopped, and Black's extra pawn wouldn't matter even if he could hold it.
There are no more checks.  Once again, Black can't offer an exchange of queens by 46 ... Qd4  because after 47 Qxd4 exd4 48 h7 f3 49 h8Q  the f pawn will soon be lost.
Black could resign here.  The queen will win the a and g pawns, after which Black has no meaningful counterplay and no way to stop the h pawn.  47 ... Qb7 48 h7 is hopeless:  48 ... Qxb6 (48 ... f2 49 h8Q#) 49 axb6 f3 50 h8Q  Kb7 51 Qf6 f2 52 Qd6 f1Q 53 Qc7  Ka8 54 Qa7#; 48 ... Kb7 49 h8Q Kxb6 50 Qxe5 and the pawns have no chance against the queen.
This position says it all.  White's king is safely nestled among his queenside pawns, his h pawn is ready to queen, and his a pawn is poised to create mating threats against the exposed Black king.  On the other hand, the Black e and f pawns that once appeared to offer chances for a win have managed to advance one rank--to squares where they prevent the Black queen from giving check.
The fastest way.  Now when the queen arrives on f6 Black will either have to allow the a pawn to gueen or let his king fall into a mating net.
The Black king can't block the a pawn:  57 ... Ka6 58 Qc6 and mate next move.  If the King escapes to a5 or c5, it can no longer catch the a pawn.  The last try is 57 ... Kc7 58 Qe7+  and the a pawn queens or Black gets mated.
If you're going to play on a queen down, and take a couple of long postponements into the bargain, then the least you should do is have the courtesy to put up a fight.  Instead, Black makes the weakest move available.  It's mate in 2.
Faced with mate in one, Black took another postponement.   After a day or so he resigned.
Although the queens are now off the board which makes castling pointless, NbxQd2 would have cleared white's back row, and preserved the castling option--useful for putting rooks on center files.
Free bishop?  Here black should play BxBe2.  19. KxBe2 (or NxBe2), RxBh4.  Black makes up the lost bishop, gaining two points (from white's forsaken pawns).<n><n>If white plays BxPf6 instead, RxRh1.  White just about has to play R(a1)xRh1, leaving black N (either one) takes Bf6.
RxBh4, white comes back with RxBg2.  Black might then respond with Pf5, though white would answer with Bh5+.  If black takes it with the rook at h4, white could play Rg8+, threatening the a rook, but then black would intercede with Nf8.<n><n>If white moves the bishop elsewhere, black can play RxPd4+, giving black opportunity to castle or otherwise protect the knight at g8.
That pawn was the black rook's sole support.
Black blunders.  The rook and pawn are not worth that bishop.
???  KxRe3!  It is a free rook.  That pawn wasn't going anywhere--there were two rooks on it and no way the bishop could be brought to bear.
Actually, I like Rc2 better.  Although white might play NxBe4, Rc1+ gives black Rg1.  White could escape with Nd7.  But Rd4 implies black is blind to the dire threat of Ne6+, and black loses another rook to the white knight the same way he lost the first one.
Nope.  NxRd4.  The whole point of issuing the king/rook fork was to pick up a free rook.  This does give white the pawn at f3, but the rook is worth so much more, and that pawn isn't going anywhere.
Senseless, driving the black king out into the field where he wants to be.
Or rook/bishop trade.
Not again.  White cannot pass up KxR forever.  In this case, white plays Rg3+ to move the rook out of harm's way, then picks off the rook and pawn one after the other.
Blunder!  After KxR the knight cannot be moved.  Black loses rook, knight, and pawn in rapid succession.
decided against the sacrifice - too early in the game, also if queen sacrifice black opens up column g for possible white attack and will have to kill white bishop with either king or black rook this will eliminate queens castle opportunity later on
repositioning king in the event of a future attack by white
another mistake by white - here comes the pin
black gambles by bringing rook up to assist queen - but leaves king with minimum protection
white begins to apply more pressure - good movement by white's knight with the pawn kills
off to the races for the queens
black king leaves rook to defend row 8, also assisting bishop to queen b3 pawn
Breaking the pin, much to the king's knight's relief.
Forking the white bishop on g3 and the knight on c3. Of the two, the knight on c3 should be white's priority right now.
Hmmm, 9. Nd2? gets a ? for leaving the poor b2 pawn to die in defense of the knight on c3.
Defending the rook on h8. Without this, the pawn on h6 would be pinned after hxg5 and could not recapture.
Capturing on c5 with either pawn just ends up with black having doubled and isolated pawns on the c-file. As played, whichever way white captures, and now he must capture, black can recapture with the backward c-pawn and avoid doubling or isolating any pawns.
The pawn on d6 isn't going anywhere, and white's center pawns need to go away.
Black is ahead by a pawn, two after this capture, why not trade queens and begin the material liquidation toward an easy endgame?
I'm not sure now why I played 21. ... a6?!. It's not quite a blunder, since that pawn will die, or with 21. ... a5 white would follow with 22. Nc4 threateing to win the backward pawn on b6, and after 22. ... Bxc4 23. Bxc4, white can then freely attack the b6 pawn with his rook from b7. One pawn seems guaranteed to fall, but 21. ... a6?! seems like wasting time when there's better things to do. I think I planned to play 22. ... Ne5 after white unpins the knight, but that would have been a blunder, blocking the bishop on d4 from its defense of the rook on h8.
I realized in time that 22. ... Ne5? would lose the pawn on g5, so I look for ways to harrass the white pieces. White cannot allow his bishop to be trapped by 23. ... f4.
White may have his passed pawn on d6, but black has 3-for-1 pawns on the kingside. There must be a way to exploit that.
28. Ra7 surprised me. Why not just 28. Rxd8 and win the exchange? Material would be imbalanced, but pretty much even. Black ahead by two pawns for the exchange would be relying on trying to promote those two passed kingside pawns. But white tried something else, and black found a way to save his rook.
White gives up the exchange voluntarily, but he seems to have a plan.
I think white's plan here was to try to get his knight to attack the pinned black rook. But it has no path to get there that isn't covered by black's bishops or pawns. The route via h5 to f6 will still take a full 5 moves to achieve, during which time black's DSB will find a way to e7 and shut white down.
32. Bf6!? was not quite a blunder, but I believe it backfired on white. I think his plan was to win the pawn at e4, or force it forward to e5 where white could then play Be5 with possibly dire consequences for the black rook. However, black's simple reply forces white's hand. He must now take the black rook or lose the chance entirely.
Black's king defends both pawns. Black is ahead by three pawns and has the bishop pair to guide them to promotion. White correctly resigns.
chasing his bishop away
The Caro-Kann
...e6 looks better because it protects the bishop.
! Usually it's not wise to put the knight on the edge.  Usually it's not wise to move the same piece twice in the opening.  But here white either wins the bishop pair or black has to play the ugly ...Be6.  (Be4 is met with e6 Nb6. Bh5+ where white is winning after f3)
Gaining the bishop pair.
Displacing the king.
This may look strange, but I felt that I had to protect e6.  This also keeps the black bishop jailed and forces black's next move.
? Missing important counterplay.  Best was Qf4, threatening Qc1+ and then winning the c-pawn.  I would have responded with 0-0.  But the resulting position is better for black than the text.
Where's the knight to go?
To give his knight a square.
Better was ...c5, which would create play on the d-file, where black is strongest.
Shutting off the queen and threatening f4.  Note that, just by glancing at the board, white's h-pawn could become deadly if black doesn't create complications soon, as black has no means to stop its advance.
I decided to make this pawn trade to gain a passed pawn.
I considered Kd1 but decided against that because the d-file is in risk of opening.  My "trapped" rook belongs on h1 anyway, to support the h-pawn advance.
Exchanging rooks would weaken black's kingside defenses.
?? And here my opponent was in deep time trouble from defending such a difficult position.  Correct was ...c5 or ...Nc7.  Interesting is ...Nxd4, and after Rxf6 Qxf6 cxd4 Qxd4, black has only one pawn for the piece, but suddenly it is white who has inactive pieces and no real play.
This game was soon after my game against darknessvisible.  I took his comment that I'd vacated the c-file too late to heart and lo!  I won, though I think I was lucky :-)
The start of the English Attack, currently the most fashionable response to the Najdorf.
This was in the Gameknot database as a fairly successful move.  I'm not sure why it should be; but I thought it worth trying anyway.  I usually develop my QB to b7 in the Najdorf but I'm willing to be flexible.
To my eye, this is now looking more like a Richter-Rauzer than an English Attack but I may have missed a key feature...
Taking darknessvisible's comment (about getting my Q off the c-file too late) to heart, I move to b8 ASAP, preparing a battery on the c-file.
This square is frequently a good one for White against various Sicilian variations.  In this case, it immediately threatens to win the undefended f-pawn.  On the other hand, it is hanging and Black can reveal an attack on it at any time.
Blocks the B in on the kingside, cutting it off from the defence of White queenside castled King.
? Black fails to see how vulnerable the Nb4 is.  In the lead-up to playing this move I had played with the idea of sacrificing the knight on c7 but concluded that it didn't work.  This was supposed to be a more conservative build up move.
This move releases the black-squared bishop to join the attack on White's castled position.
Now both bishops slant across the board at White's king.  Compare the relative powerlessness of White's prelates, stuck on the kingside with no targets, though they do control some squares that Black would like to use.
Black gives up hope of establishing an over-powering attack on the c-file and seeks alternative lines of attack.  The immediate threat is ...Bxa3
However, I moved the queen to defend e3.<n>Alternative variation: 10.Bxh7+ Kxh7 11.Ng5+ Kg8 12.Qxg4  [This variation wins the h7 pawn, but moves away from the spirit of the original game.]  12...Qf6 13.e4
I chose to shoo the knight away, but weakening g3, where the knight would love to come later.<n>Alternative variation: 11.Ne5 Ngxe5 12.dxe5 Be7 13.b4
engines would want me to attack the knight on f6 before moving the rook out.
Alternative variation: 15.g5 Bxe5 16.dxe5 Ne8 17.Kg2 g6 18.b3  [Engines decide to try a queen side attack as well, in order to weaken the black pawn chain. I was not interested in that.]
Engines suggest I move the king and concentrating on the attack, but I took the knight with the rook.
The so called classical variation. The intention is to strengthen ones influence on e5, a key square in this opening. White wants to take a foothold there to make the black Bishop very passiv and to occupy the center.
This seems to be a good place for the knight, however black gets an etch on development, and white obviously has abandoned his plan to occupy e5.
Now the plan becomes clear: aiming at the relatively weak f7 file. An exchange would drop blacks king safety, however black would have a relatively large advantage in development.
I did not enjoy this move, since it blocks my bishop. White's attack is showing effect. <n>e6 is a somewhat two edged sword for black in the Pirc. It can, combined with c5, help to break through... but it can also lead to a weakened king safety and unfavorable pawn structures for black.
A move I do not fully understand. getting a hold of the e5 square is normally an important goal in whites strategy: It simply locks the Bishop in. In this situation the push does not work yet. <n>I was not sure what to do in this situation, so my opponent at least confused me. e5 would block both our bishops. However one could aim for f5 and Bxf5 after an exchange. But since I'm no friend of that much closed up Positions...
Thinking that white would of course move his knight. Fritz recommends exd5 !? Since after exd5 follows 8 ... Re8. Forcing one light figure to "hang around". Leaving either d5 o g5 weak. <n>e.g. 9 Be3? Ng4! <n>However the move is not that bad. Although it will ruin my pawn structure on the kingsside
... to play xe6 and apply pressure on the e file
Let's engage the f7 Pawn... However perhaps Ng4 would have been even better, as it let's the bishop stroll around again and cover g5.
Grabbing the undefended g5
I wanted to get rid of the f7 pawn and therefore  i had to get rid of the bishop....
A brute force attack, and a little counter attack. The queen has to move! And she will be unable to cover the bishop on c4, so f7 will ultimately fall :) (together with the Bishop an c4!)<n><n>I think this move would have been possible even sooner. But somehow I did not see it...
? Going to lose the exchange!
And the exchange is won
Nb5: Well if I have to move anyway, why not there?<n>Intending Nc7 and attacking the weak d6<n><n>However: e4 c2 and b2 are undefended at this moment.
I'm not able to grab the efile myself, well then let's block it. <n><n>However Nxg5 is worth consideration, freeing the king and f7 is history.
Although I could've been standing there with a +5 in material, I felt pretty confident. The Pawns on the 2nd rank would probably be easy to fetch and the 2 Bishops could be of devastating use. So at this point the game was imho practically won. <n>The e-file is blocked and so there is only one file left for white to use with his rook advantage, however that can be crumbled at any time by putting the bishop on g4 or by getting my rook on the 6th rank. However the game continued for a bit, and since I do not have a lot of experience with minor pieces endgames and since I suck at endgames anyway I decided to grab another pawn or two.
With the intention to additionally block b5 and to probably harass the rooks. Bb5 will totally dominate the f file. and I could play d3 ... Bd4+ and Nf7+ afterwards...
No need to hurry with the bishop... if he is planning to double i can still prevent it.
Chessmaster, feeling perhaps in an attacking mood, extends his bishop onto Black's half of the board.
Black prepares to fianchetto his bishop.
A good move by Chessmaster, as it increase the scope for his dark-squared bishop.
Black does the same for his light-squared bishop.
Chessmaster goes on the attack against Black's queen. Black can block with 7. ... f6, 7. ... Nf6 or 7. ... Bf6, or simply move the queen. However, White's bishop will then be too dominating.
A good move by White. Pressure is now starting to build up around the f6 square.
White's queen now has more opportunity to join in on the attack. Note that the g4 square is defended by Black's knight.
Chessmaster's pieces are now quite more active than his opponent's. Black should be aiming to castle kingside soon.
A quiet move. But now, if Black castles, he will lose his pawn on h6 and be under attack by White's queen. Black's king is running out of options for future safety. The kingside is very dangerous what with White's queen and the queenside is unlikely to provide major refuge from White's two knights and a bishop.
Black, perhaps preparing to move it to g7, moves his bishop back onto its starting square.
And now the position really starts to bust open. Queen and rook back up White's pawn on f4, and Black's king is indirectly stuck, while his queen is doing next to nothing.
Titans responds surprisingly, as if to electronically provoke his opponent. It's somewhat weak, though, as White can capture the pawn on e5 and after 14. ... fxe4 Black's king will be very exposed.
And now Black's in trouble. His bishop no longer defends d6 and White has capitalised on that. Black's response is actually forced.
White now clips a pawn and attacks the queen, but note that White's queen now attacks the pawn on c5, and capturing it will place Black's king in check. Black can't save the queen and defend the pawn at the same time.
Now it is Black's rook's turn to feel White's dominance. It can only safely move to b8.
Chessmaster now threatens to checkmate with 23. Qf7#. Unfortunately for Black, he must sacrifice a piece to get out of it.
Amazing. Chessmaster is seemingly giving away free pieces. Black could move his king to f6, but he wouldn't last long.
Black could move to f7, but that would leave him exposed to White delivering checkmate within a few moves using the bishop.
Bishop attacked
Open diagonal for queens bishop
Black has an exposed king
d6 can lead into many lines such as the Scheveningen,Acc Drag,Dragon,Najdorf(etc).
I was prepared to play the Open Sicilian.
with g6, Black aims to fianchetto his Bishop and then to castle king-side; setting up the main line of the Sicilian Dragon
Black Fianchetto's his Bishop very logically.
f3! A very common move in the Sicilian Dragon. f3 supports the e pawn which can come under massive threats in the next couple of moves, it also allows White the option of playing g4!? after he has developed his Queen to d2 and castled Queen-Side. The variation where g4!? is played is known as the "Yugoslav Attack" and I believe it is very effective for White.
In the Sicilian Dragon, White aims to attack on the King-Side whereas Black will always try to attack on the Queen-Side - This can lead to some very entertaining play and lots of games end in a quick finish. Bd7 portrays Black's ideas of attacking on the Queen-Side as it allows moves such as Rac8(etc).
White brings his A rook into the game by castling Queen-Side, now White will try to attack on the King-Side.
Rc8...The most theoreticalk move here, note that Black has chosen to not castle here as he is aware of my knowledge and understanding in the Yugoslav Attack Line.
I continue my attack on the King-Side!
instead of playing g5 which leads to Nh7 and my attack on the King-Side is thwarted, I chose to play the novelty of gxh5! Not only does this open up my position slightly but it leaves my opponent bewildered. Goldaxe2006 knows lots of Theory on this line so this novelty left him wondering what to do.
Rg1, in my view is a strong,logical move as it prevents dangerous advances of the f-pawn at a later stage.
Black immediately attacks on the Queen-Side, typical of Black in the Sicilian Dragon.
Nb3 immediately questions the motives of the Queen on a5! A good move, the only draw-back here is perhaps that now the c3 Knight is open to some strange and timely sacrifices.
The best Queen for the square, if the Queen were to retreat to d8, I would have just won a couple of free moves and the short expeditions of the Queen would have been quite pointless.
Nd5! I like this move because it averts potential sacrifices on the c3 square by black, it also tries to cramp up Black's position and forces Black's Queen onto a square which is not in the game.
Black's Queen retreats to b8, as you can see it is not doing anything at all on this square.
Black tries to gain some counter-play by offering the exchange.
In exchanging the pieces, I believed that my position was a little superior to my opponent's.
I chose to play Kb1 to avoid potential threats of the Black Bishop coming to h6 if a few pieces are swapped off, so eventually my Queen could have been pinned to the king or some pieces would have been in some very awkward positions.
Black chooses to bring his in-active Knight into the game...a very logical move on Black's part.
I choose to exchange...quite logically.
Black has to take.
forcing the exchange of Queens.
Nd4! Centralising the Knight is very good from White I do believe, as it cannot be hacked off of this strong square by the Black Bishop or by a pawn.
Black chooses to bring his King closer to the centre.
I did not want to lose the power of my centralised Knight here, so I decided to bring my Rook back to d5, on d5 it is still on a very commanding square.
Black now has the option of Ba4 but after Rd3, White has a better position and is threatening to reak havoc on Black's Position.
Black chooses to try to do something with his Rook, perhaps aiming to bring it to the h-file where it is more commanding.
Ra5! Threatening the Pawn and preventing potential threats of the Bishop coming to a4.
Aiming to exchange Black's most active Rook.
Rh8! Is a good move from Black, it aims to bring the black Rook into the game, despite his efforts...their is not much Black can hope for here(other than a draw).
b3, halting Black's hopes along the 1st and 2nd ranks.
a3! Taking the oppurtunity to advance on the Queen-side.
Here we go again...Black is totally dumbfounded here, he has been forced into making passive moves. A draw is virtually guaranteed here! So I can afford to play on for a few moves in order to see if I can win.
The Bishop moves ONCE again. Notice that Black has done absolutely NOTHING to improve his position in the last couple of moves - allowing White to further his plans.
c6! Forcing the exchange of some pieces and some pawns.
The Bishop takes, forcing the Knight to exchange it!
The Pawn HAS to recapture...obviously.
Rb1.. a passive move...forcing me to swap off the a pawn for the c pawn! This is quite good for me though as a Rook on the c-file cuts the King off from getting to the passed B Pawn! White's chances of winning look very good now!
Kd4! Perhaps the winning move...Bringing the King into the game aids the chances of the B Pawn promoting.
If the Rooks are exchanged, Black loses on the spot, White will eventually manage to Queen one of his pawns.
This move wins on the spot, the King can't come to d6 because the f pawn dies. If black moves the King out of the way, the B Pawn is going to advance very easily.
b5.......Black resigns now, the b pawn is going to promote and force Black to give up his Rook and White will be able to win easily.<n><n>All in all, White's 2 King-Side pawns managed to contain Black's doubled f pawns and his g-pawn while my Queen-Side pawns were allowed to promote. A very well played game by White!
So, heres an exciting game which i played against campeon. White wins blacks queen at the beginning , and soon after sacs a piece for a fierce attack on black. This is how it went down. I start with my usual d4.
I decided to jump on the fact that black is not trying to control the center.
This move allows white to gain a tempo and gain major control over the center
With this move i wanted to secure my tempo gain with the knight, by avoiding the pin
This move comes with a thread my opponet failed to reckon
The queen is pinned to the king
Preparing to sac on h6
Blacks king side is torn apart and white is readh bring reinforcements in to the attack
Threatening rg4+ with mate to follow
I thought about saccing the exchange instantly but decided to virtually pinn blacks lsb
Only move really because after nxg4 blacks lsb is unpinned and free to grab the rook
This was made to leave the "c" pawn free to advance.
I considered that in order to take some advantage of my superior developement it was a nice idea to... spend a pawn's move in order to "squeeze" white's position a little.
It would be difficult for white to create a battery of Q and B against h7. Now I considered b5, in order to further block white's pieces developement, but then white would have had some countergame with a4. Better to concentrate in keeping ahead in developement.
I don't want the white's dsb to set on f4.
My battery is armed. It's not a very whorty one, but with the bishop and the kinght, conditions for attack are given.
The normal attack was Ng4, hitting h2... but after h3, it goes nowhere. Instead, if I would have castled queenside, after h3 I can confidently play the sac h5!, and if hxN, hxg would have recovered the piece and played a risky but strong attack. Now, I realize that the only way to disrupt white's fortress is to throw in some pawns... uncovering my king. But no way: I cannot play without looking for an attack. And this move covers g5, which is good anyway.
...but remember: avoid to exchange piece when you have superior developement, or you'll easily lose it. This way, white owns a very nice diagonal, and supports the lethal d5. I had to act quickly, or the game will return to be even. So I dared, pretty irresponsibly...
If d5, fxB, dxB, exNf3, exNd7, Bxh2+, and black has a winning attack. But I overlooked the simple 14. Bxb2!, QxB, RxBe6 (who has became undefended when the f pawn was moved!). Instead, the more normal and calm Nf6 leads to 14. d5, Bd7. White has blocked his good white diagonal, and he has to retire or exchange his lsb. It was not a bad result for me. So I played with enthusiasm more than calculation, and this is a very common mistake at chess.
White chooses to retire. Probably he is happy having my own f pawn blocking my lsb's action. And, of course, I have to take care of my lsb, but this is not a problem:
Now it's me who is mastering the good white diagonal. I threat inmediately BxN, and then Bxh2+. Not a big deal, but still something white has to care for.
Ha ha, this was the very elegant way white defended: just moving the attacked pawn. Very, very smart. I can lose the bishop's pair, give my check and... nothing. I have to be tricky.
I choosed the wrong way, but as I said: all my game was based on a quick attack, so I went for it. My own pieces, although well placed, are impotent without a pawn's break. And I have to count on a tempo loss to place the rook behind it, as it should... and, finally, for beginners: this move opens the way for the white Queen to h5. And the white knight can go to e5, because if I exchange it, I cannot retake the white pawn in e5 because I have to spend a tempo defending the bishop.
Trying to surprise my opponent, depriving him of a place in g6, and defending h6 after the queens goes to h5.
White uses his advantage and returns me with the same coin. Now I'm not sure it is convenient for me to open the files, since my rook cannot move to the right place (g7) and I cannot exchange. I realized by now how different would have been my position having castled queenside - true is that probably white's moves would have been others.
It's useless to try to keep the advantage of a bishop's pair. At least, I can have white exchanging the strong knight....
Here, it is very depressing to try to decide if it is better to take with the rook or the king. It's just choosing the best way to lose.
Even more sadistic :-D Beginners, learn how to attack... in a sadistic way. I hoped for Re3?, f4, but of course such things happen only in dreams.
Ah ha! My knight can move, and he does a wonderful job defending, even if never for an attack.
I feared g6, NxR, gxR+, Kxg7, Qh5, a sure mate net, with those nasty bishop aiming to my kingside. But my problems are still to come, of course.
So I sat the only threat I could, just for bringing my rook into the game to help, trying to exchange as much as possible.
The bishop is no longer useful on g3, so better to exchange it. I know that the f pawn is a goner, but I couldn't allow the white's lsb to look undisturbed to h7.
I even have a shadow of a check in e3! Oh! :-). To be truthful, I was looking for Rh7, and after the exchanges take the h6 pawn. But this leaves me against two joined pawns for an endgame, so even if I survive the storm, I'm doomed.
Is was a mistake, but it was hard to see compensation in Qe7. It was in the fact that white has, as a minimum Qd5+, and if black covers the check with the rook, to avoid a subsequent BxRh7+, now, in h6, the queen doesn't help to the defence of f7, as it does in e7. so QxR becomes possible for white. So this was a mistake.
White found the right way to had the most of the situation. In any case, BxR will win the piece and the game.
The "residual tactic" is now that the king is forced to let undefended his rook.
and so i take back. in another game here i tried more development before recapturing like nc6. it lead to a tangled fight and took a while to get back the material and that game isnt over heading into 40ish moves i believe.<n><n>i also tried leaving the opponent the pawn edge playing d6 in another game to induce fxd6 to reply Bxf6 but that also lead to a tangled game,<n><n>and so this third game is why i go with the immediate retake,
i decide to clear the way for an early castle.
offer a pawn exchange and the c file would become a nice file for my DSB was my thought behind this move. i was also going to push queen side. i didnt think he would push by putting 2 pawns in front of his LSB's diagonal. but i may be wrong
i didnt like this pressure, i also didnt want to play f7,  maybe d6 was a good move. or developing my B knight,<n><n>but i felt like exploring a new line see if i can come out on top with a knight sacrifice.  <n><n>so i devised my plan from here. ill be able to take out his C B and A pawns at the cost of my knight and c pawns. and my objective will be to simplify out the remaining LSB connect my rooks behind my B and A pawns and have a pressure fight with 2 passed pawns.<n><n>lets see if things go according to plan
keep eating the pawns.  i was hoping he would recapture here with the A pawn and i could take with my DSB and thought he would offer DSB exchanges to block the check
hmm unanticipated. puts alot of presure on the king.  but looking at the scenario i feel i can defend it at the cost of a pawn if he decides to launch his attack. but i have to look to castle ASAP now, im happy the way is clear.
so after feeling comfortable being able to defend atleast 1 turn before castling and i complete the plan to take all the queen side pawns off the board
anticipated reply. now i liked this position would make it easier to simplify out the bishops and head to the position i had planned before my knight sacrifice.
hmm brings in his knight closer. i decide i dont have to move my pawns yet
the board currently finds itself in this state... updated for completion purposes the early part was more important to analyse especially since it was potentially very blunderous to sacrifice the knight.... hmmmm opponent decides to resign. i dont know if it was premature i wouldve loved to play it out.
If I was willing to surrender the diagonal, Bxc6 would certainly mess with black's queenside fianchetto.
This is a bit of a gamble as it uses time, but using time allows white to examine the black pawn structure before permanently setting his own.
6.e3 wastes more time, but black is not taking advantage of the opportunity to develop.
I really have broken most of Kosten's rules of thumb from Dynamic English.  He recommends playing e4 only after Black commits to e5, but the white formation is one that English players are often familiar with and rely on.  I believe the my experience with the position will pay off.
Probably an error as 10.f4 would likely lead to an exchange of knights that gives back time I have wasted over the next few moves.  Here the knights exchange.
And White is faced with a choice.  Nd5 or Ne2.  Nd5 is routinely played, but it results in trading the knight for black's blockaded bishop.  The center is firmly locked down which allows a kingside assault in certain circumstances.
Black sould probably deploy his knight and use the waiting move to determine if this really is the best position for the bishop.
Threaten an exchange and introduce a new defender.  Holding, but weakly.
I have to be careful about the e pawn because of the pin.
Not ideal, but I underestimated his capability to undermine the f pawn.
I was expecting black to play some preparation, but black decides to cement his hold on the pawn.
A touch surprising.  The queen exchange is not unfavorable and disallows Qxf7.
Now he must take or face the fall of the f pawn.  Given the diminished power of his attack, nothing now discourages the white attack on f7.
Even though I am down on material this suddenly feels more winning.  When I see an oppenent play the same move, a part of me always thinks he could find no improvement and is willing to settle for a draw.
The h pawn is ultimately, now or later, lost.  This only exchanges pawns on an ending that does not clearly favor black.  Better is a5.  I think that over the last several moves black has failed to improve his position.  His king is very nearly trapped, and the bishop controls as few squares as possible.  The rook, tied to the h pawn defense, does not exert influence.
If Kxh5, then Rg3 and suddenly black's game has life.
Black cannot prevent the e pawn from falling.
Well, it had merit for reasons beyond the previous analysis!  If only I had played it earlier, but here it allows the black bishop to be attacked while providing a worst-case exchange on the troublesome d pawn.
The only trick is to avoid losing the rook or bishop after 54...d3.
I played as Black in this unrated game against one of my teammates whom I found to be a strong 1700  player.  In the game, Black plays an interesting 9th move which defines a good portion of the game.  Late in the game, Black blunders away a winning position and with a second blunder loses the chance to draw.  The credit really goes to White though who played a nearly flawless game.
A nice move adding a defender to the knight and attacking h7
f5!? This, to me, is one of the defining moves of the game, intended to shut down the attack along the b1-h7 diagonal.  Yet, as my opponent pointed out to me after the game, g6 was probably objectively better as this weakens the a2-g8 diagonal which becomes a thorn in my side.
Breaking the pin on the c3 knight and forcing Black to decide whether to make the exchange there or not.
Getting wood off the back row needs to be Black's priority at this point, and this also attacks the c3 pawn.
Defending the pawn and getting the bishop on the long diagonal where it will eventually exert more influence
Here I made the decision to try to get my bishops to optimum locations as I thought the diagonals would probably be what would win or lose the game from this point.<n>Ideally, I would like to blockade the passed pawn with my dark squared bishop on d6 and get my light squared bishop to b5.
Trying to open up some room for my pieces and create counter-play on the queen side.  Gaining tempo by attacking the bishops was in my mind.
This is the diagonal I had planned for my light squared bishop back on move 17 as it keeps the white king locked up and can become dangerous to White's rooks.
9 ... f5 comes back to haunt Black now as the pawn advances with check, forcing the black king far out of the action
Forcing the Rook exchange because of the threat of Rc2
This gets the light squared bishop back onto its best diagonal.  White correctly declines the temptation to initiate the rook exchange and keep his passed pawn with a dark queening square (opposite of Black's bishop), as the succeeding threats of a back row mate would cause White much trouble and probably loss of material.
Trying to get that Black king into the game before it is too late
The rook does not seem to have many present opportunities to exert influence even on the a file, so zigzagging to e8-e7-d7 seems to be its best choice.
This looks to be a wasted move.  Breaking up the king side for the Black king to invade with gxh4 looks better
Black is now set up to break the king through and have queening threats on both sides of the board.  This looks like a winning position here.
??? Black blunders into the trap and hurts his position badly, much better was Rd7.
And the Black king is reduced to tears of frustration as it can now be of no real use
White offered a draw here and I declined, feeling Black still had enough play to win.
And the end to a great game and nice win by brmichael.<n>Please leave comments and star rating. <n>I will try to answer any questions and alert you by message after doing so.<n>Same with comments if it is warranted.
In a game were I was trying to regain some rating points after some time-outs. I wanted to play Roy Lopez because I enjoy using classic Bishop sacrifice on h3 or the Berlin Defence
Now my gut was 4... Nxd4 5. Qxd4 but I thought realised that Bc5 would put me ahead in development and also kept his Knight into Nd4 because of a Qf6 or Qh4 mating threat.
Takes away the mating threat and protects the knight. I had never planned on making a serious mating threat on f2 but a mating threat no matter how simple must always have a plan to take care of it.
This was to add another attacker of the d4 square and make black think about the mating threat
Allows me to castle
I liked this move because it meant the bishop was under attack and meant the knight could attack from d4 at a later date when it was free from the bishops wrath. However this was the third time this knight moved in 9 moves and if not for the Bishop v Bishop I would have Been able to have castled and been up two tempos. However O-O was probably a weak mvoe as If the knight was sacrificed then my king is opened up.
Means That white has to double pawns or lose a pawn because of the combo In the annotation above
I decide to keep my bishop alive
Wants to trade Queens which is interesting because of 14... Qxf3 15.Nxf3 Bxe4 makes knight stay at f3 or move to h4 which means it is on a weak square to protect the pawn on b2 or risk going down by 5 points.Also if he plays 15.gxf3 forced him to castle queen because of half-open b-file. Although there is nothing wrong with castling Queen side because it controls the half open d file
I castled king side hoping to attack the e-pawn with f5 in a few moves time and so Half open the f-file for my Rook and with No light squared bishop it means my king will still be safe.
Looking to attack both rooks with 17... Ne5 and 18... Bxf3
Prevents 18... Nd3+ forking King and rook
I was looking to get rid of as many white pawns as possible considering I was already two pawns up with 4 on 3+ a king on the queenside side and 3 on 1 on the King side. The only weak link was the e-pawn.
If I trade Knights My pawn advantage should get me home
I was quite happy to trade rooks but didn't want to lose a pawn for nothing
Now I can gain the h-pawn for the lose of the f-pawn
My opponent obviously didn't want to give up a pawn but this meant I could trap his king
I was happy with this as he was also playing apart in trapping his king
Trading rooks meant I was a certainty to win
If he captured my c pawn I would re-capture it and then complete my pawn storm
Know this move I believed before this annotation won me the game because it kept his rook away from my pawn long enough to move it one square away from queening. If I waited for my king to arrive I thought his king could have come to the rescue but what would have happened was  43... Kg5 44. Kc2 Kg4 45.Kd2 Kf3 46. Ke1 g2
The writing if not already on the wall is now on there in size 144 font, red, bold and underlined
White's idea is to defend his bishop and exert even more control of the center.
Looking to pin the bishop on the advance of the c-pawn.
Giving an outlet for the King.
Breaking the pin on the Bishop.
Preventing the N from jumping into the position.  If the position is stable, Black is a piece ahead.

Sealing the Q in and threatening to fork the Rs.
Exploiting the pin on the N.
The balance on the board is restored
White takes the d pawn. I could have taken White's knight in the centre of the board but decided against it because then the his queen would be in the centre of the board white no obvious way to attack it as most of my pieces were still firmly hemmed in. However, the decision of not taking the knight off means that I should be prepared for doubled up pawns (Am I the only one who hates doubled up pawns?)
Black retakes his knight. I was not keen on using the d pawn as White would be more than happy to exchange queens, whereby my king would loose the right to castle
White prepares to castle (or for any subsequent attack on my king after it has castled king side. I want to restore my pawn structure...
Double attack on his bishop and his e pawn. I gain a tempo in development
White decided to retreat to enforced my double up pawn. The best move I thought was to prepare to castle by moving my dark square bishop to e7, but then I would still be on step behind in development to white. Seeing that all of his queen side was still full, I decided to fix the White king in the middle of the board for now.
The sole idea is to keep white from castling to allow up a better game through superior and faster development. In my mind, this move was the key in winning the game, even if in the middle of the action, I was very worried about putting my bishop unprotected
In my mind, this is a useless move as my next move was Be7 anyway, to prepared to castle. The only rationale I saw was: 1)that White had given up trying to castle king side and wanted to castle queen side instead and 2) preparing to take my d5 pawn off (attacked 3 times, defended 3 times), so by taking the knight out, he'd be a pawn ahead
I gain an extra tempo and free up the pin with this move. I am resigned to losing my d5 pawn... My only consolation would be still having my 2 bishops
White did not White take the pawn? Was he worried about his king being still in the centre? If he is, why is 1) destroying his pawn structure queen side and 2) depriving his knight of the better c3 position?
Now let's pin the pawn to the king. I liked the pin because there was no obvious way to break it immediately (unless he puts the queen as a buffer)
White is still fight for centre control. But now, his bishop is cut off the right hand side of the board (for now) I thought he was preparing castle and increase pressure by moving one of his rooks over at some point
Since I wanted to hang on to my pawn, I decided to take the knight out of the game
White cut my light squared bishop from the other side of the board
I respond in kind. This move also allows my to move my light squared bishop to the a8-h1 diagonale to provide extra support to my e pawn and an x-ray attack on the White rook in h1
White releases the the knight pin. I must take the knight, as soon my e pawn would be overwhelmed. Plus my queen is right underneath and is too sensitive to fight along an open file. Notice that now White's king and queen are lined up in a diagonale and I still had my light squared bishop
To protect my pawn, the knight had to go. I do not like trading a bishop for a knight, but the end justified the means
The temptation was too great, and White had to attack my queen
The Queen had to move and still provide support to my e pawn. My e pawn was safe for now (attacked by a queen and protected by a rook) but just in case, I wanted to keep my queen near by
White is on the march to reclaim his lost pawn. I personally do not like having my rook wandering unaccompanied around the board. They are so clunky and work best as rear protectors in the middle game and battle tanks in the end game. But that's just me. Anyhow, White has a good unprotectable attack on my c5 pawn and subsequent pressure on c7 pawn
Now, I was eying one of two things, either taking the unprotected h1 rook off by moving the e pawn up, or better yet, catching the White queen in the same diagonal as the king. White may think I was desperate to attack anything, but I was not, I just wanted to make sure that he does carry out his thread of Rxc5
He wanted to and had to
Now, I can have me a whole rook at the very least. I am attacking the rook on h1, the pawn on f1 with a threat of queening early in the game and to top it off, he controlled the e4 square 3 times
White is preparing to attacking my queen by f1-f2. Not a good move, the rook is much better off in an open or semi-open file
No rook meant I was free to use the e4 square to pin White's queen to the king. The game was half won
My bishop is off the board and White has finally an open diagonal to my king, with check. But I have a passed pawn...
I could not forget that my queen was under attack, I attack the f1 rook which it was best to move
This is a very bad move from me. I normally would not do this because of the weak squares f6 and h6. But I reasoned that White's dark squared bishop and queen were off the board, so having my king able to run to the g7 (a dark square) when attacked, would be a good thing
Excellent move from White He attacks my rook and prepares an attack on my passed pawn
When you are up, you tend to overlook things. This was a terrible move, I had overlooked the attack on my rook and was just preparing to pick off White's king side pawns
White obviously overlooked the rook attack as well. Uh, the rook must move
Another terrible move from me, I had the opportunity to threaten mate by Rab8, instead I came back to my original idea a few moves back to control the d file, I was happy to give up pawns because I was so far ahead
I read on a chess forum that one should always address all threats. But here, I had caught up to the checkmate potential on b2 and was happy to give up both rook and pawn
An excellent move. A fork on my king and e8 rook
I did not want to put myself in the corner where the king's movements would be severely restricted
White now has a mate plan. Rf7+ Ke8, Rxe4+ would eventually lead to White's win. That's why I did not fork White's rooks by Qxg3. My king could take care of it self if I protect my f. valuable e pawn
As expected. The king's only move is Ke8, Kg7 would lead to a deadly discovered attack
Excellent move from White who has not given up the fight. Going for an attack on my g6 pawn and a threat of check by Bf7+
I had to go for forcing a fork of the king and rook on f6
White has the option of recapturing right away (3. Qxd4), developing with 3. Nf3 and daring white to try to hold onto the pawn with 3. ...e5 (as in this game), or going into the Smith-Morra gambit proper (3. c3), which looks a lot like the danish gambit (for those familiar with 1. e4 e5 2. d4!? exd4 3. c3).
Black decides against e5, and gives me the option to turn this into a standard sicilian game with 4. Nxd4.
...but how boring would that be?  4. c3!? isn't the soundest gambit, to be sure, since it appears white is offering a pawn for just one tempo, but if I can develop quickly and efficiently, maybe I can turn this into an effective attack.  (That's the goal, anyway!)
I approve of this move, since allowing 5. cxd4 allows white to hit back in the center and regain his pawn -- this is black's best shot for an edge.
Castling seems like a normal developing move here.  Now, I'm still willing to allow cxb2, because my bishop will become very powerful on that long diagonal, especially if black plays Bc5 or the like, which e6 seemed to prepare.
Then I'm going to keep developing pieces!  My goal is to use my edge in development and slight space advantage to launch an attack down the open c- and half-open d-files.
Of course, this is going to require a balance of defending as well, as black is not without his own resources.
Black may not like the looks of my bishop on c4, and I don't like the looks of his on c5.  This move prepares to knock the Bc5 into the corner.
?!  Now, this move is perfectly fine, and even makes it into the gameknot game DB (with a win for white), but it is not a good move here.  Why?  First, it prevents the bishop from retreating to e7.  Second, the new moves it allows, Bd7 and Qd7, are not moves black is going to make!  Nge7 was my preferred move here, as if I were black, I'd want to neutralize white's developmental edge as soon as possible!
Forcing the bishop to a7, as Bb6 would block the b-pawn, hampering the light-squared bishop, and allow further harassment by either a5-a6 or Na5, or even a future Nd5.
Bf4 is probably going to be preferred by many of you reading this, but what I was thinking is that it was going to be most beneficial to provoke weaknesses in black's kingside, since that's clearly where he's going to castle.
This is probably the best and safest move, as Nf6 would leave black exposed to a dangerous future e5 thrust, and f6 weakens the light squares around black's king.
Putting a rook on this open file can't be a bad idea, can it?  As it turns out, this move never does much, but I was happy to develop this piece to a good square for now.
Totally consistent.  Black is nearly caught up in development, and I can see that after b5 and Bb7, he'll have his development nearly completed, and all I'll have to show for my pawn is a space advantage.  At this point, I realized I was going to have to turn up the pressure if I wanted to get a (hopefully winning) attack going!
Preparing to give the black queen some uncomfortable opposition with Rfd1!
And of course I'm going to keep the 2nd rank free for the heavy pieces to maneuver.
Nonetheless, let's go ahead and continue with loading up on the open and half-open files, and see if an attack develops!
And this is where I come up with a plan on how to break through -- build an Alekhine's gun on the d-file!  Get an Rd3, Rd2, and Qd1, and just ram it down black's throat!  Is this a good, sound plan?  I'm not sure, even now.  But I'm better developed and more maneuverable, and it's better to have a speculative plan than no plan at all!
In hindsight, the Rc1 move earlier did keep the black queen off of c7, so maybe it did serve a purpose.  Still, had I known, I could've achieved this configuration a move earlier.  It's silly to harp on it now, but the reason I'm critical of it is that when you're ahead in development, you want to make every move count!  If black catches up in development, then I've got nothing to show for the pawn.  At least I have more space.
...I see he's not going to give me the pawn back so freely and easily.
Of course, now he sees I'm planning Qd1, and does he have a good way to defend the pawn a third time?
I guess not.  So, when I first saw this move, I said "ooh, free rook!"  And then I said, no, no, look, if you play 18. Bxd8, he plays Nf4, and then what?  Well, it looks like the complications favor white after 18. Bxd8 Nf4 19. Qd1 Nxd3 20. Rxd3, but I thought I could get a better position by reducing the effectiveness of a possible Nf4.
Of course, black's not going to let me get a free rook out of it!
This is the best square I could find, although Bh5 may not have been awful either.  Still, exchanging the dark-squared bishops aren't so important when I'm going to be able to get away with Rxd6 shortly.
A tough move to find, but much better than Rxe3, which disrupts the gun and doesn't prevent Nf4 like the text does.  I'm not worried about the isolated, doubled pawns, because I'm counting on having a successful attack!<n><n>So now the lines are drawn; I'm going to try to blow open the center and win material, while black's going to defend and try to make it to a won endgame.
There's a lot to consider here, but this move forces the action.  If I can't do something positive, I'm just going to wind up in an endgame down a pawn.
An interesting try!  This threatens Nxe3, but also threatens the cheap Qxh2 if the Rd6 and Nf3 both move!
Forcing black to recapture with the knight, giving me uncontested ownership of the d-file.
The best way to defend e3 and still maintain all of my influence down the d-file.
Increasing the queen's scope and freeing the rook, this maintains the threat on h2 if the knight on f3 moves.
...and I finally can't stand it any more, and I expel the knight.
Black doesn't want me to make his pawn structure suffer the same fate as mine after 24. ...Ne5 25. Nxe5 fxe5, so he retreats to h6.  Note that in some variations, black can avoid a back-rank mate with Ng8 now.
Forcing the queen to move.
This excellent move forces white to commit to sacrificing the rook for knight and pawn at most.  So, I decide to choose the path which gives me the most activity for it!
And this is as planned.  Now, I was hoping for Qxe3  here, which looks good for black, but after, say, 30. Kh1 Qxc3, 31. Qf8 is checkmate!  So, there's a lot going on in this position, despite the exchange of some pieces.
This is a nice in-between move, as it forces the queen to move before I play Qxe6.
I don't know whether to hope for Bxd5 or not!  While exchanges will help black in an endgame, I'm not sure he wants to grant me a passed pawn on d5, especially with his king all the way in the corner.
The sad reality here -- there's nothing I can do to force the queens to stay on the board.  Absolutely nothing.  The best I can do is put my pieces in a more aggressive position if he does exchange.
?  Black doesn't want the exchange?  I realize there are a lot of complications here, but after Qxe6 33. Nxe6, I don't really have a great feeling about my endgame chances with two knights vs. rook and bishop.  The c-file is a nice place for the rook to roost, but I see now that a knight on e7 would be pretty for me!
Smart man... to say no to that.  But now my position has become very threatening, and my knights are getting closer and closer to his boxed in king!
Black is just repeating moves, and with good reason (Qxg7 was threatening mate)!  I'm going to try and go in for the kill!
Very smart.  Forks the knight and bishop, but also threatens Nf7 checkmate!  Black must play Rf8 to save the rook and avoid checkmate, hanging the bishop.  Even so, the ensuing endgame of rook vs. two knights and an extra pawn doesn't leave black with much hope.
The title of the game  "Who needs a queen" .  I was not sure who was going to lose a queen but I would soon find out. <n><n>White opened with Kings pawn to e4.
I decided to play using the Dutch defence.  I was intending to move my g knight out to f6.
I took the queen with my g pawn.  Now I found out who was going to lose their queen.  However this has given me doubled pawns on my h file which obviously means I cannot safely cast on the king side.  I don't think I would have chosen to take the queen in this position but if I get a chance to take a queen then I would mostly likely do so.
Now white takes the pawn I was offering at the start which provides a place for my knight to reside and stops the pawns advance.
White develops his knight to f3 and prepares to castle.
I move my pawn to d6 and this allows my LB to be pointed at white's pawn on f5 and stops f3 knight from moving onto e5.
White castles.  White looks likely to move his rook onto the e file which only has my undeveloped e7 pawn and the king still on his spot.
I continue to add to my pawn chain with the move c5.  I wonder if e5 would have been a better move as it would stop white from using the e6 square to place his pieces and limit my scope for attack.
White develops his b knight to c3.  White's bishop is looking happy with itself as it is currently at d3 and has access to 2 diagonals to a6 and h7.
For some reason I now decide to capture the pawn at f5 and in consequence lose my LB to white.
I move my rook out to the half open g file as my doubled pawns are both protected by the knight at f6.
White moves his d pawn to d3 to allow his DB access to the diagonal to h6.
I develop my b knight to c6 trying to get my pieces out on the queen side so I can long castle.
Now that pesky LB moves to the spot which I in future will try to fill with my own pieces before my opponent gets in them.  He is now pointed at my rook on g8.
So I bring my rook out to g7 as there is nothing for me to attack at present and white has some squares on the g file protected.
White pushes the h pawn out to h3.  This stops my f knight from landing on g4 plus the e6 bishop is also protecting this square.
I push my d pawn out to d5 this is protected by f6 knight and the queen.  It is threatening to move up to d4 and attack the c3 knight.  The pawn also hems in the LB on e6 on one diagonal.
The white rook is moved across to e1 to take control of this file and protect the LB.  The king is still on his spot.
Now I push my d pawn and threaten to capture the d3 knight although I am in the reach of the f3 knight.  I have 2 protectors in the c5 pawn and the c6 knight.
The knight retreats back to e2.  This was probably a good time for me to bring out my queen but I think I was worried about the LB at e6.
I decide to move my c3 knight into an area where it can cause a bit of concern to white.
White's LB also decides to move to b3 to protect pawns that are in the firing line.  I see that was one way of removing the pesky LB.  I should now try to fill that hole.
I now bring my queen out to allow me to long castle.    My queen is protecting 4 pieces in the position she has come out to and has a diagonal which she can control.
I castle.  Great at last its done my king is safe well just peaking out a little bit.  I still have my DB blocked in at f8 so I need to move that pawn at e7 soon as I need to double up my rooks.
Oh no now I have white's knight on the e6 square which I wanted to make sure my opponent could not use.  The knight is threatening to capture my rook or my LB but I am unable to take with my queen as the rook at e1 is waiting to pick up the queen.  The rook has the king and queen to protect it but the DB has no protection.
So back comes my knight to d5 which was not really doing anything at b4 so now it is paired up with the knight at f6 and they can see off any attacks on either of them.
I decide to move my rook back to g8 to allow my DB to be developed and as this is my only bishop I do not wish to trade it off with the DB lurking at g5.
Knight takes my rook and queen retakes the knight.  I am not sure I wanted my queen on the back row again but I did not want to take with my king as this would make him more exposed.
White moves his rook up to e5 and I have nothing to defend this move.  No doubt he will move his 'a' rook and double up his rooks on the e file.  I now see that without my queen at d6 this move was on the cards.  So I should have taken with my king instead.
And as expected 'a' rook moves along to e1 and it looks like white is getting ready for a battle.  I thought I had a good defence on this file as I have a pawn at e7 which is protected by d5 knight and the queen and DB.  Maybe I was putting too much weight on my pawn's shoulders.
Now I also bring in my rook to g7 so now 4 defenders of this pawn as I saw it.  But of course this may not have been the object of white's threat.
And the LB slips in from b3 and takes my d5 knight.  One of my defenders gone.
Rook captures my knight at d5 now attacking the square next to my king d8 with the queen protecting this.  There is a pawn in front of my king at b5 which may be useful square to take.
I move my queen to b6 defending the pawn at c5 and the 6th file plus d8 square should the rook decide to take that square on but unlikely.  Apart from 1 pawn at h5 my pieces are all working together.
Now the rook at e1 comes down to e5 and joins his pal on d5.   Nothing to defend this move with.
I now decide to move my rook to f7 protecting my bishop and still protecting the pawns on e7 and h7.  The rook was threatening the DB at g5 but this was protected by the f3 knight so I don't feel that moving the rook made a lot of difference here.
D rook moves to take pawn at c5 but I did not want to risk my queen as e5 rook would have taken and it would still have been check.
So king moves to d7 to unpin the queen and avoid getting stick at the back.
C rook moves to a5 ready to take a7 pawn which will put king in check.
King moves up to d6 threatening to take d5 rook if a5 rook moves off 5th row.
DB moves to d2 in order to access king from the queen side of the board as the e rook is blocking access to the king.
I move pawn to e6 leaving my rook to protect the a7 pawn if taken by a rook I will take back.
King retreats to e8 to take cover behind pawn at e5 and with bishop alongside at f8.
E rook moves to e6 and takes pawn and checks king.
And of course DB comes in to save day and pinches my DB but I will have revenge.
I take DB with my f rook.  Now its just me and my rook against him and his 2 rooks.
E rook moved to b7 getting further away from the king so I didn't interfere with the play.
My king was only able to move along the row so I moved my c pawn waiting for the inevitable checkmate. <n><n> (In this game I think I got to put up a bit of a fight compared to my last game with easy19 but I should have as I did have a queen and he didn't.  <n><n>1) Try not to create an outpost for your opponent to put their pieces.<n>2) I think I missed a chance on move 15.  Instead of castling I should have moved my b knight to d5 ready to take on the knight and there would have been a bit of a fight.  The only thing is then my king would have been in the middle. )
I try taking the pawn, even though I think in retrospect it is not such a good move.
Black regains the piece.
A blunder. By exchanging knights and bishops, white would have left black with a terrible pawn structure. How is it possible to make an error like this one? Of course, white obviously played too fast. But another explanation can be this: it is very easy to overlook a threat when it is not directly a consequence of the piece actually played. Black played his bishop on move 7. The bishop does not threaten anything. So it is quite possible when one plays fast to overlook that the black knight on c6 is now unpinned, and can now take the white knight. One must always try to consider not just the piece that has moved, but also how this movement affects the dynamics of the other pieces on the board.
Trying to protect the pawn and leaving the king in the centre would be dangerous. With the piece won, black can afford to let the pawn go.
I had a little trap prepared (winning a pawn) if white played pxp here. See if you can find it. The solution at the end of the game.
Why this move? It develops a piece. But the real reason is that the rook is now on the same column as the white queen! While this may seem a bit wild for a reason (there are now 4 pieces between the rook and the queen), it is surprising how fast sometimes pieces can get out of the way and all of a sudden, the rook can take the queen!!
Rxe5 would be met by Qxf2  followed by Bc6 and the mate threat by the bishop(!) or the queen
So now the smoke has cleared and the white's sacrifice on move 15 resulted in losing the exchange. But with a piece behind it was worth trying.
Black can try this because of white's weak first rank (the rook can not leave because of mate).
And this does not help either. f4 was the lesser evil.
The solution to the problem on move 12: <n>Black exchanges bishops first, then takes the pawn on d3 with the knight.<n>The queen can not take the knight because of Bh2  winning the queen.
As you will also peer on throughout the game, we have been picking up several messages from the Chess Mailroom about which piece is better, Bishops or Knights. After many nights of disastrous fighting, the answer has sneakily turned up in this game, but please don't comment or give the answer away now, otherwise...
Gold starts with the Sicilian Defence. This defence gives best results for Black but if Fevil plays properly, then he stands a chance. <n><n>Personally, nowadays I do not usually play 1. ... e5 as after 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4!? leaves me in confusion facing the Scotch Opening (as you will see on the next slide and on my annotation after my next annotation, 'The Brick Wall'). The only correct move would've been 3. ... exd4 but after 4. c3 things get awkward. <n><n>Opening with 1. c5 can get Black several options to attack and counterattack.
!? Fevil plays a Gambit for control in the centre. Most juniors might think: "How absurd for a grandmaster," since after 2. ... cxd4 3. Qxd4 White gets an early queen, that can be easily chased away with such things like 3. ... Nf6! etc. <n><n>The reason is, after 2. ... cxd4 White follows with 3. c3! and as I said, things get in a muddle then. A national game went: 1. e4 c5 2. d4!? cxd4?! 3. c3! dxc3!? 4. Bc4 cxb2? 5. Bxb2 5 ... e5 6. Bxf7+! Kxf7 7. Nf3 Nc6?? 8. Ng5+ Ke8 9. Nc3 Bb4 10. Qb3 Bxc3+!? 11. Bxc3 d5!? 12. exd5 Nf6 13. O-O Nxd5 14. Bxe5!? Nxe5? 15. Rfe1! Qxg5 16. Qxd5 Bf5?? 17. Rxe5+! Kf8 18. Rxf5+! Qxf5 19. Qxf5+! Ke8 20. Re1+ Kd8 21. Qf7!! Rb7?? 21. Qe7+ Kc8 22. Rc1# 1-0<n><n>I would personally play 2. ... d6! defending the c-pawn and controlling the centre, without risking the pawn.
As I said, 2. ... d6! is strong as it defends the c-pawn and allows open lines for Black's LSB, and it also controls the centre. The only snag is that Gold's DSB is blocked, but can be opened up at anytime with g6. <n><n>At this time, both players have got a share of the centre, but that's for now. What about later? Who will get all the land, and who'll be squeezed in to his castles? Only one way to find out, read on!
Black attacks the e-pawn and eyes the d-pawn suspiciously.
The knight gets himself out of the tangle into an even bigger tangle. Now, the knight is stuck, and so is Black's LSB.  And if the bishop takes the knight with check, then: "Here we go with all the fuss and quarrels about Bishops vs. Knights.
Theoretically, this seems to be a good move in developing terms. The negative point is that White is ignoring the fact of 5. ... a6! which forces the Bishop back, which cannot seem so serious, can it? The thing that holds the debate is that after 6. Bc4?! b5! the bishop must retreat, which fails in developing terms. But, more of the less, White should not play the innocent 6. Bxd7+? as White would have swapped of one of his best-placed pieces for a knight which hasn't yet opened his eyes.
Black tackles the bishop. Will it retreat, or take the knight? And which way?<n><n>6. Ba4?? is blundered, as after 6. ... b5! the bishop will have to retreat to b3, following 7. Bb3 c4! which nets the bishop.
?! The bishop does retreat down the long diagonal to a difficult square. A bishop on c4 can threaten f7 when the d5-pawn has been cleared off. Using tactical ideas (and opinions), the bishop could've been there on move 2. Has it been delayed?<n><n>0002 C4<n>Delayed until 0006. We apologise.<n>Ran by Bishop. Formed of 5 coaches.<n><n>There's another reason too, that it is pretty dubious. Look what happens next...
On move 3, the knight was stuck. Now, on move 6, the knight's already in the pluck. What's the time? Lunch-time!
Now for a bit of developing and describing. Look at this...<n><n>The knight on c3 is the only one out and about for white, but he's staring at his own pawns. The bishop on e2 has fallen off the sofa, and all the rest of the pieces are still sleeping in bed, waiting for the alarm clock to ring on move 10 (with the exception of the d & e-pawns, who've set off yesterday for late 'knight' hunting. Don't worry, it's just a joke)<n><n>For Black, the bishop on f8 is just about to come out, and so is the bishop on c8! That leaves just the major pieces snoozing, though. They're the wrinklies, but Gold's a winner!
Gold sharpens his lance and sets off the white alarm clock early. Trouble is, it only wakes up the bishop snoozing on the floor.
The bishop is now in front of the castle wall. A bad place to sleep, but the bishop is very tired, so...
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. The black bishop jumps off his bed, in front of the castle, but behind the separated wall, while the white bishop snoozes. Wait, what's that noise? Tick, tick, tick...
Black's king has shuffled into safety. Gold's in a good position but THWACK! He's forgot something! His LSB is still doing backflips in his swimming pool, located in the hall of Black's queenside castle. Time to get a towel...
And now White starts the chase. This is where it gets complicated. "Oh no! Here we go again!" with the fuss about bishops and knights. Black's best choice is to capture with his Dragon Bishop, as after 11... exf6 Black gets doubled pawns, which might be good to open up the e-file, but still, they aren't a nice sight!
Black retreats his Dragon Bishop to it's normal square, and into safety, protecting all the pieces and squares around it. But now Gold is a couple of tempos down, and needs to clean up his act!
?? Right back to its starting place! Much better was 14. Ne2 or 14. h3!? The knight now blocks the rooks from connecting. Knighty-knight knight.  <n><n>The other reason why this move is a ?? not a single ? is that after 14. ... Bxb2! White's rook is left trapped and Black wins a Rook and a pawn for a bishop. Fevil must be drunk! He ust be blind!
White makes a little hole for White's LSB to fit into. Trouble is, this doesn't help with the Rook Rummage! Better was 15. Nc3 protecting the Rook but losing the exchange. Fevil must really be drunk!
The rook's friend takes revenge, and if 16. ... Bxc3 then... Here we go again with Bishops vs. Knights. Escape Bishop!
The bishop dodges the catapult does it dodge the next one?
The Rook is certain to get revenge! "Where are you going to go next?
The bishop belongs at g7 when the queens are still on the board. I mean, it might get stuck on the rim forever in this game!
The Rook sends another bowl of fire towards the bishop, but does the bishop dodge it this time, and how?
?! The bishop doesn't dodge but has some water handy if the catapult hits him, and sends white a present. A pin! What's next? A fork? A knife? A spoon?
Black's poor bishop is being chased around like mad. There's only one place to go...
The bishop should be safe here as there are no more catapults for the rooks or arrows for the pawn, and there is a row of pawns to protect him. Also, anything attacks the bishop, it can simply move down inside the queenside castle, where everything is safe and sound, and where he can swim and mess around with his friend, Black's LSB.
The white bishop jumps into his kingside castle, his "fianchetto" square, defending his king. He's come for another rest, and it's only move 20! Golly, he must be tired!
Gold marches down to attack the rook, and the poor rook finds that there is no place for him to attack, so sadly, he leaves for home, guarding the back rank.
The bishop is setting off for g7 again, but will it overcome the difficulties? Now that he has released the pin on the knight, White's pieces may get active again, though another present has been sent. Can you see which one?
And NOW the knight moves to e2. Why couldn't it have been their on move fourteen. That would save a Rook's life! And what's the point now? What's the matter with Fevil's pieces? Are they listening to him?<n><n>0014 E2<n>Delayed until 0022. Due to signal failure. We apologise.<n>Ran by Knight. Formed of 4 coaches.<n><n>Oh, and by the way, the other present the bishop sent was another PIN, the one pinning the f2-pawn to the king!
Finally, Gold let's his LSB out into the game. It's a bit late, isn't it? Despite this fact, Black still needs to do some developing, centralize his rooks, and get his queen into the game, without missing transporting the bishop back to g7! That's a lot in one step, isn't it? But now, if the Black Bishop takes the knight...
...Then it's back to the fuss about Bishops vs. Knights. But that's the title of this annotation, isn't it? And I still haven't told you who wins yet!<n><n>Fevil launches his knight off to f4. He probably likes Knights better than bishops, then?
Black sends off Pawn Power (made from original flavoured development) to chase away the knight and hopes to get his queen into the game and centralize his rooks and get his Bishop back to g7 through the castles. That's another lot in one step, eh?
Gold keeps his LSB and the knight is still under attack, and White's kingside is starting to rot. Anyway, Gold seems to like Bishops better than Knights...
Black hopes to capture the pinned f-pawn with check. This is the first castle attack for Black!<n><n>Now, let's stop for a development break. It look like White is behind in development, as no pieces have got past the second rank, and they have not yet been centralized. I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU, B1 ROOK! + They have no plan yet.<n><n>Black should centralize his rooks and probably get his LSB into the game a bit further.
White's knight moves for the eighth time in this game, but here, there is a point for the move. This move allows the queen to defend the pawn, but there is a saying in chess which reads: Always defend with the weakest available piece. So where does that leave White?
Black centralizes his rook, ready to make another great attack when the e-file is open. On second thoughts, the bishop is actually good on b6, as now the Black Queen is defending the king.
White aims to centralize a rook as well, ready to defend an opposing attack from Black.
?! White marches ahead with his pawns. Trouble is, they are on the kingside, but anyway, Black has still not got enough pieces to attack, though, or has he?
?? White leaves his f-pawn to be taken and aims to attack Black. But it's not just the f-pawn White's going to lose...
There is also another saying in chess that goes: Always take a pawn/piece with the weakest available piece, unless the stronger piece can do more damage. Here, it is also because 29. ... Qxf2+ may leave the Black king under attack.
?! Better was 30. Kh2 defending the g-pawn. Anyway, it has to go now...
This move is forced, and, if you are a little kid, after 32. Bh3 Black replies with 32. ... Qxh3+ winning a piece! How fascinating!
Black is simply giving a barrage of checks to try to threaten mate.
White gives up the knight to stop mate as after 34. Bxd4 White replies with 35. Qd2 defending the threat. Which piece is Gold going to take with, the bishop or the pawn?
Black threatens to open up the e-file for the Rooks to attack. Make sure that at least one piece guards the back rank when the queen is at h6 as if a Rook gets down to the back...
Gold pushes a pawn forward to attack the queen! Even pawns can get to the third/sixth rank in the Middlegame!
Black wins a pawn and threatens to promote to a queen. What a waste of exchanging queens, Fevil.
Kids, how many squares could the king move to after 38. ... d3+ (And the answer is not just one!)?
Black threatens to promote by taking the rook. There is only one answer to stop promotion...
White sees the trick and doesn't take the b-pawn, but smoothers butter on the c2 pawn, ready for c3-pawn trifle. But that doesn't work...
Now the diagonal has cleared, and Gold threatens the rook, and to promote the pawn.
... And how many squares could the king go to after ... Oh, I think you already know the joke.
? And Black accepts it! He must want to delay it by a move! At least he gets his other rook out...
And finally the Bishop moves, but this doesn't actually help...
Black finishes off the fifty-move game with a spectacular checkmate made by a bishop, and 25 points up! Sorry Fevil, but that was such a spectacular one...<n><n>Oh, that reminds me. Who won, Bishops or Knights? The answer was that "In closed positions, Knights are better, but in most positions, and most endgame positions, BISHOPS ARE BETTER!"<n><n>So where does that leave us? To say goodbye. I hope you've enjoyed reading my annotation, and I'll leave to see you next time.<n><n>Thanks <n>@oodle
Black defends the pawn, and develops a piece
The immediate development of the knight is called the 'Two Knights Game'.<n>It is VERY sharp and theoretical and so is not to everyones taste, it certainly does not appeal to me playing this move as Black unless you are very well prepared.<n>If you are well prepared, it is EXCELLENT!
White immediately makes a move on the centre with a threat, and opens a line for the c1 bishop and provides some space for the Queen. <n>White threatens 5. dxe5
White captures the pawn and threatens the knight on c6.<n>6. Bxd5 Nxd5<n>7. exd5 Qxd5  and Black is already better, as he has the two bishops, a extra pawn, developed his queen and has exchanged an attacking piece.
Black checks with the queen. This is a very interesting idea for Black. White reply of kf1 is forced.<n>Both sides will have development problem and king safety issues. <n>White will have to somehow develop the h1 rook.<n>Black on the other hand will have to deal with the fact his queen blocks the dark squared bishop, as well as the fact his knight on c6 is en prise to the pawn at the moment.
Black defends the knight, and also threatens the c4 bishop. The knight also defends the important f7 square.
White decides to try and increase pressure by sacrificing a pawn.
White attacks the knight.<n>This is quite a tricky move by White. It pins the knight, and so stop Nxc4. It also threatens Bf4 with a simple double attack on the pinned knight. It also threatens Nf3 in some cases, so Black must play quite carefully!
Black defends the knight.<n>This is a very good move. Black recognises the danger and retreats his queen back.<n>It is not such a great loss of time as one would expect, as he threatens to exchange on c4.
White decides to develop a piece, and try and gain a time and initiative advantage.<n>Also possible was Bb3, this saves the two bishops but gives up a tempo.
Blacks game is not particularly easy to play.<n>I like the idea of playing to exchange the queens and then giving back the pawn on c7 to gain time.<n>White has a long term problem with his h1 rook to develop, and if Black adopts this plan it looks promising.<n>e.g.<n>11...Qc5! <n>12. Qxc5? (Nd2! is  probably better) 12...Bxc5
White exchanges knight for Bishop and elimites the disadvantage of the two bishops.
Black decides to take with the pawn. If he can keep the two centre pawns, Black will have a very superior centre position.<n>I think overall Black has the better game here.
White develops his last minor piece.<n>Qxd4 is far too dangerous, as the Black rook will come to the d line very strongly with a gain of time on the White queen. This move should be avoided immdiately.<n>White threatens Re1 with a strong attack against the e6 pawn.
Castles Queenside and improves the Black king safety, as well as defending the d4 pawn.
Black stops the threat on the e6 pawn,<n>but this move looks very unnatural and leaves the e5 square very weak.<n>A better plan is to try to exchange Queens, give up the e6 pawn, and develop quickly.<n>The white rook on h1 will takes at least 3 moves to develop, and Black will gain the initiative.
White immediately places the threatened bishop on the weak e5 square.
Black finds a good plan to exchange the queens and develop his f8 bishop.
White exchanges queens, as there are no other good squares to go to.
Black recaptures, with a double threat against the c2 and a2 pawn.
White moves the knight to a strong central square and attacks the bishop.
Black defends the bishop, placing is on a strong square. Be7 is also good.
Black moves the attacked rook and attacks the White bishop.
White defends the bishop.
Black carries out his threat of taking a pawn, and also attacks the White rook.
White moves the rook and counter-attacks the Black knight.
Black moves the knight to safety.<n>It is time to evaluate the position!<n>Material - equal.<n>King safety - Blacks king is safe. Whites king is less safe, but not critically.<n>Activity - All Blacks pieces are active. White has a problem piece of the rook on h1.<n>Other features - Black has a isolated pawn on e6, but this is not important at present as it is difficult to take advantage of and helps Blacks centre control.<n>Conclusion: BLACK IS BETTER
Black doubles his rooks on the open file.
This move does not much, but it is hard to think of a good plan for Black.<n>Rd3 threatens Re3+ but this can be stoped by White playing Rc3!.<n>Perhaps Black should push the h pawn or try and attack the g2 pawn.
White seeks to exchange the powerful doubled Black rooks.
Black moves the rook to the open g line and attack the White pawn.
White defends the pawn moving it forward one square.<n>Perhaps moving two squares is better, but often in endings it is a good idea if you are not sure to move the pawn just one square. The reason for this is that you can always move the pawn again (sometimes!). Whereas if you move two squares, you can't move it backwards later!
Black improves his rook to a useful rank e.g. it could go to the h line to attack the pawn.
White exchanges a set of rooks.<n>With each exchange Whites game improves, as the isolated e5 pawn is becoming a serious weakness and the White kingside pawn numerical advantage is increasingly important and the Black king is far away on the Queenside.
Black recaptures with the bishop and threatens the b2 pawn.
White defends the pawn. <n>This is better than defending with the rook, as in endings it is important to try to keep your rook active and not passive.
Black begins to advance his Queenside pawns.<n>Another plan centralising the king by Kd7.
White pushes his kingside pawn advantage.<n>EVALUATE the position:<n>Material - even<n>King safety - even, not a important factor.<n>Activity - the e4 knight is very well placed, and is slightly superior to the black bishop, which has few square to move to as the e5 and b6 pawns block its path somewhat. The black rook is quite active. The White rook is reasonably placed. Whites king is a slightly more active than Blacks.<n>Conclusion - slight advantage to White.<n>PLAN - Try and advance the kingside pawns.
White improves the position of his rook, to a better 2nd rank allowing it to come to g2 or h2 (once the king moves out of the way)
Black advances the king, but to the wrong side of the board. The action is on the kingside, so this is where the king should head towards.
White improves the king position slighly, and allows the rook access to the kingside.
Black moves the rook to the seventh rank, possibly with some ideas of playing it to a7 in some cases if the Queenside pawns advance.
Black attacks the White knight, and threatens Rf3+ if the knight moves.
Black defends against the threat and activates his king.<n>EVALUATE:<n>Material - even<n>King safety - in this endgame, king safety is not a critial factor<n>Special features - White has a powerful passed pawn on the 5th rank, Black has a Queenside pawn majority.<n>Activity - White king is well centralised. Blacks king is placed to help attack the queenside pawns. Whites rook is well placed on the second rank where it can go behind the passed pawn. Blacks rook will likely go passive to prevent the advanced passed pawn advancing.<n>Conclusion: White has the advantage.
Black advances his king on the White pawns.
Black defends the rook.
Black advances his king.<n>The Black plan is to sacrifice the rook for the passed pawn at the last possible moment, and then use his king to take the White pawns. And then try to play with the Black pawns against the White king and rook.<n>This is a excellent plan, as the White king will be quite far away from the Queenside.
White moves the king towards the defending Black rook.<n>Black is prepared to sacrifice the rook and and then capture the White pawns.<n>Unfortunately Black resigned here, but he should have played on as the ending would have been quite tricky for White to win.
White has to choose between the Rook and the Queen.
White seems to be trying to block my Bishop from retreating, but instead, he's just lost a pawn. Now my Bishop can take that pawn and not be recaptured by the Queen due to my own Queen protecting it.
I decide to take another Pawn. White can't recapture my Bishop with the pawn, due to the pawn being pinned by my Queen.
Mate. I think the key mistake in this game on White's part was move number twenty, when he moved the pawn to try and block my Bishop from leaving, but which ended up allowing me to demolish the pawn defenses around the king and open up a path for my Queen and DSB to force a mate whilst supporting each other, and my LSB to block the one escape route for the King in this situation, whereas I was able to mate because I set up an advantageous position for myself by exploiting an opening in White's defenses.
A vigorous response that looks to open lines for attack.
Developing, so I can't say too much bad about it, but the bishop looks a little odd on that square.
It is the right of the better developed side to open lines and attack, so this move is a positional blunder. Black would be better to keep the position closed and try to catch up in development.
Not sure why black refuses to recapture the e5 pawn. He is going to be down a pawn either way and this keeps the position slightly more closed, but two moves ago he was trying to open the position, so it probably isn't fear of opening the position further.
Developing with an attack on a weak point and preparing to castle. Nice play!
An awkward way to protect f5, but at least black has decided to develop a piece. The knight is probably better placed on e7, but perhaps black is saving that square for the f8 bishop.
A reasonable looking move by black. This prepares castling to safeguard the king, and offers to trade off one of white's attackers. But looks can be deceiving, and this is actually bad, as white shows with his next.
An interesting way to capture. Although, at this point, any move by white will win, I think taking with the bishop is better here. The main reason is that it would inhibit castling by covering the f8 square. But perhaps white was anticipating Bxh6 after black castles to break up the remaining pawn cover of the king.
Moving a piece a second time when there are still pieces waiting to be developed is a violation of opening principles, and this is therefore a bad move. It does attempt to remove the defender of the c5 knight, so that if white overlooks this transparent threat, black could theoretically win a piece with ...Nxe3 followed by ...Qxc5. But white has numerous ways to defend this "threat", such as Nb3, Qd2, Qe2, or even Bd4. Notice that black is attacking the e5 pawn twice and it is only defended once, so black can win that pawn, but if I were white I would sacrifice it and play Nb3 looking for a sequence like:<n>12. Nb3 Nxe5<n>13. Nxe5 Qxe5<n>14. Re1<n>and the black queen is going to have trouble finding a safe place to get out of the discovered check. For example, 14...Qc7 loses to 15. Bf4 .
Avoiding the trade and protecting the e5 pawn.
And now black develops with an attack on a defender of the e5 pawn, renewing the threat to win it. Again I would sacrifice it, looking for a sequence like:<n>13. Nb3 Nxd4<n>14. Nbxd4 Nxe5<n>15. Nxe5 Qxe5<n>16. Re1<n>winning the queen.
This protects the d4 bishop, but turns that bishop into a mere pawn in the chain. Maybe something like Bc3 presents itself, with the idea of Nd4.
Looking to trade off the blockader of the passed pawn?
Protecting the bishop.
Connecting the rooks and protecting the e5 pawn.
Is black trying to induce f3, when he can plant the knight on the e3 outpost? I don't see any other reason for this move.
Blundering the knight to fxe3.
White refuses to accept the gift and offers his opponent a chance to win the exchange with ...Nxf1! Argh!!
At least black will not repeat his mistake and x-rays the b2 pawn.
This is a safe and good way to stifle black's attempted counterplay on the queenside. Notice that if black tries ...Rb6 planning ...a6, white can gain the tempo needed to protect the b pawn with Be2, putting a second attacker on the knight. After black either moves or protects the knight, white plays b3 so the queen can protect the pawn. Eventually, white can convert this 2-1 majority into a passed pawn that, together with the passed e pawn will put tremendous pressure on the black defenders.
Since white has allowed the bishop to be attacked, black attacks it.
And black finds the best move.
At first blush, this appears to pin and win the black queen. But appearances can be deceiving, and tactics must be calculated precisely, not just guessed at. The knight removes the defender of the bishop with check, and this gives black the tempo he needs to save his lady.
Better than recapturing on f3 with the pawn, as then the bishop falls to the queen.
Protecting the f pawn to activate the f8 rook.
Accepting the gift and eyeing the b pawn.
Ignoring the threat to the b pawn, white puts a rook behind his passer. Normally the best strategy, but here it is just too little, too late.
Accepting another gift and destroying white's 2-1 queenside majority. After this, white can resign with a clean conscience.
Desperation, as the pawn has no chance to queen, but if white is to play on, he must move something.
Threatening the a pawn, which would give black a passer, and taking the c6 square away from the bishop. Nice move!
Ignoring the threat to the a pawn in order to advance the passer.
But black successfully blockades the passer and can win it at his leisure.
Protecting the pawn to allow the rook to head for e8, but this is too slow and black will have plenty of time to counter. For example, ...Qc7 puts a second attacker on the d pawn and freezes both white pieces in their tracks.
And now the reason for 33...f3 is clear. It was a deflection sacrifice to allow the black queen the f5 square. But really, 33...Qc7 would have been better.
This is worse than just a wasted tempo, it actually helps his opponent. The bishop has to get to c6 to protect the pawn, and by checking first, the black king gets a free move to get activated.
Taking the tempo gift to get closer to the action around white's passer.
Forced, to get a second defender on the passer, but now ...Qe6 will force the bishop to abandon its protection and the passer will fall.
But black doesn't find ...Qe6. Is he thinking of a pawn storm to destroy the pawn wall in front of the white king?
White has to move something, but this still allows black to consolidate his won position with:<n>37...Qe6<n>38. Bb7 Rxd7<n>39. Rxd7 Qxd7<n>40. Bxa6 Qd1 <n>winning the a pawn, after which the queen will dominate the bishop.
Uh, this was the big follow up to 37...Qb1 ? I guess I still don't see the point of this line. Except that it sets a trap for white if he should take the h pawn.
And white partakes of the forbidden fruit! After the double attack of ...Qg6, white has the choices of:<n>A) 40. Rh8  Ke7<n>41. Rxd8 Kxd8<n>and the King wins the d pawn after the white bishop moves<n>B) 40. Rc5 trying to protect the bishop<n>40...Qd6  forking the rook
But black misses that and continues to play with his king.
White's best chance to cause some confusion.
The best try.
Which he doesn't find. The text defends the g pawn and attacks the a pawn, but misses ...Qh7  forking the rook. In a Q vs. R ending it is very difficult for the rook to stay active and avoid getting forked at the same time.
Threatening to win the pawn.
And again missing a fork to win the rook with ...Qb3 .
Can't blame white for trying to put up resistance, especially since black doesn't appear to be looking for a way to win.
What is black's plan now? He must be wanting to push his passed a pawn, but then why did he leave the queen blocking the a file? ...Qb3  would have cleared the pawn's path with the tempo gain of a check.
Again, "Patzer sees check...". Is there a point to this move? If white wants to queen one of his pawns, he will need to cut the black king off, so Re4 would accomplish that and after Kf4, the g pawn could get moving. This move just lets the black king take a free move.
And black figures out his pawn can't walk through the queen and gets out of the way. Another lost tempo, so I guess we are even.
An interesting intermezzo that gives black a chance to go wrong. After:<n>53...Qd5<n>54. Rxd5  Kxd5<n>55. g7 a1=Q<n>56. g8=Q <n>it is white who queens with check and black will have to be careful to hold the draw.
And this transposing of moves ruins the game. By letting the exchange happen on e5, white lets black queen with check.
Perhaps I should have sacrificed the b-pawn to open up lines for my rooks. I chose a more solid approach.
Threatens gxh5 and Black can't recapture because of the pin on the g-file
Finally! Sanctuary for the Black King!
Black should play Qd2 (the only move) and try to draw the game, down a piece.
Isn't it fun playing with the Black pieces? You have to defend for 99% of the game and your attack comes in the last 1%.
The 'Chinese' Dragon. Black will play directly along the b-file, aiming to open up the b-file for his a8 rook as soon as possible via ..b5 (often as a sacrifice). For more information on this variation, the reader can check out some of my past annotations.
The point. White cannot defend the b5 knight and the f3 pawn at once. Now Black regains material with a strong attack.
Uh oh. White overlooks the threat to b2 (again with this square!) that arises after the f6 knight moves (threatening forced mate in several moves after .. Bxb2 ). This is a typical Dragon motif (it often occurs after an Exchange sacrifice along the c-file too), where the knight attacks the queen and reveals an even deadlier attack on b2. White is dead lost.
This was a first try for me with the Traxler counter attack. This is definitely a risky 'all or nothing' opening for black, but one gives a lively and enjoyable alternative to quieter and more strategic openings.
Black ignores the threat and sets up an attack of his own.
Black lights the fuse, with the signature traxler BXf2. From here on in, it's fireworks all the way.
The hungry knight continues to chew up the available material.
Black keeps the counter attack going. Threatening the White bishop and opening up the channel for the LSB.
White eliminates the threat and is now offering his own threat to the knight on c3.
Time to throw the knight into the attack.
The pawn advances, threatening the black queen and reopening the diagonal for the llsb, and the escape route for his knight on f7.
Pxd6 - a necessary pause in the attack.
And now white feels able to take the bishop that has been hanging onf2 since move 5
The king retreats..
This looks like a natural move for white, opening up the diagonal to develop the bishop, whilst simultaneously attacking the black queens and knight.<n><n>But after black's next move white's goose is well and truly cooked......
If the king tries to run for it the black queen will check on f5 and mate will follow on f2. So instead......
and black resigns!
Is this rook sac really sound? In this game my opponent sacrificed a rook early on. Although black seems to not have enough compensation, I was unable to find a way to consolidate and lost quickly. Has anyone seen this sacrifice before? Also - where did I go wrong? The post-match computer analysis doesn't record any mistake by me until the last few moves, when it is clearly lost for me - although it claims - perhaps wrongly - that the sacrifice was a mistake. Your comments would be most welcome!
Black shows an indication to play the King's Indian or Grunfeld Defence
And black plays the Grunfeld
This is a quirky, rarely played move. Someone played it as white against me. In the first game I met it, I lost, and I adopted it for a while, and enjoyed some successes with it. I am not sure that I would still play it against an equally rated opponent. My opponent was then rated about 1600, and I played it in a "give him a chance" frame of mind. Perhaps my lose can be traced to this move?
pxd5 seems to transpose into the normal exchange variation of the Grunfeld, where f3 is not normally played. dxc5 scores better in the Gameknot opening databases.
White won both the games on the database when black played the alternative e5, although I am not convinced that e5 is not playable.
Now there are two games in the database with this position. Pomes Marcet, J… (2390) vs. Martinez, A. (2220) continued with Be7 and a draw. Nestorovic, Dej… (2424) vs. Misailovic, Neb… (2335) continued with Bxc5 10. Nxd4 exd4 11. Bd3 and black eventually won. But I thought "Hang on, if he takes on c5 I can just win the rook on a8".
he retakes the bishop of course.
mmm this is unpleasant, ideally I'd like to put my bishop on d3
So it has to go to e2 instead.
With some nasty threats. Post-match computer now gives this as level. Although it looks daft, maybe fxe4 was best here? Black can play Ng3! White can't play Kxg3, unless he is prepared to give up his queen after Bd6+, but maybe White can struggle on with Nf3, although after Nxh1 approximate material equality has been regained, and Black still has the attack?
I wanted to stop the bishop check on c5
But this causes problems. If 16 Qb5, then Qd4 is a horrible check. There is a massive black squared weakness in my position!
Post-match computer gives this as a mistake, leading to an advantage of just 0.01 for Black, instead of Ne3 maintaining the adavantage of 1.88. I think this view is questionable!
So I play this, hoping for QxQ or QxR. I'd be overjoyed to give back the exchange to get queens off the board.
Forced again. If Kf2, Bc5+ and White has to give up his queen.
Attacking my knight. Perhaps it would be better to play Nc7 or Ne2, but I decide to counter-attack his knight on f5, which has been causing me problems.
And he now grabs back the exchange
At least I have got rid of his black squared bishop. Will my king finally find sanctuary on f2?
I decided to at last develop my king's knight. Post-match computer gives this as a massive mistake, and rates my position as minus 8.33 and gives 27. Qe2 Qd4+ 28. Kg2 Ne3+ 29. Kg3 Rxa8 30. Qb5 Rc8 31. Ne2 Qd6+ 32. Kh3 Rc2 33. Re1 Qd5 34. Qxd5 Nxd5 35. a4 f6 as best for both sides, and black 2.4 ahead. The ending is clearly winning for Black - he is a pawn ahead and his pieces are still on better squares, but I'm not convinced that black has to even go into an ending.
The following is an interesting encounter in the Queen's Indian. White abandons his natural central play (e3-e4) to contest Black along the a1-h8 diagonal. This is a clear instance of White becoming too "caught up" with one-move attacks and countering Black's plans while losing sight of his own ideas.
White signals his intention to continue quietly, strengthening his central control (and not grabbing space with the more popular 4.d5). This allows Black a free hand to develop (again, he has more space to maneuver his pieces).
The Queen's Indian formation. Black restrains White's central expansion along the h1-a8 light-square diagonal with ..b6 and ..Bb7.
'?' - Now White's passivity is becoming an issue. His bishop would have been well-positioned on d3 (the best move), where it immediately eyes e4 and gives White attacking possibilities. The decision to fianchetto contests Black along the long diagonal, but it creates massive light-square weaknesses around his kingside. If White loses his light-square bishop, this formation will be especially weak. This plan is also slow.
'?!' - White harasses the Black queen. His knights give an imposing impression, but are they really that dangerous? If the knights don't accomplish anything concrete or establish more permanent outposts (specifically the b5 knight), they will lose a tempo in retreat, which may allow Black to improve his position with tempo. Also, shouldn't White be worrying about his c1 bishop, which is blockaded by pawns? It seems White has abandoned the natural, freeing plan of e3-e4 (supported by pieces), in favor of this (dubious) knight-harassment scheme. A better plan is cxd4 followed by Re1, aiming at e3-e4.
'!?' - Avoiding an isolated queen's pawn position (not necessarily bad!) after ..exd5 and exchanging bishops. Black reasons that White's kingside light squares are weaker than his queenside ones, and in any event the trading of pieces favors his cramped position.
Also strong is ..Qb7 , taking control of the long diagonal. White ought to contest this via Qf3!, exchanging into a drawish endgame. The text presses for an advantage, allowing White the sequence 15.Qf3 Nxe5 16.dxe5, when White's light-square control faces off against Black's queenside majority and obvious target on the doubled e5 pawn. Highly imbalanced.
The e5 knight has no defense now, but after exd4 Black wins the d-pawn. White must complicate the situation immediately via Rac1, pinning the knight to the queen.
A further mistake related to Black's last move; positionally, Black's idea is sound - he seizes the light squares and attacks the b6 knight. He doesn't mind allowing Nxa8, as he will pick up 2 knights for the rook with a winning position. Indeed he believes the knight is trapped. But tactically, he overlooks 19.Qf3!, when White pins the c6 knight and actually seizes the advantage (the fight for light-square control is the most important struggle in this position.)
'!' - With the a8 knight trapped, Black can rescue the d4 pawn via ..d3! or ..dxe3!, since Bxe5? is impossible in both cases (after ..dxe3, Black threatens ...Rd2 pinning the queen). Black decides to make a passer.
'!' - Black hits upon the best plan. The old adage: "knights need advanced outposts" certainly applies here, so Black rushes to create strong positions for his knights. One-move "tricks" like ..Nd5? ("centralizing" the knight and scheming 24.Qxd3?? Nf4 ) are clearly worse: from d5, Black's knight simply obstructs the d8 rook and can easily be chased away via e4, when he has nowhere to go but backwards.
Now the maneuver ..Nd5-c3 is a very real threat, so White squashes it and doubles Black's kingside pawns. A fair trade? Not exactly, but there is little else. More tenacious was axb4, retaining the bishop, but White is hopeless either way.
Very strong (and made possible by the immobilizing 23..b4!). White has severe problems defending both the b3 weakness and the d3-d2 advance. So, reasonably, White chooses to lash out in attack. Unfortunately for him, Black doesn't budge: White's position is hopeless. The rest is simple technique.
The pin on the king and bishop is deadly. So i add another attack. but..
I continue to play aggressively because i'm already a piece down.
I don't want him to gain space if I retreat my bishop so i damage his pawn structure.
I probably could've won the piece back if his pawn was still on the 7th rank.
continuing to play as aggressive as possible.
I think that this was a blunder. Taking my pawn allowed me to play Rh8+
black develops pawn in center to d5 with attack on the center, backed up with queen.
with protection of knight on h6, black moves LSB  to g4 and threatens whites queen.
Black retreats LSB to h5
white trys to force away the LSB with another pawn to g4.
Black continues moving his d pawn up the center. It is protected by pawn on e5. Remember the knight on c6 is pinned.
rook slides to d8 next to his king for protection from the lone queen attack by white. This move will save the rook from a fork if queen attacks c6 pawn for a check.
?d pawn checks king and is not protected by the pinned rook on d7.
queen moves to 2nd file on f2 and is going to end this game soon.
? queen moves to b5. A better move would of been moving Bishop to g3.
My opponent resigned here. My sac was not at all convincing. After fxN, Qxe6 is strong, but black can't play Rxf4, because of Bxg6+, with deadly threats. But he can still goes elsewhere.
Black evades the pin on the knight, but it takes his king into the rook's path.
Here, white plays what it can be a brilliant move, or a flop. It opens the way for the white rook to g8+, so black can't take the bishop with the knight. Black has to do something or Qd2#, so it seems reasonable to take RxB.
Black has to take, or the queen is lost. If QxR, Rg8+! and black has only NxR, QxQ+, Ke7, and white will grab some other black pawn for a difficult but probably winning endgame. But if black takes with the knight...
Black is half forced to take, in my opinion.
Material is only +1, but white dominates the board, with two joined free pawns. It's a matter of time. I hope you enjoyed the trick position, and please feel free to correct my mistakes an analysis!
A sure way to prevent a Black counterattack of ...Q-R5 ch, always a danger in the King's Gambit.

Hi everyone!<n><n>Here is Part 2.  I am taking part in a mini-tournament called Memoralis.  I find myself under the cosh in the middlegame but somehow my opponent does not make the best moves and I end up bailing out into a 2 knight v R + 2 pawn ending.  Looks favourable to the side with the rook and 2 pawns, but somehow my horsies won the day.  As a rare experiment (very rare in a rated game) I try the Caro-Kann Defense.  That is 1. e4 c6.
12. Qxd2 - bishop trade.  I now develop my king knight to e7 and prepare for castling.
20. ...... Kf7 - Henry and Glenda both defend the vulnerable e6 pawn.
29. Nxf6 - my f pawn now drops.  In order to come out of Old Matey's shadow there is only one thing for it.  To give up my rook for the knight on f6, giving me two knights for a rook and 2 pawns.
34. ....... Nc7 - my isolani on e6 needs careful protection.  Just how come a few moves later I get a pawn right up close to Glendadom and Paul must give up his rook to stop this?  Well, here is how the action unfolds.
47. ....... Nc6! - indirectly protects my pawn on d6 for if Rxd6?? then Ne5+ winning the WR.
51.  ....... Ne3+ - now the white rook is toast, Nxd1 next move, suddenly it looks as though I am about to receive a white flag!
54. ........ Nxa4 - my d pawn goes but I create a new passer.  White plays one more move and I move the a4 knight to c5 clearing a path for the black pawn.  After this white does wave the white flag!  Phew, I feel soooo relieved!  Part 3 coming up soon.
This is the most accurate move order for black since white can go for a specific set up involving b3 and g3 that solves many problems early if black captures the pawn immediately. I think the point with this move order is that if white goes for the set up, the black LSB may prove to be more useful on the c8-h3 diagonal.
A thematic idea in the benko gambit.the knight reroutes so that he can have extra control over e5 and he can then look to play there and have a pair of knights exchanged, but since white has moved the rook away from f1 I figured I would leave my knight where he is, until he gets kicked away, since quite often the pressure against f2 can come in useful and whilst the knight is here my bishop has a clear diagonal.
Sometimes I come to b6, but this is a more common square for my queen and I figured I should probably aim to stay within established norms.
Indirectly hitting my queen and also connecting the rooks and adding protection to the knight. I was not worried about it though, since I had already decided there are no useful discovered attacks against my queen.
This weakens the long diagonal, I think if I were white I would have first played h3 and only then look to get a timely b3 in.
!? Getting in this pawn advance is one of blacks key ideas in this opening, usually it's purpose involves getting a knight to the d3 which isn't the case here since white has still not moved the e pawn. However this advance often has dynamic purposes and sometimes aims to free the c5 square for the pieces. I couldn't help but feeling this was too soon, but every line I looked at seemed promising, so I just played it. The purpose is to get the queen to c5 which hits f2 and by initiating contact between the pawns I'm sure to induce a weakness, also I'm now hitting d5
I thought this would be decisive, I didn't put much calculation to it though, thinking my passed pawn was just going to be strong, and he'll, it 'looked strong' incidentally I never even considered ...Qxd5 which was probably best.
I probably should have started to play for a draw now, but I decided to still try to win, so I though for a while and decided the best way to mix things up was to use the tempo white spend regaining the pawn, to reposition my g knight, that is susceptible to attacks by the white LSB
Cramping whites king and pawns, and also preventing the bishop coming into play via h3 where it will eye the e6 square. I also could have exchanged bishops now with ...Nd2 but the exchange would only have favoured white, this is a better move.
Finally realising that I have no winning chances whatsoever I decide I have to exchange rooks and play to draw.
Ba6 seems better looking to redeploy to c8 where the bishop would hit e6 and g4
I would have liked to get in ...e6 but that just drops a pawn.
And now we agreed on a draw since its an opposite coloured bishop ending, thus shouldn't be too difficult to hold.
take back the pawn and gain center
Black Gains a pawn but lose a tempo
weak pin on the knight
Black tries to gain center
trade a bishop for a knith destroying black castle
?? very weak move! gives black the chance to get the f white pawn, but i can't see a reasonable move
? In my own opinion this is a terrible mistake, because frees the white king
No way to promote black pawn......  if black leaves h columns white get a queen!
?? again a mistake white will trade the rook for a pawn to gain a tempo and promote
Here, not interest about the center.
Black side observed it and may be get ready for it.
Another Pawn was earned. Black side can recover it. Watch for it.
Now white like to have to exchange the pieces, looking for Rooks at the beginning.
Now looking to exchange the Queens. Does the other side agree?
Instead of it, an exchange of Bishop and Knight !
This time, of course white can get rid of the Rooks. May be can think about some other possibilities.
Both sides trying to attack ! Got to wait.
Finally, sacking the knight. But..., missed an opportunity!<n>Instead of sacking,  <n>    55. ...   Qh5+ 56. Rh6 Knf6+ 57. Kh8 Re8+ 58. Bishop/Queen cover the King but the business is done.
In that process, Rook is going to die.
Again, Black is smart, pushing the Bishop and saving the Rook.
Ne6 seems to be rather popular among the other players so far in this tourney due to the the chance to possibly at a later date exchange the knight for bishop.  I wanted to attempt to free up my dsb, but black ends up locking it in.
e5 questions the stability of my knight and bishop.  Being that f4 will fall soon.  Either by exchange fxe5 Bxe5 (though I don't see what good that does.) or by exf4.
This little move follows whites need to develop quickly in order to gain some sort of restraint or initiative to balance out black material advantage.
forcing the passivity of the dsb my initial plan.
Giving the bishop flight squares and protecting my b4 pawn form Bc3+
Here is where I have plenty of ways to go forward but they all seem to leave my king quite exposed.  The best move in this case is O-O seems odd huh.  Freddy and I both agree on this now but I was too focused on how to go forward even-though I did consider castling.
I wanted to do something with this pawn because I was afraid I was going to lose it.
Bd2?? no coming back now.  I needed to realize all the pins because the kings is so exposed... starting to see my point now?
Now another piece falls and I'm hopelessly behind in material at this point.
3. ...... Bb4! This is a very strong move as it tries to undermine the defence of the e pawn.  I decide to take the pawn on e5 but is this a good idea?
4........ 0-0 - black castles and is threatening a skewie by playing 5.... Re8.  I decide to play d3 backing up the e pawn but the drawback of this move is that it leaves my c3 knight in a pin.
7. Bd2 - I break one of the pins by developing a piece.  My e pawn needs some serious back up.
9. Be2 - I break the pin on the e-file and prepare castling.
11. ...... Nxe4 - regains the pawn and worse still threatens to break up my queenside pawns with NxB.  Would Be1 have been a better alternative here?
13. ....... Qf6! My queenside pawns have been busted and the Wicked Witch of the West is homing in on them!
14. Nd4 - blocks the queen's attach and if black takes the knight I then straighten out my pawns but black has other ideas and exchanges bishops.
16. Nd4 - would Qc1 have been a better alternative to moving the knight back?  A plethora of exchanges now leads to me being a pawn minus.
19. Rb1 attacks b7.  I think about moving my king to f1 but with the queens on the board, is this wise?
21. Kf1 - the queens have been exchanged and so I now move my king towards the centre.  If black tries to increase his material advantage by playing Rxc2 I will play Rxb7 splitting up black's queenside pawns.  He prevents this by playing b6.
23. Ke1 - the king moves ever closer towards the centre and defends the f pawn and stops the rook doing any further damage.
24. g3 - after black moves his rook out of the way I prepare h4 and black moves his rook to a4 attacking my a pawn.  He gains a tempo this way so that I am somehow prevented from playing h4.  This costs me dear much much later in the endgame.
28. Re1    I have a decision to make here, should I remain passive or should my rook counterattack - the course of action I take does not change the result, but does it liven up the game and make it a little more interesting?
38. Rd5 - over the last few moves I have kept my opponent in check (literally) - now he decides to act.  He moves the pawn to h5.  This pawn turns out to be the killer.
39. Rd7 - I continue to attack but unfortunately after black moves his pawn to c5 the rook has nothing to attack - at the moment.  It does however confine his king to the back rank.  Normally a rook on your opponent's seventh rank is called "a bone in the throat".
40..... Rxa2 - my opponent increases his lead and threatens to check on a1 so I try and prevent this by playing my king to b1.
42. ..... h4!! the start of this plan.  If I take on h4 it breaks up my kingside pawns.  I play my king to b2 but alas it is driven to a2 by a rook check on b4 on move 43.
46.... h3 - strange, I expected black to take on h2 with his rook.  He will do this next move however.  In the meantime me and my rook decide to liquidate black's queenside pawns and get a passer of my own.  It seems to be another Battle of the Wings Part 2, only this time my passer never gets to leave the second rank, black's passer is on the 7th at the end!
52. Rc8 - the queenside pawns have been liquidated over the last few moves as planned and if black queens his pawn then I play my rook to h8 and give him a skewie.  Black sees this though and forces resignation by playing his rook to e7 because it will interpose on h7 and the pawn will safely queen.  It was time to hold out the white flag to my opponent on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.<n><n>As far as the Experts are concerned, I still have a way to go to reach half point heaven but I was told that I did at least make the game interesting which is a step in the right direction towards such a goal.<n><n>Look forward to your feedback everyone!  Cheers and bye for now.  Joanne
ahah so my chess friend believes I will fool for the lowest kind of mate, he believes that he may have an easy win against me as if to say to me,<n>     "There will be no glory in your chess game. I will erase even the memory of Slockster from the histories! Every piece of G(r)eek parchment shall be burned. Every annotator, and every chess puzzler shall have their eyes pulled out, and their tongues cut from their mouths. Why, uttering the very name of Slockster, or Leonidas, will be punishable by death! The world will never know you existed at all!<n>to wich I replied<n>"The world will know that free pawns stood against a tyrant bishop, that small ratings stood against bigger ones, and before this game over, even a god-GM can bleed
then we shall fight in the shade," I did this to prevent Bg4, it was already getting crowded..hang on.I'm sure I know a metaphor about this Oh yeah," Hotshowers dispatches his monsters from half the world away. They're clumsy beasts, and the piled Persian dead are slippery" its abot to get "slipprier" ,no "slippier", no "more slippy" Oh forget it
once again this situation is again safely returned to normal, However I was worried about Hotshower's cramp on my king side
his knight looks thirsty, well lets give him something to drink, to the cliffes
no retreat, no surrender, that is Slockster's law, and by Slockster law we shall fight and trade through mysterious yet brilliant gambits, a new age had begun and all will know that 32 pieces on an 8x8 checkered board gave their last breath to defend it, oh yeah the movement ummm Knight to e7 allows for castling on both sides and better access for rook
This is the part where I spotted the open line, dxe5, dxe5 and an open d file
now I have allined myself, the bishop has easy access,
I have athought (suprisingly) this Bishop is a messanger and I play Leonidas for a famous scene<n><n>Messenger: Choose your next words carefully, Leonidas. They may be your last as king.<n>King Leonidas: [to himself: thinking] "pawns and respect"?<n>[Leonidas unsheathes and points his sword at the Messenger's throat]<n>Messenger: Madman! You're a madman!<n>King Leonidas:pawns and respect? You'll find plenty of both down there.<n>Messenger: No man, annotator or Greek, no man threatens a bishop!<n>King Leonidas: You bring the pawns and rooks of conquered kings to my walls. You insult my queen. You threaten my people with knights and queen! Oh, I've chosen my words carefully, Persian. Perhaps you should have done the same!<n>Messenger: This is blasphemy! This is madness!<n>King Leonidas: Madness...?<n>[shouting]<n>King Leonidas: This is Sparta!<n>[Kicks the messenger down the well]
0.5 of a blunder I move my knight, forgetting my rook, but this allows me to complete my attack on the black king
Our ancestors built this wall using ancient stones from the bosom of Greece herself. And with a little Spartan help, your Persian scouts supplied the mortar.
moving in for the kill, suitable quote for this point, ahh yes,"The old ones say we Slocksters are descended from Hercules himself. Bold Leonidas gives testament to our bloodline. His roar is long and loud
no, Hotshowers I am not going to exchange queens that would be thick, take that....
We are with you, sire! For Sparta, for freedom, to the death! In coming death imminant
and so i a turn around for the bookies Slockster/Leonidas defeated the Persian Xerxes/Hotshowers to win his 100th victory, thanks for listening, now go back and comment
I've picked this game for annotation because it resulted in an improbable victory from a near impossible position - (at one stage I was down 2 knights, 1 bishop, 1 rook and 4 pawns and had only captured a single pawn in return)<n><n>Tolemac has subsequently thrashed me in every game since.
Realised Qxe4 would result in the loss of rook and leave king exposed after Bxc3
Forced and keeping my bishop protected
A surprising move... as it gives me a target (it did however free blacks rook for a potential attack on the E file)
Given the state of the game, I'm prepared to take any opportunity on offer
Maybe Tolemac will take pity on me and leave his Queen there...<n><n>Actually, I realised that I needed to get my king out of the firing line and moved the bishop to block the check on c1
And then lost a knight as well... -17... I pressed the resign button at this point in time and then decided against it as I wanted to see how long I could last.
Can't remember why I moved here... (maybe I can get my bishop on c3?)
Giving my king somewhere to hide
Saving my bishop
probably my best move in the game... The trap is set!
With the Knight lost black is desperate to try and get a checkmate
the best response.Ready to contest white on the c-file.
the bishop is pretty strong here because now he also has the b1-h7 diagonal.Also the queen can go to e2 forming a battery on the f1-a6 diagonal.
the rook joins in the hunt for the a6-pawn.
looking to trade and get my 2 queenside passed pawns to work
onward to victory!
the white king finally joins the battle to stop Black's central majority.
I prefer not to give up the center to two attacking bishops and no development, so I like the Soerensen defense.  d5 allows both of my bishops to get into the mix and provides a counterpunch in the center.
Applying pressure to the knight to pin against the queen.
protecting the f knight but also offering a queen trade if White really wants it.
I knew that my options to castle would die, but I opted to try something different.  Perhaps keeping the knight and immediately retaking with 7.... kxd8 would have been better, planning to retake the pawn with Bxf2 down the road, but I just wanted to see what would happen here...  If White takes Bxc7, I can retake Nxe4.
We're pretty even at this point.  White needs to try and get his castle on to link up his rooks if possible.
protecting the pawn from the bishop
Adding pressure to my knight, perhaps with an eye towards Be6 down the road.
I'm not certain of the utility of this move.  The lone pawn can only do so much.  Odds are bringing the knight closer (Nd4) to the Black king would provide more options for mounting an attack.  The other downside is that this move allows Black to go up a pawn.
Despite being up a pawn, I need to get my rooks into the game.
I'm not interested in taking the c pawn as that would give his rooks and two pieces direct lines of attack on my king.
Allowing me to get my own knight back into the game and protecting the bishop at the same time.  Side benefit is that this move also prevents an immediate formation of a rook battery.
Giving up a knight for that bishop is very tempting, but I'd rather trade rooks first to give me more of an advantage.
Better late than never!  As Black I now have to deal with the double attack on the LSB.
I like this move better than Rd6 or Re8 because I will eventually need to get my King down to help secure promotion of the pawns.  Also, I want to keep my bishop on this diagonal to help protect my pawn march.  Note that if I move the bishop instead, I give up a pawn from Re7+.
Decent move, thanks to the protecting c3 pawn, restricting White's King's movements.
The LSB will allow me to march my pawn to a2 with no resistance.  White is about to be in big trouble because he will have to dedicate a piece to prevent promotion or trade piece for pawn.  Note that my king is way closer than his to the action, which should be able to provide a decisive difference.
Wise play.  He is going to need both pieces to effectively block my promotion.
This move is the clincher, as it will allow my king to get into the game and force an unfavorable trade on White.  All in all, not too bad a game for a new player.  Thank you for your comments and suggestions.
in this game I struggled for a space advantage in the centre and slowly profited from my opponent inaccuracies until I was able to win a pawn, and create a passed pawn
King's Indian, Averbakh system, black allow white to overextend his pawns in the center hoping to contest that occupation latter with the push c5 or e5, the move Bg5 intends to prevent the immediate e5, black usualy replies with h6 to repel the bishop with the possibility of a future g5, although this last move may weaken the castled king
keeping the queen behind the g5 bishop to avoid h6
pins the d pawn to keep it from advancing, keeping it as a weakness on black's field
I will try to exchange bishops to exert some pressure over d6 latter on
I'll exchange bishops and try to use the holes on black's dark squares...
gains space with tempo, and forces the knight to define it's location either on the king's side, or on the queen's side...
Now black is forced to recapture, probably with the pawn and not with the rook (I'll detail latter the complications to black arisen by recapturing with the rook), either way he will lose a pawn to Rxd6 if he captures with the pawn or with c5 Rxd5 if he captures with the rook, notice how the d6 pawn is pinned in the h2-b8 diagonal by white's queen, now several ideas arise from the position:<n><n>If black recaptures with the rook, then in addiction to c5 Rxd6, white may try also Bg4 to skewer the knight, and if black tries to block the bishop he will lose two pawns covering his king, whom will be left exposed.<n>Also after c5 and Rxd6, Rxg6+ is another possibility with a discovered attack on black's queen.<n><n>So Black has to deal with several threats now...
to put pressure on d6, that is about to fall
? pointless, Qg3 keeps the same threats, and offers the chance of playing e5 with tempo
only now I play b5, if cxb5 I have the strong Nxb5 were it will add further support for the d6 pawn and even keep an eye for Nc7, on the other hand Nd5 forking queen and rook, loses the d6 pawn because blocks the d1 rook that defends it
adding further support to my b pawn, as I may want to move my knight or my bishop, e5 will follow
I expect now Rf5 and I will play Qe3 to pin the knight while defending the e pawn
The gold standard.
The Sicilian -- Van Geemen prepares for hand-to-hand combat.
Because of this move, White cannot bring his knights out at full power. Knights going to a3 and h3 are limited in power. Best if White cleared out c3 and f3.
I thought I won with this move, but that was me pretending that the Light squared Bishop was off the board.
! Threatening one move mate and his bishop.
Either I'm frantic to deliver checkmate, or I'm missing a bunch of good moves, because I forgot to take that FREE light squared bishop!
I am furious about that bishop that I forgot to take.
I decided to take my vengeance on White's Queen!
By the looks of this move, I was even foolish enough to let his Queen join the horrendous, frantic fight!
Finally! I captured his Bishop. That Bishop was probably mocking me ever since I forgot to take it with my Queen.
I bring my selfless rook into the Battle.
A terrible miscalculation. My opponent missed the strong strong attack that follows the trades.
Better was probably Qb8 or something.. my attack is overwhelming.
Now black surely realizes the problem!
If Kf8, Bd5! mates
Allowing the possibility of Nh5 should the g pawn advance, and putting pressure on the uncastled King.
Gutsy move; the Black King is now isolated from the majority of his own forces, whereas White has pieces ready to attack in the quadrant. Nf6 may have been better, followed by 0-0.
! An even exchange that also demolishes the Black King's pawn protection.
Black has no other piece to come to the aid of the a pawn.
Moving some forces to assist the isolated King.
White eyes a knight check with 17. Na5 to begin a Queen-side assault.<n>if 17. Na5+, The Black King has not positive response. 17...Ka7 or Kb8 leads to 18. Nxc6, winning the Black Queen.<n>if 17. Na5+ Ka8, then 18. Qxa6+ Kb8 19. Nxc6 ++<n>if 17. Na5+ Kc8, then 18. Qxa6+ Kb8 19. Nxc6 ++<n><n>Black needs to marshal more forces to his Queen-side to prevent the White Queen from joining the fray.
?? Black responds by presenting no defense other than a hope of escape for the King via the d7 square.<n>16...Nb8 provides the same escape route, but also protects the a6 pawn.<n>16...Ra8 also provides an escape route and protects the a6 pawn.<n><n>Either move was preferable.
White launches the final assault. Black's best option now is to flee by playing 17...Kc8 an move towards the d7 escape square. Unfortunately, that allows 18. Nxc6! forking the Q and R (not 18.Qxa6+?, which gains only a pawn and allows the Black King to escape form pressure).
As projected; Black now drops the R for the white N at best.
White seals the deal by bringing the Queen into the fray at the optimum moment.<n><n><n>In summary, Black made a lot of early pawn moves at the expense of his development.<n>He castled into a sea of enemy forces, then blocked his own defenses and finally trapped his King in a fatal position.<n>White was lucky here, as Black's errors did more to determine the outcome than White's own efforts did.
Necessary to control knight's jumps to the 5th rank.
Strong and normally enough to win.
Black recovers the piece because of Qh2#
Black can recover the piece here, but I like to attack. Chess is about it.
White is struggling to shield his king.
I think it was the right way to go on with the attack, threatening Re3.
Or it was a simple overlook that the bishop is pinned. Anyway, black was even in material (now with a huge advantage) even before the queen's sac.
Nice, white wants to further exchange material in order to free his position.
After Kmoves, black has plenty of ways to further exchange material and win, so my opponent resigned.
I admit I had to look up what this opening was called. Apparently the Paleface Gambit...so I guess I'm the natives then looking to break through the circle of wagons.
....so best way to defend for now and allow development of my opposing bishop
Taking the centre with his pawns but my knight on f6 is not too worried as there are still options for his to flee and attack against advance to e5
So I just bring my second knight out to apply more pressure on the middle of the board
Keeping my knight in the centre of the board
Potential to pin his queen with my white bishop after a5
Castling queen side but after the c3 move to force my knight away unto an already weakened side of the board that I will seek to exploit later.
There's the a5 move to threaten the pin
Give my bishop options to go whichever side of the board he will be needed.
Maybe seeing the threat to his bishop gets in the attack on my knight first
Only safe square but still has attacking options and the rook on h1 is immobile for now as Rh2 leads to Nxf3 forking rook and queen.
Protection for that weakness on f3 while bringing the knight into the attack, but relieving the pressure of the c1-h6 diagonal couple of queen and bishop. <n><n>Maybe Be2 would have been better at this point, iving more freedom to the h1 rook while still protecting that weakness of f3.
So time to stamp my own authority on that diagonal even if only in a small way and making my black bishop passive as a result.
What I thought he should have played the move before now it is merely adding further protection to that weak f3 pawn freeing the knight up, though there isn't much for it to do from g5, but also connecting white's rooks.
Inviting the exchange of pawns so I can apply pressure on a2 with my bishop
White is not keen on the exchange but instead retreats the knight reopening the power on the c1-h6 diagonal.
I can't allow that strength to remain to force the Bishop to declare its intention.<n><n>Actually this is an error as 17. Bxh6 Bxh6, Qxh6 allows the knight to move to g5 forcing the Black queen to capture or else Qh7 mate
I'm fortunate that white also failed to see that mate in 4 and retreated.
I'm prepared to give it up as well as my gained pawn advantage from earlier if it opens up the long black diagonal.
Although she adopts the most passive option she could have taken. Better would have been e3 to claim the blank file, although I would have responded Re8 to pin the knight.
Inviting the en passant capture as my bishop can come into play.
But instead get this, the third move from this bishop and not once has it moved more than one square away from its home square. But it is trapping most of white's pieces behind a balance queenside pawn structure to try and get at my king and not giving queen or bishop much room to manouvre.
Pushing my bishop to here I'm hoping to eventually get full control of the long diagonal, especially if he uses the pawns to push me away.
And white starts the pawn push to get rid of the wrong bishop threat
The push continues
So I retreat my white bishop to the a file in the future hope of b5 trying to breach that line of pawns it needed.
At this point I couldn't believe my luck, there was no immediate threat and I could get my queen safely unto the black diagonal supported by my bishop straight away.
The tarrasch. I played this on the grounds it's the variation i least like to play against when I am black in a french. It will never refute the french but it can be very hard to create counterplay against it.
The Guimard. It has a dubious reputation and it blocks the ...c5 break, but it can't be bad to simply develop a piece. I tried to keep the position closed as I think Black may find his position a bit "gummed up" if he isn't too careful.
I am playing for the so-called "Universal system": I don't know any theory so I just develop my pieces on natural squares and hope for the best!<n> 4. c3 e5 5. dxe5 Nxe5 6. Ngf3 Nxf3  7. Nxf3 Nf6 With a slight plus for white according to Fritz, but with the e5 break obtained and even development, it feels pretty level to me. Given that 3...Nc6 presumably aims for a quick ...e6-e5 it feels wrong to let black get it in so quickly.
I am trying to argue that Black has misplaced his knight.
I found out after that this is theory: black gains a tempo for ...c5, but it seems very much like a normal Tarrasch.<n>6... f6 7. Ng5 Ndxe5 8. dxe5 fxg5 9. Qh5  g6 10. Bxg6  Kd7 11. f4 gxf4 12. Bd3 Nb4 13. Nf3 Nxd3  14. cxd3 Qe8 With equality according to Fritz, but long-term I would prefer white: the f4 pawn looks ropey and Black will have to mess about with his king to get the Bishop out. 15. Qh4 Qg6 16. O-O Qxd3 17. Bxf4 Bc5  18. Kh1 c6 With a slight edge to white, although black will have counter-chances against the white king so it's playable.
Black pressures d4, what will become the base of white's pawn-chain to gain time for development. White can either organise a king-side attack or play down the c-file if it is opened.
Protecting d4 and eyeing up c5 as well as freeing the path of the dark-squared bishop so white can complete his development. Contrast this with the black position and the hemmed-in light-squared bishop and inative d7 knight: these two pieces don't appear to have any obvious squares to go to.
Black is seeking to put pressure on the base of white's pawn-chain by attacking the knight, but he doesn't seem to have enough to disrupt white's play.
Obligatory really, but it's nothing to worry about as I cannot see how black can utilise the outpost on b4.
12... h6 Is gospel according to Fritz. It's hard to see why on the grounds I think the Bishop belongs on e3, discouraging any ...f6...e5 break by Black by pointing at the queen and overprotecting d4 and by extension the c5 outpost too.<n><n>12... Bb4 Prevents the rook going to e1, perhaps making ...f6 easier, but black's king-side looks a bit draughty 13.Qc2 with a plan of playing on the king-side with Nf3-g5 or down the c-file.
This opens the e-file for the white rook and allows white to complete development harmoniously. The B can always drop back to d3 if needs must.
This seemed like the best square for the rook. In the event of an ...e6-e5 break it points at the e6 pawn.
I am not convinced about this as black just seems to get left with a weak e6 pawn and even if he gets ...e6-e5 in, he'll get an IQP in return. However, it's hard to see a constructive plan for black here - he's solid but passive and by extension worse: As Mihai Suba said, chess is a dynamic game and black seems to lack dynamism.
After white's next, the e5 break is off the cards so I am not sure if the alternative captures help at all.
Pointing this at the queen, and reinforcing control over c5. It also rules out any ...e5 break for the time being. White will line up on the c-file and occupy c5 and e5 with knights if given the chance.
17... Bxd2 18. Qxd2 Ne4 19. Qc2 Leaves white with a slight but enduring advantage owing to the weak dark squares - white usually aims to exchange dark-squared bishops in this kind of line.<n><n>17... Bd6 18. Ng5 Re8 19. Qc2 h6 20. Nf3 With potential play on both sides of the board for white. A spatial plus means white can alternate play on both wings when black will struggle to regroup his forces in time.
The black knight has no decent square to retreat to.
Creating another backward pawn on an open file.
Giving the bishop options and forcing black further back.
5. d4 - white is developing a very strong centre.  After getting Henry to safety(?) on the kingside, this time I do manage to puncture an Expert's strong pawn centre in a timely fashion!  At least with the g7 pawn already moved, white would be hard pushed to find a smothered mate here!
6. .... e5 - now comes the push.  Dave pushes his pawn onwards rather than exchange.
12. .... Ne8 - hmm, Dave misses Nxe5.  However, there is the possibility of regaining my pawn by taking off his e4 pawn with my knight, discovering an attack on e5.  So, after 12. Nxe5, Nxe4 13. Nxe4, Bxe5, material is even.  However, I notice that the pawn is hanging so I decided to open up the h8-e5 line for Fou Lenoir.  I think my knight would be well placed on d6, hitting out at e4 and c4.  On the next turn that is just where my knight goes.
16. ..... Qxd7 - after a trade of bishops, Glenda comes out to play and reinforces the b5 square.  I don't think I would mind a white pawn on b5 though.  The seed of the Joblock Plan is already beginning to germinate.
18. ...... Rfe8 - just a little bit of scratching around to see what Dave does.  Although I am stumped for a plan here, at least I can put my rook on the same file as the Wicked Witch of the West.  Although I got into bother in my last game doing this, on a central file, I think it is OK here.
20. ..... Ra8 - Hmm, I think Dave is trying to double rooks on the a column.  I think my heavies ought to be in the near vicinity of it to prevent any ingress of white pieces into my pos!
22. Nd3 - Dave mirrors my plan of putting pressure on e5 and c5.  I think Fou Lenoir and my f pawn could be up to the task of defending e5 though.  c5 is already reinforced with a pawn on b6.  All very solid.
23. ..... Qc8 - Glenda my Good Witch of the North and the Wicked Witch of the West glare at one another on the c1-h3 column.  Will there be a trade off?  We shall see.
25. hxg4 - I trade, and now Dave has to contend with a doubleton on the kingside.  With me having a doubleton on the c column this appears to even up the game a little, although I may have to keep an eye on my h6 pawn because it is possible for Dave to double rooks on that column and try and provoke an ingress on it.  This must be prevented.
27. Rh8 - I think I will have one rook plus either Fou Lenoir or Henry guarding my h6 pawn.  This will free my other rook to move wherever he likes on the first rank.  My knight will hold firm on d6.  I have confidence that I can prevent an ingress and a zugzwang.  This can only mean one thing for me and Dave.  My mouse is already beginning to hover over that Offer Draw button!
30. Rh1 - before I hit the button, I must make doubly sure that Dave cannot make ingress.  Here, he is trying to pile up on the h column.
31. ...... g5 - Dave told me in a post-match pm that he thought that this was the move that threw away half a point.  Not sure there.  According to Gameknot Analysis it was an error-free game.  Neither side had committed so much as an inaccuracy.  Dave however thought that it had given me the chance to sew up the kingside.  He is right on there, but can he do something on the queenside?!  We shall see.
33. Nb5- Dave finally puts the question to my knight on d6.  I have been wondering whether he will do this for many moves now.  I decided to trade.  At least it does lock up b5 as I stated in one of my previous notes in the early part of this game.
34. .... Rh8 - now my queen rook decides to move to h8 and it is my king rook which will have a few moves at his disposal.
35. Nb2 - aha, this knight is trying to make an ingress into d6 and support a possible advance of the d pawn.  I must prevent this.  I have a concrete plan and once I execute it, I will then hit the offer draw button.
37. ..... Bd6 - Fou Lenoir occupies the berth that my queen knight had before I traded him off.  Now, Dave can trade off Fou Lenoir with my good blessing.  If he does then a black pawn will occupy the d6 square.  If Dave does double rooks on the h file then Henry will help my KR defend my h6 pawn.  This will free up my QR to move wherever he likes.  There seems to be no way of ingress.  The only way Dave can try to make progress is to sac his backward b3 pawn.  However, this is very risky and I didn't think that Dave would want to take such a risk.  I had in fact worked out that I would have been able to defend against this sac with my queen rook which would in turn support a passed black pawn.  At this juncture I decided to offer a draw.  I remembered something that Coach Ion had said in my epic draw game against The Master Mater.  "Bad Bishops make excellent defenders!"  I quoted that line to Dave in the chat after putting in my draw offer and he agreed with me and told me he would accept my offer and that I had given him a good game.  After acknowledging his complements with "Thanks" he then accepted my draw offer.  So, after incurring losses against IM Albertwall and Expert X, it was a great way to end my weekend!
I make a break from my usual development to stop Black's pawn chasing my bishop away... plus if I play my usual move (Ngf3) the pawn would fork the bishop and knight
considered moving the bishop to c7 to lure the rook out to c8, then I could make the knight pin the king and rook... but of course, there's Black's 2nd rook
I was focussing on the top part of the board too much - I didn't see this coming
b1 would have been better, making Black's bishop retreat, at the very least, and place a threat on Black's b7 pawn (to me at this point, any piece won is good) but then again, I'd have to move one of my kingside pawns before I attacked (mate with rook)
White got greedy, and now has to lose material.
His Bishop is hemmed in, his Knight is pinned, and his King is vulnerable.  Not good for White.
Forcing the King to retreat.  Now we can get things going.
Going after bigger steaks.  Not a strip steak, not a T-bone, but a Porterhouse, nice and juicy.
He doesn't want a triple fork.  I'm probably going to need one of those for my Porterhouse steak, perhaps he can lend it to me?
Where to move the Queen?  There are no good spots.
...that in this case (the only one I know) can't be followed by the Icelandic gambit, since after the exchanges black will have an isolani on the e column... not any good!
N looks as if to threat c7, but if fact he is aiming to e5, forking Q and B and resolving the tension in the center.
White reacts, and it seems a blunder. Now, I can take with the queen and the game is even. Or I can...
+6. A N pinned. Relatively safe Q. b2 is lost, but I would welcome to exchange one of white's bishops. It is starting to look hard for me to develop.
I though about Bb4 here, but Nc4 was awaiting me. Qxa7 would have been to insist on the classical "too greedy" mistake I was already in.
Guarding b2. I have to solidify, but in doing so, I wasn't answering the question "where to develop my lsb? How to bring the rooks into the game? How bitter feel all those pawns.
+6 and I should think about f6-e5 to win some manouver space.
Ok, white will get me by hunger, with waiting moves until I lose my temper. Which I am very willing to do, in spite of a counter unbalanced exchange that can rid off some of white's overwhelmigly well placed pieces.
Just to win a tempo for doubling rooks.
Sad necessity. I will lose a minor piece, leaving him the bishop's pair. But at least I had some mobility with my two rooks.
? Blunder. Bd7 and I will have to work hard to even save the R from an exchange.
I am dangerously driving his pieces to open field, knowing that minor piece's weakness against the rooks it the "two undefended sided pieces" situation.
Now, I will lose a rook for two minor pieces. I am +4 now, I will be +6 then, but I will lose some of the lonely pawns on the kingside. I can hope just to be an exchange and a pawn up. And with the feeling to have fooled a horrible death.
I can play c4, of course, but I liked to speculate on the king itself.
...and here my opponent abandoned the game. My queen pawns will cost white a piece each, and then, my rook will win.
My favorite French trick, though I never get to pull it off, is to follow 4. Bg5 with 5. e5 and win a knight. Black never seems to let me do it though. I blame the GK DB... Nevertheless, it's a good way to develop a piece, with a threat, and it nearly forces black's reply.
Time to poke the bear, see if he growls. The pawn on f5 is not protected, and can be freely captured, but white will reply with 12. Nxd5 threatening 13. Nc7+ and 14 Nxa8.
The e6 pawn is, in my opinion, the lynch pin of the French. So he dies, though black can replace him quickly enough if he chooses.
Preventing the pin by keeping the black bishop off of g4.
Planning to go to f5, though white is about to get sidetracked and it will take 6 moves to get this knight to f5.
Sidetrack. This knight wants to whelm upon the black bishop on e6.
Cogitating and cogitating. How white dearly would love to get his LSB on the h3-c8 diagonal and skewer the black queen to her king, but I could not find the way to force it to happen. Though, if I had not played 16. Nh4, the way would be open for 20. H4 threatening 21. Bh3. Not that I think that would have worked, and it's even less likely as a three-move combo. So, instead, white launches a mini-campaign against black's kingside pawns.
This feels wrong, or at least dangerous, to hunt pawns on the kingside while black is forming a powerful queenside attack. White's king may find himself in jeopardy, risking the loss of the game, while black is risking only the loss of pawns - quite an imbalance of risks.
White may be trying to do too much. This move threatens both h5 and Bh3, each of which creates problems for black. It might, however, have been simpler to just start with 23. Nd6+, offering to trade knight+pawn for rook, else winning the f7 pawn outright.
Black solved the threat of Nd6+, so white puts more pressure on black's king. Funny how a kingside pawn hunt turned into a harassment of black's king, way over on the queenside.
Black ignores the danger to his king, or more accurately, the danger to his other pieces that begins with a discovered check against his king, and launches an attack of his own. White must deal with the advanced black pawns before continuing with his own attack.
Put an ! on this move. 27. e6+! took a long time for me to work out, to figure out that all the angles were safe. With a combination of Qc7 and Rb3, white has several mating threats that black must carefully avoid. 27. ... Ka8 buys him the most time, but then he immediately loses material with 28. e7. White's pawn forks the two rooks, so 28. ... Nxe7 is forced, after which white plays 29. Nxe7 winning black's knight and threatening the black queen. 29. ... Qb6 blunts white's mating attacks but creates new problems after white plays 30. b3 and the black knight has nowhere to run. But any other queen move leaves black dangerously vulnerable to white's mating threats. And white still holds Qe5, forking the d5 and g7 pawns to win another pawn. Faced with all the threats, black chose to resign.
I seen that and thought he's probably going to try scholars mate
so I brought my knight out so if he tried move Queen to F3 I would go Ne5 to attack both queen and bishop and protect the mating square
but instead moves his Queen to H5 and then try and mate me on the F7 square
I went to E6 to protect the C5 Pawn but also stop checkmate
I attack it with the other Knight
I was suprised with this as I thought he would probably move it to E2
not playing the main line. the main line here was 10...Nc6 and keeps black ahead. the move in the game give white the advantage as Black's queen will soon be hanging on a5 and the b8 cant move to good positions.
???<n>I think that 0-0 is a must. now the black king is helpless in the middle of the board.
open up the lines and files.
soon, there will be no spots for the black king to run to.
and there is no hope for black...
White ignores my jibe and quite sensibly decides to maintain a passive stance, for now.
I cover my pawn and prepare to play d-5
So I push my d-pawn to it's limit and secure the boundaries..
Both preparing to castle...
Some may see this as a bad exchange for black, having doubled the c pawns, however in many cases I find the open B-file sufficient compensation..
May have been more efficient to have just put it there a move ago, white may have lost his tempo lead but I need to take advantage of that for it to be an issue...
I decided to deaden the scope of whites Bishop on e2...
This was bad on reflection, I should have just taken the pawn but I wanted to line my bishop up with the h2 pawn and maybe swing my Queen in front or behind the Bish....
And after getting my queen behind the bishop I go and wimp out of Bxh7+, why? I have no idea is the honest answer, but something about it didn't "feel" right at the time of play so cut my losses and retreated. :(
At this point the momentum begins to swing in whites favour as the previous concession exposed my reluctance to commit to a plan, which is one of the basic rules of chess, "you should always stick to your plan"! My opponent seizes his chance...
Preparing my defences and opening up some room for my rook to add support to the e-pawn..
Now we are engaged in a battle of wills, the tension in the centre of the board could snap at any moment with each player trying to figure out how the release of the tension can benefit them...
I felt I was safe enough to allow my h pawn to nudge the menacing Knight out of earshot...
After much deliberation I felt this to be Ok, doubling whites h pawns and opening up lines toward the white king, this must be weighed up against the very real possibility of white being able to sidestep with his king and take hold of the g file with a rook and my confidence in being able to defend against such a threat. 50/50.
Now the white king is exposed and I need to find a way to capitalise..
I offer up an exchange of queens and an open invite into a quiet endgame, politely exchanging off pieces and courteously racing to promote maybe...
Trying to defend as best I can really whilst always keeping attacking ideas in mind, white now has to defend f3..
Suddenly, whites attack appears to have run out of steam and is now on the defensive!
This is my second annotation. I hope everyone liked the last one. Anyway, this was against another 1300, and he also was very good. I want to say thank you to him for the game (I will be playing him again because this is from a mini-tournament.) So, thankyou:)
Yes, the knight is being pinned to the rook, but it is easy to get out of.
? Most people actually fall for this. On first thought, it looks like a harmless move which sort of develops the bishop with tempo. But if you look ahead, this actually loses a pawn.
notice that I cannot take the rook.
?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development.
!? This is an interesting alternative to 6.Qh3, and allows Black the possibility of 6...Rg8 7.Nxf8 Rg4 8.Qh6 Rxe4+, winning White's e-pawn with check and creating a potentially-strong attack down the e-file after 9.Be2 Qe7. Accordingly, it is somewhat less popular than 6.Qh3, though certainly still playable.
Black allows White the advantage of the bishop pair--if he wishes to take it in exchange for one of his only two developed pieces.
White accepts the proffered Bishop.
Rather than take the Knight immediately and return the initiative to White's hands, Black plays to win the e-pawn and set up a dangerous battery down the e-file.
More popular is 8.Qh6 Rxe4+ 9.Be2 Qe7 10.Nc3 Rxe2+ 11.Nxe2 Nd4 but I can see why White doesn't want to give up his material advantage this way. The text move allows the WQ to interpose along the e-file and defend c2 when needed, making 10...Rxe2 unwise.
!? This sharp move has some precedent at least as far back as 1995, but the game here is not between Masters ;) Black keeps the pressure on, as his Rook is not in any serious danger: 11.Nxe4 Qxe4 12.Qd3 Nxc2+ 13.Kd1 Nxa1 and Black will equalize with an eventual ...Kxf8. Skipping the capture doesn't leave White all that much better-off: 11.Qd3 Nxe2 12.Nxe2 (12.Nxe4 Nf4 13.Qf3 Qxe4+ 14.Qxe4+ fxe4 15.Nxh7 Nxh7 and Black is a pawn down but has reasonable compensation) 12...d5 13.Nxh7 Nxh7 and White will struggle to develop his queenside.
And here we are. Black has the advantage in mobility and development for the moment, but needs to convert it to something more substantial before White can mobilize his unopposed kingside pawn cluster.
?! White prevents a check on g2 (16...Ng2+? 17.Kf1 and the Knight is lost) and drives this Knight away. I think this move weakens White's pawns unnecessarily though (Black's Bishop is eyeing h3 hungrily), as he has no pieces ready to defend himself. I think 16.O-O was simpler and stronger here.
Black really wants to set up a mate with Bf3 and Nh3, but it's still a few turns away and he's going to need his Rook involved and his King out of the way first. He also has to be careful of ...Ng5 being answered by d3!
0-1. White sees the upcoming mate after 30.Kh1 (six moves; try to find it before looking below) and surrenders graciously. This game is (I think) a shining example of the kind of tactics characteristic of the Latvian. After the fifteen moves each, White had a small material lead, but not a single piece developed, and it took him too long to get his remaining pieces into the game--the final position says it all, where Black has all four of his pieces engaged in the mating attack, whereas White's Rook and Bishop are barely participating.<n><n>Thanks so much to enfuego7 for the game! Any comments on the analysis or the game itself are much appreciated; if you leave a rating please also comment letting me know why you rated the way you did. Thanks for reading!<n>.<n>.<n>.<n>30.Kh1 Bh3! 31.Rg1 (any other move allows 31...Bg2#) ...Nxg1 32.Kxg1 Nf3+ 33.Kh1 Rh8 34.Bh6 Rxh6 35.Rg1 Bf1#. Several shorter variations are possible.
!? I momentarily forget myself and thrust the d pawn forward, rather than the usual e-pawn.  As it wasn't deliberate, I can't really take credit for this gambit, but it works rather well.
immediately undermining the N's support, using the same method I usually employ in the Petroff
an option not available to Black in the Petroff.  This seems a sensible response, though it does block Black's WSB in.
so now I either give up castling or submit to doubled pawns or a big swap off: not ideal when I've given up a pawn.
retaking with the pawn to gain a tempo.  Doubled pawns can soon be sorted out and I've spotted a great square for the N.
Preparing to occupy the open file and tucking my K away.
unpinning the N and setting up my first attack on the K's position.
with the N ready to go to f4, perhaps not the best response.  11... g6 also looks unappealing, though, with White's QB ready to go to h6.  11...f5 is even less appealing when W can hit the Bg4 with 12. h3 and then pick off the f-pawn.
forcing Black into an awkward choice: where to move the B?  Only d7 or c8 look safe but d7 deprives the N of another square and c8 is completely undeveloping.
Now Black has a serious problem trying to complete his development and White's kingside attack is almost ready.
after a long think, removing the sting from the planned fork and attacking my R, which wants to move anyway ... Hang on, I still need to develop my DSB.  Now's my ideal opportunity, connecting my Rs
pinning the N and adopting an aggressive posture but inviting
I'd been planning the more modest lift to e3 but this asks the Q an immediate question.
and again, but these moves help me to reconfigure my attack on h7
Now, if Black took on e5, I planned to prosecute my attack regardless: 24... fxe5 25. Qh7  Kf7 26. Qxg7  Ke8 27. Rxe5  but I'm not sure what happens after 27... Kd8
double-edged, as now I have to beware of allowing ...f4, forking Q and R
I decide to keep Qs on in pursuit of the win
Now I fear that I've blown it.  My initiative is dribbling away and Black may soon be able to develop his QN and QR
I could have won back the pawn immediately by swapping Qs and taking on f5 but I preferred to maintain the pressure.  I was 40 minutes ahead on the clock.
! the K is overloaded and the Q falls.  Black resigned.
The bishop/knight exchange relieves the knight's defense of d5, where white can push the black queen around a little, and maybe bring some power down on the king's pawn fortress.
The rook will keep black's knight pinned until black moves his king.  White is only up one pawn at this moment, but it will be easier to trade rooks from here.  Every even exchange makes white's one pawn more valuable.  Finally, black's queen is really boxed in as well.  Qd7 is blocked by Nb6+.  Black will have to spend several moves getting material off the back row--moves white will exploit taking pawns or setting up other costly trades.
White is only ahead two points after the exchange.  QxN opens up Qg5.  White's undefended bishop could move to e4 to protect the undefended pawn.  Most scenarios look pretty good for white at this point.
An honorable gentleman must accept!
An unusual, and somewhat conservative, variant.
Adding support to the advanced KBP, but because of Black's 3rd move, the supporting Pawn itself is now vulnerable.
Tucking the King in what Black thinks is the safest available spot, while adding a guard to the KBP.
Threatens 10 Q-R7 mate. If Black creates a flight square with 9... R-K1, 10 BxP ch gives Black the choice of 10... K-R1 11 Q-R7 mate or 10 K-B1 11 N-R7 ch with mate or overwhelming material gain for White to follow shortly.
Renewing the mate threat on KR7. Black resigns [10... R-K1 11 QxP mate.]
Not a fan of this, but some are, but have to deal with it before it becomes a problem.
Capture would be stronger as it allows me to develpe.  Also a second bishop move in the first 4 moves.
Gain some queen side space as well as force the bishop to move again.
Have to do this for defence as the bishop on c1 can pin my knight.
Open the f file with a capture or the d file with no capture as I would own d 5 3times to my opponent twice.
I never capture here as it opens up a file for me.  If I captured instead it would open up the a file for my opponent.
Brain cramp on my part as I leave the e5 pawn undefended.
And a good move spoting it.
Have to play a bit of defence as the knight can cause problems.
3 pawn islands with this move, but have more space on the board.
This move allows me to trade a rook for a bishop, knight and pawn.
And good move to protect against the upcoming fork if queens get traded.
But since they are both on the board, this spells the end with a sacrifice.
and a nice rook sacrifice to finsh it.
There it is.  I hope some on the team can add some more comments to help out Jerry as his game is getting stronger but I do know others on the team can add more info to help him out.  Thanks!!
A crucial win from last week's match, which helped take us to the top of the table.  I gained a crushing grip at the end of the opening, which I maintained through the middle game, but then lost my way in trying to force the win with a king chase when swapping off to capitalise on my material advantage would have won more easily.
I like to play this before Black can defend with a piece to give Black an isolated a-pawn , which is, potentially, a weakness but can also become a remote passer if not watched properly.
Playing simple, direct, chess, I'm trying to make Black's development as awkward as possible.  This pin starts to keep Black tied up as, if his Q moves, the K is tied to defending it.If he castles, his Q can't move and neither can the N.  I was hoping maybe to provoke ...f6, weakening the K's defence.
Occupying the half-open e-file and setting up potential pins that could lead to gain of material.
?  I think this was the losing move as it surrendered the open black diagonals to by B and Q.  Patrick also thought it had been a mistake when we chatted afterwards.  The motivation behind it was obviously to give me weak isolated doubled pawns but Black never got to exploit them.
The B, no longer defended by the N, had to swap quickly before I could recapture on c3.
! This defends the pawn and attacks the R on h8, denying Black the chance to castle.  It also allows me quickly to centralise my other rook.
Black appears to be freeing himself up, possibly preparing to advance his d-pawn but he has to watch out for mate threats.
This frees my Q from the duty of defending c3, while also preparing to double rooks or perhaps swing across to attack the h-pawn.
? Now the e-pawn is pinned against the Q rather than the K and the d-pawn has no other defender,so ...
? I soon felt that this was a mistake, allowing Black to escape his bonds.
Forks c3 and f6.  If I don't do something effective soon, he will free up his Rg8 and equalise.
Re-establishing the bind and threatening mate.
Going after a back rank check to win the Rg8 in due course.  I was about half an hour up on the clock now and maintained that till the end.
Black played this with a look that said he'd more or less given up hope and was just trying to create complications.
? This N was defending the Rg8.
The N was controlling 3  squares I wanted to use for my hunt.
and now all the spectators were silently screaming for me to swap on c2...
? but no, I stubbornly kept the rooks on in my search for mate, pausing at least to guard against Black queening easily.
and, with 33 seconds remaining on his clock and 6 points behind once more, Black finally resigned.
Repaid in kind. It is noted that with the black pieces, RJF tried to castle kingside early, and this move aids that idea, as well as exerting influence in the middle.
Going for a quick queenside expansion right away. I guess the d and e pawns haven't quite learned to walk yet....
And the plan of RJF is obvious. Bishop to g7 and castling are next....no surprise there.
RJF finally stakes a claim in the center.
And it appears that Byrne owns the center.
And now RJF blocks in his light squared bishop. I wonder if he really knows how to play this game;)
Strong....rook to half open file, and protecting the d pawn.
Last piece developed, with a nice little pin to boot.........
Byrne now entertains the idea of getting his knight to e5 or g5.
! Weakening the d pawn, and seeing play down the e file. If white takes, then the Be7 is pinned against the king next move.
And closes.....
And opens.....
And closes....
! Preserving the strength of black's light squared bishop.
A last chance effort to free the rook is coming.....
Grabbing yet another pawn for free if the king budges.
Not willing to give up the Bd5 under any circumstance.
Byrne's inner vocabulary was probably insulting to Fischer's mother.....
And father.......
And siblings....
And extended family....
And dog.....
I am usually at a loss when trying to create a pawn storm.  Should it be a single mayhem-maker, or a time-consuming swarm?  This time, a swarm seemed to work.  I was proud to play this deeply into a territorial battle, against a much higher-rated opponent here. I play white, and comments most welcome!
Providing an escape squre for the DSB and limiting the Nf6 simultaneously.  It was not necessary until h5 was played, but this is one of those quick blitz moves that seems to serve my clock management well.
Black continues development, but this move seems very quiet.  A kingside breakthrough must be played, and time is of the essence.
Of the two options available to the bishop, this one seemed better, with more scope, but it doesn't look spectacular there, does it?
This move, but I was stabbing in the dark.  As I said, I get the idea of a pawn storm, I just don't know how to make one work in a time-efficient way.  However, I felt that there was some time to spare here--I felt that my kingside defences were relatively resilient, and took the time to complete a full-on pawn storm.
?  Did Black push the wrong pawn here?  This move blocks his finacetto bishop, although I suppose  12...e5 can be met by  13. d5 and the result is the same.  Perhaps 12...Nh5 followed by f5 and attempting a kingside breakthrough was a better plan for black.  As it is, this allowed...
Strong.  14. Nc3xNe4 is impossible due to 14...dxNe4 forking the B and N.  The N on c3 is hanging, so it must be protected or moved, and I must accept doubled pawns on the g file.
Perhaps Nb5, with the possibility of Qa4 to follow and threats on a7, was possible?  But after a6 the N would be forced to the rim.
Black opts to double my pawns.
The king side is less solid now, and the mighty DSB is off the board, but I have an open file for my rook in exchange.
A decent idea, I guess, putting the rook on the file that looks likely to open, in line with my queen.  But I am now under little pressure, and though I could afford to walk out of a potential pin on the Nc3 if necessary, so I forged ahead.
Here it is--the sledgehammer approach to a kingside breakthrough, attacking the strong pawn twice.
Now I'm flummoxed.  How to proceed?
Black tries to diffuse the situation, taking the rooks off the board.
This was my try.  Was it best?
I try to create some mayhem.
? Was BxN better?  I think allowing this N to advance was the losing move.
?  This drops the bishop.
The N is untouchable due to the royal fork, but in the heat of blitz, this went unnoticed.
Nope.  Pd5 forks black's rook and knight.
trying to fork knight and bishop if knight should take e5...
black's defensive knight looks like it will be difficult to dislodge, so I opted to try and castle with the prospect of f-file pressure
after this simplification white has the better bishop, but his pawns are much worse.  I was thinking about swinging my h-rook to f8, f4, then h4 and playing e4 to develop pressure on h7, but this probably would have been too slow.
a questionable pawn sac meant to open some lines to the black king.  I am playing desperately here.
threats of rook h-8 to b8 and then b2
black should have simplified and headed into a winning endgame.  it's probably no excuse, but both sides are under time pressure here.
black has under a minute and i proceed to ignominiously harry him with a series of checks.
Black locks in his light-square bishop.
Black sacs the exchange.
Here, e5 would get rid of the weakness and give Black active piece play.
Forced, due to the pin on the e-file.
The bishop is hanging due to the pin on the knight.
Rxg6 was better. Now Black's rook is useless.
The only move I could find in any quick reference was 2. ... d5, but the GK DB seemed to like 2. ... e5 just as well, so I tried it this way.
White kept the black bishop off of g4, but he weakened his castle to do it.
Aniticipating the inevitable Nb5, and also preparing b5 for a black pawn if the desire arises.
White pins, black forces the issue, and white exchanges. Black now has the bishop pair.
White attacks black's bishop and he has to be saved first.
White played the only defense. Black intends to open the f-file for more pressure, or to put a rook on g6, whichever comes first, and maybe both.
White alleviated the pressure, so black decides to exchanges some material.
Saving the black rook that has been en prise for 5 moves and driving away the white knight.
Doubling rooks on the soon-to-be-half-open f-file.
This doesn't really win another pawn since black can't hold onto it, but it prevents white from gaining a pawn with dxe4.
Defends the pawn at d6. If white plays 26. Nxd6?, black replies with 26. ... Rd7 skewering the two knights and winning one of them.
Now that the white rook would defend the skewered knights, black must see to the defense of d6.
Well, that tears it. It's two-on-one attacking the doomed black pawn on d6. Black can't save it. Or can he? I entered the next two conditional moves and crossed my fingers. No, not hope chess, because the move was necessary to save the pawn either way, but I was hoping for a happy outcome.
White took the bait and now he loses a rook. That d6 pawn sold his life dearly. Sometimes the best defense is to not defend.
30. Kg2 seals white's fate. Yes, it was fairly well sealed anyway, but now his king is trapped and will never be able to get past the black rook. 30. Kf3 seemed to be called for, so the white king would at least have a chance to stop the pawn on the e-file from promoting, and he might also support his own queenside pawn majority, although it would mean he could never reach black's passed pawns on the g and h files.
The white king cannot reach his own pawns, nor can he reach the passed black pawn on the e-file. White's knight is the only piece that can prevent that passed pawn from promoting, and black's move 31. Nc4 covers the pawns advance. At this point, that pawn will promote, or it will cost white his only remaining piece to stop it.
White saved his pawn, but that is why black played 31. ... Nc4. After black advanced the e-pawn, white realized he had to sacrifice his knight to prevent the promotion, and he chose to resign instead of play out a hopeless endgame down by rook, knight, and pawn - and black was never going to let that white king cross the f-file so support the white pawns. A small point of interest: it took 46 days to play 32 moves, and at least three of the moves here at the end (black's 28th, 29th, and 32nd) were entered as conditional moves. During that time my GK rating increased 197 points (including 5 from this win) and I'm now rated 253 higher than my opponent, a 255 point swing. A lot can happen in a month and a half. Our other game ended much more quickly, and much more abruptly, on 2/13/09 and can be found in the public annotations on that date titled "The Price of Slow Development".
The computer calls this an inaccuracy.
Trying to open the e file.
To
To add even more pressure.
And here it is: the bomb.
!? There's a book out with the amusing title "Play 1. b4!: Shock your opponents with the Sokolsky". I have to admit, it personally never failed to shock me so far, because it is so unusual! White doesn't occupy the center, but plans to do that indirectly with the dark-squared bishop which will be placed on the long diagonal soon. Another opening following that strategy, which is probably more calm (because the pawn isn't placed on Black's dark-squared bishop diagonal immediately) is 1. b3 -- this is called the "Nimzowich/Larsen Attack".
I decide to exchange my central pawn to White's non-central queen-side pawn, an action which increases the opponents impact on the center. But for that, I enjoy a gain of development. Another very interesting option, which maintains central control and has been played frequently by grandmasters, would have been 2... f6.
Performs the indirect pawn exchange and threatens to take on g7 as a little bonus.
Defends g7, develops the knight and prepares to castle king-side. The other option, namely 3... f6?!, looks dubious to me.
Developing with a gain of tempo. If White doesn't want me to possess the pair of bishops (and thus the minor imbalances), he has to move his attacked dark-squared bishop...
Time for gaining some central control with my d-pawn. In earlier games I preferred to play d6 instead of the last knight move to banish the opponents bishop, but I figured out it would be better to perform a double-step with the pawn because it increases central control and -- for me personally more important, because that often has been a problem! -- it enables my bishop to retire to d6 or e7, in case it is attacked or wants to aim for the king-side.
I'm not sure whether this can be considered a good move. It looks very active to me and I usually like pinning my opponents knight with the bishop, but in this case it isn't pinned at all; quite the contrary, it could be dangerous for me, because if White's knight moves, my bishop is under attack and he threatens to win material.
Increasing central control, but also limiting the scope of the dark-squared bishop -- following the definition, it is a "bad bishop" now.
The knight has a nice home there for a short time, as it can't be attacked by the d-pawn anymore.
Of course, White wants to get rid of my knight by attacking it with a knight of his own. Besides of that, my light-squared bishop is under attack, so I have to do something about that.
Enabling to recapture with the bishop, in case White wants to exchange knights (which I have to assume).
Okay, White decides to attack my bishop before. Notice that this move blocks White's dark-squared bishop even more. His only possibility for active play would be on a3 by now.
My bishop retreats to a place that is better anyway, aiming White's king-side. At this point I was glad about my decision to take a double step with the d-pawn earlier in the game. If the pawn were on d6, my bishop would have to reside on the queen-side, being really useless.
White wants to open things up, forcing me to lose my remaining central pawn.
I would have only done a favor to White if I took with the pawn. Instead, I wanted to recapture with the knight to place it more centrally.
White finally develops his knight with a double attack on Black's knight and bishop.
Forced, if I don't want to lose the pair of bishops (or material, of course).
Hooray, the mate in two I hoped for is working this way! But as soon as I can tell the mate can't be avoided anyway at this stage.
Mate with by bishop, nice one. A nice example showing how to create king-side attack. However, as mentioned earlier, I guess the major mistake by White here was 18. f3??, so he helped me very much. On 18. Bf3 we likely would have played an ordinary, overall equal endgame. I have to check what Fritz says on that. Anyways, I hope you had fun reading this annotation and feel free to comment, for whatever reason (critique, praise, suggestions...)!
Hi everybody, just to continue my theme of making blunders under pressure this time it is my buddy dmaestro who is on the receiving end.  A lot of the time dmaestro has caused me many problems and I have suffered from serious passivitis against him so I am glad to give something back here!  I kick off with c4 which is the English Opening.
15. Nd2 - the knight retreats to add protection to  the e4 pawn.  Dmaestro, however chooses to advance his f pawn - he is trying for the standard kingside pawn attack where he is trying to keep my pieces confined to the queenside.
19. Rc1 - after an exchange of bishops I decide to put my rook on the same file as the Wicked Witch of the West.  Never a bad plan to do this unless the Witch is threatening mate on the move!
23. Bc3 - the start of a plan to open up the queenside.
27. bxc5 - as the f3 pawn is adequately defended I continue to give my pieces some air on the queenside with the possibility of winning either the d pawn or the b pawn depending which pawn takes on c5.
29. Qxf3 - Glenda must recapture as the g pawn is pinned - she also comes closer to Henry.
31. Ba5 - reinforcements on the queenside - I have Bc7 in mind, piling up on the d6 pawn.   I also plan to put my other rook on a1 to add fuel to the fire.   Dmaestro succumbs under this pressure by waving the white flag!
f5? This seemed like a mistake right away. I've seen this move vs d4 and also vs f4 Bird's opening. It comes up in the Kings Gambit, e4--e5, f4--f5, but here it isn't challenging anything and weakens the king-side.
It has led to this where White is clearly better as a result of Black's poor piece placement, backward e pawn, and lack of king safety.
Now Iv'e eliminated the strong bishop and the queenside now will not provide good castled protection.
Black didn't see the problem the rook lift at a3 was going to cause.
Now is where I'm going to go to work--I have the space and the piece placement and what I want is to sacrifice the exchange at h6 and rip open his king position.
He has to lose a piece in this sequence and again just didn't see it coming.
That definetly did it. Now it would be a matter of being careful not to give a stalemate.
A true member of the schablone family... If we can play this happily ever after, this game will surely draw... So white has to break the symmetry... But how? 5. Bb5+ will surely do the trick, but after c6, Bd3, Bxd3, Qxd3, Bd6, the position is fairly equal... And in blitz, you only get five minutes, to prove any point...<n><n>>>>>>Special note to water123: nobody cares what you think. I call my opponents not by name, to protect their privacy, whether they win or lose... We call this respect, something you've never heard of. You do not only insult me, but also my opponent(s).<<<<<
Of course, black can't copy-cat 5. ... c5? 6. cxd5 exd5 (cxd4?, Qa4+) 7. Qb3! Qb6, which leads to a dead position, for black... But this is the right moment to strike, since black has Bb4+ left, without Nc3; plus: white ruled out Bb5+...
First things have to be first... This is forced, otherwise this pawn will get to c3, plus coverage via b4... There is no use in preventing Nc3, because of f6... Plus, black has always Nxf4, and his strong bishop on d6...
This checkmate felt to me like a legals mate. It was only a bit like it, but it still used bishops and knights.
Planning to get his bishop out. Perfect time to get into action.
D4 is my attack. I have a harder to find attack on h6, and his bishop.
Now I have a free bishop, and am close to his king, the invasion part.
The f7 attack I planned earlier is now in action. No longer avoidable by D5, but by e6
if I were to lift my knight up now, it would be checkmate. Another 5 moves and it is. A free queen doesn't matter.
But that did not quite do it for black. A discovered kill makes it easier to win.
...Bg7# This is not a common checkmate that you come by. Many of you may disagree. "this is nothing like a legals mate." That is because it isn't. only 1 piece is even ON the 4th rank, it just feels to me like there are so many ways to checkmate in positions, and legals seems a way you can call it. Give me other ways to call it in the comments please, if you don't agree. See ya for now.   <n>       Posthuma
Being the c pawn still in c7, it is not difficult to control the white's lsb.
Preventing an early e5, that can be annoying.<n>c6 makes sense, too, fighting for the center (e6, d5). But I didn't want to keep my pieces undeveloped because of f4 and a possible early attack on my kingside.
Clearly aiming to f4.
White doesn't seem to want to play e4, so it's time to get some control of the center.
Standard moves right now. I hate to develop bishops on d7 or e7, since they seem very inactive, there. But I had no choice. I don't want to play e6 because I don't want to trap my own bishop, so unless it becomes unavoidable, I won't do it.
Just a profilactic move, nobody is taking initiative. I don't see a real plan. White still has f4, but probably he is waiting for me to go somewhere so he can play the knight or the bishop to f4, instead. <n>But in doing so, he is weakening the kingside, unnecessarily, since neither the knight or the bishop are doing anything in g4...
It was difficult for me to go on. Maybe h5 would have been the right attacking move. With the played move, I was looking for a surprising future b5, but in doing so, I left the white knight a wonderful outpost on a4-b6.
White doesn't seem to want to take advantage of it, so the game proceeds in a - not clear what to do fashion, and begins to be "squeezed".
I am trying to bring my pieces over the kingside, and preparing b5. <n>Now, if white plays f4, I can try Ng5 as a dubious sac, or he wins two tempoes.
Despite all my good intentions, I couldn't see a good sac yet. Not without a rook on h1. And no way to get there easily. <n>Bxh3 (BxB, Nf3+ and...?), or Ng5+, hxN... what? Maybe Qxg5 could have given me something, but in order to play it I must have taken the bishop out of the way...<n>White's move IS a loss of tempo, after Bf4 (?)
This is useless, just a loss of tempo. Since I didn't dare to sac, I had to proceed somehow.
This move is just to gain some space, but my aim is to use the inactive a rook in order to defend the e7 pawn. I don't want to move the pawn because I want to keep the diagonal free for my queen as long as possible, but Nf6 is "blocked" because Bxe7, then Bxd6 would be nasty moves.<n>And Re8 seems weird, since sooner or later the f column will play a role in all this, for sure.
Not Bxb5 because of Nxb5. I don't want to lose my bishop because I feel it has a lot of squares to be useful.
As foresee, and I have tempo to play...
A sad decision. Probably white is thinking about d4 - a good option to open the game a little. But it didn't consider the tactic I have.
I think NxB and Rg1 are clearly better. <n>Now, I am only +1, but white pawns on the h column are sad. Anyway: be careful, because the g column is open to him, and my king is just behind. <n>I don't have a clear win just now, but I knew I didn't want to lose my dsb, and Bh8 is really dangerous. So...
I realized I had to open the game, since my pieces were lacking freedom. With the white king exposed, it must be good for me anyway.
Looking for exchanges in order to loosen the position.
I thought about BxN, exB, Bf4+. It souds very strong, because the king cannot go to h2. Kf6, e4+... ok, but I didn't see a clear win, so I decided that to open the f column will be the key (remember my comment about the importance of the f column).
Rxe4, BxN, and Bxe4, Rxf2+, then Qxh3 (you see, not to play e6 was a good decision...)
If NxB, the correct move to win is Bxe5!
I liked my open acres on the Q-side and was determined to restrain the remote isolated passed pawn.
An interesting offer of the exchange...
Already a pawn and the exchange up, Black has swapped the R for a B and 2 pawns, so is still material up: 3 pawns.
At this point, with my opponent on about 6 minutes left, I pointed out that he needed to write up his last 20 moves in his own time and an arbiter agreed.  He did that and then didn't have to record any more...
Good supporting move and opening lines for Black's Kingside Bishop
Move Black King to safety. Better is e5 leads to the exchange which wins a knight and a pawn for a bishop and a pawn.
a good tactical move Forking Black Bishop and Knight
Better is Bd7  which leads to exchange 11.exd6 Qxd6 12.dxc5 Qc7 13.a3 Na6 14.Be3 b3 wins a pawn for a bishop and a pawn.
Black replies with its own attack of Rook at a1. Better is Nc6, which leads to 13.Bxc6 Rb8 14.Bf4 Rb615.Be4 cxd4 16.Qd3 Bb7 17. Bxh7  Kh8 wins a pawn for a knight and a pawn.
Slighty better is e5 which supports d4 and threatened Bishop at f5

white offering a exchange to open either e or f file.
I decided to use the French Defence for its superior structure and difficult-to-penetrate barriers.
White takes on c6 forcing an exchange and preventing c6 unless I decide to lose a tempo.
9. exf6 is good for black because I can now develop my knight and recover a piece -- two birds with one stone.
I should castle long here.  White's idea is to attack on the king side, and I am a pawn short on the f-file.
I play 11. . . h6 with idea 12. . g5.  In retrospect, I lose a tempo on a weak move.
I am looking to exchange material with 13...Ne4?, and white obliges with 14. Nxe4.
But 13...Ne4 gives white space, puts another white piece on the attack, and places black at a disadvantage.  My saving grace, however, is the pawn on d4.
With 16...Bd6?, I plan to exchange dark-squared bishops, but white sees it differently.  I forgot my ideas at 15. and regretfully leave f6 open.
17. Nf6 thwarts my plan.  Now I have to play 17. . . Rxf6 to save my queen.
I sense impending danger in 19. Qh5 . . . 20. Qh6+. . . 21. Qh7++, so 18. . . Qf5 seems feasible.  At this point, I would like to get the queens off of the board.  If white denies an exchange, then my fork will yield white's bishop.  If white exchanges queens, black gains an improved pawn structure.
I am able to recover material and thwart white's king-side attack.  I am still sans one rook, but I have both bishops.
After 22. . . Bxf1, I am finally in a good position to win.
Black activates the rook to center.
I should have played 27...b6 to stop the rook on b3.  Instead, I looked to get a passed pawn with the pinned pawn on f3.
29. . . Re8?? was a fatal blunder.<n>Two of my weaknesses are the queen and bishop on the periphery.  I was blind at this point. <n>I should have come up with a plan to de-position, exchange, or capture white's queen.
33. . . Qxe7 would only be met with 34. Qxe7+ and the win was a matter of promotion or bringing in the king for mate.  Resignation here was necessary.
OK, this pawn push was needed to protect the e pawn.
Nimzovitch tells us to act in the center.  So, were I Black, ... f6 would be my move. <n><n>Now, this a4 move works out for White in the game, but I am generally skeptical of these pawn pushes. I would be expecting g5 or f6 and would likely have moved my Bishop to c3 first.
I'm thinking Qd2, anticipating ... f6 or ... g5 and wanting to backstop my Bishop and position my Queen to help protect my advanced Kingside pawns.
Black has the better game at this point in my opinion.  ...g5 then ... gxf4 or Ng6 and Black attacks the center.
Now we expect Black to use his superior center. Qe3+, then e5, then f5 or f6 and a counterattack begins.
A mistake. White seems to have just one thing on his mind!  Qg3 was necessary to defend the King, to prevent Black's counterattack (at last).  Black would follow with moves like h5, e5.
Better e5 first, driving away the Knight. BUILD the attack.
At this point, a piece ahead, I would exchange my Queens.
A blunder.  Now Rxa7.  If RxR, then Qe4+, taking the Rook and beginning the march of pawns with e5! This is Black's game now to lose.
Qxg3!  Then, perhaps ... Qxg3; Bxg3, Rf8; Bd6, Rfxb8; axb8(Q), Rxb8; Bxb8. White's ahead and should want to exchange Queens.
Now I imagine Qf6. There is a recurring theme here, that you can build the attack.  <n><n>The pawn on a7 is safe and the Rook is busy protecting the back rank.  Let's get more pieces in on the attack.  <n><n>You can imagine Qf6, then Be5 threatening mate. Queens will get exchanged and White's bishop will land on f6, limiting the King's movement. Then Rb1-Rb8+ (Black cannot take the pawn on a7 because of Rb8 mate). If Black takes the rook, then the pawn Queens.  Black will lose his rook with the check.  IfThe Black King will start running, with h6 as a start.
Another game from the 54th GK Tournament. Again I am black, and again I am faced with my favorite move and reply with the Sicilian - I don't like playing against the Sicilian, so it seems natural that I should return the favor to white.
This used to be known as the Philidor Variation (2. f4), something of a reversed Dutch position. Way back in 1834, Louse-Charles Mahe de La Bourdonnais played his greatest match of his career, hailed by many as a world championship match (though there was no title back then) against Alexander McDonnell. In that match, La Bourdonnais demonstrated that this variation is not sound and allows black to equialize efficiently. Today it's better known as the Grand Prix Attack, or the McDonnell attack. Me, I really know nothing about this attack, so I let the DB guide me through my next few moves.
In for a penny, in for a pound. Black gains a bunch of turf on the queenside chasing the white bishop around, but the white bishop gains a strong position on d5. For now.
Time to chase away a bishop.
Or not. Black voluntarily doubles his pawns on the d-file, but this is generally not very weak, and either way, it was going to happen, on d5 or d4.
12. Qe1 seemed a bit unusual to me. The point is the discovered attack after exd6, but since black has Be6 and Qxd6, discovered attack won't go far. Consequently, a rook on e1 instead of the queen seems more dangerous - rooks on open files and mobile queens for attacking all over the board. Maybe white planned to push his d-pawn soon and wanted his queen to defend his knight on c3 against black's fianchettoed bishop on g7.
The black bishop overextended himself. White defended his knight avoiding a potentially ruinous doubling of pawns and exposure of the white king, and at the same time she threatens the black bishop who must retreat (defense is not an option since black intends castling kingside and wants his queen to remain mobile).
White opened a line for his bishop and black advanced his knight with tempo, then castled. This position looks very much even right now.
White's attack on the queenside is met by black's attack into the center. Black would like to open the a1-h8 diagonal for his bishop.
White's queen has made 4 moves and yet is standing on e1, only one square away from where she started. Of course, white wanted to be able to recapture on e5 and also wanted to get his queen off the open f-file so black cannot get a discovered attack or pin with his rook on f8.
Black's bishop on g7 dearly wants a piece of white's rook on a1. All that stands in the way are a pair of white knights. With the queen on b6, black threatens a discovered check with 21. ... cxb5 which will win the white knight. I was hoping this move would invite white to move his knight off of c3, leaving the other knight pinned on the long diagonal, but I was expecting either 21. Kh1 or 21. Rf2 to prevent the discovered check.
White took me by surprise with this move. Obviously, his plan is 21. ... Bxd5 22. Nd7, forking queen and rooks and winning the exchange. This speculative sacrifice, if it works, could trade evenly, two white knights for a black rook + pawn, and has the added advantage of blunting black's attack. However, white miscalculated. 21. Nxd5? simply loses his knight for a pawn - if white stops here to reconsider.
Nb1c3, and I have an awkward position to say the least.
Nd6 , this was simply played to prevent black from castling.
This was the key move for me.  It exposes my king to an easy check, but that's what I want.  Then Black can move his knight to a5 and double attack my bishops, but he didn't look any further than that...
... and the trap is set.  Black is thinking he is going to end up with a bishop advantage, but I had sacrifice planned from the time f4 was played.
and it begins
my pawns also provide a nice barrier to seal off Black's Queen from coming to the defense.
time to chip away at Black's weakened king side defenses and maintain heavy pressure... notice also how Black's light square bishop is locked in and consequently keeps his other Rook locked in.
and mate!
Another game that I think I played well other than a few mistakes, but I have only been playing for 7 months at this time so mistakes are going to happen. Fell free to comment if you see something I did not. I will try to learn all the abbreviations for pieces and moves in the future but I will do my best for now.
This is how I was opening up most of the time for awhile. I grew not  so fond of it because if I move my Q pawn to d3 I end up leaving my bishop open for a pawn attack.
We are both loaded up for a big exchange.
Trying to force something to happen. I feel I have control of the center and want to see his reaction to my push.
Defending his bishop from advancing to b5. Maybe not a very good move.
After he castles I start to push my pawn attack. I should be able to castle in the next few moves and bring my other rook into the game.
I did not like that knight coming down on me. I struggle sometimes with defending the knight attacks. Maybe I have not been playing long enough to fully understand the best ways to defend them.
Now that my rook's are where I want them I will continue my push with the pawns.
This was a big mistake. Now I get  a bishop for free.
Following a nice plan in a Carlsbad pawn structure, helped me to get a couple of pawns material advantage, then some unfortunate piece placement by black allowed to increase the advantage and even exchange a queen for two rooks into a won endgame, black still tried some perpetual after a nice quiet move 31...g5 to open the h7-b1 diagonal, if my rook abandons the 1st rank, then black's queen would give check either on b1 or h7 and I could have had done nothing to prevent it, finally black blundered and allowed white to control h7 preventing the referred perpetual
so now we have a Carlsbad pawn structure white allows black's light squares bishop more freedom than he would usually has in the Queen’s Gambit Declined, but in return, white fixes the central pawn structure, has a half-open c-file, and a pawn-majority in the centre. From now on white has three possible plans for the middlegame:<n><n>a) castle queenside and attack black’s king by means of a pawn-storm<n>b) make use of the central pawn majority, with Bd3, Qc2 and Nge2<n>c) make a minority attack by the advance of the b pawn hoping to create weaknesses in black's queen side<n><n>Black on the other side has some counter-play in form of a minority attack on king side with the pawn push f5-f4, or exploit white weaknesses on c4 and e4<n><n>I'll try "plan B", with an eye for a possible  swindle back to "plan A"
castle for safety and to connect the rooks
another mistake, this move is only viable if white doesn't play Qc2, now black will lose a pawn, to increase white's pawn majority in the centre
giving up the bishop pair for a pawn and a strong pawn majority on the centre of the board
An interesting novelty, already tried were Bf6 and Qa5, both moves lead to wins by white, Black has a bishop pair and is playing a solid move developing his last piece to were it controls c4
to support the d pawn push if ever needed, also leaves the c column for the a rook, Nc3 will follow...
now two ideas for white to get back a bishop for a knight depriving black of his bishop pair, although not my preferential bishop as we would end up with opposit colours bishops, and to play Nd6 forking the rook and b7
black opts to keep both bishops on board
so again "plan B" Now I expect Re7 Nf5 with another fork this time on bishop and rook
again the threat to exchange the knight by a bishop, now with two pawns advantage
hitting both c6 and the square c5
this move by black gave me some ideas: is maybe possible to consolidate the position and try then the clearance of the c column to play Bc7 with a fork on rook and queen
first step of the wanted consolidation to open an escape from back rank mate to my king
inviting black to exchange his rooks for my queen, or to play Re6 and lose yet another pawn with no compensation
a zwischenzug to force the pin of the bishop which guarantees white's advantage
and now the second rook
doubling rooks on c column protects the c8 rook and threats to bring the final rook in to the fight
! Nice quiet move to try some perpetual shifting the queen between b1 and h7
opens c8 for the c1 rook with tempo
now the c1 rook is tied to the defence of the back rank, so its a virtual B+R vs Q endgame, as black also has the bishop pinned... the idea behind this move is to get to d6 with the bishop
? bad as it allows white to win the bishop Be5+ Kg8 Bd6 ...Bxd6 or Be5+ f6 to block the bishop check Rc7 and now black doesn't have any perpetual as the c7 rook controls h7
and the bishop falls
White move achieves one of most important goals for black in the french: to exchange the white squared bishop. Be2 was better.
White should size the moment and play a3 to avoid black to blockade d5.
But black also misses the point. Better was Nb6 to respond Nd5 to a3 without having the knight exchanged.
Finally! Black recognizes the imporance of the d5 square.
Both Na5 (with the idea Nc6) and Ne5 were better. Particularly interesting is the variant 20. ... Ne5 21. Nxe5 Bxe5 22. Be3 Bxd4 23. Bxd4 Qxd4 24. Qf3 Qd5 and now to avoid the activation of black rooks white is forced to exchange queens.
Bb2 was better, since e5 is not anymore possible since the rook is not blocked by Be3.
The rook cannot move there.
b6 was more precise according to SF5, since it avoids counterplay based on Rc3
Almost a blunder which can give white good defending chances. After 42. ... Rc2 or e4 white has no moves anymore. It must either leave the c file or the third row.
I'm looking at playing Bd6 as soon as I can place it in a defend able position to challenge the f4 Bishop.
Offers an escape the the White Bishop in case I play Nd5?  Not what I had in mind however, I'm still looking at the eventual Bd6 to shift that Bishop.
The killer attack on the White f4 Bishop, planned from the beginning.  This move is why I dislike the London System, White now struggles to find decent play.
Now the Ngf3 becomes more obvious, allowing White to defend his f4 Bishop.  However, this closes off the Bishop quite nicely, so other than being aware of the problem of Nxf7 I am happy to ignore it.
Looking at castling on the Kingside.
Open to castling on either the Kingside or the Queenside.  However, I think this move was slightly worse than just simply castling to the Kingside.
Still threatening to dislodge the f4 Bishop, integral to the London System.
Provoked White into pinning my Bishop, which will allow me to dislodge it soon.  I'd have considered 11.Nxc6 Bxc6 12.Bxd6 Qxd6 13.O-O, which I think was slightly better.
Shifting the White Knight away and strengthening my grip on e4.
Fork on White's Bishop and Queen, forcing the Queen to move.  I considered e5 instead, and am curious on the opinions of you, the readers, whether or not I made the right choice.  Perhaps 15...e5 16.Qg3 Qe7 17.Rfe1 Rb8 ??
Once again, I'm not sure I made the right choice here either.  Considered exchanging the Knight and Bishop with 16...Nxd3 17.Qxd3 Ba6 18.c4 dxc4 19.Qc3 Nf6 20.Nxc4.  Be interested to hear any thoughts on the matter.
Just shifting the Knight to a more powerful square than the edge of the board.
Definitely should've considered 19.f4 instead, with half an eye on possible threats to the White Bishop.
Bishop and Knight exchange.
Seems to be a theme copied from one of my previous tournament games, weakens the King's defence for no real reason.  I think the best bet was to shift the Knight back to f3.
Black wins another Knight, going to +6.  White is hoping for g6 followed by Qh7#, but there it's easily defended against allowing Black to gain an even larger lead.
First real blunder I think, hangs his Rook out to dry.  At the time and in analysis, I can't see a mate (although I'm sure there is one, probably around 20 moves), but I was certain I had won the game here.
And now I can see a mate, or at least I did in analysis.  33.Qh7+ Kf8 34.Qh8+ Ke7 35.Qh4+ Nf6 36.Qh8 Qxe3 37.Kh1 Qg3 38.Qxg7+ Kd8 39.Qh8+ Kd7 40.Qh2 Qxh2+ 41.Kxh2 Rxg2+ 42.Kh3 Rh2+ 43.Kg3 Nh5+ 44.Kg4 Rag2#.  During the game, I was simply thinking that after  33.Qh7+ Kf8 34.Qh8+ Ke7 35.Qh4+ Nf6, I should be able to find a mate.
Here's where it gets interesting, as we are leaving the opening lines. White begins to get aggressive.
If I take the pawn right away on e5, I'd be faced with an immediate checkmate: 14. Qd7#
At least now my king has an escape square on f8 for the mate threat.
I did not want to let my e pawn go to waste if he took on g6 first.
Now I had to take care of the threat against my g pawn.
Here was where my opponent sighed in regret. I win the b pawn. Ka3 leads to Be7+ and later Qb4#
Note that Kd3 leads to mate on c3. I thought a moment before exchanging queens, to see if I could win more material later, but I usually prefer simplicity when I have a big advantage.
I believe this sacrifice was the only way to get my other pawn to advance.
I was dissapointed in the fact that I might have reached a draw despite my clear advantage, but I wasn't about to give up. All the other boards were finished, the score  2-2, and this game would decide the league champion. We needed a win.
Note that just because a pawn is on the 7th, protected by a bishop, doesn't mean it'll promote. White's king is free to roam about the e2, f1, and g2 squares.
This was that 2nd dumb occasion. White's bishop would have to oscillate between a6 and b5 or my king would get to e2 and I would promote. Neither of us realized it, though.
And then I found the move...
If I would have taken the a pawn, the position would be hopelessly drawn. Although I was at first skeptical about this move, I finally realized its importance. White must now take the pawn on b5 or face a deadly threat of promotion, but afterward the a6 pawn will recapture and be saved. Black's position is clearly won.
White resigns with less than 3 minutes on the clock for both of us. This was truly a long and exciting game. With this win, Kamiak won the WESCO league by a single point*, and for the first time ever. I hope you enjoyed viewing this as much as I enjoyed sharing it.<n><n>*It was actually 1.5 points, since Stanwood had to make up a match against Monroe, for which we expected them to win 5-0 (no offence to Monroe), but instead they went 4.5-0.5.
8. ..... Be6 - development and black may want to take the knight giving me isolanis at the right moment.
14. f4 - after both knights retreat the kingside pawn storm begins anew.
16. cxb3 - the B for N trade is forced.  Henry is opened up on the c column but thankfully this does not prove to be a problem.
18. Kb1 - Henry sorts it by moving to b1 out of the threatened discovery Nxe4+.
21. Nh5 - bringing a piece into the vicinity of the BK and attacking black's dsb on f6.
28. Bb5 - the bishop is en prise on this square but I am not too fussed.  Fou Leblanc defends the knight on e8 but more importantly the Wicked Witch of the West is perfectly in line for a pin on the g column.  If the Witch now moves off the diagonal then black can cop Old Matey at Her Majesty's Pleasure!
31. Bh6 - no need for the rook to eat the Witch yet.  Might as well get a piece in to ensure that black really does cop Old Matey.
33. Qg7 MATE!! - yup, there it is, Glenda in all her splendour is doing what she always wanted to do, give the enemy king that kiss of death, aaah.  Now there is another player, a certain Master that Glenda would just lurve to do this to - I will leave you to guess who!
I am pleased with this game.  I don't understand why white never castled maybe he underestimated me.  I think he had plenty of time.  He must have thought he had an advantage on the king side but I was not worried about his pawns coming down as I could still castle and get away.
White opened with e4 and I responded with e6 preparing to move pawn to d5
White's knight came to f3 and I moved pawn to d5
White's knight came to c3 and I moved c pawn out to c5 protected by DB at f8.  I have allowed the pawns to protect themselves but must now start to move the pieces out.
Now white pushed g pawn forcing me to move DB back to e6.
White took my pawn on d5 and I developed LB to d7 knowing that white will take on e6 and my bishop will recapture.
White's LB took my pawn at e6 and I captured it with pawn at f7.  This has now left a gap and may not be so easy to castle kingside.
After white's f knight moves to e5 rook comes to f8 alongside king to take control of the f file which only has a pawn at f2.
White continues to push his pawns on the kingside with pawn to h5 and I develop my b knight to c6.  Attacking the knight at e5.
My last kingside pawn is captured by rook at h7 and I move my DB  out to g5.
Now white moves his queen to g4 threatening my bishop at g5 and I push my c pawn which allows my queen to protect the bishop.
White decides to remove his rook now since my castling brought my rooks together and the rook would have been in trouble.  I move my f rook across to h8 attacking the h1 rook.
White left his rook at h1 and instead brought his knight to e4.  So I captured the h1 rook and put his king in check.
White moved his king to e2 and I checked the king again with my queen also attacking the knight at the same time.
I aim to take the knight so will remove the king and then take it.  So I move my queen to f1 and check the king which moves out to e3.
Next I bring the rook back across to check the king and he now moves out to f4 leaving the knight at the queen's mercy.
I don't see the point of this move (unless it is to prevent ...Nb4 if white chooses to play c4).
Black is cramped and hopes to open lines on the queenside.
Now black has more space but white's kingside attack looks scary.<n>(Note the two white bishops ready to make sacrificial captures on f7 and/or h6.<n>And there are the two knights ready to advance.)
Black defends f7 because soon the king might have to leave g8.
White intensifies the kingside pressure.
Black's king doesn't want to share the g file with the white queen.
The queen has to stay on guard duty of b7.
If ...hxg4, then 32 Qh4+ Bh6 33 Qxh6#.
Another sacrifice (to take away the guard from f8 so the knight can go there).
Keeping guard of the bishop on h6.
Royal fork and black resigns. <n>(Thanks to Chris Depasquale for informed commentary.)
I brought my Knight to attack the Queen and at this point I thought he would move back to D8
but instead moved it to F5 and thought whilst its out I can attack it
He then moved to F6 with the queen
I then pinned his queen with the Bishop
Then it was checkmate<n>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<n>To gmflash2008 here's the link <n>http://gameknot.com/chess.pl?bd=8376639&rnd=0.3262944566156024
this is probably the most common response. I took some advice from quite a few people not to push c4, maybe I'll save that if i need to confuse the crap out of someone.
I wasn't 100% sure of this move, sure it's a good move, and it's attacking the d5 which is easy enough to remove the guard from, but it slows down what is supposed to be an aggresive game
this has happened to me so many times, I decided it was time I started using it more.
this is my response to this too.
"realizing the utter stupidity of his previous actions, the south brazilian black chess player retreats to it's natural habitat." this one isn't much better. anyone else see the lovely practically unguarded f7?
sweet spot has shifted to e8
this bishop really comes in handy
I can almost hear the shouting of my team mates in my head "Pin the Bishop!" I like this move better
method to the madness
Avoiding 10 N-R4 Q-R3 ch 11 K-N1 Q-R5, where Black wins the Q pawn in exchange for the KR pawn.
Now White cannot enforce a hold on the black squares with either N-R4 or P-KR4.
At last Black makes his effort to secure the center.
If 18 KPxP, 18... Q-B2 ch 19 K-N1 NPxP and White's KR is shut in.
The move that forces the Knight to give way at last by the threat of ...P-QN4. If 38 NxP Black plays ...R-K8 at once.
I felt removing the knight in exchange for my bishop was the best move
My opponent decided to take my queen in exchange for his
This move was done to remove the bishop in exchange for a knight
Black has a number of options here, but this isn't one of them! If you want to play aggressively, try 3...f5. Otherwise, 3...exd4 or 3...Nf6.
Forcing Black to give up his good bishop for the knight.
A natural-looking move, and you probably played it without considering other options. But ask yourself "On which side do I want to castle?". I would suggest that the queenside is safer. So how about playing 7...Qh4. Not only does it enable you to castle next move, but it also attacks the weak pawns on h2 and f2.
Try to avoid moving the same piece twice in the opening.
I did consider Nd7 but decided to put my knight on c6 instead, as Bg5 wasn't an immediate threat so I had time to play h6 if g5 needed covering.  As it turned out this was a vital decision.
I decided to use the pin and try and force h3 bf5 g5 so as to hinder any ideas of castling, but then this could also be considered a wasted move as the bishop will have to retreat back to d7 or c8 as h3 Bh5 g4 Bg6 losses the Bishop to f5.
This move committed my bishop to the sacrifice but not before pulling out the pawns...
I feel a little happier about sacrificing my bishop now that the white king has castled as the kings cover will be completely blown wide open....
Now is the time to strike!
Collecting the second pawn in exchange for my bishop, I also gain an enormous potential for an all out assault...
Dodging the bullets...
Firing another volley and opening space for my knight if need be, one way or another i have to drought in reinforcements and quickly if i am to keep my attacking edge.....
In preparation for g5 and hopefully a fast route for my castle and Kings Bishop to enter the maelstrom....
I guess this was an attempt to coordinate a defensive counter and develop....
I needed to create threats and I felt this was a good plan....
I don't know if this was best but I'm happy to exchange, I'm sure my opponent felt he had to keep the g file closed by any means...
Now my Rook has the h file...
Keeping the tempo up and forcing the issue as much as i can, i need to keep my opponent off balance.....
Opting for retreat and sacrificing the material advantage. I have positional advantage and the material one now too....
I now find myself a pawn up and the white King has retreated back to the center of the board. I still have to keep up the pace....
I hadn't planned on taking the knight had it been left on c3 after dxc3 bxc3 it wasn't such a clear win by my reckoning so i plough on ahead with my original plan...
I knew this was a lethal attack at this point and i couldn't see a way to stop it, I really was inspired by this game....
Landing another mortal wound...and showing why the silent d4 was so deadly..
Hi everyone!<n><n>Has anybody ever heard of Steve Backshall?  Well, he is a guy who just lurves chasing wild animals, although on occasions they chase him.  I found out about him from watching a Children's programme called CBBC with my six year old Charlotte and later played the CBBC game where Steve has to outrun bees, hippos and alligators - this game is called Steve's Deadly Dash.  In this MT in aid of the Christchurch Earthquake I am playing Master Janet.  Things seemed to be OK for me when suddenly Henry was subjected to a deadly dash from her rook and the Wicked Witch of the West.  Alas, Henry got caught and he had to rest up!  Anyhow, on with the game.  Gameknot Analysis is provided in the following link.http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15488483&fb=1&rnd=0.19786173690656117.  Janet kicks off with the English Opening - 1.c4.
2. g3 - white usually likes to fianchetto a lsb on the kingside in the English Opening and Janet is no exception.
11. ..... Nd4 - an interesting passage of play is about to evolve.  The e5 pawn is left to hang, but ....
17. ..... Re8 - my rook is en prise and must move to the only possible square.
24. e4 - puts the question to my knight.  I opt for f6 - will Janet be prepared to part with this strong bishop in order to open up the g column?  Will this decision prove costly to me?  Time will tell.
26. Qxf6 - Aha, here is the Wicked Witch and my f7 pawn is en prise.  I choose to defend by Qh5?? but this proves to be the losing move according to Gameknot Analysis.  My opponent also suggested 26.Qe6 and she thought that if I played that then I would have had great drawing chances.  Again I miss the chance to add Janet's name to my Master Draw list!
28. ..... Qb3 - I eschew the knight on a4 because Henry will cop Old Matey if Glenda takes it.  Instead she defends the pawn on f7.  However, Rg5+ proves decisive and now comes Henry's Deadly Dash.
For some reason, I've always scored well against the Kan Sicilian (particularly in comparison to, say, the Najdorf).  It's fundamentally sound, but Black's counter-play always seems a little too slow for me.
Keeping the option of c2-c4 rather than simply putting the Nb1-c3 is the general plan here - if White can do that, Black will struggle to play d7-d5 and d6 will be a potential weakness.  Of course, in 10 moves time, that'll be irrelevant.
Putting the king in line with the Bb7 looks a little odd given that g2-g4 might well form part of the plan, but the c5-g1 diagonal can also cause some problems, perhaps if Black can play d6-d5.
Withdrawing the knight from d4 looks slightly odd, but White has lined up his pieces to play e4-e5 and this is the next logical step.  e6-e5 can be met with f4-f5 and g2-g4-g5 to storm the Black king.  Nd7-c5 is probably the best bet, although White will still look to play e4-e5.
Natural, and hard to meet.  The Nf6 has no squares and Black is doomed, just 15 moves in.   If you play through the rest of the game, try to guess White's next move in the continuance of his attack.
If you want to play 17. h3 Nh6 18. Bxh6 gxh6 then I'm afraid that you have no soul.
Now 17. ... Kxh7 18. Ng5+ and 19. Qxg4, hitting f7 and h7 in equal measure is terminal.
Black thinks he can run his king to the Queenside.  He can't.
d3 to open th black bishop and to protect the e4 pawn...
Now i have two ways, take the pawn with the knight or the queen... I chose the knight in order to open the queen for the f3 square...
I played the queen in order to checkmated him then...
And as i guessed before he took the knight and ignored the checkmate...
With only 4 moves played queens are already traded. With queens off board inability to castle is not a big problem.

must defend myself.....
All the opening moves are played for the Queens Indian Defence (as per game title) to whites move 7. and we begin to make our moves now.  Black to start and he opens with DB to b4 attacking my knight.
I decide to attack blacks night at f3 with my DB which develops it as well.  I am forgetting that my knight at c3 is under attack and if taken will leave me with double pawns. And black will have access to 'b' file.
My c3 knight is safe for now and black instead pushes his h pawn to h6 and kicks me off g5.
I move my DB to f4 which I feel is a more central position and I leave my knight on c3 to the attack by black's DB.
Black pushes his a pawn out to a5 and he has a chain of pawns and is protecting the diagonal from b4 to d6 with these pawns.  I probably should have pushed my c pawn and tried to attack on c5 and this would have broken the chain and given me more centre space.
Instead I make a move with my LB to h3 (I was preparing to move my g3 pawn up so this LB was protecting g4).  I may be going to learn a hard lesson about moving your LB unnecessarily.  Perhaps a better move would have been moving my e pawn up which is a move I make and I would then have 3 pawns in a row but I seem to have forgotten this!
Black decides to take my f3 knight with his LB and again I can only retake with my pawn so I will have doubled pawns again.  I don't think this is too bad on the 'f' file as it provides protection to my king.  Now there is the 'e' file for black to access but my rook is able to access too.
Black moves g7 - g5 and blocks the progress of my g pawn and attacks my DB at f4.
I move my DB to e3 which gives protection to my f2 and d4 pawns.
Black moves his pawn b6-b5 and if he moves his c7 pawn next will have taken control of the diagonal a4 to c6 with his pawns.
I move my DB to d2 protecting my c3 pawn as I think that black may move his b5 pawn down to attack it.
Black moves c7-c6 and his pawns are now connected and he has a very strong pawn defence while my pawns are doubled on 2 files and I am restricted by his c6 and d5 pawns from doing anything in the centre.
I move my DB back up to e3.  I have purely been acting in defence mode and not as white should play by making the moves with black defending.  I do not see that he is about to bring his last flank pawn to c6.  So instead I should have moved to c6 with my pawn but I would have been captured by the knight.  So black is in charge.
Black moves his rook over to e8.
I yet again move my DB to d2 allowing my rook to access the e file.
Black pushes his pawn down from e6 to e5 and he is attacking my pawn at d4.
Black moves Nd7 which defends his other knight at f6 which was a piece I could have launched an attack on with my queen at b1.
I move my LB to allow my pawn at h2 to move to h3 whilst protecting my f3 pawn.
I end blacks progress on the e file with my DB to e3.
Black moves his king to g7 and with the pawn now at e4 my queen is prevented from commencing an attack on the diagonal to h7.
Black moves his rook on e8 to e7.
I capture the pawn at f3 this may have been a mistake as this piece was protected but it allows my queen now to access the f file.  If this pawn is retaken it is protected by my LB at g2 but the LB could be retaken by the knight at f6.
I bring my queen to f3 and I am attacking the pawn at f7 but this is protected by the rook at e7.
Black moves his knight to c3 which allows the rook to attack down the e file.
I move my queen over to h3 in order to try an alternative attack on the king from the h file.
Black moves his a8 rook over to h8 in order to thwart my attack on the king.
I push my pawn f2 to f4 attacking the g5 pawn protected by my DB at e3.
I move my queen to f3 looking to provide defence to my DB which black may capture since we are unable to capture the pawn due to the black queen defending.  I could have moved my DB but it would have involved taking it down to c1 and this would have meant the rooks were no longer together and if I had moved it to d2 or f2 black could have captured with his knight.
Black captures my DB and I could capture with my rook or my queen although my queen is on the f file and I want to try to launch an attack on this file.
I do not capture the pawn at e3 but I move my rook to e2 looking to move it across the possibly g file and attack the king.
Black moves his knight to g5 allowing the rook again to have access to the e file and this means I cannot capture the pawn at this stage.
I move my queen f3 to f5 using my pawn at g4 as protection.
Black moves his d7 knight to f6.
I move my LB in front of the king at g2 as the black queen is at c7 on a clear diagonal and there is no pawn in front of my king.
Black moves the queen to d7 and is attacking my queen at f5.
I bring my rook from a1 to f1 and white looks good for an attack on the king.  However I seem to have forgotten the queen is at d7 and therefore is liable to attack.
I feel I probably was not looking too bad up to now but it looks like my chance has gone with my queen.  The way black has blocked the centre with the pawns is not only bad for me but I feel it is bad for black too.  So despite black having more pawns it really does not show the real picture.  All he has is an extra piece and one passed pawn.
Black now moves his rook h8 to b8.
I attack the knight at g5 with a pawn move h2 to h4.
Black moves his knight to h7.
I now push my rook up to f4 this may prevent black trying to bring his rook down.
Black now pushes his b pawn but I have a pawn at a3 and I am not concerned about the push as I have a LB which can cover the b1 square.  I do not wish to use my rooks as they are strategically placed.
I begin to move my LB across with a move to f3.
This means the king has to move and he goes to f8.  This allows me to move my LB again.
I move my LB to e2 and should be in time to pick up the soon to queen b pawn.
Black pushes his b pawn down once more to b2 now.
I am now ready to pick up the queening pawn as my LB is at d3.
Black queens and I pickup although there is a rook at the top of the b file and I will be captured but at least black does not have another piece on the board for me to defend against.
Black now moves his passed pawn on the e-file to e2.  I feel I have a chance to interfere with this attempt.
I move my rook from g2 to g1 attacking the rook at b1 protected by my king.
Black captures my rook and I capture the rook with my king.
So pawn queens and I move my rook f4 to f1 and the rook stops the check.
The black queen moves to g3 to check my king and I move to h1 and out of check.
Black brings down his E7 rook to e2 and I can see that its probably all over and I resign.  <n><n>What do you think about my game?  I thought I made a good fist of it against a higher rated player and I find myself not feeling scared but looking forward to following my plan and seeing what happens.
I feared e5, trying to trap the bishop. I could have saved it, but it would have costed me a slight inferior position, and the bishop pair (e5, 11. dxe, dxe, 12. Bb5 or 12. f4).
I must protect myself from Nb4, losing the bishop pair.
Ok, now, this is one of this situations in which long-term analysis must be performed, and I don't have a clear plan. Very difficult. The ideas can be: <n>14. f3, preventing the N to go to g4 (but... is this N a threat, there?). If Nf5, I can play Bf4, since he cannot threat it with his pawns, since the N would be hanging. I will lose the bishop pair, but I will win some other pawn. But I cannot stop Nf5 - Bd6.<n>14. Nc3, developing and making him harder to push e5. With Nf5, he allows his bishop to d6, thus exchanging it with mine. And the only way I have to stop it is BxN, but this is ugly, even if he gets a doubled pawn (not easy to take advantage of it).
Ok, blocks my knight, or I go in through a4-b6 but... to where? I dind't find it a great plan. <n>So, the best plan maybe was Kd7, and push the central pawns e4, f4... but I feared to get only a blocked center or, worse, an open column it was not completely clear to whom would have been an advantage to. <n>So I went to another direction, among the many possible (e. g. o-o-o): b4, pushing and try to get advantage of the weakness of his 7º rank, due to the bad collocation of his pieces. This one I eventually reached, but probably a move too late, since I played the knight in order to go e2-f4 to support an incursion in g6, either by the bishop or the knight. Another plan...
Ok, now I forget my previous plan, and lose a tempo by moving the King. Now, the "incursion" in g6 is really a desiderable objective? I must admit I didn't "do the homework", I still don't know. To change my knight for the bishop in f8 was a favour to him, so I must be sure to get something more from it, and I wasn't.
Time losses due to his "mistake": not to have placed the knight in f5, instead, in order to get one of my bishop changed, either with his knight or with his bishop, a liberatory change for black. But to that plan I had some resource, still a good try for him.
To change or not to change (BxN, of course), this is the question. <n>If he re-takes by rook, I can make pressure over the b7 pawn with more easyness than him can defend it, and if b7xB, my a pawn is free. But I lose my bishop pair, a major advantage. It's worthwile?<n>For now, I must defend from the knight jumps, so I lose a tempo in return to his previous one.
Ah, now I see his plan. Pretty good. Now, I will lose my bishop pair, since I must take the knight with my beloved g3 bishop, or I would have had problems pushing my a pawn, with so many black pieces around there. I analyzed some variants leaving his knight in d6 and I didn't see a victory, so I came back to the previous "exchange" plan. But, again, with a "detour".
Necessary anyway, in order to threaten the b7 pawn after the exchange.
AH!, So, he must stop my a pawn! That's good, this brings me the initiative. But it is very easy to lose this pawn, I must be very careful!<n><n>Now: to check or not to check? What do I get from it? <n>Maybe nothing. The truth is that Rb2 in order to double rooks seemed somewhat weak to me. Just it.
Now, I started the advance, with doubts. <n>Couriousely, I saw that Rb6, in order to "block" his rooks, didn't worked because of Bc7, and I cannot take the pawn because of Ba5+, winning the rook. So Rc6 is a bad plan. Uh ok, what other plan do I have? To advance the pawn, of course.
Rd7 doesn't work because Bb4+ and then (whatever I move), Ba5 blocking the pawn, and while I try to unblock the situation, the black king has time to go to the queenside.
Can I stop it? Or must I go for Kf4, threatening his pawns? But this is a very passive plan. After BxN, black can go with his king, and I have to look for some counterplay on the kingside, but this is really difficult, even with some "tempos". If I go into the center, he can even allow my pawn to go to e5, and just retire the bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal, and I am almost blocked. <n>So I went for a surprising one:
A "magical" trap.<n>29.	..., Kd8 (the King MUST go to d8 instead of d7 because of: <n>30. Na4, and the black King cannot go closer to the pawn, and if the rook takes the pawn, <n>30. ..., Rxa6, <n>31. Nf5+ wins a neat quality.<n>But to try to avoid it by Kd8 fails, for instance to: <n>30.	Kd3, Kc8<n>31.	e3xe4	, Kb8<n>32.	e4xd5, e6xd5<n>33.	Rb1+	Ka7 (assuming black's plan is to take the a pawn)<n>34.	Ra1, Kb6 (it looks as if he will achieve it)<n>35.	Ka4+, and if Kxa6<n>36.	Kc5+, Kb6 and the rook is lost again!<n><n>Maybe this will never happen in the game, but I couldn't resist the temptation to find out if he would have seen the trap or not. The alternative was <n>29. Nf4, retaining his king to this side of the board, with the result to somewhat stall the game, or if he changes his bishop for my knight, his king comes first and takes my pawn, so no good.
This doubled pawn was calculated. It looks like weak, but prevents the black king to threat the a pawn along with the rook.
...and "use" my a pawn as a sacrifice in order to win a precious "tempo". <n><n>The other choice was Ka6, and if he tries to push his pawn (38. ..., d3), I thought about some trick with 39. Rb1, but d2, 40. Rb7+, Kc8, 41. Kb6, d1=Q, doesn't give me nothing, just for one tempo. Ohter variants based on the same motive get more or less to the same point.
If he exchanges rooks, I must win due to my king's proximity to his pawns, since my doubled pawns prevent him to easily take them.
Yes, I "must" leave him the h pawn free in order to get tempos to advance mine. At least, this was what I thought.
As I said, I must take the risk.
I know I have to make him check me in order to get the king to the b column, free of checks.
And here I blunder, because I am still thinking I threat mate. If only I had hold the position some more moves, I would have won. Or I think so.
His knight is now involved, but he had to make three pawn moves to do so.
I actually would not mind trading my knight for his dsb, but he chooses not to trade.
This is an awkward square for his knight, and is useless until I initiate an exchange later.
I decided to sacrifice my knight and bishop for his rook, since I deemed his knight on a4 to kind of being out of commission.
Now my goal is to play sharp enough to survive the predicted attacks.
I think I would've moved the a4 knight to b2 to try to get him active on the other side of the board.  It might have taken a few moves, but my position is so cramped, that I would have likely taken time to do anything positive anyway.
I think this was a key move for me.  First, it gives my rooks much more strength with an open file, and now I'm thinking of ways to trap his bishop on f4 also.
now I have two open files.  Even though his rook is on the file, it still benefits me to have it open.
Now I want him to waste a move protecting his bishop so that the rest of my plan can unfold.
He should've sacrificed the knight and tried to survie with Q and B.
Hi everyone!<n><n>After I waved the white flag on my buddy Steve I found myself entering some conditional moves after finding myself in a K & P ending against a bare king.  Luckily it was Hilary who found himself with the bare king - as he beat me in our first match - I was playing white in that game I was sure chuffed to get my revenge on him!  This, I am sure, will be of some benefit to members of the Coaching Club who may well encounter this type of ending, so maybe some useful guidelines here.  Anyhow, in the early stages of it I found myself on the black side of a Ruy Lopez.
10. Nxe5?! - Hilary surprises me with a speculative sac.  Subsequent play, however, proves this to be unsound.  At the time he did get two pawns for his piece though.
16. cxd4 - so, after one pawn trade and the disappearance of the two dsb's I am still a piece for two pawns up, but that wretched Witch is still in my face.  I still wish to castle kingside so I decided to move my queen rook to the d column and back up my isolani on d6.
21. Qd4 - avoiding another invitation to trade queens.  I am still a piece for two pawns up and I have my eye on that dangerous looking white passer on the d column.  My next plan is to round it up.
22. ...... Kf7 - oooh, I forgot to mention in my last note, I finally developed that horsie to f6 on move 18 to pave the way for castling.  However, white had other ideas with his last move - still, with the absence of white's lsb I can start a castling by hand manoeuvre by putting Henry on f7.
23. ..... Rhe8 - mission accomplished - although Henry is not on g8 I have been able to get my king rook on e8 so I am as good as castled by hand.  That king rook now challenges white's king rook on the e column.
32. fxe4 - I manage to trade under fire Fou Leblanc for white's knight.  I now isolate white's f pawn once it moves onto the e column.  First, now that I am a piece for a pawn up I decided to force a trade of queens thanks to the open a7-g1 diagonal.
34. Rd4 - defending his isolani, but I will not take no for an answer here!
36. ...... Rxe4 - However, I am now in a position to nab the pawn on e5 making me a clear piece up.
41. ..... Rbe5 - trying to attack down the e column but it does not come off.
45. ..... h6 - this move is played to create a bolt hole for Henry while the two rooks are on the board - it would help greatly if Henry was not subjected to annoying tempo-stealing checks from the enemy rooks.
50. ...... Rxb4 - namely one pair of rooks and the two queenside pawns have disappeared from the board.  Now the action is focussed solely on the kingside.  How on earth can I force a win from here though?
52. hxg5 - hmm, running out of pawns here, only one pawn left.  Can I ensure this precious footman stays on the board?  I just hope I will not have to play out the 50 move rule with K + R + N v K + R.  We shall see.  I decided the safest course of action was to place my attacked horsie on e8.
56. ... Rf6+ - this rook move provides a space clearance for my knight to take his place on d6........
58. ..... Rxg6 - pawn on g6 duly drops, eureka!  Now can I get my one and only precious pawn to the place of Glendadom!?
59. ...... Kh7 - hmm, so he is after my knight is he, well he is welcome to it because with my rook and knight dropping off in exchange for his rook I am left with K & P v bare king.  At least I know I cannot lose the game, but can I win it?
63. ..... Kh5 - Henry must support the g5 pawn onwards and upwards.
66. ..... Kf3 - ooops - I have just realised, Henry is the wrong side of my passer.  If I try and walk my pawn up to Glendadom I risk stalemating the WK when my pawn reaches g3.  I must therefore get Henry back onto the h file and try and get the WK off it.  Luckily my opponent is very obliging here!
No place to retreat the bishop, so I'll have to trade it off. Hate to do that.
Not sure if castling queenside will be a good idea, but I'd already been thinking of it, and I kind of made the move automatically. I wanted the rook on that open file.
I like that move for him. He threatens a4 and opening the a-file up to get to my king. Now I'm thinking that kingside castling would've been better off for me.
This doesn't stop a4, but it at least makes it a bit more complicated, and I need more complications to make up for my weaker position.
I know, it doesn't look like a good move. <n>My other choice to protect my kingside is Qe2, and I'm bottled in and really don't protect the kingside all that well. So I'll let him double my pawns. He can't immediately take advantage of them, and he may run into trouble if he chooses the wrong way to get them.<n>Probably his best choice, after trading the queens is to put his rooks on a5 and a8 while I put mine on d6 and d1.
Everything I can do loses a pawn, or more.<n>Qd6 loses to Rfa8. <n>g4 loses to Qf6.<n>Ra1 loses to Qf6. But that may be where I need to go. Not good, because when you're losing in an endgame, you want to trade pawns, not pieces.
I found a way to stay even materially -- though my isolated e-pawn will mean my pawns are weaker than his.
hmm, is there any advantage at all for going to a2 instead of b2? Only thing I could see is that he's going to go play Qf6 and my pawn on c3 will be pinned. Maybe I should ask it the other way around: is there any advantage to going to b2 over a2? The king guards the rook from b2, but that queen's not going to be attacking it after this move. The king guards c1 after I move the rook, but I imagine he's going to try to keep his rook on that open e-file.
Trying to break the center apart.
Adding support and breaking the pin.
Reshevsky pounces, winng the Bishop and attacking the Queen.
After e5, I decided to play Nc3, going for Vienna opening.
After Bc4, Nf6, Nd5 was played. This move sets up the trap - white is now challenging black's knight on f6 and leaves the e pawn undefended, if black takes the e pawn then he would be in trouble.
Qg4, forking black's knight and g pawn, leaving the f2 pawn hanging.
Black happily captured the f pawn, he is now two pawns up and his knight is now forking my queen and rook.
Black thought that my rook on h1 is trapped, so there is no rush to take it straight away, thus he defended his rook first with Rf8. However, he totally overlooked my next move.
Qxe5+!, Black now has two options, he can block the check with either Qe7 or Be7, unfortunately either move would lead to disaster.
This was actually a terrible move on my part because he could take the bishop with the rook and leave me with nothing for my efforts.
A master knows more understands more and calculates better.So what to play?Best to stick with ones usual openings.
Black is ahead in development and has open lines for his pieces.But a pawn is a pawn and though he has compensation for the pawn I would gauge its not enough.
Temporarily putting the n on the bords edge so as to develpe the blaxk squared B.
In the last few moves black gained the B pair.In compensation white has managed to exchange a minor piece and alleviate his cramped positin a little.
17.Rc1? seeking further exchanges but this error gives black the c-file and definite comprnsation for the P.17.Qb3 was better.
With the bishop pair the c-file and iniative black has definite compensation for the P and he may actually stand a little better.
Happy to exchange Q's on his terms only as if white exchanges he cedes the 7th rank.Looking at it further white can exchange followed by Bd1 as happens two moves later.
Its here that black decides to take the draw by repetition.26.Bb3 and white slowly unravels his position and still retains the P plus.To understand why white takes the bird in the hand and accepts the draw one has to look at the hiding white received at the hands of stalhandske played at the same time.That had a negative effect on my psyche so I was happy to grab the draw.
8. ... Be7? is losing cause of 9.Bxe6! fxe6 10.Nxe6 Qd7 11.Nxg7+, and for the piece White has three PP and the unsafe position of Black King
14.f4 (threatening to enable the fork with e5) doesn't work cause of 14. ... Nc6!, and if 15.e5 Nxe5! 16.fxe5 Bc5+ mating
Desperate try to survive by tactics
After 19.Kg1 Rxd1+ White has to lose the Queen
Black's position is becoming cramped as he has to respond with defensive moves to whites attacks
defending the isolated f-pawn. Better was Kg3 which would also release the LSB from guard duty
Better was Ra4 giving the option of Rae4 lining the RS up on the e-file
Presumably to stop f5 but it creates so many weaknesses. Better was Re7
Better to attack with Nf5+
threatening to get both Rs on the 7th rank and threaten mate
Analysis engines suggest Rhxc6 here which just shows the weakness of engines when it comes to subtle positional moves. The engine move leads to Rhxc6 RxR Rxa7 and white has traded a R for 2 Ns. With passed pawns on each side of the board it looks good BUT they are on the edge of the board so black only has to capture one and then the K can force a draw against the other one.
Now the Rs manouvre for a mate
Note not Kd3 as this would allow Nb4+ freeing the Ns to join the fight.
This is the main point of the slav black will try to hold onto his c4 pawn.
forced if I want to hold onto my e pawn.
Now I'm in big trouble 25. Nxd4? Qxd4+ 26. Kh1 Rxf1! 27. Bxf1 Qf2 28. Qb1 now black has up a few tempos to play around with while I try to figure out how to not lose a whole piece.  So I chose a different option.
gives my king some room though not sure this was best here because it gives black time.
problems to whites with the castling and the development of the white bishop
E4 or d4 are my only choices as White. I am comfortable with either and do take time to look into the history of my opponent to see which way to go.
Black really has to either come up with an attack or defend that f4 pawn (and counter attack). Black is doing what I usually did against my dad back in the 1960s when he taught me chess. This is a good move for Black but it doesn't really stop the pacing of White to really come on strong....
The King Side attack is the whole idea with the King's Gambit. Get an attack going fast on the King Side and worry about the (your White King) King later. There are measures in the King's Gambit you can take to protect your White King should this attack be subdued....
This is a usual move by Black to try and upset the King Side attack....
I would consider Black to have two "passed pawns" before I jumped. I always thought a pawn crossed over the center line was "passed" (at least it was "passed" in my days with my dad who taught me chess). <n><n>However, my knight that has to move is conveniently set to move again to e5....
Black moves to develop and defend g4.
I apply pressure to the f7 Black pawn. It is a standard King's Gambit practice...<n>You can see why, right? It really upsets things down in Black's King Side area....and King! <n>The King's Gambit is an Attack instead of a slow moving game that a Ruy will do to an end game. <n>This is why I don't use the Ruy Lopez.  My dad taught me not to use that defense against e4. I then learned Sicilian and Caro-Kann and Alekhine's instead to deal with e4. I became biased against the Ruy Lopez. I am still biased to this day even though I have used it a couple of times here just to see if it is really as good as others say (and do what) it is.
I want that bishop in line with the f7 Black pawn straight into the 0-0 area.
Black is blocking and putting forth pressure on my e5 Knight.  What shall I do to make things a bit more saucy around here (in the King's Gambit you can easily make things more sparky or fiery or explosive...)?
His passed pawns (as I understood it in the 60s from my dad) are targets for the King Side attack.
Time to shift the attack to threaten the Black King...
Applying pressure to make my King stay in the line of fire...however, more wickedness (in knowing the King's Gambit positions for the King Side attack) is in store....
Black's King and Queen are subject to my Queen Bishop (dark square). Which is best? The Black King is under cross fire from both bishops at a single move; but, so is Black's Queen and that Queen I want to suppress instead of trying a game of "chasing the King" with cost....
She tries to find the best confined space and threat....
I want that h6 bishop fixed in place with back-up to keep Black's King in one place. I have the time to do it.
I am -1 but obviously a real problem here for Black...all because I sacrificed a pawn in the King's Gambit. The KG was popular at the turn of the Century (20th Century = 1900s) and if you buy a book on Chess Openings that is complete through every 8th move and possibility you will see a quarter of the book dedicated to the King's Gambit. The Gambit is the most diverse and complicated White Attack ever. It is risky and does have holes in it--but by the time you are involved with it the position(s) have sent you light years ahead of any predictable game. I like it that way! No one can memorize the moves even up to the 5th or 6th or 7th--let alone 8th position!
The only place for the remaining bishop not taken and I think a good one.
Bishop traded in for a rook....
I shift to the right side now. I put my remaining Knight where it is most useful.
This should end the game for sure but I don't know if I am playing against a person who wants to go to the end...<n><n>It turned out Black was ready to surrender. <n>Wish more on this site would see ahead and not drag out a game to checkmate. I do get checkmated on occasion but usually I see it and give up.
Wins a pawn, if NxN, then BXB, and if BxB, NxB.
Black wants to contest the center with the extra pawn.
To weaken White's kingside and possibly double the rooks on the f file.
A fateful decision to castle 0-0-0 since the king is exposed, but 0-0 would have left the king too exposed.
...d3!? is the point of the plan, now Black can take on b5 and the king will be exposed.
...d2 !?, to open up lines of attack. I was hoping for Nxp??, Rc8 .
Now if .. RxN??, Qd5 ! So Black needs another plan.
White wants to centralize the queen and open up bank rate mate possibilities if Black is careless.
If Kd1, QxN  and similar to game.
I sacrificed a pawn to set some structural defects on black's pawns, but he managed to remain dynamic enough and I was forced to regains the pawn... latter on the game I was able to get a small advantage by trapping black's remaining bishop but was ultimately unable to proceed to promotion without losing that advantage. Overall it was a nice dynamic draw against an higher rated opponent, that was never able to exert any pressure... I choose not to publish this analysis yet, because in this tournament my direct opponent has the chance of playing for 19.5 points maximum, and I'm able to get only 19 points maximum for that I need a win against him playing black... my most direct opponent withdraw from this tournament, so now he is playing for 17,5 points and I'm playing for 19 points (although I'm almost sure to lose one point so more realistically I'm playing for 18 points)
avoiding Qh4 with the idea Qxe4, and prepares the castle
N sacrificing a pawn to get a better development and to difficult black's positional play, even if black doesn't take it I'll be better on the endgame
at some point I will need h3 to avoid back rank weakness, providing my king with an escape square
recovers the sacrificed pawn and heads to a drawish position with some small prospects in a B+R vs. B+R endgame
it was this or Bxf4, but I preferred to undouble my pawns
?! allows me to give black another disconnected pawn
this looks drawish... but still I'll try to enforce my connected central pawns, I see two different approaches to this endgame, first to block the c5 pawn and capture it with both my rook and bishop coordinated, or to let black push the pawn to c4 obstructing his own bishop and the maneuver to capture any of the remaining pawns with my pieces
setting a trap as Bxa2 does get a pawn but allows the domination of the bishop and I get another semi-open column for my rook
and the bishop is almost trapped in the corner
add to the domination of the bishop and forces a5 as it threatens Ra3, the idea is now to attack the blocked c5 pawn and then push the connected passed pawns, if needed even maybe exchange the quality to assure the promotion of one pawn
to gain more freedom for my rook
gains space and blocks the light squares on the king's wing
defending the g pawn
and there is no way to push the pawns without exposing my king and setting free black's bishop... this will for sure end in a draw
Ok. The battle field is set.  Black has accepted the 'poisoned' g2 pawn, and white has begun to try attempt proof of his opening beginning with 6. Qh5 .<n>After looking it up on the web I found a quote I liked. Apparently one Graham Burgess (of whom I know nothing) has said "Is not utterly, clearly bad.".
?! This is most common in the torney (this far). It's a fun move that makes all kinds of tactics availible. There is however another possibility that leads the game into more normal/stable lines, 8. Qg5 ?!.<n>A possible continuation is 8. ... Qxg5 9. Bxg5  Be7 10. Bxe7  Nxe7 11. Bb3<n>and white should be better. Lead in development and control of the center.  The black king is stuck in the center and white still has the ability to castle. I think I'll try it in a few games.
So. The bishop has fallen. Time to regain the rook.
Forking king and rook.
?! I really don't know what this move accomplishes. Granted, the g5 square is no longer an issue, and the Q was doing nothing on c1. But after Nd2, she is almost as usless.
This discovery forces the king back to d8 and vacates a good escape square for my queen.
Now I'm attacking both the knight and the bishop. Both captures would come with check. When I played with this in the analysis window looking at responses to Nf6. I realised that the most natural looking defence is a horrible blunder...
... might look ok at first glance. Actually black had to accept the loss of both pieces and move his c-pawn. But in the back of my head I hoped for this.
My first smothered mate here at GK. I love smothering the king. I always look for ways to do it but I so seldom get the chance.
My opponent wants 9. Bxf6 gxf6 where he castles queenside, or plays Kd7, and uses the g-file to attack the king.
Preparing a queenside pawn storm to attack the king.
He keeps going to play for the win.
And my opponent resigns. Anyway, this game was sort of advertisement, if your rating is above 1700 and you want to join my mini tournament, message me and will add you.
As white I like to play 2.d3 and transpose into the King's Indian Attack (Nd2, Ngf3, g3, Bg2, O-O, and so on).
Normally black will trade his dark-squared bishop in the Winawer, but that's after 4.e5 c5 5.a3 and now Bxc3+ (5...Ba5 is possible). Here, however, I saw no reason to relinquish the two bishops, so that's the reason for this retreat.
Keeping the pin, eventually black might play Bg6 to offer a trade of bishops.
I'm not sure about this move, it seems weakening. The pin was annoying and white decided to break it.
I wasn't sure this was best at the time. I wanted to reposition my knight (to e6 or g6) but I've given up control of the e5 square temporarily. I wasn't afraid of 15.Ne5 Bxd3 16.Qxd3 Ne6 (or Ng6, trying to simplify), but I thought I might have had better. 14...Bxd3 15.Qxd3 Nf8 (Qb6!?) also seemed a bit uninspiring. But the truth of the position seems to be I didn't really have a good active plan and I just had to wait for white to show his cards and only then react accordingly.
(?!) This just seems to further weaken white's kingside. Possible alternatives may be 15.Ne5 Bxd3 16.Qxd3 as mentioned in the previous comment, or 15.Kg2 Ne6 16.Bg3. 15.Nh4 may have been the best try, I'd probably have replied 15...Bxd3 (15...Bd6!?) 16.Qxd3 g6, preventing the knight from hopping to f5, but also creating some dark square weaknesses.
I went for the most obvious move. 18...Ne6 was also possible, but even there after 19.Re5 black would play 19...Qxc2.
Getting the bishop out of the way to challenge the e-file and starting a manoeuvre to possibly bring the bishop to h6 (with f6 and if gxf6 gxf6 Bh6, or as in the game f6 h4 h6 etc.)
The pawn on g5 is cramping up black's kingside, so white tries to preserve it, gxf6 wouldn't be so good.
The rook on a8 is doing nothing, so I began to slowly try to activate it. It's not easy to unbind on the queenside, however. I thought of a slightly strange plan here, which took some time and might not be best, but I also saw white doesn't have much to do himself. So, first of all I will play a5 (and later a4 to fixate the weakness on b2), enabling Ra6 (protecting the c6-pawn), then b5, Bd7 (again protecting c6), and only now the rook back to a8.
I also considered 28...Kf7, so black still has the f4 square for the knights. However, the e3-pawn is now weak and is a potential target for my other rook on e8 and bishop on h6 (see 23...Bf8 and 26...a5).
To play h5, freeing h6 for the bishop.
As it turned out, c1 wasn't the best place for the rook. Maybe 39.Re1 Nf5 40.Bh3 was more resilient.
Indirectly defending e3 and h4 because of the pin on the knight on f5. 40.Re1 N(either)xh4 41.Nxh4 Nxh4.
And not 44...Bxc1?? 45.Bxd7. Now black has three pawns for the exchange and d4 will also fall.
Black is winning here. He must now try and limit white's counterplay, if possible not giving the rook open lines and possible targets to attack. I tend to resign early and would probably throw in the towel here as white.
I played this - and almost immediately regretted it. She could have played 5. d4 and transposed into variations of the Dragon Sicilian, which I am not too familiar with.
She continues to develop.
Did you get it? Immediately after playing Nf6?? I saw it. I am now losing a piece, as both knights are attacked.
And this is the worst way to lose it. Other moves, such as Rc8, Nxe5 mean that at least I get a pawn for it.
The best way to take.
As I now gain a tempo attacking c2.
She gets everything protected. I now rather feared her N going to b6 then d5, so I decided to stop that.
This exchange seems to lead to me getting pressure.
She seeks a queen exchange - usually the right idea if you are materially up - however her pawns get doubled and I get pressure.
So she tries to hang on to that pawn.
Another mistake. Kf1 was needed. Now I wanted to play a4 and if she takes the pawn, Ra3 and I get the pawn back. But I was afraid of her meeting a4 with b4! and she is winning easily. So I dropped my rook back a square to prevent b3-b4.
She has a plan of Ng5 and attacks on my pawns on h7 and f7
And this move throws away a couple of pawns, and then she has a difficult position.
She protects the knight. Round about here she offered me a draw, which I instantly turned down. I commented that if she had offered me it about 10 moves ago I would have accepted. The position is easier to play for black, but white should be able to draw it.
The rook exchange helps me.
The knight is now without any sensible moves.White can't do anything about the e pawn marching down the board. She plays on to mate, but further annotation is not necessary.
Pins the knight in preparation for e5.
Provides replacement if I take the knight.
Attack and attempts to wrest control of the center.
Prepare to castle
Preparing to fianchetto the queenside bishop.
Defending the bishop from b5
I can attack sooner.
Attempting to exchange queens to blunt the attack.
A pawn for free, I could not play Rxe6 because there's no good follow-up.
Threatening to fork queen and rook with Nxe6. White's best move here is probably Qh8, trying to blunt the attack by exchanging queens.
I don't have to take with the knight. I'll happily trade a rook and a knight for a queen (and that may have been white's best move).
But the best possible outcome is the loss of a rook after Rh8 RH3 , K moves, RxR, but that's the only way to save the queen.
The only way to avoid mate, but it wouldn't take a rocket scientist to see the next move.
I was hoping to mess up his defense by doubling his pawns.
I think he's planning to take my bishop...
Heading for the rook.
Protects queen on trying to get the rook.
If queen atempts to get rook, nd2 will take it. Also allows queen to take bishop and not be a stupid move. Also allows development.
Threaten Bb4 so I can continue with my mate.
Nice! A good mate that I didnt see! Some random stuff and good stuff as well!<n>One of the problems I had here was, I didnt look what my enemy was doing.
Beginning to pressure Black's K-side.
Attacking the weak point at KB7. Deep Blue used the same Knight move against an exhausted Garry Kasparov in a Caro-Kann to win the decisive Game 6 of the second match, thus making a computer World Champion. Humans have, as yet, been unable to reclaim that mantle.
I would think that 11... B-K2, preparing 12... O-O, would be a better plan. With the game opening up, Black needs to get his King out of the center.
The Queen must bestir herself.
I never respond to e4 Ruy Lopez and so I have the French or the Sicilian or the Caro-Kann in my mind as a response.  Rule out the French Defense because the barricades there limit Black to do anything except defend.  Rule in Sicilian or Caro-Kann and then an attack is possible and imminent by Black--and isn't the best defense an Attack? Sometimes I do Sicilian and in this case I do it.
And this is now my problem.  I am essentially behind in development while White has traded with a front I can't attack. I lost the attack here.  "In the fog of war" sort of thing.
I'd have done the same if I was White. That King Bishop Pawn in the King's Gambit is crucial to quell Black into absolute submission.
I need to make an advance in the common Infantry Point formation.
Time to castle.
I see the weakness again on castling Queen side.  It usually turns out to be a more vulnerable position for the White or Black King to do the Q side castle.  The a1 and b1 squares are open for a prying move to break the box the King is in.
If White takes my rook with his bishop then there is nothing to stop the a3 pawn now.  What will White do now?
We are still at this point even in the material world but working against a Queen with multiple pieces is always a touchy endeavor.  The Queen needs space to maneuver and my pieces need to be where the Queen is limited in movement. I can also use my King to ensure this...
Not sure about this move. I wanted to castle but did not want to spend tempo protecting the Knights either.
The drawback to the plan is that Black has the Knight placed on c6 with tempo. I will still spend more time using the Knights. Reminds me a bit of Alekhine's Defense with all that hopping around and whatnot.
Black's plan is simple. Push the pawn to b4 and capture Knight. I can retreat one and reposition the other but the e4 pawn is left en prise a la Nc6.
My counter is equally simple. Gambit the Knight. If I am to go down in material, at least it should be in exchange for position. I can strive for play on the Queenside.
Pin the problem Knight. Mobility is essential for me now. My other pieces and pawns need to be repositioned with minimum interference.
I decide to make good on my threat. I give up the Bishop pair but I relieve pressure from my e4 pawn and open an outpost on d5.
Black gets the King to safety and further reduces the impact of my Bishop.
I consolidate the centre of the board and plan to dominate the light squares.
I want to make the opened a-file Black's Achilles' Heel. The b- and c- pawns can gain much honour in the battle ahead.
Black counterattacks on the Kingside with the intent to destabilize my centre and open lines to my King.
Any number of siege plans can follow. I did not analyze the Kingside in detail but pawns + Bishop + Knight + Queen/Rook just felt bad for me. I needed to hurry up.
No use having backward pawns. This move allows me to push c5. It also restricts Black from getting to a5.
We both ignore the other's plans and hope our own attack is better. The ultimate game of "Chicken." I loved it!
unsure now about this. work done for fianchetto but now blocked in. 17... Bf6 18. Bxf6 Nxf6 or 17... Nf6 18. Bxf6 Bxf6 and more mobile bishop
bring king towards d7. not a5 since 27. Bb5 and the king can't be another defender
blunder, there was enough firepower to defend N on d7
can't play axb2 since lose rook after 33. Rh8 K? 34. Rxa8
I then decided to proceed with the dragon variation, which probably wasn't wise.
I suppose it might start to be telltale at this point that my opponent was working on a kingside attack. I was too focused on building towards a queenside attack that I didn't notice a trend that began to be apparent in the next few moves.
Here, with the aftersight of how the game progressed, its pretty easy to see that my opponent's bishops, queen, rook, and the d4 knight were perfectly set up for a pawn attack against my dragon formation. I've discovered that this might be a weakness of the dragon...in my past games it has seemed to depend on the pawn structure and bishop remaining in that formation. I might need to think of a defense that can answer this threat if I'm to continue using it.
Here the pawn attack begins to be apparent. At this point, I was considering a knight sacrifice for one of the pawns, probably the g4 pawn, to break up the attack, since I've experienced previous games where pawn attacks were devastating. However, I didn't want my opponent to gain a material lead so early in the game. I foolishly decided to try and keep building my own attack.
This, it turned out, stemmed the tide a little longer, and I had some hopes at this point of surviving the attack.
The knight kept on attacking my queen and concentrating around my king. There was really nothing I could do.
As soon as he brought his rook down, it didn't take long for me to realize there was no way I could win from this situation. Here's to a poorly played but instructive game.
I have seen the arrival of the queen on the a5-square many times in Sicilians and then a contest on opposite wings has been put into order.
it is hard for black to keep finding the right moves; this is not helping either...
mainly preparing b4, with possibilities to break up the a-file freeing Ra2... or d4/f4 in some cases...
blacks' position was already deteriorating; Qd7, was best here to take the edge of an upcoming d5... after Rf2, cxd4, Rxd4, Qc6, black can hold out longer... black resigned; after d5, Qd7, Qf3!, R6e7, e6! all is over...
There are lots of tactical traps to play after 6... Kxf7 7. Nxe5 (Black cannot play 7... Nxe5 because of 8. Qxd8).
Black leaves the bishop alone, but now has dropped a pawn and lost the ability to castle.
Defends the e4 pawn and keeps the mobility of the king down. If 7... Kf6 8. Bf5 is planned, but perhaps after 8... g6 black can start to mobilise pieces.
Clearly aiming for Bb7, I decided that the timing is right for 9. Nd5 , as the exchange after 9... Nxd5 10. Qxd5 is favourable for white -- the rook at a8 is hanging and the Queen can join with the bishop to attack black's king
Chose to avoid the exchange, but doesn't achieve anything solid with this move.
Only two options here -- if 10... Kd6 then 11. Nxf6  is very painful, as it drops material for nothing and allows white to swap off the other knight, the c8 bishop and the queen on the d7 square, whilst leaving white the next move to castle kingside.<n><n>if 10... Kf7 then I plan on 11. b3 to fianchetto the c1 bishop and attack the lone e5 pawn. If 11... Bb7 then 12. Nxf6 is possible, but my e4 pawn is in danger, so perhaps another strategy will be required. Nc3 seems passive but perhaps Nxe5  is strong instead...
Interesting, I rather like the bishop here, so I will lay a trap that, in the worst case, leaves a straightforward material exchange.<n><n>12. Nxf6 only allows a King capture (before g6 the pawn was possible) now, as 12... Nxf6 13. Qxd8 seems losing.<n><n>12... Kxf6 13. Qd5 leaves some interesting threats. The rook is hanging but if 13... Rb8 14. Qe6  Kg7 15. Qxg6# is a straight win. interestingly, 13... gxf5 14. exf5 is also good as the pawn can replace the bishop in the mating attack if 14... Rb8<n><n>Alternatively, 13. Ne5  is also strong, with 13... Kxe5 14. Qd5  winning material for white.<n><n>12. Nxf6 seems therefore to give white a potentially winning advantage, unless there is some trickery I have missed!
An unexpected defence. I guess I assumed black would either move the rook or take the bishop. This seems to lose material now as the bishop can escape with a capture on the knight at d7
Material is heavily lost now, and black requires some tactical counter-play. I need to make sure the exposed nature of my king does not allow tactical combinations involving the queen and bishops. For example, whilst my queen rests on a8, a check with the f8 bishop allowing the rook to capture it is a real risk, albeit when the black queen is no longer on e7.
I am not so sure about this move and it's purpose. My idea is that black can with 6...h5 to achieve a good position (which i did not do :)) <n>For me most common is 6.Ne2
I think here i made a mistake with time. I should first develop the knight and play h5 and after it to place my bishop on e7 square. And c5 would be a good idea too
Here and the moves after i would play a3 with using of this losing time move made by black and after a3 Ba5, h5 to prevent the similar move from the black
I believe here is better first 12.a3 with putting the bishop out of the king side field. But i would not play after it 13.b4, because for me it would be a weak move. it would weaken the c4 square with already bad e4 one
This move was not necessary actually i was afraid from a3
Here i think that the black stands better but not much. I evaluate this because all the white pawns are on black squares and this is the reason i went to exchanges
26...B:b4?? it seems i did a huge mystake here. I evalueted everything like a draw, but as it happened i was wrong. My idea here was to put you in presure and without any chanses for losing to search and wait for your mystake.
It is interesting here that position like this one, but with pawn on b5, not on b7, black can hold the draw even without a rook :)
Congratulations to the winner, now i am going to have an remark :)
? This blocks my B in.  11. h3 was probably better.
?  Now Black's DSB is as hemmed in as my LSB so we're about even here.  I think the nuisance check and claiming of the a7-g1 diagonal would have been better.
Played to inhibit Black from advancing the N or d-pawn and to encourage Black to weaken the squares around his K with ...h6
The B returns to a better square than its previous base on d2.
If Black had put his B here on move 13, I wouldn't have been able to occupy e3 without preparation.
Following the series of exchanges, Black has the stronger looking position but his Q is vulnerable to attack.
This move was designed to protect c2 and prepare doubling of rooks on the open file but the computer prefers the immediate 21. f4, which is, I suppose, more forcing.
I assume he was worried about 22. c3, revealing an attack on his Q, but then he could have nicked the a-pawn.  It was probably better to contest the d-file with a rook immediately.
Here the computer advocates immedate action with 22..a5 followed by swaps of pawns and queens, eventually giving black a pawn advantage.  The move played does get the rook off the long diagonal, where it was potentially attacked by the fianchettoed bishop, and prepares the advance of the b-pawn, which will block White's pawns.
The N moves before it is attacked.  Now Black can swap it off and pursue his planned Q-side expansion.
I didn't think my Q could wreak any more havoc than his and I had long term hopes of capitalising on my Q-side pawn majority and my doubled rooks, so I decided to swap here.
So I decided to swap it off immediately, possibly also disrupting his pawns.  However, my B was really stronger than his, so perhaps I should have kept them on and improved the position of my King with 28. Kf2, covering the square e2.
Preparing to push the c-pawn.  The computer prefers me to keep my rooks doubled and offer to swap with 30. Rd6, which it evaluates as dead even.
Now the immediate 31. c4 would have been better.  After the rooks swap on c4, Black wouldn't be able to hold on to his extra pawn for long.
Black occupies his 7th rank - always a good thing to do - and puts a double attack on the c-pawn - but that was about to move anyway.  Perhaps attacking White's a-pawn immediately was the better way to go.
The computer prefers 34. Kf1, allowing Black to double rooks along White's 2nd rank , deliver several checks and snaffle the h-pawn.  I preferred to stop the classic 2-rook mate by pulling my rook back to the back rank.  Black will still be able to double on my second rank but I hope I'll be able to limit the damage.
I hadn't meant to drop this pawn though ...
Preparing to block Black's pawn on a5, I think.  The b-pawn is now undefended and could have been quickly won by Black.
and before attacking the f-pawn, I should have blocked access to my King by retreating the c-rook to c2.
The danger to my h-pawn forces me to allow the rook swap.
Now I think I still have drawing chances if I can just frustrate Black long enough with pins and checks along the ranks - Black has to prove his win as I'm not going to give up without a fight.  The computer evaluats the position over the next dozen moves as Black being slightly more than 2 pawns up but no more than that.
No comment from the computer but the evaluation drops to -1.49 with this move.
But this is a mistake: Black can now mop up my two pawns.  I should have just retreated to g2 and continued with my harrassment strategy.
Now it's 4 pawns advantage.  If only the computer had a longer event horizon, I think it would have been predicting a forced win for Black here.
A mistake, allowing White to settle his King on g4, preventing the pawns from advancing further.  Black should first have freed up his Rook for checking action from (e.g.) the d-file.
But White returns the favour, increasing Black's advantage to 5.  g4 was the right square, preventing Black's King from advancing yet.
?  Black tries to throw the win away!
But White misses the opportunity: I could have got my draw immediately with 80. Rxg5+!! Kxg5 81. Kxf3 Kf5 82. Kg2 and I stop the pawn from queening by shuffling around on g1 and h1.
Apparently a blunder that should have allowed Black to queen.  The computer evaluates the position after this move as -13.34. Instead, I should have retreated to the second rank and switched to a policy of checks from front and rear: 84. Rb2 Rd4 85. Rf2+ Kg5 86. Rf8 h3+ 87. Kh2 Rd2+ 88. Kg1 g3 89. Rg8+ Kf4 90. Rf8+ etc, resulting in an evaluation of -5.21.
In the line given by the computer at White's previous "blunder", the computer gave this move as the correct continuation.  But the evaluation after this move has reverted to -5.21: presumably another stark example of its event horizon.  Whatever, an advantage of 5.21 should enable Black to win from here.
and now the computer announces Mate in 12.
But this is not the way to deleiver it, only evaluating to -7.52 ....  86...g3 was the correct move.
?? enabling White to win the g-pawn or draw immediately with 88. Rxg3 Kxg3 stalemate.  The rook is immune to capture while White's King is trapped in the corner and to free it up to move Black will probably have to give up the other pawn as well.
?? Black should have put a stop to the checks with 88. ...Re4.
8. ....... e6 - Freddy tries to keep up with his opponent in the development stakes, he opens up a line for his dsb.
10. ........ Bb4 - and a pin the other side of the board.
16. Qb5+ - not dxe5??  If white plays that then his queen drops on d3 with QXQ.
19. Qxg7 - white grabs the g7 pawn after his rook goes on a1.  As the rook on h8 is en prise there is nothing Freddy can do to avoid his dsb being taken.  Instead of 0-0-0 at once, could Freddy have played Bxd4 instead, grabbing a white pawn as the rook on h8 would have been covered by just one more move.
30. ....... d3 - Freddy tries to promote his passer on the d file but it is easily stopped.
36. Bxd3 - although material is even, Freddy has had enough.  It looks as though white's kingside pawn majority could be decisive here as Freddy's isolani on h5 could easily drop off allowing those white g and h pawns to crown.  So he resigns on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  Commiserations and good effort against the IM, Freddy!<n><n>Joanne
pressure on the pawn
a must move.  black has to castle
The queen exchange might have helped white, breaking up king cover to boot.  granted, the black rooks are centralized and the B has decent scope, but the threat of Qxf7 is only slight
black is fine with the open file.  the white rook hasn't moved and the N on c3 is far from action
the white rook is blocked from helping though the N covers the mating square
Trying to drive the Knight.
Sacrificing the Bishop to open lines of attack.
Tempting Black to retreat with 17... K-B1???, to which the follow-up is 18 B-R6ch!!! and Black can resign.
Black doesn't fall for the trap. But now his King is exposed.
The King-hunt is on in earnest.
The fatal mistake. Now the King is toast.
Black bows to the inevitable and resigns.
Now the light square bishop is stuck!
Moving in for the attack... planning to do Nxf3 and open the g-column to an attack on the king.
Planning to exchange knights... now that I have the advantage, I'm going to just get rid of as many of White's pieces as possible.
Still trying to get the queen
At this point, I decide to try for a back-rank mate anyway.
Preparing to do Qc1+ to force a mate. At this point, if I were White, I would have done Qa3 to increase my defenses on the back rank
White refuses the sacrifice, avoiding open, tactical play, but in return black gets to grab a lot of space in the centre.
While the bishop is no better than a pawn in this position, I did not want to clog the 7th row in order to maintain the defensive power of my queen and to keep the option of Ne7
White's pieces are getting very active, and since trading for my bishop would put a pawn on f5 and create a monster of a knight at e6, that's not really an option. Instead, I figured I had to reposition as many pieces as I possivly could towards defense of my king.
Black needs to create some sort of couterplay. This move opens some opportunities for positioning the bishop along the a8-h1 diagonal, and serves to grab some space on the queen side.
Not without danger: there are some lines here that seem rather dangerous While I considered it defendable, there are some lines that are interesting enough to study, even if they end up falling short.<n><n>15. Nxh6 xh6<n>16. Ne6  Bxe6<n>17. Bxe6 Kh7<n>18. Qd2  Neg8 and the position is secure?<n><n>A similar position may arise if Ne6 is the first move. Another option may be Nxg7, which is followed by Ne6 regardless of the knight that black takes, practically forcing the trade with the bishop. The pawn on g5 can then be taken by white's light squared bishop, which leaves him with very active pieces and black with a very vulnerable king. Once again I can't completely oversee the outcome, since the moves aren't forced, but there certainly is merit in studying it
White avoids the complications, but the massive exchange now leaves the initiative to black, as he gets to focus on building up pressure on the queen side.
I don't really like the line white plays here, since black gets even more space to maneuver now. Sadly, I can also not see a clear path for white to take at the 19th move. However, if white keeps the position closed, black has to do some work before being able to open up the queen side himself (doubling rooks on the c-file, but first playing Qb7 to make sure the a-pawn doesn't get pinned is what I reckon would be the plan of action), alllowing white some time to reorganize.
White has properly defended against the pin, but black can still force trades that further the developoment of black's pieces.
Simply playing c2 wouldn't cut it, since white would be able to get his king off the first row, preventing a rook on b1 from being back breaking and eventually allowing him to pick up the c-pawn as he approaches it with his king.<n><n>White is not allowed to take on c3, since 32.... Rxg2 33. Kh1 Rf2 33. Ng1 (only safe place) Ng4 would happen and now the knight needs to move away from g2 to prevent mate on h2, but it has no safe squares to move to.<n><n>Attacking the knight with Re1 is also no good, as it is followed by 32... Rxg2 33.Kh1 Rf2 34. Rxe3 c2 35. Re1 Rxf3 36. Kg2 (any other move would allow white to play Rf2 making promotion of the c-pawn inevitable) Rxd3 37.Rc1 Rc3, with what looks like a very favourable endgame for black, as he gets to move the king towards white's pawns, while white has to make an effort to take out the c-pawn.
Too hasty after all, as demonstrated by white's next move. Better would have been Rd2, as white would still be unable to take on c3 because of Rd1# If white moves the king to remove the threat of checkmate, c2 can be played, after which Rd1 and promotion become inevitable. 34. Nc4 can be answered with Nxc4 35.xc4 c2 with once again unstoppable promotion. The sturdiest defense seems to be 34. Nf3 Rf2 35. Nd4 c2 36.Nb3, preventing Rd2. This seems to hold the position for white, but the fact that white's king remains 'locked up' makes this position in black's favour, I believe.
White has dealt with the biggest threat, but the e-pawn seems to be there for the taking, as the white king is cut off from supporting it.
Dooms the pawn. If black would have been forced to come towards it and place the king besides it to support Re3, white may have had a shot of defending it, or at least abandoning it at a moment where it would allow him to apply counter pressure on the pawns on g7 and h6.
This is a poor move. Black had the opportunity to oppose the white king with 43...Kf5, forcing him to take a side (possibly after 44. h4 g4 or 44. h3 h5 45. h4 g4, which would allow the black king to advance
Forces the draw. Kf5 doesn't help because you will be left with either a pawn on the side of the board, or a pawn ahead of the king, both of which can be defended and taking the pawn will also lead to a position where neither of the black pawns will be able to end the game
Sadly, I dropped the ball at the end of an otherwise reasonably well played match, leaving me with an unsatisfactory feeling (especially since a player at my level should understand end games well enough to not make the mistake in the end).<n><n>However, there were still interesting aspects about the game overall, so I hoped you enjoyed the annotations.
In this game, I gain positional advantages which eventually lead to the win of a pawn. My opponent sacs another pawn to keep my knight hemmed in. I sac it to go into an ending a knight for 2 pawns down, but my king is so active, it is very hard to defend. I honestly couldn't see all the posibilities to the end. I wonder - would a computer have played this sac? Perhaps someone with Fritz or a decent chess computer can tell me please? Was there a defence?
I was a bit surprised at black exchanging on c6. Surely it is better to wait?
This is very hard for white not to lose a pawn. He finds the best way to lose it!
Now he doesn't get a chance to play it.
I told my opponent how I was to finish him off "I can play h3 and h2 followed by Kg2. If you try f4 I queen with check and can stop you queening. If you meet Kg2 with Ng3, I take your f pawn and your knight cannot stop my h pawn queening." He resigned. The questions are - could have held that ending? Are there any computer programs which would have played that knight sac?
Honestly I didn't want to play the queens gambit. I was going for the London System.
Marshall presses the attack.
Marshall continues his development, and since it's a QP opening, he focuses on the invasion point at QB7 instead of KB7.
Tchigorin cautiously continues his own development. He aims to move his KP and clear lines for developing the K-side.
Giving Tchigorin one safe and one disastrous way to recapture.
Better was Bc7 or Qc7 preventing my knight from jumping to a5 then c6.
Better was to keep the rook on the e file to prevent the bishop to mvoe to e5.
I resigned here because it is easily won for black. He can give up the bishop for me pawn and then he could play c1.  If I try to check him once he gets his king to b1 the game is lost.
with the though of d5 and opening the f column for my rook
(doorslaan op f7 was ook mogelijk: 15. Txf7, Txf7; 16. Pxf7, Kxf7; 17. Dh5+ en 18. Dxc5 – maar deze combinatie heb ik tijdens het spel niet gezien)
My friend wants to eat my e5 pawn. He likes Ruy Lopez openings.
I wanted to chase his bishop, but I should have played c5 then. But I wanted to play. He is a worse chess player then I am, give him a bit of material advance:D:D I wanted his bishop, because if he doesn't play Nxe5 or Ng5, after 7... a4 8.Bd5 attacking my rook, c6 would have won a bishop.
Opening his DSB. Where is my King and where is my Queen??? Now, I played too quickly. His Knight was too annoying for me...
Nice move. If Bg5 now, then Nf6 prevents him taking my Queen. But I don't have the Knight any more. ( I lied, I don't like horses. HAHAHAAA) BUT!!! It was also a mistake!!! After Bishop to g5, I would have been forced to move my Knight on f6 and he could have played Nd5# Or just simply Nd5# I must have told him the truth:D:D:D
Retreating his bishop, and attacking my rook.
I have already mentioned, he is not the best chess player, so I planned this way: 18.bxa3 Re6 19. Nb1 (protecting the discovered accack from f8 to a3) Rg6 and after I would attact his Queen with my LSB , check with my Knight on f3 (free meat), He captures my knight, and I captore the pawn on f3 checking with the Rook and attacking h1 square... His Queen would have been lost, at least I could have exchanged my Rook for it on g3 or somewhere else...
I wanted to play this because I attack his Knight, he moves it away, and I protect my Knight on d4 and if I move that knight away, I protect my pawn on e5.
I continued my idea, because if I can play what I wanted to played before, I would attack his Queen and put some pressure on his kingside as a weak counterattack.
Now, if he can play c3, my Bishop or my hatred horse would be lost.
Anything, but not Kc7 because Qe7+ would win another pawn, or at least it would go on attacking after c3 and I save my Knight or Bishop.
Now, I wrote him on msn, again: I am going to win, HAHAHAAA! You have no chance:D HAHAHAHAHAAA! I was sure he was going to win...
If he takes my Bishop, I take his pawn checking his King, and he must play Queen to h3, or...
He is going to capture my Bishop with his h pawn...
Only option, because if 34. Ke1 then Rhxf1# and also Rfxf1#.
Yeeeeeeeeeeah! Now, he wanted to pull my leg and he wrote to me: Oh, no, you are now able to capture my Rook for free:'( I replied: I would choose your Wueen, if it's not a problem. He told me this time he wanted to pull my leg this weak way...:D hahaha...
I also had no better idea, but to start bringing my King in the battle. And the pawn on g4 is quite vulnerable.
He told me to finish this game quickly, he had to go... My reply: OK, I win quickly and you can go.
I tried to put my Rook on g5:)
FIIIREEEEE! Oooooh! Finally! About 35 hard moves for me! From move 12 to about move 47! And my dream came true! I won! I was glad to finish this game. Especially with victory... Please, rate my first annotation (this one:D)! And also, add comments, please! Thanks:)
open my prawn up a bit allow my bishop to see the whites prawn
UM MM this was a good move by white, if i move my bishop back he has the prawn on g7, and my knight on f6 is in danger i cannot let this happen!!
OK i new this would happen and i let it but, better to attack now i am sick of giving away control!!!
OK i gave away my bishop but i am attacking whites queen, forcing white to take my bishop and exchange queens
well if you want to take my knight you will have to put your self in check, i didnt want white to take my knight
OK what white had seen there was my hidden attack of moving my Knight to g3 in my next move putting white in check and allowing my to capture whites rook, so good move again by white well spotted
had to do this i thought if i attacked with my knight i would have allowed white to get a prawn on b7 and my rook useing the bishop on g2, i wasn't about to let that happen
Forced to move my knight, OK but where to move it that's the question, rem it will be check in the next move, in the end better to be safe and move him back to f6
White rook safe but I can see checkmate in the future, need to tempt white with bate tho just to distract there attention, so i can go for the KILL, what can I use ow ya my other knight
OK this took a bit of risk, rem I new white would take my knight I was counting on it, and I have hidden my true attentions, that%u2019s checkmate, now I have the whites King where I want it YES :)
On a blitz basis, this opening has some very dangerous lines if black goes after the pawn.
I'm looking about how to shield the black diagonal instead.
I waited enough: now white "must" play Bb2, or I'll play e5, contesting his center space.
Saving the b4 pawn, but losing another developing tempo. This is the reason white coudn't allow e5 in the first place.
Just weak? Maybe, but white still has b5 for his pieces. I can allow myself to play slower than average. a6-c5 was the natural and good plan, but it was too explored. I'll try something else.
I sac the central pawn! Crazy, but it will give me more tempo after Bd6, and since W's lsb is still a move away from b2, maybe I can play this crazy move.
White refuses the sac - with a higher rated player offers you a sac... just in case, refuse it. If you can. White could, with this nice move, asking a question to my B.
Ok, let's take it and open my h column. I can cope with that, and even turn it in my favour. Be careful!
White plays the tactic way. Now let's see: NxB opens an attack over the WN because of BQ, but any of the possible takes back are just good for white, defending it. I can hope in 9... NxB, 10. QxN, f5!?, 11. Qg3... and black just misses one tempo to make of Bd6 the weapon to recover the N... or not, because white can defend with f4 at some point... too dangerous! And if 10. hxN, I have just nothing. But I am not forced to take it! Its better to have there a B than a Q... I can use my center instead... can you see how?
A center is valuable because an just when it can do things like this! White's N has few places to go to, since I didn't give up my Nf6 for the W's lsb.
No, it was not a mistake! If Ne2, I would have played d3!, and after fxd3, Bxd3, with a pressing and dominant position over white. White could have exchanged and played for Qe2+, hoping to unravel himself with some exchanges. Now, how would you proceed?
...of course. This pawn will become a formidable outpost and, if c3 is played, will block forever THREE white's pieces. White shouldn't have allowed this. Better for white is to take, and try Be2, etc, begging black doesn't find something along the way...
The worst? White coudn't allow dxc2, and if 11. NxBg6 instead, ...dxc2 and white can't take it or 12. Qxc2, hxBg6 and NxB is now a threat for white. After white's B retreat, black has plenty of options.
White went for the "normal" one. The risky was 13. Qh5. black will win the N with xNg6, but white would have had Qxe5+, usually very good. But not in this position! White made the best move, after all.
Ok. Can I transform this into some advantage for me? Probably yes.
? Wanting to exchange Q? No, not now, and not like that!!!
Oh, there. Ok. Let me grab the least of an edge, if ever I have it.
Ok, his Q is diverted from the king, and d2 will fall. This is not a good strategy, since I free white's pieces, but see how I am unable to get some advantage. So I have to risk more! This is a blitz, not a championship. Will be my intuition good enough?
Adding another pawn to white's bargain.
...which he grabs. My B is threatened... will I defend it (and lose a tempo)? Never!!! :-)
He can get the useless B! I'll have a R on the second rank...
Very happy to take the turn to develop my forces, and looking hard for a "Tactic Trainer's like" trick.
...pressing hard on g2, being d8 covered by my B. Now, white can draw the game (if I am correct) with a tactic. Can you see it?
Now. Now! The game is not won. In order to win, I have to be sure to get rid of all white's pawn, and I have a B for doing it. How? White has to be sure about his pawn's march will keep black busy and, with luck, try to snatch some of the black's extra pawn in the process... very hard.
...I sacrify the pawn in order to get my Q able to check. I sense it was the right thing to do...
My Q gets closer and white can't avoid it!
Very elegantly, the B's bishop was "en prise" all the time, and participates in the mate... Thank you for reading!
Is this another centre game? All four royal pawns are in the centre of the board, and I'm hoping to open up the queens' file by 3. dxe5 dxe4, followed by 4. Qxd8+ Kxd8 5. Bg5+, so I could eventually castle queenside, hopefully checking. (By royal pawns, I mean the pawns starting in front of the king and queen).
I capture the king's pawn as mentioned in my previous comment, threatening to open up the d-file. I could now get ahead on development...
...but my opponent declines to recapture, covering the queen's pawn. This sounds like a gambit to me...
Moving out my knight to block the queen check was my best move, as should my opponent play 5... cxd5, I could regain the pawn, and possibly exchange queens, threatening a knight fork on c7, allowing me to win the rook on a8...
...but my opponent declines to do this, developing the bishop, no doubt hoping to surprise me. This may have been the wrong square, although 5... Bb4 would have been dealt with by 6. Bd2, allowing us to trade pieces, but...
With me having a three pawn advantage, I can afford to trade my opponent's knight for my bishop. I have also forced doubled pawns in front of the kingside rook...
...allowing me to capture a fourth pawn, giving me a passed pawn on c2. I have now removed half of my opponent's pawns, and although I'm about to drop one myself, I can now go in for equal value exchanges...
This was, I felt, the way to go. With the b5 square covered by my knight, should the queen move away, my kingside bishop can check the king, and I can possibly go in for an exchange...
...and I castle queenside to prevent a bishop check on f2, although this may have been unwise, with my pawn there under attack...
...but my opponent declines to take it, no doubt hoping to capture the more important pawn on b2 instead...
...so I decide to get my opponent's king moving by checking, so castling can no longer be an option...
...and I now move my knight to cover the pawn on b2, forking the queen and bishop, also saving the pawn on f2...
...so I can trade the bishop for my knight...
...and perform a royal fork with my queen, also attacking the rook and knight (which I am actually not threatening to take)...
...and I get the queen exchange, although I used the wrong piece, but my opponent may find a way to capture the pawn: 17. exd6 Rd8, then manoeuvre the king to attack, then remove the pawn and possibly exchange rooks...
...as I lose my pawn on e5 to the knight. However, I still have an advantage, but it's only two pawns.
I move out my remaining knight to free my other rook, as 18. Rxh6 would have lost a rook, where my opponent would play 18... Ng4! attacking the rook on h6, and the pawn on f2, also controlling the f6 square, and if I moved my rook away from h6, my opponent would play 19... Nxf2, and as the rook on h1 cannot move 20... Nxh1, so the knight move freed it (notice I placed my knight on h3, not f3, as that would have distorted my own kingside pawn formation 18. Nf3 Nxf3 19. gxf3)...
...so the king can now cover the kingside pawns...
...and use my rook in the middle of the board to attack the knight...
...so I move my knight towards the centre of the board to help my rook...
...and although the rook attacks it...
...it allows me to fork the rook and knight...
...so I get the knight exchange, leaving an extremely familiar double-rook endgame. If I can exchange both pairs of rooks, without losing any pawns, I have an extremely good chance of winning the game.
I now move out my inactive rook to connect it with its twin...
...but this allows me to get an exchange, as if one moves away from the file, the other disappears. This may have been a little dodgy, however, as I could end up with doubled pawns on b2 and b3, although 24... Rxb3 25. axb3 may lead to a possibility of undoubling with the only queenside pawn being on the rook's starting file. And I have two extra pawns...
...and my opponent enforces the exchange, moving to a single-rook endgame.
I move up my queenside rook's pawn to stop my opponent's pawn's progress, and to pressure the rook...
...forcing the rook to move away, hoping to hoover up my pawns...
...and my opponent lines up my bishop's pawn on the kingside...
...but my opponent clearly didn't notice that my king was adjacent to my rook, when I clearly had a numerical pawn advantage. I was expecting 28... Re1+, which would have forced me to block the mate with my rook: 29. Rd1, and 29... Re2 should possibly be followed by 30. Rf1, protecting the pawn on f2. Anyway, I got the other rook exchange I was looking for, with two extra pawns, one of them being passed.
I move up my queenside knight's pawn to attack the remaining pawn on that side...
...and get the swap, giving me a second passed pawn on the queenside, connecting them, so they could potentially help each other up the board...
...so I advance my QRP up to the 7th rank, where this time, it is unstoppable...
...and I move her along the top rank to check the king, forcing him onto the 5th rank had my opponent not resigned. The moral of the story? If you go into a pawn ending with a numerical advantage, in nearly every case, you will win, as you have more queening opportunities. It very often depends on how far advanced they are, and whether or not they are passed.
I'm going to risk somethin it can result in victory or eventually in defeat
The Giuoco Pianissimo, a very positional opening compared to the aggresive 4.c3!? 4.0-0 is also an option
To prevent his Bg4-Nd4 ideas
Offering a bishop trade after which there will be discoveries on the f-file.
I decide to trade because d4 will be available after the trade plus he has no rook on the f-file
to prevent my potential Qxa7
Black resigned because my king gets to g6,g7 and h6.<n>Game 2 has already started...
An unnecessary opening for the bishop that costs time and creates weaknesses on the kingside. -0.20/27
Gives black a slight edge, and can lead to some exciting lines.<n><n>If 14. Nxc3 Rxe3 15. fxe3 Nb4
Threatening mate and ganging up on the knight.
To win the bishop.
If I can trade Queens, I'm fine to lose a pawn.
Trying to keep the Queen on.
Forcing the King onto the C-rank
I was honored to be able to play someone ranked in the 1800's.
I started to figure this would be a battle of tempo.
After unpinning my queen I really wanted to place my knight here.  This proved to be a very valuable outpost!
I was shocked that jammic would trade this much material for this move.  After looking it over carefully, I decided that the bishop had to be terminated.
Now it's starting to heat up!
Fianchetto52 mentioned this move and the more I meditated on it the more it seemed like the best option.  Essentially, I'm trading an inactive rook for jammic's most valuable piece.  Apparently this seals the deal!
i was thinking about f5 followed by Qf6 and than a little trap on c5 aiming for the rook on a1... but
I like my setup.  My opponent has given me a free hand in the center and I am prepared to attack on the Kingside.  However, my opponent does not give me anything easy.
I thought here about c5 instead to gain space in the center.  However, it allows the N to jump to b5, forcing the trade of my dark square B.  I decided I wanted to keep the B.
An excellent move.  I can't play dxc4 because my Bb2 hangs.
Playing dxc5 and then exchanging Bs might have been better.  I would have a better chance of a Kingside attack.  On the other hand, White would be stronger in the center.  The problem with Bc5 is that is allows White to take more time to develop.
A good move which cuts off my N and heads the N to an outpost at b5.
I need to make space for my R.  I also gain a tempo by hitting White's Q.  Playing c6 to dislodge the N immediately loses the exchange to Nc7.
White avoids the temptation to play Nxc7.  Now that my R has space, his N would be poorly placed on c7.
Gaining a tempo by hitting the Q again.  White's Queenside pawn structure is a problem and I will keep trying to beat on it.
Gaining another tempo by hitting the Q.
In the heat of battle, White somehow missed the attack on the Q.  I think White probably had a good plan to open the e4 square to drop on the the Ns in.  This was a very unfortunate move in a well-played game for White.  I am guessing egill's rating will rise from where it is now!
Instead of wasting a tempo taking the pawn, I offer the computer my pawn to for a lead in development.
Black can't immediately take my pawn because of Qxd8  Kxd8 Nxf7  1-0
...................I develop a piece to defend it. Development is the most important part of the opening, and can often lead to pretty wins like this one.
Black should be developing his kingside pieces to castle there, because my strongly placed pieces will attack the uncastled king.
I develop a kingside piece while adding pressure to Black's queenside.
Every single one of my moves have been strong developing moves that control everywhere, so therefore I can castle before Black. Notice how we both had pressure on the c-file knights with pins against the king? Now since I have castled first, my pressure on the c-file knight and Black's underdeveloped queenside will allow me to take advantage of Black's uncastled king.
A developing move with tempo.
Black has wasted to many moves. Now he doesn't have time to castle.
If Black tries to escape with f6, then Na5 is a discovered check winning a piece.
Computer has already calculated the mate, so by the way it's programmed, it will stall mate for as long as possible.
Black's king is very exposed and my developing active pieces were crushing. Black didn't have time to develop the kingside because I had so many tactical threats on the queenside.
Nice.  I am partial to Re1.
Yes!  Black must defend against QxRf7+.  Nd6 also gives white Rf7.
this was novelty for me. Usually it is bishop exchange
Good exchange in my eyes
some center attack!
Hopefully it will be playable even with -2 for exchange. Good position and some pawns. I should try to use my position somehow.
using king as attack piece. it's needed if want to win. Or draw atleast.
oh! I loved this! trapped king! Now I plan to N R mate. N needs to go to f3. Easy - b3,d2,f3. It would need some tempo...
need to go to safety first
hmm. It looks bad. If Rb1, it'd go with my plan. I could not give up another pawn!
The first diversion from my game against untateve, in which 9... e6 was played. That is also the move I have encountered more often. This alternative prevents a knight incursion on f7, but has the disadvantage of further delaying the development of Black's minor pieces.
White gets another piece out in the hope that his strong central presence and developmental advantage will pay dividends.
Black opens a second line for the bishop, perhaps hoping to exchange it for the c3 knight. This does, however, seem to make 11... e6 look questionable.
White responds by getting his own bishop out, choosing to develop on e3 since if Black's bishop goes to g7, White has some pressure on the c5 pawn, and the c3 knight is free to move (unless Black takes it immediately).
Instead Black chooses to pin the White bishop, with an exchange looking likely.
White does not take the immediate exchange, since the c3 knight would have to move after 16. Bxd4 cxd4, and none of the available squares look particularly enticing.
Black protects the c5 pawn and prepares to get his king behind some pawn cover. Unfortunately....
The diagonal is opened, which White immediately seizes. Black must now respond to the threat of Nf6+.
An anchor, allowing the knight to join the attack at b5. White could play 18. Nf6 winning the exchange, but since White is still material down, that seemed unappetising; it would involve surrendering White's active minor pieces and would lead to a difficult endgame.
It's hard to see what this exchange achieves, since White recaptures with tempo and still has a knight ready to come to b5. Perhaps 18... Bxe3+ was better.
(?) The rook gets out of the way, but to the wrong square! Black needed d8 for the king.
The idea is that Black is going to try and hold the position, developing very carefully.
White would like to see Black play gxf??, Bh5++. But Black continues to develop.
Black is willing to give back the exchange to eliminate the active N.
Black tries to build a protective force around the king.
White takes advantage of the position of the Black bishop to get the pawn to d4, but at the price of a piece exchange.
? An immediate Qb4 is better. But the idea here is to prepare for freeing action on the Q side.
Black is willing to sacrifice the exchange for action on the Q side.
Black begins to assert pressure.
The plan is to exploit White's king position and threaten Qe5.
White resigns, since the g pawn is pinned and to prevent mate, the bishop must be sacrificed.
I had overlooked this move. The bishop can not move because it is pinned to the b pawn.
? Best probably would have been to exchange immediately. Now I must be very careful with my next few moves.
! Cutting off the bishop from the queen's protection. This move also opens up the threat of Bd6 which would prevent me from castling and making my position cramped.
This is practically force to keep the bishop off of d6.
!? Interesting. White will seize a strong initiative, but I can create a counter attack quite easily. White will have a difficult time defending that d pawn. However, it certainly can cause some problems in the future...
White gains another tempo, but now I will start to really pressure white.
Putting some pressure on the knight.
With the intentions of playing c5 at some point to protect the d6 pawn, or cxd5 to open the c file.
My plan was quite simple at this point. Open the f file, get my queen to g6 to attack white's king, and try to isolate the d6 pawn.
Further defending the b pawn and preparing to play Qe8.
Now that my plan has come to fruition I have a comfortable position. I am now threatening Be4 with a decisive advantage. As far as I can see white has only two good options. Either Bf3 (probably best) or a more aggressive Rf3.
This drops the e5 pawn, however there is not much else white could really do about the threat of mate.
This move is basically forced to prevent the queen and rook battery. Now I am up a pawn, but I must still be careful.
?! This is not best. The immediate Qxe5 was probably better, leaving white to decide whether to exchange or not.
The best way to defend the d6 pawn. I thought long and hard about playing b6, in an attempt to be rid of the pesky pawn. But after 26...b6 27. cxb6 axb6 28. Qc3! and white should be able to hold a draw. However, I chose to immediately put some pressure on the king.
And here we reach a critical point in the game. It is almost as if white is daring me to play Rf3. My opponent was getting very low on time though(just under 15 minutes). I started to get really nervous. Second guessing myself and I began to struggle with my calculations. So I messed up.
Anything else loses also. Just the threat is enough to make an opponent get scared and slip up sometimes though.
Now that my king is safe enough I can threaten mate with Qh4. My opponent did not have time to calculate how to prevent this so he did the simplest way of doing so.
?! Now that my king is in position to stop the pawn, an exchange of rooks will pretty much force a draw.
This now forces f5 so that the king can catch the pawn.
developing the QB outside the pawn formation.  e3 is to follow, and then the KB.  6. Bg5 merely invites Black to develop a minor piece in response (...Be7, ...Ne7, or ...Nf6) and probably commits the B to swapping off.  I prefer to contest control of e5 and d6.
One of those difficult moments when nothing obvious offers itself up for consideration.  Black's K is still stuck in the middle so this seems more attractive than Rc1 or any pawn moves or minor piece moves.  In the ideal scenario, White's KB will move to f1 and the e-pawn will advance to e5 and Black will be under pressure.
pinning the N against the R and preparing to castle
defending the N, connecting the rooks and casting an eye at h7
!? jumping out of the pin, allowing Black to take my R, but in turn removing the defence of the Ne4 and threatening to fork Black's K and R.  It's not clear who benefits most from the complications.
White wins an important strategic advantage: Black can't castle and his KR is stuck.
Black saves his R and seems to secure the material advantage.
but now White has a 2 pt advantage and plenty of tactical opportunities with which to follow up
The Queen was not really defended by the pawn, which was pinned by the B against the K
13. Nd4 - hoping to keep my knight on this good outpost.
15. Be3 - I now redeploy my bishop because I am hoping to complete my development on the queenside and then castle.
26. h4 - Over the last 2 moves I decided to put my pawns on dark squares that would be difficult for the black dsb to attack.  Craig's horsie does a tour de France to the queenside with devastating effect however.
29. Bb2 - this move is forced because I must get Fou Lenoir out of the knight's attack and prevent a fork on a3.  It leaves my f2 pawn weak though and this is gonna drop off.
32. Be5 - I decide to improve Fou Lenoir's position but black's move e3 kills things off stone dead.  I wave the white flag because I will have to give up my knight to stop that e pawn from crowning into the Wicked Witch of the West and getting at Henry.  Well played Craig - Joanne
I bring up my knight in case my opponent unleashes his bishop.
I attack the knight...
...my bishop is attacked by the pawn...
...at the expense of my bishop...
Now I decide I need to cover the square from a queen attack...
...but manage to pin the knight down to its file...
...but I can no longer use the rook to remove the knight...
...so instead, I bring one of mine to attack it, to ensure no net loss...
...and my remaining one has to move out of the way.
I eye up the rook in the far left-hand corner...
...but my opponent is wise to this...
...but I steal his bishop...
...and my opponent decides likewise for his pawn.
...and he moves his bishop to cover...
...so I push my far left-hand pawn up one, so the bishop can't attack it...
...and finally I remove the pawn on my fourth rank...
...but I create some space by removing his pawn on e4...
...to create more space on my right.
...so I stay close to my rook, although the bishop has it covered.
...but he declines to take it...
...so I attack his king once more...
(game info on previous page) Bird's opening (A03) named after the 19th century English master Henry Bird, probably just comes outside the bracket of the most popular opening moves: e4, d4, c4, Nf3 and g3.  They all try and contribute to control of the Centre (Nf3 and g2 in a more hyper-modern way), but Bird is less popular than The English (c4) because it weakens WT's King-Side and WT has to watch that fools mate diagonal (e1-h4).  Bent Larsen however used it to good effect.<n>Comment from yanov (1817):  if you look to statistics, black won more games than white, in all variations<n>Comment from me:  Yes, I don't particularly like it.
Standard kind of reversed dutch defence (1. d4 f5), controls 2 central squares and releases my LSB.  Another interesting option in the database was e5: The From Gambit, where White will have to play accurately to put out the flame in blacks attack.<n>Comment from charleshiggie (1937):  Perhaps, in case anyone is wondering, I should point out LSB = Light Squared Bishop and DSB = Dark Squared Bishop. The author also uses WT = white<n>Comment from me:  OK, sorry I thought it was pretty self explanatory. I'll explain that in any future annotations.
Releases his LSB, however his DSB is now cramped because of the dark square pawn chain on d2, e3 and f4.  This shouldn't be a problem however should he choose to play a fianchetto with b3 and Bb2.  However with me planning to fianchetto my Bishop along the same diagonal, I heard somewhere that the K-Side Bishop usually gains control of the diagonal when opposed by a Q-Side Bishop along the same diagonal.  Not sure if that's true though.<n>Comment from yanov (1817):  anyway, this construction is very passive -- white must play b3 rapidly<n>Comment from me:  I don't see this as too bad.
Even Stevens..<n>Comment from just_some_guy (1303):  i actually think black is a tiny bit better here he has more open pieces his dsb is only blocked at the moment his lsd has a 5 square attack d=radius at the moment his queen has a 3 square, but white's q and lsd have 1 and 0 squares respectablly.<n>Comment from me:  True, hard to make anything from these minuscule advantages yet though.
Dubious?  To me slightly passive, and takes away c3: the best development square for the Knight.  But the Knight is good on d2 as well, as it prepares both e4 and c4 advances.  I was encouraged at this point by my opponents arguably tentative moves.
A problem with K-Side fianchettos is that such pawns as f4 can advance eventually to f5 and cause problems.  e5 gains space and gets rid of the problem.<n>Comment from yanov (1817):  this is not a problem there, as black fully controls f5<n>Comment from me:  Yes, it can become a pest in the future however.
Position about =<n>Comment from bobdoleeatsfood (1144): I would disagree. White is cramped and black controls the center ad is more developed. I'd give a slight edge to black here.<n>Comment from me: Yes, I was probably wrong in that statement. You are right, I am better here.
Threatens Bxh3 and WT cannot take because of the pin.  Maybe I have the slight edge here.
So I can recapture on g3 with my Knight, forking f1 and e2 and getting the trade Bishop for Knight (Bishops considered more mobile on a fairly open board such as this 1).
Seems like the only option, but Fritz 9 recommends Bd1!?- Keeping hold of the Bishop pair and allowing it to become more active by coming to b3 (14. Bd1 Bxh3 15. Qxg3 Nxg3 16. gxh3 Nxf1 17. Kxf1etc..)
Best.  d4 creates a backward e-pawn and allows my B domination of the WT central squares.<n>Comment from yanov (1817):  i agree but from the beginning, white are strategically lost
Take with h7 to preserve my passed pawn.
Ke1 achieves the same thing, but moves out of the pin. <n>Comment from Charleshiggie (1937):  Surely Ke3 is the most stubborn defence? moving the king to a more active square, but avoiding the pin which forces resignation soon.<n>Comment from me:  No 27. Ke3 Bh6  and that's my simplification done, I can get rid of Knight & Bishop.
Opening a file to get rid of some of the heavy artillery.
The Queens are gone and now I threaten to swap off a pair of Rooks.
White is temporarily up a Pawn, but it's  doubled and isolated. Plus I now threaten to win it back.
I do win it back and threaten to remove the last pair of Rooks as well. But White has undoubled his Pawns as compensation.
The Knights come off the board, leaving a pure King and Pawn ending.
If i foolishly play 39... PxP? I lose a tempo in the race.
Technically, I'm now ahead one Pawn. But with an open board....
It would be easier to defend e5 with Qb8, although Black has to then be aware of any potential attack on the file.
Now trying to build up a kingside attack whilst my pieces seem to have good positioning.
Erm, yes, like I said, my kingside attack ... :S<n><n>Not quite sure why the change of plan here -- I think I was blocking bishop advances to b5 whilst hoping to play Ra3 to get the Rook into kingside play.
Hmmm, not so good. now e4 can release the black bishop and I'm under attack myself. I'd love to know what I should have done differently? The only thing I can think of is playing dxc6 myself and then following with f3, but it seems to restrict the kingside I was trying to activate.
Trying to maintain the initiative and swap a bishop back as I get uncomfortable with my opponent having both bishops.
Strange move to me? I'd love to know the thoughts behind this one.
Tempted with g4 and Nxd6, but my desire to remove a bishop was greater.
Hoping to play b4 and lock up the queenside.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is just so agonizing.  I came very close here to ending my losing streak with Coach Ion.  Incredibly the only real mistake I made in the game was to resign it!  I did keep in my game notes the analysis I made before the decision to resign so I will show them to you so you will at least see just what prompted my decision.  I kick off with 1. e4 and Ion gives me the Robatsch Defense.
11. Qd2 - I am preparing to exchange dsbs here.
17. b3 - I will soon want to centralise my queen rook so I give my a4 pawn some back up.
18. Qd4 - forcing a queen trade as the Wicked Witch of the West is pinned to her other half!
22. f4 - to hold back e5.
25. Kf2 - I want to trade off the final pair of rooks and put myself in an endgame with Ion.  I have to tread carefully though else Ion's horse could spring to c3 via e4 and fork Henry and the rook.  Nevertheless Henry moves towards the centre.
31. Nc4?! - this move was just sooo tempting.  I should have perhaps played Ke2 here centralising Henry but the attack on the b6 pawn was for me a moth to the flame.
31. ...... Nxa4 - The moth gets burned.  The pawn on b3 is overloaded, defending the c4 knight from the BK and defending a4.  Ion's knight defends the pawn on b6.  If 32. bxa4?? I will be in a K & P ending a clear pawn down.  There is a way to regain the lost material though.  I analysed it and then set up some conditional moves.
33. Ng4 - forking the black f and h pawns, I must win back one of them.
37. Kc1 - I inch Henry towards the queenside because Ion may trade pawns creating a passer on the a column which could be very nasty if Henry cannot get to a1.
38. ....... b5.  Here I wave the white flag.  Here is an exerpt from my resignation note to Ion. Variation A 39. Nc6 a4, 40. bxa4 bxa4. 41. Na5 a3 42. Nb3 Nxb3+ 43. cxb3 Kxb3 44. Kb1 a2+ 45. Ka1 Kc2 46. Kxa2 Kd2 47. Kb3 Ke2 48. Kc4 Kf2 49. Kc5 Kg2 50. Kd6 Kxh2 51. Kxe6 Kxg3 52. Kf6 Kxf4 53. Kxg6 Kg4 54. Kf6 f4 - the f pawn will crown.  Variation B 39. Nxg6 a4 40. bxa4 bxa4 41. h4 a3 42. h5 a2 43. h6 a1=Q#.  But Ion sent me a pm.  Here is the excerpt from it.  Thanks for the game. Now, I'm going to tell you something you might not want to hear. I'm not altogether sure that Black is winning at all in the final position (after 38...b5). I'm not even sure my 38th move was the best! I did like it enough to play it "on screen", but you had a reasonable response in 39.Nc6 and if 39...a4? 40.Na7! <n>I probably would have had to try 39....Nf3 40.Nxa5 Nxh2 and maybe I would have had the edge.  So the only thing I did wrong here was to overlook the saver 40. Na7!.  I suppose the one consolation I have here is that it is one of my better efforts against Coach Ion.  Ah well, better luck next time!
The knights are poised to put pressure on the black position
Black offers an exchange which also restricts the bishop, I think I'll take it
I wanted my bishop on e6.
Now my f-pawn was free to move ahead.
He wanted to open the diagonal.
Now his black-squared bishop became useless there.
He did not saw what was about to happen. g3 was the correct move, wasn't it?
Of course here it was also possible g3. But he was disappointed since he hadn't noticed, and he moved fast. Anyway, I think my position after taking the pawn, checking and taking the bishop was good enough to have plenty of possibilities of winning the game.
I thought of annotating this game, and I decided myself to do it after seeing the comments on the puzzle (#89083) I created about it.<n>I hope you enjoyed, let me know what you think about it.<n>Sorry for any possible grammar mistakes.
I play Black in this quick play game. I wasn't really focused on the opening and was trying some barmy ones to see what happened.
I attack d4, hoping it will get me some tempo later on.
I can not take it so I bring out another pawn, thinking I can gain some position
I think this is where white loses the game, I lose a pawn, but I gain a huge amount of tempo
Perhaps sensing that I am gaining to much position, white attempts to make his 2 point advantage decisive with a queen swap. If I take the Queen white also has a strong knight on g5.  I want to keep the attack on b2 as it is essential to my plan! However I give him what he wants with...
white attempts to catch up
I am not sure why white does this now, there was no pressing threat on the back rank and it allows me to win the game
White assumes the rook defending the bishop will be enough, then sees his blunder
Tries to push the knight away and at the same time giving his rook what he thinks is an escape square (but for Be6)
I swap the rooks and gain parity on material
Strong and natural, forcing the Queen to move again.
T. M. was shocked at this move. I remember him poking me with his elbow, as if to say, "I can't believe she made a mistake!"
The 5th Game between Graham and myself.  This one was fairly long but i tried to hold on to a game i really should've resigned.
I really should not move my queen so early but felt i needed to try get in early for the win,  I was wrong :-)
A piece up and decent space control.  I need to hold onto this lead......
I thought being a piece up exchanges are in order to widen the gap.
I thought it best to exchange when you are a piece up.  With every exchange the difference becomes bigger.
Help,  need to run now.
Going to push some pawns.  I dont want them in my half of the board.
I thought if i can get my queen up there maybe i can attack from the back.
I saw the pin 34.Be4 and i lose the queen.  Nice try graham.  For the record,  graham did manage to catch me in the same trap a bit later on.  Well done buddy.
Got to try get something for it.
I think black should go ahead and play 11... Qe4, trade queens, and use the time to further develop while white tries to shuffle his king to safety. 11... Nxe5 grabs a pawn but allows white to castle and eventually equalize.
To bring the rook into the game.
Taking back immediately obviously loses another pawn and the file. This is white's best hope, though black still has the initiative. Of course black cannot try 16... Nb2, or any other knight move, because they all lose to 17. Qxd8 and then mate.
Regrouping. There's no way to immediately continue the attack on d3.
I assume black was aiming for 18... Bh3, but can't play it now that the knight is under attack.
If it'd been me, I probably would've moved the knight. After 24... Nc7 25. Qxf6 Black's kingside is open but he still has many defensive possiblities. Material isn't everything, but it is something, and the knight on c7 would go a long way toward defending against white's major pieces.
Black hadn't been playing well for a few moves, but this seems to be the key blunder. Black MUST keep the queen on the a2-g7 diagonal for defense. 26... Qf7 is probably best, since white can't immediately harass it any further there; Rooks on the d-file prevent the queen-winning pin.
Ouch. Chess games are often lost when one player can't bring himself to concede material and a won piece becomes a mating attack. Black needed to be able to bring his rook to the seventh rank, since the queen is preparing to threaten mate on it. Now he can't.
28... Be6 isn't much better, since after 29. Rxe6 white wins the bishop, gains a tempo and prepares a brutal discovery check on the diagonal. Black is lost.
The irony is that black is not in check and is a move away from delivering a mate almost identical to the one white is preparing. But his queen isn't in position, and he has no time.
Aaaand the arrival of another major piece seals it. Anything black does with his rook or bishop will be met with any number of mating moves, the most elegant being 31. Bg7#. The only way to delay is to sac the queen with 30... Qf8, Qd1  or Qxg3 , all of which are empty. Black resigns.
I often play the Scottish gambit, but I found that against 2...d6 3. d4 xd4 4. Bc4 is rather lackluster. I therefroe tried to prepare for d4 this time, trying to create a strong centre.
Contesting black's centre. If I get to trade, my centre is similar to that of black and if he decides to trade, I will develop my queen and create more open files which may be used later to create strength out of my isolated passed pawn.0
Letting me trade means the e-pawn will not easily turn into a monster. On the other hand, I get to trade queens on my terms, which ends up costing black quite a few tempi
Quick development is of great importance, since seizing the open files besides the passed pawns on the e-file will be instrumental to make yours a danger before your opponent can attack you with his. The bishop on c4 helps preventing that black will castle short.
Best placed, but blocks the g-pawn, so the double advance to g5 to grab space won't be possible
Creates an outpost on d5, but also a weakness on d6. I think simply developing with Nc6 seems stronger and then answer 15. Nb5 with castling long.
17....0-0-0 is still not an option, since 18. Rad1 leads to problems.
This covers potential threats from the black e-pawn, but opens up the possibility for black to play h5-h4 at some point, so perhaps it was suboptimal compared to Bh3.
Black basically has no hope of castling any time soon, so he gets his rook into play like this instead. The king in the centre actually turns out to be a problem, though once I get my pieces to active squares with the help of my e-pawn.
blocks the d-file so that black can not cause mayhem on the second row and makes my knihgt more active at the same time.
shields the f-file, so castling short becomes an option, but importantly, it concedes control over f5 momentarily, where my knight may cause some trouble.
Trying to keep the initiative. After Nd3 the plan was to play 21. Nf5 Nxf5 22. Bxf5. After 22....Bd5 23. e6 looks very dangerous with the prospect of Bg6 and after 22....e3 23. Rf3 looks quite strong.
Chasing away the bishop so the king will be stuck in the centre, where he can be easily attacked.
The g-pawn looks like it is rather important, but perhaps it would have been better for black to just let it go in order to better defend against the impending attack.
Threatening checkmate on e7, while attacking the rook on d8. Simply moving away with the rook on the last row leads to 27. e7, threatening Bd7 and moving it along the d-file of course loses to 27. Rc8 Rd8 28. Rxd8#
Wins a piece, as I can recapture on c7, bringing my bishop to safety.
34. e7 Was a bit more elegant, but being a rook down, black has seen enough anyways and concedes.
13...Qxg2 is probably very dangerous because of 14.O-O-O and Black's lack of defenders on the kingside.
Allowing the White Queen to go to f3, you must put pressure on a pinned piece.
This move ensures that the d7 Knight and Black Queen remain stationary in order to protect f6.
Allows for 0-0-0 and looking long term, plans for a rook to come to g6.
! - Preparing for Rf4 to put as much pressure as possible on f6
! - Now how many of us would nick the a7 pawn? Interesting idea, but instead, Tarrasch can see Black wants to unlock his position with a Rg8 and a Rook swap. This allows white to respond to that threat and keep the pressure on.
With the idea of Qf5 and Rf3 and winning the pinned Knight on f6.
Anticipating Qf5, which would have pinned the d7 Knight. One pin was bad enough; the last thing Bogoljubow wanted to see was another pin.
Bogoljubow goes for plan 3: to give back the pinned piece; in return he picks up the exchange.
?! - The matter of the pinned piece has been settled, it ends with a pinned Rook on f3. This, however, is an amazing miscalculation from Bogoljubow. He has obviously relaxed after the all the fun around f6 has been resolved.
Black either wanted to go into a Rook v Knight ending intending on QxQ to play Bxf3+ before re-capturing on h6 or he has totally miscounted the h-pawn moves to promoting.
The White King and Rook cannot catch that h-pawn but the knight can!
And Black resigns here. A masterpiece put together by the great Tarrasch.
black has to counterplay fast
this is black objective, to open king-side.
recuperate the pawn, but with a risky move for the bishop.
here i recuperate a pawn, and start to imagine a possible win.
willing to keep both bishops.
the fear, is to finish with opposite bishops, that would lead to a draw.
good thinking: now black is on the move... And, late, I realize my king is not so cool
God damn! Now, if Bxh4, then Qxa1 + recuperates the bishop + threats a fast Rd2 possibility...
I needed to keep my pawn up to try to find counter-game, because, now, black is on the lead, clearly!
yes: my counter attack was lead by the ideas Qxe5 and Rc7... Of course, I could have hoped for that kind of dream.
to create a bubble of oxygen, in case of attack on the first line.
now, black is safe from my own attack.
thanks to h4, the first line is no more a dead threat, but I needed to recuperate some column
good thinking: if i take, the king comes to participate to the pressing, if I play h5, then g5 is destroying the infrastructure.
but not to close... With the king on h4, then g3, it would have become too sweaty.
i calculated that my pawn would arrive first, and safe, due to the black queen and the white queen positions.
after having played that move, i was wondering: wouldn't it have paid to play b7?! Qg3 56 Rg1, but then Qe1 leads to the draw, anyway. And 56 ... h2 is not better.
I see no reason to dislike this situation. On the contrary: I open the queen side and keep an average center.
recuperating the pawn... without the bishop.
expose the possibility of Bxf3 and disabling the castling, but I guess black was not very open to the possibility of a second opened colum, right on the king side.
both camp castled... White has to concentrate the battle on the queen side.
the idea was double: or you change, and I reconstruct my pawns line (which happened), or you go away and lose a tempo.
starting the progression. I am not sure black saw the coupled possibility of b4-b5 with the bishop e2 and the two rooks before the next move.
but black wants to preserve the pawn by giving the possibility to play axb.
well, then, we are going to get more soldiers.. on b5?
before taking the pawn, white viewed other advantage: as we are three on the pawn, we can allow ourselves to double the attack with this centralized knight. As black moves' Nd2 is without consequence, we can liberate our f3-defender and make him attack the bishop
yes, that was the threat of course! But it was also foreseen by white.
i guess he wanted to prevent Bd2, or to assure c3 and b4 for both horses.
well, the bishop was already with his voucher for b7, so...
i guess to prevent Nd7 - Bxd7 - cxd7 and then Bc8 which would be dramatic. But instead black loses its only threat to b1... on the other hand, with b7 and b4 occupied, there was no more threat for a good while...
prohibiting white horse to go to d7. It was not the plan actually. I planned to play Ba3, then, after the expected Na6 or Nc2 to play Be7, or even after Nfd5, to play Nd7, then
faster, now, because i can plan to go on a5. target is c7
unexpected, and losing faster, because the main protector of d7 is now exposed to...
Too soon! It had to play first Ke7
To this day, I really do not understand why some players avoid the symmetry of recapturing with the pawn.  The alternatives lose time from either Nc6 or e5.  Of course time is not everything, but being able to develop at your opponents expense allows you to take control of the direction of play.
He can create his own square for the bishop.
I missed the power of Ng5 here.  What I did see was 10... Nxe4 11.Qxd5.  Should I have tried 10... Nd4 or Be6?  [A]10... Nd4 [A1] 11.Nxd4 exd4 12.exd5 Bxc5 13.Bc4 b5.  White has an isolated queen pawn and the attack has been diffused. [A2] The queen moves and White has to play carefully. [B]10... Be6 11.Ng5 Nd4 with unclear play.
The other alternative is Be6, but I thought that if I played the queen move I might be able to avoid 12.Nxe6 fex6 13.Qxe6+.
Oddly enough I had dreaded this move, but when I saw it I thought that Be6 would allow him to continue his attack.  For a single pawn, which I was ahead anyway, I might remove the teeth from the attack.
The more I examine here, the more I believe that b5 is a serious Black misstep.  The Black knight on c6 prevents the painful 13.Nxf7 Rg8 14.Nxe5 Nxe5 15.Bxg8, but 13.cxb6 e.p. seems to allow White to pursue the same line only a move later.  Instead 12... Nd5 here, rather than later, puts pressure on White to prove his idea has merit.  Black ends up getting a break when white passes over the en-passant move.
Closing off my kingside to his queen.
The other alternative was Nxe4 which I think may have been prudent.  This continued attack is not so fierce as it seems at first sight.  White's main problem is the lack of piece involvement in the attacks.  I think 20.Be3! develops a piece with tempo, but Black is likely to respond to it with the same idea that works so well against 20.Ne6.
Most of Black's moves have been nearly forced for a while now.  Now Black has to look and think what to do to develop his own threats as well as counter the White threats.
Black cannot afford to open the position around his king.
This accomplishes two things.  It allows Black the option of exchanging on e3, and it covers Bb6.
If I had it over to play again, I would play g5.
As long as not Ka7.  I actually have had decent results on many of the rook-for-knight exchanges.  My advice to anyone who is on the "bad side" of this exchange is to find the compensation that the exchange creates.  Here the knight is a valuable attacker, and when it dies, so does the immediate prospects for further white pressure.
I realize this move is not great, but defending the d5 knight was going to be a slow crush.  Moving the d5 knight allows an exchange that allows him to seize control of the d file.
! The busy knight: Securing the pawn, offering the knight for an attacking lane, and denying d3 for the rook!  40.Rxd4? Ne2+! 41.Qxe7 Qg2#.
The correct idea when 2 pieces are in contact is to not take, but to keep up the pressure. This move releases the tension, and gives black a solid game. However, it does not waste time.
White's idea is to go with f4 and e5 and advance on the kingside.However, this move should not be played, because it does not develop the queen or help with the opening goals in a position that could become open. To be most active, the white bishop can go to g5 and the rooks can be developed to the open files. Black suffers no problems here, because he will be able to play e5 and develop nicely as well.
This move tries to take advantage of the white's slight edge in development. It is failing however, because it allows black to take the initiative, and develop with tempo. Before conducting an attack, the best preparation is always necessary. Developing another piece would be the best move.
(?)Now this is a concrete tactical mistake, but takes some efforts to find why. This move creates tactical motifs that black can exploit. The d3 bishop is hanging by a thread, since the queen has difficulty holding on to it. The f4 pawn is also under attack after ...Nh4 hitting the queen. If you use the right method of calculation here, I am sure you can find the best move and the reason why. Here, I used quite a lot of time, and calculated the game right out to the line that happened in the game.
The correct challenging continuation for white, as other moves lose the initiative and black starts getting the advantage. It is not tactically sound however.
(!)The correct first move in the sequence, which wins the game by getting a decisive material advantage. Here, by using the right method of calculation, you will see that black wins nicely in the most challenging line, with a nice trick at the end. Try to STOP and do it now. If you remember especially to calculate the most forcing moves at each variation, the shocker to the opponent will not shock you very much.
(!)White plays in the most challenging way possible, although this loses far more than other moves would. The winning move comes next. A shocking one, but can be spotted easily once you calculate the most forcing moves first. As a note, 18.Qh4 g5 wins decisive material as well. In the current position, 18...hxg5 19.exd7+ Rxd7 wins at least the exchange. This should win the game as well, but is not nearly as good as the best move.
(!!)And the opponent resigned, since the queen is lost, while the black queen escapes. The opponent here was rated 2100. It proves that you don't need to be able to visualize 10 moves ahead. The right way of calcualtion will help you play this way even if your absolute limit is 4 or 5 moves.
Continuing to apply pressure.
To attack successfully Freddy needs some open lines. Now he's opened one.
Trying to take control of the line. I naturally don't want to initiate the exchange, as then the recapture would give him the line and I'd have to exchange my other Rook to oppose him.
Freddy brings his other Rook over to the Q-side to try and break down my position.
I rush additional forces to the threatened sector.
Switching the attack to the K-side on the black diagonal.
Adding a guard to the KBP.
Looking to attack on both wings.
Here's where the game gets very interesting. I saw that he had 24... BxP with the X-ray attack on the R once the Q moves, but I also saw that I could defend with 25 N-K4. I know Master Freddy wouldn't just throw away the piece, so he must have sacrificed it for a reason, but I decided to take anyway and make him prove his attack would work. I assumed he had something in mind to N-k4, and he did.
Initiating the attack...
...and again defending it.
...so I add a defender to the pinned knight on K4.
Freddy ends up a Bishop and Pawn ahead after the tactical fireworks show.
Now I have to back up and with my limited remaining resources, try to hold out for as long as possible.
I tuck my King in the most secure spot left.
It's a lost cause now, but this move inadvertently enables Master Freddy to construct a nice mate in 3. I was prepared to resign...
Probably to avoid 6.Bd3, for black doesn't want to play c4
The black queen has little place to go and there is a danger for black on f7.
Why not accept the gift ?
Unpinning the bishop and menacing to exchange bishops if black plays 13... exd5
Just to prevent black to castle
Black wants to send the white queen away from the LSB to take on d5
Only move to carry on menacing the LSB
Critical point of the game :<n>White has a strong material advance (partly compensated by the fact that white will take the LSB)<n>Black's pawn structure is terrible<n>but :<n>White will quickly be out of the center<n>The white king is extremely weak<n>Black pieces are more active and better connected ( The white queen is alone and in danger)<n>Black has a rook on the central open file.
Finally black takes the bishop and is evidently better now because white's rooks are blocked.
White needs to keep the d5 pawn on the d file to block black's d rook
I had trouble to understand this move (19... Bxc5 is so tempting and evident). Black probably wants to avoid the pin of his c knight by the a rook)
freing the rook
Not taking with the rook, for this menaces fork attack by a further Bf4
I was asking myself why not Qc4.
Not sure about this move. It joins the rooks and white is planning to hide in b1 but masks the c rook and enable black's next move.
Why not 35... Ke7 ?<n>Probably because if 35... Ke7 36.Qe4 Be5 and white has a chance to give perpetual chess...
white continues with the Amsterdam by pressuring the king pawn
Here White makes a minor mistake. Instead of Ne4, I would either castle or push the queen pawn to c5. The knight can't do anything, even though black's position is too clumped, the knight can only take the bishop which as we'll see doesn't do much good.
This move doesn't make much sense either. That pawn is no threat to white in any sense. Even if white castles king side, that pawn would be overextended because black cannot afford to do anything other than get the bishop and the queen out of the bank rank. Black has to castle queen side because a decent pawn push king side will tear his line apart and expose the king.
White is wasting time. Bg4 is no attack, it's just the best place to put the bishop.
Another bad move. Attacking the pawn gives black an excuse to move the knight. The advance of that knight is going to be decisive.
White now has to react to black, the initiative has passed from black to white. Ne2 is fatal.
White decides to keep fighting. I move to eliminate the isolated pawn.
White does not want to surrender the pawn. But the bishop is now stuck. He can't move to check the black king and if he moves anywhere else the result is checkmate.
As Black I prefer the Petrov defense (mostly because I dislike playing in Ruy Lopez), and there are several variations: Nxe5 - French attack, Nc3 - Three Knight game, and d4 - modern attack
This move (Petrov's defense) shores up the e4 pawn, and opens an egress route for the DSB.
going in early for the pawn grab... In this circumstance I prefer exd5 more as White, because Black must retake with the queen, allowing White Nc3 with tempo.  Other options worthy of consideration are Bg5 and Nbd2.  I don't like this play as much because it opens up White to an unfavorable queen trade to retain pawn parity.
I played this move to see how White would respond.  I looked at dxe4 instead, but liked the tactical challenges this posed for White more.  This move gives White more challenges and I think allows Black a good chance at a free pawn or forcing a queen trade with White giving up the castle.  I anticipated d4, Nc3, or maybe even f4 in response.
Unforced errors make it harder to win games.  This move coughs up the knight at e5 for free.  I think d4 is the top play.
No reason not to bring the queen out instead of taking with the bishop.  Whenever you have the chance to retake and develop a piece at the same time, you should almost always take it, provided there aren't any defensive considerations.
To protect against Bxb2, winning a pawn and a rook.
A wise counterplay, preventing my bishop from getting a dangerous post middle of the board.
Giving support to the d pawn and giving a space for the knight to come out to c6.
Good, going for king safety and hoping to connect the rooks.
This move is the beginning of an assault of White's Kingside.  My bishops, queen, and rook will soon come into play.
To prevent Bxh2.
Another move I considered was Bh3, to prevent a castle, but saw that Bg4 would be a strong counterplay.  This move attacks his center pawns and lets my rook get into the game.  White's position is beginning to look precarious.
I was expecting Bf3, f4, or Nb2.  This move gives up a bit of the defensive structure of White's pawns, and will allow for some nice attacks by Black.  Losing that knight early was costly.  I think Nb2 was the better play.
Now Black has a lot of firepower trained on the kingside's pawns.
This move was a little unexpected, because while fxe4 and dxe4 each have their problems, it still allows White to castle and link up rooks.  This move now offers exchange options for Black to blow open some holes in White's position and still keep a lot of pawns downrange for later advancement and positional restriction against White.
Willing to exchange a bishop to rip apart White's defenses.
since Rf2?? leads to mate.
I looked at a lot of different options, but liked this one best, since it placed a pin on White's bishop.  I fully anticipated Rxf2 in response.
Na3 would have been better if you don't want to trade rooks here.
Forcing the rook trade
Trading a queen and bishop for a rook...
Notice if White instead moves the king instead of retaking with the queen, it would lead to forced mate.
Unforced early errors caused some complications.  It is very important to get your king to safety early with a castle, and link your rooks.  Some lost opportunities for development and faster castling would have significantly changed the Black assault on the king.  Allowing Black to build a second assault on the king proved White's ultimate downfall.  Thanks for reviewing and your comments.
In this game, I play black and open with a combination of moves that my Dad calls a "Bobby Fisher" opening (which is also called "Reti" when it is played for white, and can be the Old Indian in some variants).  It makes for a closed game.  I'm still experimenting with this opening for black and learning things as I go, and I'd truly enjoy your comments on the strengths and weaknesses of this opening for black.
Completed the fist 8 moves of this opening.  At this point, there are options to attack the middle or either side, particularly the queenside.
... then moved to e5.  At this point, I would have expected f5 or fxe5 ...
The chess gods were smiling on me ... I saw the potential for a stacked Queen and rook along the diagonal ...
... but changed my mind and advanced the f pawn with the support of the rook.
I was not accepting challenges but I had made a challenge against djburns of the English Team and he declined.  When I had made a challenge my German national Zugspitze appeared challenging me with me opening as white.  I tried to gracefully decline but the machine in Gameknot would not allow me to decline.  I figured it was a sort of computer thing and then I though oh well why not play another game when I had told GK I was through playing games with online chess players.  It was a moment I knew I was sealing my fate to play another game despite my limitations to GK saying no more online games but then GK allowed Zugspitze to come into my chess board and there was no way to get rid of him! <n><n>I usually open e4 so this is no surprise.
Now comes my surprise! Zugspitze (Black from here and after with me White here and after) uses the Caro Kann against ME! I use the Caro Kann most times selecting from two other defenses I trust: Alekhine's, and Sicilian (usually in Sicilian I opt for the Shev or the Dragon).  Imagine my immediate sparkle to Zugspitze (Black) to use my favorite defense against my e4 open!  I had to check this out! And play!
The first time I ever encountered the Caro was when I was playing against a blind seminarian (we were both seminarians having a hobby outside of Greek and Hebrew and Theology and Philosophy and Exegesis and Church History and Homiletics and Reformed Theology and Psychology and Sacred History and Secular History and all we had to do to get ordination.  We just got together and played chess and relaxed in Graduate School instead of going out to party.  We liked being unavailable to distractions sort of like monks in a monastery and we liked chess! This is the move I made in 1983 the first time I saw c6 to my open e4.  It was a reaction to take over the center of the board as fast as possible and it seemed the best move to make.  It turned out I had made the standard response to Caro Kann.
My blind friend in seminary did the same move which is standard for the Caro Kann.  At this point I can't recall what I did in 1983 with the Blind Seminarian but soon after I had played with him I studied the Caro Kann.  I liked Sicilian and Alekhine's. I had decided for my brains to give up the Ruy Lopez since my father beat it every time with the King's Gambit.  I learned the King's Gambit from him and my records here on GK show I use it ALL the time against the insignificant Ruy Lopez. I had also studied the French Defense enough to see it was mostly a blockade like in Les Miserables by Victor Hugo when his book was written about something entirely different from chess.  I had read Rommel's book on being a Platoon Leader in WWI against the French and the French like blockades and retreating instead of fighting.  The French Foreign Legion is a gathering of exceptional troops and these troops of the French Foreign Legion are not included. However, in chess the French Defense is as it was in WWI against Rommel defeated and running behind barricades.
This is called the closing action from white instead of the engaging act from white to trade pieces.  White can do other moves to engage in conflict but in this case white is dealing with the Caro Kahn and white has many published responses to d5.  I confess my response here is what I would have to think the most about if I was Caro Kann (Black).  What is happening is I am responding to Black in the fashion I know I would have to WORK HARD as Black to get this opening just right!
This is a deviation from what I would do if I am black using Caro. It is not what I would do.  I would have done e3 to make an Infantry formation blocking and opening the King Bishop.  <n><n>The problem when somebody does something unexpected is amateurs do unexpected things and win from sheer chance or luck or the stupefying effect it has upon a person thinking all is fine until something jumps out like a cougar to attack from nowhere.  I had to think a bit about this move and even if it is in the book written as a standard I still felt it was premature.  So.....
...can't choose the pawn over the knight to block because the pawn would block the development of the knight!
What can my queen do at this point? If I try to set her aside it leaves black to advance at my cost.  It is time to execute that early developed queen...
Expected. Now to trap the black night into a useless field of fire...
Whatever.  I think a better move is available instead of Knight to e7. I think I would rather it have been Bishop to e7 or 0-0-0 or a few other pawn movements to advance the infantry before taking two moves to get a knight out of the king side.  I am not a genius but maybe Zugspitze is about the Caro.  The Caro is always able to respond with clarity for the next moves.  I think some moves done by black are not in synch with Caro but I cannot really figure it out for now because I never used these moves in the sequences black is doing now.  It is going to be a learning lesson for me at this point.
I basically have to get my rooks doubled and 0-0 is the fast way to do it.  It also means I have to commit to the right side of the board with my King....
Where else is this knight from black able to go to develop to do any kind of good?
This bishop from black has to get out of the way at all cost from the rear where he sat until now...
F6 is the place I want to make a statement because I can and I will and I do it.
Here I see the opening up on the entire king side of both of us and I am thinking instead of pushing on this side why not make my bishop available to BOTH sides at once...so
I saw this when I decided to move my bishop to d2 and now I think the best move is what I do next....
I want my bishop available on Both sides! I can't use a pawn to constrain him behind a pawn line!
Black wants to move forward...
3 pawns on the line...I did not want to put h3 pawn on h4 in my last move. There is the obvious reason for this.  And now is the reason.
The king is a fighting piece and it is time for my king to get into action.  Many chess players ignore the power of the king in a battle field. I never ignore my king in a battle.  The king is a powerful piece even though he is the prize of the opposition.  I use the King's Gambit regularly against the slow Ruy Lopez and the Gambit opens up the King to attack. The King can take care of his battlefield in the event of the King's Gambit against the dull and slow Ruy Lopez.  I never use the Ruy Lopez.  Check my records and know why I never do.
I move my knight to the rear which is better than either h4 or d2.  H4 would stack pawns on the side and d2 would blocks my c3 bishop to d2.
A premature maneuver for passing a pawn all alone...I have double rooks and a knight able to take care of a passed pawn and I decide against most ideas about a "passed pawn" to monitor and fix and kill that stray pawn.
This is a way to re rook the rooks together and attack the stray pawn from black.  Blacks pawn has very little chance of promotion.  Black's pawn has all the faith to have his head taken off while I move forward.  It is an English thing to do in a gentlemanly fashion utilizing the French Guillotine.
I have to open up our king sides in order to advance and eventually chop off the black advancing pawn's head.  Do I use the English axe used on Sir Thomas Moore or do I just do a nasty guillotine from French history? It is up to Black to decide the fate of this lone pawn....
Reasonable clearing to execute the lone pawn by guillotine or hatchet used to execute Sir Thomas Moore in England some centuries ago....
Expected. I think at this point the rook on h8 is incredibly denied action except to advance the lone pawn into a beheading.
I have to protect my own pawn on g4 to allow me to execute the lone pawn.
My opponent is moving to my left side for action.  I had put my bishop there ahead of time anticipating both side action for my bishop.
I can also protect my king from attack (and rook in the pin) by using my bishop! See now why I wanted my bishop free for left and right?
Here is an opportunity to attack the knight and make him check my king into the center of the board.  I like it!
I advance a pawn to my opponent's knight and unless he wants to retreat he will check my king into a better position....
...and there it is!
My king is checked into a better position.  In puzzles we find a checked king moving forward eventually advances with his troops to fix and kill the opposition.  The king is a powerful piece not to be hidden away in a paradise surrounded by soldiers.  He is a fighter and he can do more damage than most chess players think...
This is a move to get the headless black pawn to promotion...in the meantime I can take out a pawn without missing a move and so I do.
Black has to be very aggressive.  With rooks and the knight and the lone pawn.  I don't see the picture black has painted for king side advance.  I am thinking I might be wrong but then I have to see if black can prove me wrong.  I aim to behead that lone pawn and advance at the same time on the left or right.
I have to go back to the right side to behead the lone pawn...
I have the material and position to behead the advancing pawn while black tries to advance him to promotion (Beheading).
Time for my bilateral bishop to keep watch on BOTH sides!
Black is maneuvering his e4 rook (slow to maneuver as rooks are) to a better position to operate with his other rook. I see this! In the Army field of artillery (rooks in chess) have to have time to operate in sync with the advancing opposition. I am THRILLED!
Black is trying to figure out a better position for his own FA (Field Artillery) and so far it seems to me he is doing the best with what he has.  Problem is I am doing the best as well.  In the fog of war things can change the outcome.
One little move here.  It is like the Caro Kann against e4 open. One simple pawn moving one square forward.  Remember the Caro Kann is an infantry formation and defense and attack.
Time to unleash my Field Artillery by disclosing my bishop...
? is this move...to me...why not bring back the bishop...
Black had to move his rook and where he'd move it was anticipated by me.  I respond to the best place in the center forward point with my side knight.
When you are minus one you have to be on your toes to make sure there are no more minuses.  In many attacks going minus one is best to gain position (King's Gambit) to defeat the opposition in timely manner. This move by black is just a time wasting move leading to who knows where....
I think the h pawn over the line is not a problem so I fix his movement in the board. Black loses the knight if that pawn is advanced on the h side and there is nothing threatening me to make a better move.
Of course g7 is a square I'd like to deploy my rook from the rear and black is double protecting that square!
Black's maneuver to double protect the g7 square also involves an attack upon my bishop.  I could have moved f2 but my king is the only one protecting c3.  I do with my bishop what a bishop always does for the king.  Be his messenger and be ready to support him.  The king wants to protect the c3 pawn for the obvious reason and the bishop, without asking why, comes to the king to do what he is skilled to do along diagonal lines.
Whenever you see a line formation in the field of battle positioned forward and laterally against you you really have to start worrying about a Pickett's Charge in Gettysburg. Pickett was a Confederate General (Major General) who made an assault with a column three quarters of a mile wide against the Union troops of General (Major General) Meade in Cemetery Ridge in 1863. I don't have my infantry to attack at this point.  Neither does black so it is going to be a lock up in INFANTRY while the remaining PIECES take over.
I move my FIELD ARTILLERY forward where FIELD ARTILLERY (LIGHT) is FORWARD instead of acting like Field Artillery (HEAVY) that just stays in the rear to send shells bigger than 105 Howitzers.  Heavy FA can't move on a chess board.  Rooks are ALWAYS LIGHT FIELD ARTILLERY.  Chess was invented and played WITHOUT HEAVY FIELD ARTILLERY!
Black knows by this time if not before the king is a fighting piece.  I've always said this in my annotated games.
Good black move forcing me to get my king out...
Oh well.  I am going to be cordoned off into a more limited arena to operate.  Keep in mind my opponent used the Caro Kann against me and the Caro Kann should be the most feared against e4 open.  Not Sicilian necessarily.  Those who use Caro Kann go a lot further than Sicilian. Forget the weak Ruy Lopez.  I respected my opponent after his first move against my e4.  He responded c6! Caro Kann!
I have to retreat FA to a better position....
...and the cordon continues to trap me into smaller space....
I am not feeling good about this trade.  I have to trade now because I am minus a piece I wanted in the event it was passed up for a trade.
I can't use my bishop here.  I have to go to a place where he is still useful...
..where there are open spaces along diagonals to work.
I have hope that the rook and bishop can handle that side pawn trying to get to the promotion front....
Rooks can block and attack a lone pawn especially on the side when a bishop is working to help.
I am going to move my bishop to clear the way to check the king.
I can't take the rook with my bishop.  Then the pawn gets promoted.  I have to do something else.  Move my rook to block the advancing side pawn to promotion while keeping the rook under attack behind it....
Best way to do it while pinning the knight in front of the king...
Closing in my bishop....
Now I get to behead the pawn as I said I would awhile ago!
Like so! I predict black does rook to g2.  I have already put in the GK machine my auto response for this.....<n>Always anticipate the next most dangerous move.....
It was the most dangerous move and I had to do it.  I had no choice and now my hope is to deal with the loss of a piece while drawing the board if I can....
I looked into what I'd do at this point if I was black and realized white lost to the Caro Kann.
I knew it was over but then made another move because I wasn't ready to resign.  I did it because once in a great while a game is won by a mistake by the opponent.
Unless black is absolutely non compis mentis he'd lose.  I realized I have to respect my opponent.  I resigned.  <n>Long live the Caro Kann my favorite Black Defense against e4 open! I applaud Zugspitze for using it against me.  He is way ahead of the players who resort to Ruy Lopez and French Defense.  I'd like to have him on MY team!  <n>John
greed before the fall... best was Qd3, Bb6+, Kh1, Rd8, Qf3, Rxd1+, and pray... Qxb7 is met with Qe3+, Kh1, Qxb3...
black has managed, to bring the white King out in the open...
black does not take the bait... the bishop has to retreat, to prevent Qc2 mate...
The Petroff Defence. If beginner(s) are playing this can lead to discovered checks, queen losses and broken hearts...
Aiming at 4.Nf3 Nxe4 and then ...Nc3disc.  winning the queen!
I can see a kingside attack coming on...
Handing me the pawn on a silver platter. An added bonus!
This was interesting.  It stops Bxc6 for the moment as I'd be reluctant to trade Bishop for Knight without taking any pressure off of the center.
Nc3 was also an option but I wanted to keep c3 on the table.
With a Knight on e7, Bxc6 is still not attractive so White's Bishop will need an escape route.  Also, as an added bonus, c3 keeps Black's Knight off of b4/d4.<n><n>White's Q-side Knight and Bishop are a bit hemmed in but after d4 they should be able to effectively develop.
Now the b1-Knight and c1-Bishop can deploy.
The Knight is no longer pinned and looks to be a key player in any upcoming central fur-ball.  Black could always take with Nxc6 (and still have a Knight in position) but that would leave d5 under-guarded.  Black's doubled pawns on the c-file will not be much of a negative.
The d-pawn is sure to drop.  I'll probably have to play Re1 to give the e-pawn some long-term protection.
At least the e-pawn is taken care of for the moment and the Queen can get off of the a1-h8 diagonal.  The c1-Bishop has to come off of the back rank and end up somewhere constructive pretty soon ... Bg5 would have been nice but that's off the table.<n><n>(bigpeta suggested Rd1.  There were other options as well)
I need to get Bishop out but on f4 can't Black push it back to e3 by playing g5? I suppose I could retreat to g3 or h2 instead. Bf4 still seemed logical.<n>However, Black is aiming for Nc6 which I think is a very dangerous move for White. White would have to thread a very thin needle to stay in the game at all (Qxd5 may work). Even then, a Knight on c6 is only two moves away from c2 attacking the Rooks. Obviously White's a1-Rook needs to get into play (I'm thinking c1 or d1), but that brings us back to the Bishop.<n>I considered Be3 ... but that begs the question 'Why did you move the Rook to e1 in the first place if you're going to block it with a Bishop?'<n>I ended up with Bf4.
Black will probably play Nf5 next. This attacks my Queen (immediate issue) but also opens the d8-h4 diagonal ... giving Black's Queen a route into White's K-side. Would this discourage Black from playing g5 (and blocking the diagonal)? Hummm ... don't know.<n>Anyway, the Queen could fall back to d1, 2 or 3 and still have a playable position. The e-5-pawn is not in wonderful shape but doesn't need the Queen for protection at the moment.<n>So ... I don't think I need to move the Queen right at this moment. There may be something more useful on this move.<n><n>Na4 looks interesting. From there it could drop into b6 (as long as White's Queen stayed on d4 (which ain't going to happen as Black will play Nf5 anyway), or c5 blocking the c6-pawn. c5 might be a nice little outpost ... especially with a3 and b4 as protection. Just thinking out loud here.
An excellent example of a ‘complicating move’ ... and a move that I normally don’t handle well at all.  Now I'm faced with a position that only a couple of moves ago concentrated on the K-side (with a bit going on in the center) that now stretches from K-side, through the center to the very extent of the Q-side.  With 16. Na4 and 17. ... Qa5 we’re now playing laterally across the whole board.<n>Not only do I have to deal with a vastly expanded playing field, I have to figure out how much a threat (and what kind of threat) Qa5 actually is!  It’s subtle ... and insidious.  It does not ‘force’ me to take any action at all ... the Knight is protected by White’s Queen.  But I now must think past the current state of play and down the road of ‘what happens to the Queen if things start to break loose on the K-side or the center?’ ... ‘what then?’<n>I'm feeling the level of play start to crank up.
Continuing to protect the Knight.  I think now I can get both the Rook and Knight into play.
Had to move one of them.  Here I at least attack a rook.
My first thought is Re3.  Maneuvering my Rooks behind my advanced pawns will be very difficult with Black's light-squared Bishop still on the board ... as will freeing my King should the need arise.  If I can get my Rook to d2 or d4 then the forward d-pawn will be a bit more secure.  Whatever the case, Black is getting ready to play Rd8, but the d-pawn is (for a move or two) covered by White’s Bishop ... but then the pawn can’t move forward without a Rook backing it up.<n>However, with the Knight coming into play I have to make sure I get the Rooks and King are on different colored squares ... hummm, three pieces and two colors ... that really is going to be a trick!<n>The second choice is Be5 ... but there an eventual f6 (backed up by something of course) forces it away, maybe back to where it is now.  So that’s sort of a bust.  Although the Bishop really lacks any scope where it is, it seems to be doing its limited job fairly well.<n>And that brings us to a4.  Not a great move ... but it does protect the b-pawn.  And, now that I think about it ... Black is going to drop the Knight onto d4, threatening Nxb5 or Nc2 forking the Rooks.  So, to keep from dropping the pawn White has to cover it this move.  I think a4 does that.  Black obviously has a lot of optional responses ... but at least it works for one move.<n><n>In retrospect, I failed to realize how powerfully Black's Bishop was positioned.  Re3 was again the best move.
And the instructor graciously offered the student a draw.
the strongest attack
I think I now prefer to play black with Najdorf...
2 pawns and an attack for the bishop... it is a good idea, of course...
not quite sure this is the best move i made. But i considered the 2 others -Kf8 and Kd8- and i did not like them.
now the "épreuve de force" starts: white still has the attack, but black can try to reduce it.
accepting the reducing.
come to meeeeeeee (of course to avoid the fork)
black still thinks about escaping the attack and grouping its force on the white king at the same time: seen how the three pieces are pointing undirectly on it?
this means: black, you have to lose e6...
but i decided not to lose e6!
still looking for an attack to produce... But black has more margins now. The last possible threat could come from the 2 pawns on f and h columns...
and now... attack
threatens to attack the pinned B
and in disgust I resigned.  I'd spent ages obsessing about g3 and missed the danger to f2.  If 12. Kxf2 Qxe3#  12. Ne5 is probably best but leaves White's position looking ruined after 12... Bxe5 13. dxe5 Qxe5 with both Be3 and Rh1 still threatened, the Be3 pinned and mate threatened if I allow the Be3 to be captured.
I decide to gambit the pawn to take a lead in development
He develops his c knight and now I can take back the pawn safely.
There are ups and downs to this move I think.  Im developing my dsb but my lsb is blocked.
Take back with the knight to develop this piece.
He must really be worried about the pawn at f4
I put a little pressure on it
I take back with the knight because I want to save my bishop for the endgame.
To trade or not to trade?  I decide to trade because my endgame looks better than his.
Im planning to double my rooks on the d-file to win his d3 pawn
if dxc4 then RxR+
White wants to skewer my pawn on a5 and rook on d8
Now im trying to win the bishop with 30...f4 31.gxf4 Bf4
I decide not to trade down yet and move my bishop to cover the advancing white pawn on d4
Further eroding his kingside as he moves towards the center of the board.
This was a blunder on my part as the attack  proves futile.
Trying to develop my kingside pawn situation
Pinning his pawn to his king so he cannot make this manoveur.
He breaks the pin and now my cpawn is doomed.
He chooses to castle
Time to reinforce + launch an attack K-side
Returns to defending position to protect e pawn
His dark square bishop can't really do anything useful now and I conveniently get out of a pawn exchange
Trying to attack the lone h pawn
Defending the lone h pawn
He is preparing to add the dsb to the greenzone

The best move as ...Rh6? would lead to g5 and then he would get my Knight and get into my kings territory . Not going to happen!
The king must step aside from his lady!
37...Be3!! At this point he resigns as he will lose his rook and I will have the advantage to compose a quick win. Hope you enjoyed the annotation! :D
?!  Nf6 blocks the important c-pawn and attacks a pawn that is adequately defended. 3...Nf6 develops a piece and looks good.  3...b5 looks to keep the pawn, but gives white a lead in development and hurts black's pawn structure.  Finally, 3...e6 is a more classical move that looks to give back the pawn and set up a solid position while white uses precious tempi to take the pawn.
This is the main line.  Black, correctly, makes no show of wanting to keep the pawn, so white takes his time.  This develops the knight to the right square and attacks the center.  4. e4 is a good alternative.
This is the right move.  Black obeys the saying "Knights before Bishops".  Black takes the center and has not fallen behind in development.
Finally, white decides it's time to get his pawn back.  White has the "ideal" center, but black has a solid position and will do well to attack white after preparing.
This is a good move.  5...g7!? is an alternative, where after 6. d5, black can try to keep the pawn by 6...Na5 or play 6...Nb4?!, were white can't play 7. a3? because of 7...Nd3! giving the pawn back very favorably.  After 7. Bxc4, the black knight looks offside at b4 and it is unclear how black will respond to the threat of 8. a3, pushing the knight to the rim.
I think this is also book.  A viable alternative is 7. O-O.  This move is not a bad early queen move because black cannot exploit it's position (at least not immediately) and it is a centralization.    Note that the b4-square is covered by black's bishop, so the knight can't jump in, which is the way black usually tries to exploit white's queen position.
This move is fine.  The king is safer kingside than queenside because of the half-open c-file.  Black cannot stay in the center for too long since white may consider opening lines to black's king by d5.
Black could have waited for white to try a3, but if the white knight moves away (Ne2, for example), the black bishop looks silly.
Obviously strengthening white's center, and taking the b4-square from the knight.
?! I thought long and hard about which move to play.  I know all the books (and GMs) would punish black's last move by developing or, at least, relinquishing the bishop, which has moved once, for black's knight, which has moved 3 times.  I still don't know what the best move would be, but the principles discourage this bishop maneuver, so I hope commentors can help me out.  In any event, here's what I see: I keep black's knight on the rim; I keep the two bishops slight edge; but, currently, the only thing my bishop is doing is stopping Nc6; even worse, it will take me two moves to get back into the action.
?  With this move and black's next, white gains a significant edge.  This plan helps white, and doesn't solve black's problems.  10...b6, planning Nb7 to get back into the game, and Bb7, which is a move I advocated as early as move 5.  However, best seems to be 10...Bd7, exchanging white's bishop off and giving the c6 square back to the knight.  Black even threatens c5 at some point, because dxc5 destroys white's center and gives him two awful doubled, isolated pawns.
The obvious (and good) square for the bishop.  White threatens a tactic that emerged in the game and exerts good kingside pressure besides.
The only try was 12...g6, but that looks bleak after 13. Bg5, where white has excellently placed pieces, space, a safe king, and pressure on the black king; or, put simply, a big positional plus.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Two years ago, when my rating was in the 1500s I dreamed of getting at the very least an Expert Draw and possibly a win against an Expert.  Ion was the first Expert I played against and boy how green I was!  My very first game against him was Battle of the Wings in which we fought a close rook and pawn ending with Ion's kingside pawn majority closer to promotion than my queenside majority.  I therefore lost that game.  Since then it has been heartache, heartache and more heartache with me making some very silly mistakes in my games against him and there were a couple of games I could have drawn but I blew it big time.  Soon Ion was leading me by a mighty 13 points to ZILCH!  I repeat ZILCH!  Well, it is Zilch no longer and not even Ion can take that half point away from me.  This is happiness!  This game was a brevity (terminated in less than 20 moves but it was a forced draw by perpetual check).  Anyhow, I will start further commentary on move 7 when I played Nc3 in response to Ion's Rf8.
7. Nc3 - a developing move - in fact the Master Mater (Easy19) played this against me in the game At Each Other's Throats which I went on to lose.
9. ..... Nxd5 - and I also captured on d5 against Freddy.  Note that in the Gameknot db Ke8 is suggested here.  Hmm, if Ion had played that I had Nxh7 then if Nxh7 then Qh5+ pocketing the knight next move.  A similar thing happened to me in my game against Nuntar, viz:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=12791594&fb=1&rnd=0.08891115575838959 so I thought that would be a good way to learn my lesson - lump it on the Coach.  But he crosses my plan with Nxd5.
10. ...... c6 - I think Freddy recommended this move to me after he recaptured on d5 with his light squared bishop.  I can see why he thought I might have a good game.  I decide on Nxh7 after all because I can see Ion's King and the Wicked Witch of the West lined up nicely on that h5-d8 diagonal for a possible skewer.
13. c3 - an attempt to drive the knight off so I can put Glenda on f3 with check but Ion has something up his sleeve.
14. Qxg4 - I think f3 fails to Qh5+.  I can see that Ion has a fork on c2 but at least Glenda moves on to an aggressive square.  Glenda is gadding about just that little bit more on that broomstick - watch out!
15. Kd1 - this was put in as a conditional move.  Henry makes room for me to get my KR into play and if Ion should swipe the rook on a1 with the knight then that horsie could get itself trapped.
16. Bg5 - develops with a threat to the Wicked Witch.  Now where is that witch going?  I expected Qc7 preparing a block against Glenda's check on f5.
16. ...... Qa5 - This move attacks the pawn on a2 and will defend that wretched horsie on a1.  However I now condemn Ion to a Low Draw by Perpetual Check as follows:- Variation A 17. Qf5+ Ke8 18. Qe6+ Kf8 19. Qf5+ Kg8 20. Qe6+ Kh7 21. Qf5+ Kh8 22. Qh3+ Kg8 23. Qe6+ If he tries to duck it here is:- Variation B 17. Qf5+ Kg8 18. Qe6+ Kh7 19. Qf5+ g6 20. Qf7+ Kh8 21. Bf6#.  Commiserations and bad luck Ion.  Do you the Inquest Jury suggest a better alternative to Qa5 - I suggested Qc7 - do you the Jury agree?  I now play Ion as black and I think I will need to play out of my skin to avoid a backlash!  Anyhow, time for some sweet dreams.  Bye for now - Joanne
Here, Nakamura kicks off the opening with the aggressive King's Gambit. I am not really surprised by this move, considering the fact that Nakamura is an aggresive player. What White hopes to do is to gain the initiative in exchange for a pawn's loss.
Andreiken plays the most popular move by taking the pawn on f4, and now we get into the fierce King's Gambit Accepted.
Andreiken starts to protect the f4 pawn.
More protection to the f4 pawn.
Nakamura threatens Nxc7, forking the king and the rook.
The f4 pawn falls.
Andreiken forks the knight and rook, replying to Nakamura's aggression.
Andreiken wants the Dames off the board. If White accepts the trade by taking the queen, the knight will retake, threatening to control key squares around the king.
Nakamura accepts the trade and starts to dominate the kingside of Black's.
Nakamura bounces his knight around the kingside, eventually threatening Nxf7, which forks the king and rook.
Andreiken managed to get Nakamura's pesky pieces off his camp. Note that Andreiken does not want to take the rook on f1 as Nakamura would just retake with the other rook and gains control of the f-file.
Nakamura does not take on e8, because doing that allows Andreiksen to control the e-file.
The crushing attack! Now Andreiksen's king's safety is in jeopardy.
Now Nakamura is able to isolate te king from his other pieces, and he has those monstrous passed pawns on g4 and h3, ready to promote. It is pretty much a no brainer to know that Nakamura has the advantage in this position.
It's one way to go.
Nakamura forks Andreksen's king and bishop, and Andreiksen resigned! This position is hopelessly lost for Andreiksen. The line will go like 44...Rd3 45.Rxd3 Kxd3 46.Ne5+ and Nakamura wins more of Black's material. Then he can safely promote those passes pawns and win the game. A glorious game for Nakamura!<n>Over here, I would like to thank a few people like thereaper1 and vincerino for providing useful comments in my annotations. A special thanks and hope you like this annotation!
5. d4 - this is meant to open up Fou Lenoir's diagonal and force a retreat of his e5 horsie and really cramp his style!
7........ d5!! - this move is the refutation of this gambit.  Give back a pawn for the piece and blunt my attack.
10. ..... fxe6 - I orchestrated this bishop trade in order to leave Freddy with an isolani and endeavour to get 3 pawns for the missing piece.
15. Qe4 - Glenda must flee on her Nimbus 2000 to avoid the black horsie.  She flies to e4 to defend Fou Lenoir and the pawn on e5 (that poor gal, she always somehow finds herself defending something!)
15. ...... Nf5 - and here comes another of Freddy's horsies, the're everywhere!  I now castle long to add protection to Fou Lenoir and to perhaps discover an attack on that evil Witch!
29. Rg1 - .... but it does not get off the ground.  After playing this move I now see that if Nxe5, Rf7 then Freddy can play Rd7 stopping my rook from taking any pawns on his second rank.  After seeing nothing left in the tank I decide to give the game to Freddy.  At least this proves the unsoundness of the Halloween Gambit.
and I'm up and off to see the king, the wonderful king of Oz
Van't Krujis opening.  A little unusual, but I used to open this way frequently in my youth.
Looking at this attack, I thought that it would be enough to just block the bishop with my pawn. Looking back now, I missed that I could have attacked his queen either offering to trade queen and bishop for queen and knight. Computer analysis confirms that would have been the best move.
Two ways to tackle this check, 12. ... Nxf6 or 12. ... Bxf6. I chose Nxf6 which not only recaptured, but took all the tension out of the middle of the board. This would prove to be a bad idea as the N on c3 proved to be a very good attacker on d5 later in the game. Had I gone forward with Bxf6 the exchange of knights on d5 might have given me a better position later.
Another chance to remove some of the minor attackers off of the board which would come to haunt me later. Instead, I focused on the major pieces and allowed white's Q to infiltrate and cause my position to degrade wildly.
Looking at this position, I thought I could force the exchange on b7 by threatening the B on d5 with a rook. Turns out I didn't need to do this and I should have shielded my rook so I could remove the queen from the tight grip she had on my position and gain a little breathing room.
Here is the N on d5 I mentioned earlier in the game. I couldn't get him off of this square even if I was so inclined. I made a comment during the game about how I should have thought about going ahead and removing the knight sometime during the next few moves. Here, I should have cleared out the bishop so I had a better chance of defending the rook and a little more room to maneuver.
Save yourself! I need every piece I can hold onto, because . . . because . . . The computer analysis didn't call this a mistake, but clearly I should have done something more. I'm not sure what would have been better though.
Computer analysis calls this move by white a "Blunder". It allows for the exchange of queens on c5 if I had played it correctly, but to do so would have required me to sacrifice my bishop on g5, my rook right where it is and offer my queen twice, the second time with check so that he had to take it. It would have extended the game and maybe I could have called it a moral victory.
Instead I tried to disrupt his mate by taking it down from Mate in 5 to Mate in 3.
I just tried to develop the center of the board here
right here I was aiming to trap his Nf6 by advancing my pawn e5
Here I was looking for a sacrifice of either my knight or bishop just attacking the f7 pawn and taking it with the queen later on to check him
once he attacked the rook I saw potential mate 4-6 moves ahead. I knew it looked to good for him not to pass it up so I moved Ng5 hoping that he would take my rook. If he didnt and took my g5 Knight I knew I'd be at -1 in the same spot as I was before
All perfectly natural progressions up until this point. The Fianchettoing of the bishop caught me slightly off guard. Not too much though, I'd seen it before.
My first agressive move, normally uncharacteristic for me. However I decided to attack early and threaten Nd6 .
?! I felt the knight was in more of a fighting position here. Probably also subconscious from queen pins in the past.
...And the long fight for the queenside has begun...
?! Perhaps blundered here, I was willing to give up development for the pawn being fairly sure I could obtain the en prise c4 pawn. Ended up spending the majority of the rest of the game trying to get this back.

Now I start to break black's pawn structure to attack the king

Questions or comments are welcome.
!? I don't even know if this line exists. The idea is to avoid any N jump to the 5th rank, and to challenge the cental squares asap.
f5 is tempting, but I "smell" some danger associated with the WQ's coming in, so better to be conservative...
!? This allows him to exchange pieces and to deprive me of my bishop pair. I swore I could handle the outcoming position and get equality. Can you tell from now the outcome?
I have to take it...
I am higly developed, and even if suboptimal, my position seems to hold... with some care in further developement.
Hmmm... this I should have prevented. I don't want to move my pawns and I dont' want to castle "under opponent's fire", but I have to defend...
...but I decided I had to. The advantages deriving from the open d and (potentially) e columns had to grabbed.
?Saccing a pawn for a more open game.. even unlocking Bb2xNf6's trheat... now parrished by my Q. After Nxe4, NxN, QxN, Rf-e8, black has such a central dominance that must compensate for the pawn. If BxNf6 first, QxB threats f2 (maybe Qa1+)
? The good thing about a complex sac like this is the opponent wants to become creative, and in this case, this just helps me. I'l get rid of my sacced pawn for an exchange, when his R's are far from the f column for a couple of moves. What do you think, dear reader? :-)
Planning to play on the g column, but opening the way for my Q to g3. Should I take it? What do you think?
?? Much better was f4, winning a tempo from my Q, leaving it out from g3, etc. etc. This seals white's fate...
I can take the pawn and balance the game. I can play Nh7, theatening Qxd3 once the N is gone... But I opted for another line of attack.
Threatening Nf3+. I have to grab the advantage derived from the W's dsb exchange. I thought this was the proper way to do it. I was wrong!!!
Supporting Nc3+ again. I just need a tempo to place my Q on the second rank, and mythreats will be terrible!
This is a critical moment. Did I stepped into it by chance? Not at all. I had my "parachute" and an "additional one" read to save me from falling to the earth. Let's see if I was right or wrong.
This is NOT a free R, as you will see, but to cash it in, white has to leave me a move to open my other parachute...
Now is very funny the way I have to try to cahs the WB for a pawn. I'll have to work a little. Will I get it at last? Can you say it from here?
Covering e6. Now, apparently, f6 can be played, and the B won. Is it true? Can White save his B?
... and the answer is NO, but white has another trick in his sleeve by playing Ne4, since if KxB inmediately, Nxf6+, winning. Of course, black just had to waste two more moves, with Rh8, RxB. But it was white's last chance of countergame (N agains the black's a, b and c pawns).
? I think better was to try to penetrate with the K. What do you think?
Say that the K is a better guardian of e5. My R can penetrate into g, and I just have to make sure to be quicked than him grabbing pawns.
Where to go, dear reader?
? The last mistake. From there, his N has no countergame. From e3, yes (Ne5). My opponent resigned here, sensibly.. a nice blitz higher rated op win. Thanks for reading.
A miscue. Better is Bb5 or Bc4, Spanish or Italian. The text move strives to limit black bishop counterplay, which it does at the price of giving black the initiative.
Not a bold move, but it does open a bishop line without commiting to pawn and piece exchanges.
The text move offers the advantage of a flawed pawn structure for black, but it yields the bishop pair in the process, and no other gains are apparent due to the captured steed not being particularly dangerous.
White is still uncastled and reaching an uncomfortable position due to the lack of support for the king. It is not an immediate problem, but the cookie will begin to crumble.
Playing like Lasker who would play on both flanks. The text move seeks to break up the pawns in the centre if ignored by white, or develop a bishop if white exchanges.
The bishop sits on a centralized position, but it could be pushed back by  the move g4 - which would cost white by opening up more space around the king. The bishop is bad for the moment due to the pawn structure.
The text move may not be the best. 13...Bh4  looks better due to 14. Nxh4 Qxh4  and white is out castling rights with a slight advantage for black. There is a slow controlling positional aspect to the text move that prevents the e pawn from moving at the moment.
Makes sense to exchange a knight for the dangerous bishop.
A blunder, perhaps the losing move of the game. Better was 0-0-0 while there was time. This move fails due to the checking move available by black.
A forcing move which allows the bishop to escape.
Creating the threat at h1 while making a line available to a8 after a pawn move. This is to give black the time to make a nice sacrifice next move.
An interesting mate pattern of QPP with unsupported queen. A fun game providing chances to try some strategies.
3. ... g6 is inconsistent with 1. ... e6, not necessarily because it weakens the dark squares, but because the bishop is just as happy at e7 or d6 and the move played is inviting white to play h2-h4-h5 in due course.
5. d4 and 5. c4 are equally playable, although Black can then play ... d5 and ... c6, with a Stonewall plan
Too slow.  Black's counterplay in the King's Indian Attack needs to come from swift queen side advances, or exchanges in the centre.  6. ... c5 or d5 was better.
There's no rush to play 8. e5 because if Black plays 8. ... de, then 9. de emphasises that Black's pawns are on the wrong squares.
Now the pawn can be pushed.  If 9. ... Ne8, White continues with Nf1, h4 etc as per the game but doesn't need to play d4.
Now we have a bizarre French Advance version where both sides decided to fianchetto.  White has more space and a solid position.  Black's knight on g4 is exposed and there is no obvious counterplay.
A typical development in the KIA, freeing up the c1-h6 diagonal and planning h4, Nh2-g4 aiming at f6 and h6
15. Be7 follows the game plan, but h4 is more useful than a5.  In some lines the pawn merely supports the Bg5, but in others h5, hxg6 causes Black problems.  Black has castled into an attack which he probably didn't see coming.
Switching diagonals and coming to d6 with tempo.
At least 16. ... Re8 gives some support to e6.  Black's position is already going horribly wrong.
17. ... Qb6 looks stronger.  Black will have to exchange on d4 if he is to hold e6 though.
The bishop returns to the proper diagonal, but Black is already lost.  White keeps attacking e6 and it soon falls.
Again, there is no hurry to play Nxf8.  Now everything falls.
Never one to hoard material, Marshall elects to sacrifice his Queen in return for a strong attacking position against Swiderski's exposed King.
Swiderski hastens to bring his forces over to defend. Now once the QN moves, the QR can defend the 1st rank.
Not only adding another piece to the attack against the King, but also forcing the Queen away from the defense.
Removing a piece from the attack.
...and Swiderski accepts.
Swiderski systematically drives Marshall's King away from the theater of action.
just a quick game here, but interesting nonetheless. In this game, an early sacrifice from White leads to an immediate advantage, but Black fights back. White needs to complete the attack - but how can he do that?
! Both paths lead to imminent danger from Black!
While this move loses the rook for Black, the alternative isn't really that much better positionally; 4...Ke7 5.Qxe5+ Kf7 6.Bf4+ d5 [to stop Qf5+ after the King moves to g6] 7.Bxd5+ Kg6 8.d4 and White already has a formidable attack
here, Black now has the ability to counter-attack...
...as shown. Though Black has to deal with a dangerous queen, his own queen provides the making of a counter-attack
?! perhaps a developing move would have been better here, such as 9...d5 (striking a claim to the centre and opening up a path for the bishop) or 9...Nc6
I guess I could have driven the Queen away with Bd1, but like I've said I'm not worried about the Queen at this point - I look to exploit Black's weakened kingside
step #1 - cut off the Black queen. If Black could see what I was planning, he'd play c6.
nope, Black doesn't see it, and now White delivers the killer blow...
! one way or another, the knight defender will have to go, and as far as I can see there is no way to save the g-pawn - alt. variation [should Black see the importance of the g-pawn] 13...Ne5 14.Nxe7 Bxe7 15.Rxg6 Nxg6 16.Qxg6+ Kd8 17.Qg8+ Bf8 18.Bg7+ Kd7 19.Bg4# ((tell me if I made a mistake on this, it's the longest analysis I've ever done))
my knight has been taken, but it was taboo, due to...
one move before, Black may have had a chance that I overlooked, but now Black is doomed! There is no way to stop mate
Ke7 and Kd8 both fall to 15.Bg5+ Kd7 16.Bg4#
!?!? This move releases the tension in the centre a little too early. However, Black does want to play aggressively and develop his pieces quickly too. The normal verdict of this move would probably be unclear.
! A brave move. Ivanchuk must have been really confident that he could resist Black's attack, develop his own pieces, AND gain a little material ?!?
?! It seems logical to stake out this plan if Black played 5...Nf6, but the calm and normal-looking 6...Nxd5! is the best move, after which the chances are equal.
O.K, Black MUST be winning. Ivanchuk STILL hasn't even developed ONE piece, and his king is stuck in the centre to a big attack. However, Ivanchuk has a material advantage. The only question is whether he can keep it or not...
? On principle, this decision looks quite odd. It isn't so much the material issue of two pieces and rook for the queen (and chaos on the board still), but the fact that black will trade off two developed pieces for the queen, with no immediate way to aggressively sustain the initiative. -CB.
White must try to defend himself against the attack and if he succeeds he should win. For Black, he must try to weave a mating net or attack and get some material, which should be sufficient to win the game.
In terms of piece play alone, it is hard to see how black can increase pressure. He opts to reroute the bishop to a6, but perhaps it won't really change all that much. Possibly black had to try and figure a way to soften the kingside up with the pawns and pieces, while keeping White tied up in the center. Whether or not that is even possible is hard to judge of course, but as it stands, Black's initiative is slowly disappearing.-CB
!!!!!! A lovely finish. Black cannot take with the rook because White can take the queen with the knight. If Black checks, then after34...Ng2+ 35.Rxg2 Rxa8 36.Nxc1 hxg2 37.Kf2 Ra1 38.Ndb3 Ra8 39.Kxg2 Rd8 40. Nd3 Rc8 41.Nbc5 Kf8 42.Ne4 Rc7 43.Bb4+ Kg8 44.Be2 Rc8 45.Kg3 f6 46.Bc5 White has a decisive advantage. A dazzling game by Ivanchuk. Hoped you enjoyed this.
Normally I like to play g6 here follow by Bg7 but I was try something new.
Take away Bishop queenside and Qb6.
Try to find a way to break this pawn structure.
Probably the move which lead to my draw result. Though there are not many other options I can to try.
Attack the castle and diagnol
Seeing the path to endgame.
I respond d7-d5 because I don't like to give up the center position
bishop to pin my knight on f6
I decided to take because I don't want to waste tempo
interesting....instead of moving bishop to h4 Dmitry decides to take my knight.
pawn to c4 seems like Dmitry wants to get his bishop to attack mode.
bishop to e6, forcing Dmitry's queen off his sweet position.
time to get my king to safety.
moving my rook to an open file directly facing vertical towards his bishop.
me trying to take his strong outpost away
applying pressure on my fpawn.
me moving the rook to try to open up the c file
c5 applying pressure on d4 pawn and bishop at d3.
Dmitry decides to move his bishop to a safe position.
mwahahaha sneaky Dmitry wants to go to h7
time to get on the defense side.
better for me to trade off his strong bishop
He really likes his bishop haha.
applying more pressure at the f6 square.
whats Dmitry up to? hmmm
what about moving my bishop can't forget my cutie. And after this move I offered him a draw. And surprisingly he accepts it.
I emerged out of the opening with better development and initiative, white decided to end the game soon after it forcing a draw by 3-fold repetition, I need to find some improvement because this line seams great for black...
almost forced the exchange now, and then black needs to defend the c3 pawn, so I will be able to play Rb8 occupying the open b column
very sharp play by white, I can't play gxf6 due to Qxh6 and I don't have salvation on Bf5 due to Nxf5 and black loses
I can now proceed to capture the f6 rook, but first I need to interpose a quality sacrifice to  get rid of the b3 knight
now white must capture and I have gxf6 next, while this allows white to force a draw if he wants it, let's hope he goes for a win, because then I might be able to coordinate my pieces and win myself
if exf6 then Kh7 is forced due to the threat of mate in two
it seams as if he chooses the draw
my opponent went in to deep thinking (the previous moves were made in seconds) after this move, does he still wants to avoid the draw?
White recaptures with his d2 pawn. I think it might have been better to capture with the b2 pawn instead, since white's centre may later be weakened by the absence of centrl pawns? Although capturing with the d2 pawn does open up the c1-h6 diagonal for whites bishop...
I defend the pawn on e5 and threaten white's bishop.
I develop my  bishop, and connect my rooks on the back rank.
This prevents white's knight being pinned by Bg4... I think this was a bit of a waste of a move though - I'd just played Be6 the move before - if I'd wanted to play Bg4 I'd have done it already. Rd3 or might have been better - preparing to double rooks on the d file.
I try to control the c5 square more solidly than just covering it with the knight. White's bishop now has very few squares. But perhaps moving a rook to d8 straight away is better?
I don't swap - since this allows white to take back with his rook, and he could then double his rooks on the d file on his next move. Moving my knight to c5 would not be good - white could swap his inactive bishop for my active knight, and I'd have tripled pawns after recapturing!
White starts to take squares away from my white bishop and my knight.
I take advantage of the d file (previously controlled by white) now being closed and move a rook to it. Next time it time if opens up, white will not have control as before.
I don't quite understand this move. If white captures my knight, I can just recapture with my pawn on d7, un-doubling my pawns and improving my centre. It also gives me the chance to win another pawn with ...Nxd4, 17. bxd4, Bxd4.
Instead of winning an extra pawn with the exchange, I defend my pawn on e4. This may have been a mistake, since it creates a nice outpost for white's knight on e5.
I advance another pawn, taking away a square from white's bishop.
I move off the d file. Although I'd have preferred to keep the rook on the d file, Rd7 isn't good, since white just moves his knight back to e5, threatening it again.
I start to push my pawns - white has a lot of control on the d file if it opens up, so I want to try to open up another file somewhere else that white can't control.
Forcing a way through white's pawns on the a or b file... If white uses his rook to defend his queenside then he'll have to use the rook that is currently controlling the d-file.
I capture the pawn on b4 - if white recaptures with axb4 then I have a passed pawn supported by my rook on the a-file.
I recapture with my bishop.
I recapture with my rook. Now I own the d file...
White moves his king out of the way. Would rook f1 have been better? Once the rooks are swapped can white defend against the passed pawn on a4 with his bishop, and use his king to stop the pawn on e4?
I push my pawn again. White must now either lose a rook, or I promote my pawn to a queen.
White now has a siginificant material disadvantage. g3 may have been better here - since that does not lead to a further reduction in material on the board.
White starts capturing my undefended pawns. Those pawns are no longer important in the game though. By doing this white gives up his last chance to stop my pawn on e3 queening. Bd4 would have been better, followed by Bf2, defending e1 from the pawn promotion threat.
controlling the kingside
developing bishop
filling in the weakness i created earlier
i do not like knights because they cannot attack easily, i do not think they can touch my rook
i dont like to create weakness in the center but i need to block Q
I choose to play a open game.
Not Be7 because Qxg2. But Qe2 would have been the best and given white the tempo.
hmm after this move, i directly looked at g3 square. I hoped to utilize it somehow after i displace the knight somehow.
I continue to threathen the c2 square
! Not taking the pawn right away because the bishop is guarding it.
! Sacrifice of the bishop, white must take, there is no alternative
!! There are 7 squares between the rook and the stranded king! I had 3 seconds left on the clock when i made this move.
Major mistake, with only one piece defending the bishop now. The queen at d7 is boxing the bishop in. Bxe2, with some disadvantage to Black in position but minimizing his losses.
Black doing something to shore his position up now, trying to open up the center for his pieces and possibly pin White's queen to his king.
White evidently wants to start the middlegame and get something going.
White has been chasing Black's pieces around the board all game with his pawns, resulting in an advanced position. Where there is a pawn conflict, it will be between White's pawns on the 4th rank and Black's on the 6th, pushing the center of gravity of the battle towards Black's king. Black's pieces provide no help to him; they are perhaps a little more coordinated than White's, but not much. White still has an extra knight and his pieces are more centrally located.
The previous two moves White has ignored the Black threat on his b-pawn, which might have become an avenue for Black to breach White's defense and weaken the back rank. Black's attack has seriously been blunted, as the queen is back on the sixth rank and the bishop is little more than an obstacle White is working around. The move up of the c-pawn essentially made the b- and a-pawns irrelevant by breaking the chain with them, but White decides to consolidate his gains for a move.
White has opened up the middle with his attack on the queen, and now this game is largely a flanking action. White has a definite advantage, but Black has some possibilities to scratch and claw for a draw. He might be well off to try to start trading away pieces.
This is not the way. It is understandable to try to get the rook into the game, but capturing the pawn on c4 will open up White's middle and allow some attacks on White's king, which is a bit out in the open. Had Black castled kingside, it would have allowed White to capture Black's pawn on d5, forcing Black to scramble some more. However, the knight fork to come is more devastating, and White correctly goes for material.
The dust has settled, with White up a piece and the exchange. Black has few credible attacks here and essentially no hope of winning. However, his pawns might offer some hope of clogging up the middle and getting a draw from this mess. Moving a pawn to the 5th rank would blunt White's attack.
Entirely useless except to open up Black's rook. Now White has every reason to try to exchange pieces to get Black's rook off the board, the only really dangerous piece left.
Black scrambling, as he has little recourse to defend the d-pawn. However, as long as he's going to lose it he might as well get rid of his useless e-pawn as well, which is clogging up his rook's mobility. A move to e4 would prompt a capture from White's f-pawn. At that point, White's king has only a capturable pawn between the Black rook and him, and the f-file is open as well.
Black's whole problem this game has been falling in love with one piece to take, without noticing White's spatial advantage. Here he has pressed White into a mistake, although eventually of little consequence. White himself ought to understand that he's going to lose the f-pawn no matter what, and shift his rook to e4, where he could force Black into a pawn capture, which just protects White's king some more. Instead White wants to gobble up some of Black's pawns. That's fine, but leaves White vulnerable to a rook capture of the f-pawn, letting Black into White's backfield and complicating matters somewhat.
Another grave mistake, allowing White to force a rook trade.
Now White's rook is quite well-positioned, preventing Black's king from getting to either of White's pawns on the left side of the board. White could probably win with this material, but gets lazy and just decides to promote to win.
White's pawn on b2 is becoming something for Black's king to maneuver around.
Pinning the Knight and forcing Partos to block the development of his KB.
Partos finally throws in the towel. If 43 QxP, 43... R-K7ch wins the Queen. The Mikenas Pawn Storm lies dead and buried.
In this game, Pawnbandit has agreed to annotate his half of the game and I will annotate my half of the game at pivotal points as play develops. I write comments for the White pieces and Pawnbandit commentates for the Black pieces..I have some comments for black as well. To make this easy I will put Pawnbandits comments in brackets.
This seems to be the berlin defense. I'm not positive. It was definitely the favorite for black in this tournament.
(Nf6 leads to the Kieseritzsky Gambit and can lead to some interesting games. Here I feel like doing something different with a view to consolidating my extended pawn structure on the king side so I play 5..h5)
The crucial square in the kings gambit f7. In this position for the Berlin it's easy to kick out.
(Developing the knight on the side of the board and defending f7. This looks awkward but is consistent with the king side pawn thrust that follows.)
(Time to kick away White's centralized knight and open the way for the white squared bishop )
(This sort of early kingside thrust is often seen in 19th century games and has lead to quick wins for Black)
(The exchange of bishops ends up winning a pawn)
It allows white to immediately move my pawn forward and kick out the knight.
(Hoping to exchange knight for bishop but this is another mistake.<n>Better to return the knight to b8 then head for b6 via d7)
I did not want to trade my last bishop for a knight.
(At least now the knight has the opportunity to escape from a possible b4 but<n>at the cost of weakening the queenside. )
Not going to trade off the my active bishop for black knight thats not really doing anything anyways.
(At this stage of the game it looked like White's pieces were tied up defending against the kingside pawns so that despite the weaknesses on Black's queenside they were at the moment unexploitable. White presses home his advantage on the kingside.)
This was probably a wasted move. gives black tempo with already strong position. I felt i was losing here.
Seems safe for black. But maybe he was just as safe in the center.<n>(Developing the rook with a view to supporting a future advance on the kingside. )
(Encouraging the exchange of the dangerous knight on c5. )
(With the knight now gone, Black can breathe a bit easier and press home his advantage on the kingside. )
(With the knight now gone, Black can breathe a bit easier and press home his advantage on the kingside. )
This leaves behind the c5 square<n>(Hoping to exchange queens and move into a winning end game. )
(A terrible blunder and a losing move for Black. Defending the c5 square was critical in this phase of the game )
Black still can't take on b5 because of Ra8 . which leads to mate. Blacks also gives his king the d7 square to flee.
Black chooses the c6 option for his King.
I choose to develop my N rather than take e6.
11.a3 - As has been noted many times, it is important to prevent Black from playing Nb4-c2.
As I have learned, the key for White in this opening is to develop quickly to take advantage of the Q sac and to keep Black from having an active Queen.
14. d3  This move both aids in developing the DSB as well as attacking the Q with tempo.
15 O-O   White moves the King to relative safety, develops the Rook and threatens the Queen.
17. Nf7 forks Black's Q and R, forcing the Queen to move again.
18...b6  This move surprised me.  I expected Black to move Rh8 to safety.  Instead, White now has the option of exchanging his LSB for Ra8.  However, I wanted to keep my Bishop pair as I have learned (the hard way) how important the Bishop pair is for white in this tourney.
19. c3  I liked this move as it again forces the Queen away.  At this point, there are very few safe squares for the Q.
21 Nxh8  I thought about this move for awhile as I hated to give up a developed piece for an undeveloped piece but I reasoned that I had to make up the material.
27.  White is beginning to close in around Black's King.
28. g3  After this game, nuntar said that he thought this move was "rather aimless" and he wondered whether I thought my position was winning because of this move.  As I told him:   I moved 28. g3 to keep your Knight from f4 (and to give my King a bit of breathing room). My concern was that if the N went to f4, it could then attack d3 or force me to move it to d4. After that, I could see my pawn structure going into disarray, allowing your Queen freedom to move toward my King. The other option would have been to exchange my DSB for the N if it got to f4, but I certainly didn't like that option.--I looked at Bxe6 but I believe Black would definitely have moved Nf4, forking Be6 and d3.  I felt I had the time and position to be patient.
It was at this point that Black offered a draw.  I liked my position but thought perhaps I was missing something.  I declined the draw as I felt I had some pressure building around Black's King and I had not even developed Ra1.  It turns out that nuntar offered the draw because he thought there was a possibility that I did not see my position as "winning."
29 Re1.  This prevents his N from moving to e3 while it developed my Rook.  In fact, the only safe move for Black's N was c7.
30...Rxf6--I expected 30...Bxf6 which would have been followed by 31.	Bc7+	Qxc7<n>32.	Rxc7	Kxc7<n>33.	Rxe6  giving White a 2-pawn advantage in the endgame.  Instead, Black took with the Rook and then resigned.  I saw the continuation as 31. Bxf6 Bxf6  32. Rg8+ and then a multitude of problems for Black.<n><n>As I noted, this was my last game in this tourney.  With the win, I secured 3rd place behind freddy and joanne.  This was a wonderful learning experience and my thanks to freddy for inviting me and and to everyone who participated in the tourney.  I look forward to seeing all of you across the board!
The Rubenstein variation.  Not as common as Bb4 (the Winawer) or Nf6 (the Classical), but this move forces the knight to move twice in the opening.
Black loses the right to castle, and his king winds up on an open file...
!  This knight sacrifice forces black to play fxe5, leaving his king with nowhere to hide.
If black leaves this pawn alone, this move prevents black's king from running anywhere onto the 5th rank.
?  "TOO LATE FOR LOVE!"  Oblivious to the nasty threat contained in h4; black's best hope was to play h5.
! Black resigns, 1-0.  Black has only one legal move, and after Kh6, 22. Nf7 is mate.  Truly a punishing lesson on the dangers of falling behind in development!
This is the usual 3rd move for white, designed to prevent the Slav Gambit (3.....e5), although the Slav Gambit is rarely played and is not more successful than other 3rd moves by black.
I threaten to take twice on b5
Now both his b and c pawns are hanging
He gives more support to his knight, and prepares to develop his Bf8. I now had a good, long think. 10. 0-0 is of course the logical move here, presumably he replies with Be7 followed by 0-0 and it is hard to see any advantage for white. So I started looking at Bg5, then what? If he replies Be7, I can exchange bishops, and maybe my knights can manoeuvre to d3 and/or e4 and maybe into c5 and/or d6. This may be hard to counter. If he doesn't play Be7, how on earth is he going to develop his Bf8 and play 0-0? Yes Bg5 looks good....
This is the best square for the queen. From this square there is pressure on d4, for instance I can't play Nd2 with the idea of Ne4, as my d pawn will be hanging after Nd2. After the game I found there was one game on the world database with Qd7, but white won.
Now he really is threatening to free his position with c6-c5, so after another long think, I decide to take on d5
This rather surprised me, but of course with the closed position his king is going to be quite safe on e7 and his rooks will be connected. I could play something else rather than exchange, but then he can play 0-0, contest the open c file - I don't think there is anything better.
He delays the exchange.
I plan to put a knight on d3, threatening to go to c5.
He threatens to re-position his knight to c6, hitting d4.
My Ne1 will have to return to f3, the main reason behind this move was to make f2 available for my king.
And this time he offers a draw, which I accept. There doesn't seem much either side can do.<n><n>Many thanks for reading my annotation. I hope you found it interesting, educational and enjoyable. Please rate it on the star system and leave a comment or two.
Again with the Centre Game. I like this opening, as it keeps my options open (freeing up most of my pieces, with only the rooks being unable to move, although I would not want to move the king, as he is safe enough where he is).
He declines to take my pawn, bringing out his queen, hoping to develop her, so I initiate the exchange. Now I must try to repel the queen...
...and I succeed in this. I thought the only way to repel her was to offer an exchange, and I succeed in that, but my pawn is a potential weakness, with it being so far advanced...
...so I defend it with my knight. It may have biocked in the pawn in front of my bishop, but I felt it was necessary to get a piece out, with my opponent getting out a bishop.
Moving his pawn allowed me to get ahead on development. I now have more control of the centre, with my knights, and my advanced pawn is defended by one of them.
As he moves his bishop to pin my knight down, I can instantly break the pin with my own bishop. Also, if he captures my knight, I can recapture and maintain a good pawn structure.
...so I castle queenside to bring a rook into play. I would say I am ahead on development, with two knights on the third rank, and a bishop on the second, while he has a bishop on his fifth rank, and a knight on his second.
I now get the piece exchange, hoping to poison his pawn on g7, with mine on d5 being protected by my rook...
I decide to fianchetto my bishop, to defend the knight from the long diagonal...
...and I again get a knight for bishop exchange. I have the long-range bishop pair, he has the short-range knight pair, but we both have the rook pair, along with seven pawns, and there is one open file - the one where the kings start. Does anyone have a real advantage?
...but his rook moves to defend it...
...so I attack the other knight with my bishop. If the knight moves, the pawn will disappear, or I will get ahead by a piece for a pawn: 17... Nbxd5 18. Bxd5 or 17... Nexd5 18. Rxe8+ Rxe8 19. Bxd5.
I now get the bishop for knight exchange, and I've now doubled pawns on the b-file. I am now hoping to target them, although they will support the rook's pawn down the board...
...so I bring up a rook to target the pawn on b6...
...and move it across to line it up...
...but because it moves, I bring my rook's pawn to attack it, ensuring that I will either be a pawn up, or doubled pawns on the rook's starting file: 21... bxa4 22. Rxb7 (where the knight will now be under attack from two rooks) or 21... b4 22. Rxb4 or a potential 22. axb5...
...but because the knight's pawn advances, I can capture the pawn in front of it. OK, I now have doubled pawns on the b-file, but they are strong, as not only can they support my bishop's pawn, but they will either undouble, or one can be used in a pawn trade, which would isolate the pawn on b6.
As he declines to recapture (which would allow me to capture again, and force him to play Rb8)...
...I double my rooks on the third rank. I'm now hoping to exchange a pair of rooks, being ahead by the odd pawn...
...and get the exchange I was looking for. I'm now hoping to exchange the other rooks, so I will go into the endgame with a single pawn advantage, where I can make the most of it.
He sure gave up another exchange here! I am ahead on material, after all, and I would welcome the exchange...
...which is what happens. He has weakened his counterplay, with only a short-range knight and six pawns against my long-range bishop and seven pawns in the endgame. I felt I was the favourite to win here: I control the b1, d1, b2, c2, d2, a3, b3, c3, d3, e3, g3, e4, f4, g4, h4, d5, a6, and c6 squares: he controls e8, g8, a7, e7, f7, g7, b6, d6, g6, a5, c5, e5 and b4, while we contest the e6 and h5 squares with our pawns and my bishop. What I intended was to manoeuvre my king to a4, then advance my pawn to b4, then get the trade, so the pawn on b6 would be isolated.
I felt it was vital to defend my pawn on b5, so I retreat my bishop.
I also advance my bishop's pawn to protect my pawns on b5 and d5, and it is now protected by my bishop. His king cannot penetrate, as I control the c3, e3 and g3 squares with my pawns, and d3 and f3 with my bishop, which also controls c4, while the pawn there controls b5 and d5...
...and although his kingside pawns advance down the board, I get the pawn trade I was referring to earlier. Now all my pawns are in single file, and are connected in threes.
I felt I restrained the king well here: I looked at the squares my king, bishop and pawns controlled in order to drive him away, and so I could get mine close to my bishop. His king can only move onto e5.
My kingside pawns may now be disconnected and isolated, but the king cannot move anywhere towards my bottom rank, as my bishop's pawn is denying him access to e3 and g3, while my bishop is denying him access to f3 and g4 (which is also controlled by my rook's pawn)...
...and my king restrains him even further - he can now only move backwards, as mine has denied him access to e4 and e5.
His last two pawn moves allowed my bishop to move to some pawn protection, and to only allow the king one square: g3. Also, if the knight moves, it will be captured: 40... Nb5 41. cxb5, 40... Nc6 41. dxc6, 40... Nc8 41. Bxc8, and my bishop can now help my king to clean up the pawns, although it would have to rely on the pawns being on light squares, and undefended.
I now remove the knight, and his last good piece has gone: all I need to do is create at least one passed pawn, and then queen it, then maybe get a second queen to help out...
...and although I drop my bishop's pawn...
...the bishop itself moves back to be protected by my rook's pawn. What I need to do is manouevre my king to eliminate the pawns on either side...
...but I am unable to deal with the queenside pawns, as my king is denied access by the pawns and the king...
I now move my bishop to provide a distraction here...
...and I move it onto the 7th rank. If the king moves to e7, I can then eliminate the kingside pawns, even if I do drop the bishop, and make my rook's pawn passed: 47... Ke7 48. Kf5 Kxd7 49. Kxg5, and the king must stay on his second rank, and I then play 50. Kxh4, giving myself a passed pawn on h3, and then I queen on h8, and she  ought to have few problems hoovering up the queenside pawns.
...so I move my king back. If he plays Kh5, I play Be8+, forcing Kh6, so I play Kg4, leaving him with Kg7 or Kh7, so I can then play Kxg5 then Kxh4, so I can then queen on h8.
...so I move into the square to hunt down his pawns...
...so I check with my bishop. If he plays KKf6, I play Bb1, then remove the pawn on g5, 50... Kh6 would allow me to win the pawn in two moves, 50... Kf7/g7 51. Kxg5.
I finally remove the pawn on g5...
...followed by the one on h4, giving me a passed pawn on h3. My opponent resigned here, as he would have had to stop it from promoting, allowing my king to eliminate his pawns on b6 and d6, and get at least one queen queenside.
Putting the question to one of the few pieces that black has been able to develop, the knight has few reasonable options
The black king is hemmed in but I don't think white is in a position to take full advantage
Looking to get the dsb on the A3-f8 diagonal, though the potential pin from Bb2 is tempting too
Trying to keep some sort of attack going
The fork was too tempting to resist, there is however an added benefit that the black king is held onto the 8th rank
The c pawn is immune due to Rd8#
I think black had seen the threat but didn't realise that this was not an escape route
I moved the Knight preparing for a feinchetto on the Queen side. Which was a mistake to begin with as it is more effective on the king side
The idea of this sacrifice is that if the black king gets in the corner it will be a draw. The position looks bad for black anyway.
The lost pawn queens. I suspect all lines were lost after my king was decoyed away from the centre but my continuation wasn't the best attempt to save the half point.
developing, preparing to castle, and bring the rook into play
he now tries to gambit the pawn back to me, after blocking his bishop in, not the best move really, Bg5 was better
i take the free pawn, but i can't afford to trade the bishop off yet, as im still down a pawn, and owning the diagonals is paramount in the Danish Gambit
brings the rook into play
starts a kingside push, prepares to castle
forces him to retreat either the knight or the bishop and lets me take the pawn on g7
now material has been equalized and i have a far superior position, note that his king is still in the middle of the board and his queen, bishop, and both knights are stuck
tries to drive out the bishop, puts his rook on a file with my king
i decide to try to keep the pressure on his struggling king
bit of a waste of time, preparing b5 to drive away my bishop, which needs to move anyway
i preempt his move and attack the pawn on h7 which would also win a bishop-rook exchange
i have to guard the bishop and the pressure on his king is mounting
this move was intended to move my queen away, but look at his king, completely trapped by his own pieces, and ready to fall
keeps the guard on the bishop
his pawn move opened up a diagonal to his king, and because his knight is pinned, none of his pieces can defend, all he can defend with is a rook pawn
She backs his bishop away.
I take the bishop.
I bring my knight to safety.
I bring my rook over to attack the knight.
I'm trying to get my knight into the battle.
I take the trade.
I attack the rook.
I attack his rook.
My pawns going up to.
I have to move the bishop.

As mentioned before, ...Bg4 has given me grief in past games against the Scandinavian, so I decided to prevent it.
I didn't want to castle too early as this would enable Black to point everything at my King.  This move contests the centre and enables my QB to develop.
Under no pressure to castle yet, I make a second move with the KB to put the question to Black's annoying B.
... castle.  Now, if Black wants to swap Bishops, I can either retake with my Q, connecting my rooks or accept the doubled pawns in return for a half-open file down which to attack Black's Queen.
This is a strong attacking position for this Bishop, supported as it is by the Q on c7 but it doesn't actually threaten anything serious.
Lining up on Black's uncastled King, hoping to be able to play something like 12. d5 exd5 13. Bb6+.  That would obviously be too good to be true but thinking about it gave me other attacking ideas.  I expected Black to castle immediately, which would have suited me because I thought he was probably planning .... 0-0-0, so I would have been satisfied at foiling his (supposed) plan.
This surprised me and confirmed in my mind that he was planning Queenside castling.  From my point of view, I didn't really mind which way he went as my pieces ere centrally placed to attack on either wing but if he did want to castle long, I wanted to frustrate him, so...
!  After the game, my opponent congratulated me on this sacrifice, which enabled me to generate considerable pressure.  As previously noted, it exploits the uncastled position of Black's king to gain tempi.
Swapping this N off clears the path for my c-pawn to advance and for a rook to line up against Black's Q, which would be especially dangerous if Black castled long and his c-pawn had cleared off to the d-file.
The Queen goes to the rim, where she is less powerful, but does attack White's a-pawn.  White also has to be careful about abandoning the defence of the Rook on e1.  Yesterday's Guardian featured a nice finish by Bronstein which exploited the fact that all Black's pieces were over on the Queenside, including the Q on a5.  I wish I'd seen it before I played this game!
Finally Black castled.  Now, if I'd seen Bronstein's game, I'd undoubtedly have launched an all-out assault on Black's castled King.  I thought about trying to build up such an attack but decided it would be too easy to repel, so continued with my strategy of pressuring Black and exploiting the open c-file.
Played to stop Black's N from coming to c5 or e5 and to allow my Q to use d3.
Clearly, Black is preparing to double on the c-file but this deprives his Q of a retreat square, so now I follow Freddy's example and pile on the pressure, again to foil Black's plans.
?! Again stops Black doubling but, the more I swap off without regaining my pawn, the worse my position gets.  This was just about the highwater mark of my game.  Black gets the upper hand after this.
Now I wanted to play 23. Bg5 to take on f6 and follow up with the fork on d7.  Unfortunately the N on e5 was under attack, so that would have lost a pawn.
! Prevents 28. Qb5, which I had been planning in order to keep Black's Queen on the back row, at least till he'd created luft for his own King.
!  Virtually forcing the most important swap of all.  If White doesn't swap, Black gangs up on f2 or nicks the a3 pawn.
Black hastens to create a passed pawn.  I knew I was heading for defeat now.  It was just a question of playing for time and a lucky chance.  I had about half an hour left, my opponent a quarter: plenty yet to force a win.
I felt I had to stay on the a7-g1 diagonal to protect my a-pawn.  Retreating to e3 or f2 would have allowed Black to cut the B off from that task by ...d4.
?  As Black said after the game, White had to keep the Bishop on even at the expense of going another pawn down.
? It no longer really matters but this is a mistake.  If I want to prevent the pawn from queening, I should retreat to d1.  As it happens, Black can give up the d-pawn to capture the g-pawn and queen his own g-pawn but this move allows Black to force home the d-pawn.
Here. Ignoring the attack on the bishop and focusing on applying pressure to e7.
If black responds taking the bishop with the king it'll just seal the deal...
Black resigns knowing that next is <n>16. ... Kg8<n>17. Re8+ Bf8 for the block<n>18. Qxf8#<n><n>I think my improvement in this game was 12. Re1. I'm still not sure how I figured that out. Reviewing the game I was surprised when I saw what I had done. It's definitely encouraged me to think more unorthodox.
We begin here, with the evergreen and popular Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defence.  This modest looking move is designed to prepare ...e5 without having to worry (overmuch) about White's landing a minor piece on the b5-square and attacking the d6-point.  At the same time, the move supports an eventual expansion by Black on the Q-side.  So purposive is the move, it hardly comes under the pejorative 'country move' associated with a move like a2-a3 or ...a7-a6, which often signals a timorous approach to the game.  The Najdorf is not for the timorous!
[!?] This move, similar to the Sozin Attack in the 2...Nc6 lines of the Sicilian, has declined relatively in popularity compared with 6.Bg5 and 6.Be3.  In former times it was something of a favorite with Bobby Fischer, and was held to be one of the more aggressive lines against the Najdorf Sicilian.  It tends to discourage Black's planned ...e7-e5 advance, but at the cost of presenting Black's b-pawn with a target, unless White is prepared to pay a price in time.
By far and away the most popular response.  Black cuts the White bishop off from the f7-square, leaving ...e5 to wait for the time being.
The target having dodged, betimes, Black makes this advance anyway!  GM O'Kelly de Galway called this 'the most active continuation preparing a counter-attack on the White KP [e-pawn].'  Bobby Fischer himself played this line against Robert Byrne in the Sousse Interzonal, 1967.  Also playable here are 7...Be7 and 7...Nbd7.
Uber-aggression.  Instead 8.0-0 is more often played, but 8.f4 has also been tried.  It was with the latter move Bobby Fischer came within an ace of defeating Mischa Tal in the 1959 Candidates' Tournament.  After 8.f4 b4?! Tal got himself into all sorts of trouble:  9.Na4 Nxe4  10.0-0 g6  11.f5! gxf5  12.Nxf5! Rg8   13.Bd5! Ra2.  Note Tal's 8th and 9th moves - the thematic idea behind Black's play.  This game was to feature much the same idea...
Forcing White to make a decision in respect of this bishop: take the knight, or retreat.
She retreats.  This looks like a straight-forward loss of a tempo, but things aren't so simple.  It may well have been White's purpose to draw forward the h-pawn, weakening Black's K-side slightly, and creating a target for a later K-side attack.  Returning to the centre, this bishop is well placed to intervene on either flank.
The 'Tal' move, in a slightly different setting.  This attack decoys the c3-Knight away from the defence of the e-pawn.  Dangerous as it was in the Fischer-Tal game, it seems no less risky here, as we shall see...
'Knights on the rim are dim,' quoth the wiseacres.  But in fact this Knight is not so badly placed here, as the sequel will show.
Expressing considerable interest in the e-file already, White is gearing up for operations in the centre and on the K-side.  Planning to castle Q-side, she will be aiming to centralise both rooks.  But such is White's lead in development, she could already have contemplated the thematic sacrifice at e6:  11.Nxe6!? ... and now [A] 11... fxe6  12.Nb6! Bb7  13.Nxa8 Bxa8  14.Bxe6; or [B] 11...Bxe6  12.Bd5! Nd7! -(Instead 12...Bxd5  13.Qxd5 and White has a strong attack going)- 13.Bxe4 Rc8.  both lead to unclear positions with chances for both sides.  Insofar as the sacrifice does not compromise White's chances, we might consider it to be sound enough.
Shoring up the centre against the pressure to come, and hardening up the defences along the a2-g8 diagonal.  This is costing time, though. as White completes her mobilization.
The point d5 looks well defended!  The database shows a game 12...Nd7 that led to a quick draw after 13.Nxe6; but Black might also have contemplated 12...Bd7 here.  White now outflanks the strong point.
[!] It had to come, and it had to be sooner rather than later.  Everything is poised for an all out attack.  But that is not to say Black Black is not ready to face this onslaught.  Things have suddenly become very interesting!  Should Black accept the sacrifice?  In calling Black's reply a mistake, the GK engine offered this alternative with a near-even assessment: 13....fxe6  14.Qh5ch Ke7 -(I'll revisit this in my next note)  15.Bc5ch Nxc5  16.Nxc5 Qb6  17.Nxe6 Nc6 -(Not much improvement can be got from 17...Nd7  18.Rhe1 Nf6  19.Qf5)- 18.Nxf8 Raxf8  19.Qxd5 Kf6  20.Qe6ch Kg5  21.Rd5ch Kh4 - the limit of the engine's vision, and so it looked even.  It isn't of course: fen="5r1r/1b4p1/pqn1Q2p/3R4/1p5k/1B6/PPP2PPP/2K4R w - -" (See comment)<n>22.Qh3#.  From this it might appear that Black did well to leave the knight alone...
[??] A disastrous move that leads to a swift collapse.  It seems that Black ought indeed to have taken the Knight and then clung on in the face of White's assault: 13...fxe6!  14.Qh5ch Kd7! -(We surmise that the GK engine's choice ...Ke7 is insufficient, though that has yet to be definitively determined).  At this point White might well fling everything into the assault: 15.Bxd5!? exd5  16.Rxd5ch Bxd5  17.Qxd5ch Nd6! -(any King move gets axed)- 18.Re1! ... -(the straight-forward 18.Qxa8 is playable, too, by the look)-  18...Be7 -(What else?  Not 18...Nc6, that's for sure: 19.Nc5ch!)-  19.Qxa8.  At this point White would be a piece behind still, but with so active a game could still fancy her winning chances.  'Fancying her chances' is however a far cry from the 'gimme' win White now obtains.
Already Black has no good defence.  E.g. 14...d4 15.Rxd4 Qe5  16.Nd5 Nc5  17.f4 Nxb3ch  18.axb3 Qxd5, as suggested by the GK engine, still leaves Black miserably placed, her King stuck in the centre, and shedding material.
& the bishop is returned with interest.
I prefer 13.  Be3. It develops a piece, connects the rooks, & attacks the c5 pawn.
28. Rfd1 & let the Ra have the open c file. Also black's last move was to play b5. Get the Rf off the bishop's path.
When ahead trade pieces. 43. Rh6  Rxh6 44. Bxh6 & black resigns because he can't cross the g file to stop the pawns.
I'm a 1. d4 player. Always have been. Lately, I've been studying the Queen's and Nimzo Indian systems - and I ran across this game. I've never heard of this Sashin fellow, but the name Korchnoi cetainly caught my eye. I have come of the opinion that the strong GM types consider the Queen's and Nimzo Indian systems a little slow and boring (and most often drawish), but if it's good enough for Korchnoi it's good enough for me. Or so I thought......This is a wild game. Sashin plays solidly, and delivers an extremely subtle, but beautiful 23rd move which starts the fireworks. Korchnoi gets through the opening in solid position, and then goes totally nuts with a brutal attack during the middlegame (at one point delivering 11 consecutive checks!) which marches the white king all the way across the board. Then, just like THAT! - all of his initiative is gone, and Sashin's awesome 23rd move gem tells the tale of victory. Was it brilliant insight into the position? or was it just dumb luck? I don't know....but this IS a pretty game! As always, my meager analysis will be limited. I hope you enjoy:)
So far, standard Nimzo Indian play. White is most likely interested in kingside play, and black is looking to push on the queenside.
! A very natural move in this position, but I give it the "!" all the same - it hits the center, clears c6 for the Nb8, and loudly announces to white that Korchnoi is ready to fight!
?! White forces black to make the first real commitment. The reason I give 8. a3 a "?!" is that although black's dark squared bishop is strong, it currently is only exerting influence on c3. Perhaps 8. Bd2 was better? It would develop and hit c3 as well.
!? Black aims for complications. It's about to get ugly.
Black forgoes the bishop pair and continues to disrupt the queenside.
And the smoke clears a bit. Both sides have roughly equal control of the center. White has the bishop pair and better developing space, but three pawn islands. Black is slightly weaker in development, but has good pawn structure and quicker access to the half open c and d files.
Korchnoi maintains the initiative, and strives to further punish white's backward c pawn by trying to make it isolated via an exchange on e5.
Black develops his last piece with a nice little pin to boot.
! White correctly assesses that black's light squared bishop is just too powerful to be freely roaming about on all of those empty light squares, and aims to remove it - which will further enhance the power of his bishop pair.
While down the bishop pair, black has maintained initiative and now brings his heavy pieces into the action with a solid threat on d4.
As this bishop was unprotected, Shashin retreats it to safety while maintaining it's influence on f7.
Preparing to double up on the d file.
Preparing to double up on the e file.
Once again, black strives to maintain the initiative he has grown to love. He is solidly positioned to start mixing it up.
Black claims his prize!
Here is where it gets interesting. White has been pushed around for far too long, and delivers a threat of his own at f7. Black must eliminate this threat.
! And now for the REAL fight. White has a ton of ammo directed at black's king, and at f7 in particular. Black plays 22...Nf5 to attack the white Re7, but more importantly to clear the d file for his rook.
Of course, black sees the danger regarding his own monarch, but CONTINUES TO ATTACK! In this position, the board appears to be total offense by both sides. Defense? What is defense?
Man, black MUST have a mate in here somewhere! This is the 7th check in a row!
White is now hanging on by his fingernails! He has FOUR hits on the dismal g7 square but he just can't catch his breath to do anything about it.
White snags the offending rook and maintains the heat on f7.
.........! this gorgeous discovered/double check which is the dagger through the heart. Black resigned at this point, as 35...Kf8 loses to 36. Rg8# and 35...Kh8 loses to 36. Rh7#. What a truly wonderful game! I have gone back and played through it several times, and each time I am convinced that white is busted. I just know that Korchnoi has an irresistable attack. Then I just revel in Sashin's 23rd move and his dogged stubborness as he just waits for his chance to deliver his one and only shot at victory, and succeeds. Man, I love chess:) - Thomas
Maintaining the tension on his knight until he forces my hand
taking the pawn with tempo
At this point, I think it would have been better to back up the bishop and keep the tension on his e-pawn
Had to take the knight, because if I tried to sneak another pawn with e takes f7, he could recapture with the queen and guard his knight and be up a piece
This move sealed the draw as I would win the h pawn after the exchanges on d7
This is the most logical response, but symmetry is usually favorable to the side with the tempo. The Sicilian Defense (1...c5) is the best way to try for an advantage as Black.
This is the Ruy Lopez, or Spanish Opening. I develop my bishop to the most active square.
Supposedly this is advantageous to White, but this move avoids the well analyzed main lines of the Ruy Lopez. Instead, Black accepts doubled pawns and a kingside pawn minority, in order to leave my bishop on an unimportant diagonal, and Black will usually have more experience in this opening than a normal Ruy-Lopez Player.
Now there are a lot of imbalances in the position. I am ahead in development and have a kingside pawn majority, but Black may be able to gain tempo chasing my bishop. There are a few common plan choices here. One is to ignore my bishop and play O-O and c3, taking advantage of Black's weak pawn by trying to trade it for a flank pawn, strengthening my pawn centre. A more passive, but safer plan is to play c4 and Qe2, which greatly increases my control of the light squares and makes Black's development more difficult. The plan I chose was the only one I thought would bring me an advantage.
My plan was to take advantage of my kingside pawn majority, and storm Black's kingside before he has a chance to finish developing. Although my plan probably could've been more promising if I'd played c4 first, keeping my bishop on the a4-e8 diagonal.
It's hard for Black to find active moves in this position. I thought Nf6 was his best try.
Black questions my oddly placed bishop.
Now I have an open f-file and a strong g-pawn. Even though I only have my queen and rook in the attack, I should be able to crush his position once I get the h-pawn rolling.
I should've played this earlier, because I need my rook on the h-file to complete my attack.
Clearly Black has no idea what to do and is making random moves. Either he underestimates my strong attack, or he can't find suitable defensive moves and is waiting to lose.
Another passive move is all it takes to lose. Now Black probably can't recover.
This pawn cannot be captured, because after I recapture, Black is in big trouble on the wide open h-file after Qh2.
Now my attack is too much. One way or another, I will open the h-file and pile it with my heavy pieces.
A better chance is fxg6, but Black is still lost because after hxg7, an array of tactical threats will beat Black to a pulp.
There are probably many ways to win here. I thought about playing g7, and Rxh6, but once I knew I had a winning position, I didn't really care how I finished it.
This move loses immediately, although Black can't really do anything else. If he leaves his rook hanging, I will still have a lot of tactical threats, and Black doesn't have any possibilities for a counterattack, since my king is perfectly safe, despite having no pawn cover. Although my king may become weak if Black survives my attack.
Black can resign now. He is going to be mated soon, but in case he didn't resign, the last moves are conditional moves.
Kh8 and Kh7 get mated by Qg7#.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Operation Joblock snares another Master!  This time it is my mentor, David Patron who had a rating just 40 points south of being an IM.  David is a very strong player and he certainly deserves to get to that level.  Again, neither player did anything wrong except the fact that gameknot analysis did not like my last move and preferred h5 to Kg8.  So, I achieve my fourth Master Draw!  But how did this block out occur?  Well, we must all read on......
5. ..... h6 - the Wicked Witch of the West has plonked herself on a diagonal which could be a potential menace to Henry if he goes kingside.  I decided to play this move to prevent Ng4 and to avoid that pawn becoming a target itself.
8. ...... 0-0 - I thought I would wait until David castled before putting Henry on the same side.  David is not so likely to risk compromising his own castled position to attack mine with a pawn storm.
9. ..... e4 - an interesting conversation took place between me and David in the chat: Jo: Thanks.  Now, I really ought to block off that annoying b1-h7 diagonal and put a bit of a cramp in your position - at least for a while!  David: That's a good move Jo and the one I would have played for the reasons you have set out.  It irks me to have to withdraw my knight - for now at least.
10. ..... Re8 - the conversation now continued: ..... hmm, but that pesky steed has counter-attacked my pawn.  I did agonise over which piece was the right one to defend it but I think it is good to at least put a rook on a half-open file.  I just hope I made the right choice here.  David said: I think Bf5 was very marginally the better move to support the battle for control of the centre.  But your choice was perfectly OK.
12. Rb1 - Dave then said in the chat that he wanted to probe my defences.  After a long consideration I decided the best way to meet this move was to advance my pawn to b6.
13. ...... Qc8 - prepares the remote possibility of a bishop sac on h3.  This doesn't happen, however.
16. ....... c5 - a multi-purpose move.  This move firmly seals off the queenside.  If dxc5 then dxc5 and I will have tidied up my backward pawn on the d column.
17. ...... Qc7 - Glenda acts as a foil to all the queenside pawns.  She also connects the rooks.
18. ....... Rad8 - after Dave tries to frighten me with an incursion into my pos. by the Witch, I calmly move my rook onto the d column.
19. .... Kh8 - Dave said that all he could do was try and improve his position but he did not think he would get anywhere unless I over-extended myself.  Me shuttling Henry from h8 - g8 proved I had no intention of doing this.  After playing his rook to b5 Dave told me he would settle for a draw.  I put Henry back on g8 and made my offer of which Dave kindly accepted.  Interestingly enough, Gameknot analysis stated that my last move was an inaccuracy.  So it turned out to be a very good draw offer in more ways than one.  For me it has been the tale of two buses.  After my epic draw with Freddy in 2010 I had to wait another three years for my third Draw, which was against Skorpio, now along comes the second bus - all in the space of two weeks.  In order to increase my tally of such scalps, I need to be a little more consistent.  Anyhow, David played very well and it was a good instructive game on how to defend properly.  I hope you all have a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne
In this game, I am black.  My Opponent isn't very good and I know a fair amount of chess, so I have a clear advantage in that department.  I still make dumb mistakes and don't see everything though, so I am putting this game up so that I can get some advice.  Also I make a pretty huge blunder and come back successfully due to my opponent making many mistakes.  Any pointers will help, so please comment.
I overdevelop my knight here, which causes me to soon lose it.
I need to defend my knight somehow, and I personally thought this move gives me more center control than f5 or h5.  Also I didn't want to weaken my kingside since I was planning on castling there.
A quick analysis shows that, at this point, I am clearly winning.  I have more control of the center and queenside and most of my minor pieces are developed.  Also, My major pieces are beginning to develop as well.  Hindsight tells me that I should've played Nc6 first before castling or captured the lone pawn on g5, but I felt like playing it safe.
I capture the pawn anyway since my opponent failed to defend it
His king is now wide open.  I get excited and start planning an attack.
doubling my rooks to prepare for an attack, but another huge blunder ensues.
...<n>If only that knight wasn't there, this move would've been so much better.  My analysis missed the knight, so my plan was to capture the queen and rook for 2 rooks and end up even in material, but that isn't the case.
My opponent, while up in material, is not taking advantage of it.  His queen and black bishop have not moved since the start.  This game would have been completely different otherwise.
My opponent clearly is trying to focus on my queenside pawns, which I admit are very vulnerable.  I take advantage of it by developing my kingside pawns.  Once again, my pawn game isn't the best so I don't know if h6 was the best move for this.
My opponent falls for my pin, and I am soon going to win the bishop pair, an advantage which will prove decisive.
My opponent really wants to get rid of my bishop pair.
trading away my queenside pawn, but now I need something else to defend against his passed pawn.  However, that pawn never comes into play because my opponent never uses it.
Forcing the king even further away and preparing to defend the g pawn.
My opponents best move in a while.  I really had to think about what I am going to do next, but the next move was actually pretty obvious after short analysis.
I threaten to promote my pawn, and by now it is unstoppable as the bishop is defending the queening square.
Wins the exchange after 56. Qxf2 Rxf2+.  Victory is within my grasp.
Removed his white bishop so that my own white bishop can own the A8-H1 diagonal.
Plan is to have both bishops pointing straight at his King
He has to defend the checkmate on G2.
I offer the trade, feeling confident in my bishop vs pawns
What to do here... I considered advancing my king, but it would have been repelled by his H pawn. Offering up my own H pawn to trade with his G pawn would have prevented his pawns reinforcing eachother.
I really liked this spot for my bishop. When things come down to the bitter end his King can't cross any of D3-6. It also poses a challenge for him to get his pawns through G8 and F7.
And I'm through, just need his King to back off some more.
The king's only option is to step away from the pawn. So he plays for time on the other side of the board
Racing to the A1 corner
Pretty soon the king will run out of moves and he will be forced to advance the a3 pawn and lose it.
? strange... the move in the text blocks black from developing properly.
?? after e4 the bishop has nowhere to go.
a lame try to take a2...
with material advantage it is always good to exchange pieces.
black has to rooks on the second so even if he is with a piece down he looks not that bad.
no need to carry on. the end!
Nxf7 offers Black a strong attack and at least equality, even better in many lines. This move, Bf7+, requires precise play by Black.
Black has a strong attack.
White hopes that Black will overlook the threats on the a2-g8 diagonal.
best option to defend this opening trap is to go on with normal moves and ignore his attack
hmm now black is waisting material. White can take the black queen on d5. To do so he has to take the knight on c2 with his queen, and pick up the queen after.
Sorry to say it but, black gaved away his winning position. One move later white blunders the queen.
:) I do like the way black took advantage of white using an opening trap. Black playd aggresive and earned the win :)
I put pressure on the centre pawn - no issues here. Another possibiltiy for black is ...d6. 3. Nc3 e5 and allowing ny bishop to progress...we then move into the Vienna (C25).
and I decide to put pressure on the d file pawn
and I get the hell out also thinking about e6.
and I do not want to exchange
and I make headway for the bishop
with plans to get back to d8
a good move, the centre is kept and I am still on the run
and I made a silly move, but at the time I thought it was sheer brilliance.....on reflection 18...b6 followed by developing my bishop or thinking about protecting my king with a castle would have been a better option. I had just got her safe and now she is on the run again - a waste of time and eventually loses the game for black.
I try to make some movement on the a file
my 29...Ra7 insists whites next move to e5. The bishop is so strong here and I can not attack
more pressure and a retreat, white could have moved the g pawn to pressure my fair lady forcing Qg6+, but Ne4 would follow forcing Bb6.
at first I thought this was going to be a good idea, but I think in my mind I had lost and did not look closely enough at f5 to prevent my Qxh2.
9....d6 was better.Now white has an advantage. this inaccurasy gives white an edge but still hes a long way from winning.After 9...d6 i would have played probably 10.Re1 or 10.a3.
White with the initiative here. Now i threaten to take a pawn.Will black try to keep it or play for development and counterattack?
Going for the attack.Now white creates various threats on blacks position.Ne6 for example or Bxh7+ winning a pawn.Black must react but in what way?
Black is trying to defend actively here and counterattack. The problem here though is he hasn't got time for it!!Fritz suggests again 14....Nc6, giving up a pawn for development.Sometimes you got to give something to avoid losing a lot!!
Unfortunately for him thats not it!16...Nf6 is best even though white has a big advantage in this position as well. for example 16...Nf6 17.Nf7+ Rxf7 18.Bxf7 with more material as i had seen during the game. And the variation that fritz gave in the analysis 17.Be6 d4 18.Qd3 Qe8 19.Nd5 Bxd5 20.Bxd5 Nbd7 21.Bxa8 Qxa8.
Black was counting on this response, defending and also threatening checkmate on h2. at first glance looks good. However........
If black makes another mistake here its over!If 18...Qxf4 19.Qh7#. The only chance is 18.Qg7 19.Qxg7 Kxg7 20.Bxd5 winning another pawn (20...Rxf4 21.Ne6+).Black is still in trouble but not mated!And if he takes on f4 with the rook then....
Its all over.White threatens mate in h7 and the only response is black to give his queen and rook for the knight. for example 19..RXf7 20.Nxf7+ Qxf7 21.Qxf7. If he tries 19...Nf6 then 20. Qh6+ Nh7 21.Qxh7#.Here black resigned. <n><n>So if we see the game here black made three errors that cost him the game real quickly. First of all a slight error of playing 9.d5 instead of d6, then another inaccuracy of 12...f5 instead of Nc6 and finally the most important error 14...Ng4 instead of Nc6. One error led to another and finally blacks position collapsed. He could have put up more of  resistance later but in the end it was that small mistakes in the opening that led the position to get worse and worse until it was too late. In blacks defence i think that 16...g6 and 17.Qc7 were very  nice defencive ideas but they simply didn't work.
In this game I will continue to use the d4 opening which has proven to be effective against most players here on GK, I want to thank eesther for the challenge, as he is undefeated to everyone here besides myself.
Black continues to develop Nf6
b5 played protected by pawn on a6 and c6. This also allows Black to develop his pieces on his Q side.
I now advance pawn  to c5 and have a fine wall of connected pawns. My other thought was to get castled quickly by developing my lsb.
I add another protector to my c5 pawn.
I decide to take here thinking to take is a mistake. By taking here I actually shift tempo to his favor I believe.
this simple move does the job to protect the loss of my R if I had left his attack of a skewer not stopped.
lsb is developed and now gives me a way to castle if I decide too. Right now I question if this is best place for my piece. My N is pinned and Bfd3 was my other move I had to choose from
I believe I said nice move after Ne4 was played. thinking I should have had my lsb on d3 here to take his N.
Ok I finally take his Q off the board  Qxa5
Why not axb3 offering exchange of Rooks
I decide to protect my c5 pawn by advancing b3 to b4.
I have to take Kxf2
Now I get to attack! Bh5+ I down in score -1 but my pieces are developed especially my R.
another attack!
K break the pin
I have to retreat my lsb.
knights before bishops... except i really want to keep this bishop on this diagonal, and black's knight on a5 ruins it.
i feel that this is a good square for my queen.  any thoughts?  attacking the bishop, and a g6 blunder allows Qxh6.  plus, nice parking spot until f7 is ready to go
open up the kings protection
taunting black's queen for a free pawn... i would love it to open up on the f file.
if Qxg2, Rg1 and pin the queen.  also, i can move Qg5! and fork the bishop, but need that pawn on d6 gone
i don't want black's rook active, so keeping that pawn on f5 on the f file is key.  also Qe6! is a good place, but I need black's queen off that diagonal because it's protecting the e5 and d6 squares which i intend to use.
i would black to take my rook
now it's a matting pattern from here on in.
...black is developing well..White is looking to set up a clamp position on the dark squares and push kingside...
..black gets in a good move to disrupt the queenside pawns...and will gain material as a result...
..with the knight in such a great position its just how the queen gets to the h file to deliver mate...
..interesting and reasonable move. exf ep or gxf5 allow Ne7 and possible defenses but ultimately Qxg5 will have to be played to save the game..<n>Rf3-h3 is also nasty..
Taking advantage of the weakness on b5 and in future d6.
" Prison cell" is complete. Now white's bishop helps to promote black's pawn.
This old-fashioned opening exposes White's Queen to Black's pieces. Black tends to gain an advantage in development as a result.
Developing the Knight to its natural square and gaining a tempo.
The Queen must retreat.
...allowing Swiderski time to develop another piece with tempo. White needs to develop and break the attack. 7 N-QB3 or 7 N-Q2 is in order.
Forking King and Queen. If 9 QxB, 9...N-Q6 ch forks the royalty again. If 9 KxB, 9...NxP ch ALSO forks the white royals! White does the honorable thing and resigns. He has been magnificently outplayed!
Hi everyone!<n><n>I missed a chance late on in the endgame to nail my opponent.  This was by means of a sacrifice, namely a backward pawn.  I did not consider the sacrifice because I was worried about giving my opponent a passed pawn so I completely dismissed the idea.  I should have looked a little further into it before doing this as I found out from Coach Ion in a post-match feedback.  I will start the commentary on move 6 since in this Tournament 5. Bxf7+ has been the popular move.
6. Bd5 - another fairly popular move keeping the bishop on the a2-g8 diagonal, although Michael does have the option of taking the bishop with his knight.
9. d4 - after a bit of pawn play on both sides I decided to close off the line of black's dsb.
10. ...... bxc6 - this is a recommended move in the gameknot world db - it does disrupt black's queenside pawns to compensate for giving up Fou Leblanc for the knight.
15. fxe3 - over the last few moves a plethora of exchanges occurs and both sides now have pawn islands.  My g5 knight is about to disappear and so is one pair of rooks.  I exchange the rooks because I want to cut down on Michael's attacking power on the kingside.
17. Qe1 - my pawn on e3 is very weak so is the one on e4, but never fear, Glenda the Defender is here!  I still need to develop my queen knight though.  However, black's threats delay this as I must escape Old Matey's shadow after 17. Bh3.
19. g3 - to defend against the threats on the g column but that lsb on h3 is a real nuisance.
20. ....... Qc5 - black eschews trading queens and there are possible threats of Rg4 to contend with.  Still, if Michael does play it then Glenda can go to f3 to defend.
22. Qxc7+ - Glenda can take a free pawn with check.  I dare not play exd5?? because the Witch can recapture and simultaneously threaten the knight on d2 and mate on g2.
24. Qf4 - alas Glenda must revert to some defensive work.  Now the h and g pawns are traded off.
26. b3 - this pawn moves to evade capture from the witch and remains on this square for the rest of the game.
28. ...... Qa1+ - spent about two or three days trying to ascertain the best place for Henry to go or whether I should block the check with my knight.  I did not like Kh2 because if that black rook could safely land on the h column then that lsb could unleash a devastating discovered check.  If I took the bishop then the Wicked Witch could land on h1 with a really nasty check and then Henry would walk straight into a mating net on the f or g columns.  In the end I decided that f2 was the best place because at least the g3 pawn would be doubly defended and I then found a way to screen off the Wicked Witch's power on my back rank.
31. Qd4 - time for some Witch Ejection, folks!  I offer a queen trade and my opponent accepts it.
31. Rc1 - necessary to prevent Michael from dominating the c column with his rook to devastating effect.  Black now forces an exchange of rooks.
37. g4?? - this is the move that throws away the win.  I thought that the f3 pawn could be potentially dangerous and my g pawn vulnerable to capture from the black king should Henry try and win the queenside pawns.  However, a post match pm from Coach Ion told me I had missed an opportunity by not sacrificing my backward b3 pawn and found a winning line for me, viz:- "37.b4 axb4 38.a5 Kd6 39.Kf5 Bh3+ 40.Kxf5 <n>From here, I reckon Black would have had to play very well to have held the draw!"
38. g5 - offering the exchange of pawns and a draw.  I saw that after the trade there was no way Henry could get through to the queenside.  If Henry tried to get through on the bottom half of the board, the lsb could cut him off via the b1-h7 diagonal.  If Henry tried to go over the top then the BK could cut him off by moving onto d6 or d7 hence the draw offer.  I could have played on as my opponent's rating was south of mine but as black I got canned by him in the MT and he has been on a roll lately with a draw against a certain Expert.  So I did expect him to find the correct defense.  Ah well, c'est la vie.  Time to study pawn breaks, methinks.  Anyhow, well played, Michael.
Don't you just love those beautiful combinations we see in an attack against the enemy king? In this game we see Isaac Boleslavsky go down with the white pieces against Anatoly Ufimtsev, where some good attacking play and even a nice queen sacrifice lead to some pretty fireworks!
Doubled pawns are usually a weakness, but in this case black hopes to benefit from the open g-file by eventually playing a rook to g8, especially if white castles kingside.
!The second surprise! If white takes the queen it's mate in three: 21.Bxb6? Rxg2  22.Kh1 Rxh2  23.Nxh2 Nxf2#! And if he tries to defend with 21.g3, black   can play a crushing 21...Nxg3 sacrifice: 22.hxg3 (22.Bxa6 Ne2  23.Kh1 Bxf3 mate.) 22...Rxg3  23.fxg3 Qxe3  24.Kh1 Qh6  25.Kg2 Rxg3  26.Kf2 Rg2 ! also leads to mate!
!! Fantastic! Though there's basically only one threat, there's nothing white can do about it. Again, taking the queen: 23.Bxa6 Rxg2  and 24...Rxh2  leads to mate while 23.f3 Qxe3  24.Kh1 Qh6 also leads to mate.
! Finally the bishop gets it's turn and white resigned. A magnificent performance by Anatoly Ufimtsev. (Dedicated to Reuben Fine: "Thanks for all the 'lessons'.")
Every chess player experiments with openings at sometime. We all search for the one opening that will give us a big advantage the majority of the time. Well, their ain't one! Once you learn that and play for equality and maybe a minimal advantage or initiative the sooner you'll move on to solid chess. I myself learnt that when playing the color black here. I was trying to hard to pull off swindles and turn the tide towards black's favor. <n><n>When learning an opening its important to understand its goals and purpose. The opening here is King's Gambit, Falkbeer Counter Gambit. <n><n>The Falkbeer is a hard opening to understand for lots of intermediate players. --- more on this after the opening moves.
King's Gambit. Whites usual goal here is to open up the f file for his rook after castling short. If he can exchange a center pawn of white's for the f pawn all the better.
The Falkbeer Counter Gambit. Black is gambiting a pawn, e5, for  positional advantages. He hopes to undermine the purpose of white's opening by not taking the f pawn and not allowing the file to be half open for white's rook.<n><n>He is offering (gambiting) his e pawn. Taking this pawn is considered unsound for white due to 3.....Qh4 and the old beginners type trap - 4.g3,  Qxe4ch  5. white blocks with Q, B or N on e2......QxR. The alternative for white being a king move and the loss of castling with a poor position.
The sound way to play against the Falkbeer. White will gain a tempo if Qxd5 and white plays Nc3. The black queen will have to move again.
This isn't the best move for black. Stronger is e4, advancing the center pawn and giving white problems to solve. The pawn can be supported by f5 and also Nf6. The pawn at e4 takes away Nf3, the usual and best placement of the knight.  If white plays the version of the King's gambit where this is a standard move then white is out of his comfort zone.
Gaining tempo (time) as black must move the Q again.
Defending the pawn.  A tactic here could be Nf3 ignoring the pawns safety. If Qxg2 then Rg1 gives white a strong attack on his Q side.  Another similar tactic is 7. d4 and now if Qxg2 then Bf3 again with open lines for a king side attack for white.
Instead black could of played Qh4. Yes this doesn't get you the rook due to the knight being on e2. After g3 black could play Bxg3 (if the knight wasn't there) and after h2xg3 the Q takes the rook. Maybe that's why white put the Knight there.  But moving Qh4 does force white to play g3 as Ng3 gets you the rook after BxNch. <n>g3 weakens the castled position of white if he was to castle this side. So its a prophylactic type move.
Anticipating 11. Bxb7, Q moves and BxR or 11. Bxb7, Qxf2ch, 12. Kxf2, Bxb7 trading a queen and pawn for a rook and bishop.
Developes a bishop fully. Fully in that it has an X-ray type attack, it can move in four directions next. Compared to the c8 bishop that is partially developed. Makes the queen move yet again. #8
Further controlling the center.
Not Nc6 due to d5 after.
Not wanting to exchange bishop for knight here. The two bishops side by side are a strong battery.
Moving to join the king side attack.
Not wanting Bxf6, gxf6 which opens up the castled position. Black's queen can't help due to the rook on f3.
Attacking the future dangerous pawn.  Notice how this move blocks black's queen from helping with king side defense if needed. The black queen can only move to a5 or c4 now.
Attacking twice at d5 but guarded twice, so no need to react here by guarding it more. Now white is able to do his plan.
Trying to force the knight away and its mate at g7.
Forcing the queen away. But she stays on the same file to keep pressure on the knight.
but white continues his plan. The knight is toast as it can't move due to mate after.
Here black has a somewhat saving move. She could of played Rxd4 which removes the mate threat. It looses material (5 for 3) for a deficit of 2 points.  cxd4 then allows the knight to move which keeps the castled position intact.
Also playable was Rd2 if Qxd2 then Qxf7ch, Kh8, Qxg7mate.
This move gives it to white. Better was moving the f rook sideways. White would still have the much better game. This allows a wholesale trade off of pieces and white comes out with a bishop up still. When down material don't trade off as you limit your options to pull off a swindle or a perpetual check to save the game.
Much better was: Bxg7, if Rxg7, Rxf8mate. If black plays other moves afer Bxg7 then Bd4 is discovered check and black has to play Rg7 then Qxg7 is mate also. Of course white could play Qxg2 after Bxg7 or other silly moves and still loose the game.
The moral of the story: Play an opening the way its meant to be. Here white was able to do that. Black did not play the gambit as it was meant to be played. Black wasted time playing around with her queen and when she was needed for defense, she was away.
Hi Everyone!<n><n>Ok, not quite the lady at Flambards but nevertheless, Cristiana certainly ended up as Lady Bountiful at the end of this game.  She was playing her mentor, Skorpio47 (aka Klaus) in a Walking the Walk and Learning to Run Welcome MT and she managed a Master Draw against him.  So, I want to learn from Cristiana's experience and just see how she did it.  This MT was a themed tournament called The Dutch Defense.  So, how did she do it?  Well read on......
5. ..... 0-0 Cristiana tucks away her king on the kingside.  Kingside castling on both sides seems to be thematic to the Dutch.
9. Qxe3 - and now there is a trade off.  Klaus has a choice, kingside or queenside castling - he defers it until move 14.
11. Rxh5 - meanwhile Klaus' heavies start to gather on the h file.  Can Cristiana muster a good enough defense before all three pile down on it or will Old Matey descend on h7?   We shall see.
16. ..... Nc7 - away from the rim!
19. ..... b6 - solid, but Cristiana must keep an eye on the h1-a8 diagonal because Klaus' bishop and Cristiana's rook are both on it!
21. ..... Bxf5 - Cristiana responds to the pawn trade by developing her bishop.  She must still keep an eye on her QR though!
29. ...... Nxc3+ - aha - there seems to be some method in the madness here?  Despite no BQ, will King Klaus cop Old Matey on the queenside?  Just look at that black dsb raking down the h8 - a1 column!
31. Qf1 - if BxR then Ne2 disc ch wins the WQ.
33. ..... Nxf2 - the crazy captures have not come to an end!
37. .... Re1 - the attack continues.  Now Rb1+ is threatened.  I think King Klaus is just beginning to shiver a bit.  Klaus prevents this check by c3.
41. Qg6 - now Klaus' queen tries to counter-attack.  Note that the rook on c7 cannot move off the second rank because Cristiana's king will cop Old Matey!
Paistab, et must on suutnud arenguprobleemid lahendada.
After a heavy defeat its hard to face ones demons but if we wish to improve face them we must. So two weeks after the game has finished I finally have got round to annotating it for the Walk the walk thread.
Having been an avid follower of the brigadecommander- stalhandske matches I expected 4.....c5 here with the Semi-Tarrasch Defence to the Queens Gambit Declined.
Played so that I didn't have to retreat the Bishop on f4
I'm out of my book now so my loss in only another 9 moves is particularly galling as in this position white looks to have equality at the least. Though I think my esteemed opponent would be happy with his position due to his piece activity.
11.Qa4 may have been much better here and after the game I found in the GK database a game played with this move. When I played 11.Bc4 I saw the Qa4 ch and wasn't too unhappy about the Q exchange. Interestingly both the GameKnot engine and Houdini 2 give my move as imprecise going from a +0.20 to a -0.10
12.Nd2 was also possible as 12....Bxg2 13.Rg1 Bb7 14.Bh6 Bf6 and now the move I missed 15.Bxg7. Having missed this I played 12.Qd2
13.Nxd2 was an option and may have been preferable. I didn't play it because of 13.....Bxg2 but like the previous note Bxg2 is weak.
Played to get rid of the weak pawn on b2 though again Ke2 getting the King of the exposed D-file was better.
A blunder.-1.88 GK.-1.06 Houdini2. Both give 17Rhd1 as better though I still lose the pawn.
A blunder that loses a piece.  Though with white about to drop his remaining Q-side pawn then having to face blacks Q-side passer it probably shortened my misery.
Zip to four and probably my worst performance against stalhandske. Food for thought and back to the drawing board. But once again well played by my opponent.
The pin on the knight can get annoying, but black has a variety of ways to respond.
I'm aiming for a setup that strong-points d5, protects the Nf6 with Nd7, and then the queen heads to a5, with a number of threats.  White plays the opening well, though.
The defining move of the Cambridge Springs variation.  Black threatens a number of strokes, including Bb4, winning a pawn, and dxc4, discovering an attack on the Bg5.
The best two moves to defend everything.  Notice that dxc4 by black is met by Bxf6 for white, and black gains nothing.
Now white is playing for a buildup of forces aimed at black's kingside, and so I start to get defensive.
A strong recapture, hitting the queen and threatening to sink in to d6.
Missing that white can play Nd6, but something had to be done to get the light-squared bishop active!
So I decide to regroup on the kingside and try to get some fireworks happening there.
Finally, a chance to get the bishop involved.  If I can get it exchanged for white's good one, I'll be a lot happier.
Mission accomplished.  Now white can't win a pawn with Nxb5, but flanders has plans to build up pressure on it...
I figure that now's a good time to build up my pressure on the kingside -- I notice that white's back rank is weak with the second rook out of there.
This was the best complication I could find, made possible by Ng6 the move before.
I wondered if dxe4 was better, but then I realized how weak white's back rank is (black's is weak too)... if 27. dxe4, then Rd1 is strong for black!
... and now I get my passed pawn.  White can respond Qxf5, but after the exchange of queens black plays Rxd4 with a big advantage!  I'm pretty happy with the outcome of all of this, although I'd be lying if I said I had planned it all this way.
And now white pushes his pawn, which has the added bonus of preventing black from playing c3.
Behind the passed pawn is the place to be.  Now, I have to address the threat to the pawn on c4, and notice also that the g7 pawn is pinned.  So after a think, I decided on...
Qe2; probably the best move.  While it doesn't support the advance of c4, it prevents the Rf1 from moving into action, since any move leads to Qe1  and mate to follow on the back rank.
...whereas white is free to push his pawn.  Still, the idea in the last note gave me a new idea, especially since he didn't play something defensive like g3 or h3.  Notice that the Re8 cuts off all of the white king's flight squares, and his back rank is weak.  So, with the idea of forcing a mate on the back rank, I play...
Rab8!?  This is a threat that must be addressed, although there are many good ways to do it; the safest being Qd1.  But white overlooked my threat, and played:
d7?  Threatening to take the rook on e8, to promote to a queen, and give white an overwhelming advantage.  There's just one oversight...
!!  Sacrificing my queen *on purpose* for the very first time on gameknot!  After 32. Kxf1 Rb1  33. Qd1 Rxd1# is checkmate!  <n><n>Thanks to flanders for a good game and the chance to do something amazing!  Hope you enjoyed it, too.
!? risky move, because if white succeeded in blockading the pawn, this bishop would become very passive
After Bf5 it will be easy for black to take the g5 pawn..
This game was from the 4th round of the 78th Gameknot tournament, and myself and my opponent were the favourites for  winning the round. Our other game was a draw and so this result in effect decided the round. This game started quietly but  quickly got very complicated. I more or less fall into the complications, which were hard to calculate and required accurate moves from both sides. And as always, some luck always helps :-)
There's not much to say about the opening moves I played except they are not particularly ambitious..
solidifying the knight in it's aggressive post. The drawback is that it weakens white's kingside
My opponent has delayed castling to attack me  so my plan is to attack while the king is still in the centre and I have the better development. If I wait his extra space advantage and attacking pieces could become a problem
? This tactic doesn't work if he simply plays Qd4 then I am lost. He attacks my knight, protects his c4 bishop and still threatens Ng6+ winning the exchange. I can't defend against all of these threats. Funny how a slight innacuracy can be the turning point on the game.
This seems strong, two of my pieces are attacked, he is protecting c3 and it looks like I must lose material but luckily for me there is an only move and I find it
! This protects the knight and protects against the Ng6 move which was the move he keeps trying to get in. But why can't he take now on b4?
I saw that If he plays cxb4 then I play  Qxb4+ Kf1  Nd2+ Kf2 Nxc4 getting the piece back with a strong attack. My opponent also saw this and played g4, which attacks my bishop but he gives me have a forcing move
the king is on the move and this gives me the tempo to save my bishop
the forcing move, white's position looks really uncomfortable now and this is another tempo to save my white square bishop this time
I have saved my pieces and have the better position  but I am being driven back and white has some resources, mainly due to his aggressive knight and bishop
attacking the knight. I had to choose between Nd6 and Nf6. I liked the fact that Nd6 attacked the Bishop which was causing me some problems.
moving the least active piece into play and creating a new pin
I was threatening to take the g4 pawn taking advantage of the knight pin
Playing safe, but I could have played Nxf5! Nxf5 Bxf5 Qxf5 Rxe5! White's queen cannot move off the f file because I have a mate threat on f1. Qf4 Re6! is powerful because I am threatening Rf6 with a skewer and if Bxf6 fe Qxf8 Kxf8 I am material up and still threatening mate on f2. But this is a computer line that I didn't see in the game, but could have found if I looked for the forcing move Nxf5
! Iit helps if you look first for the most forcing moves before anything else. This move forces the queen back and starts a combination based on the weakness of e2 and black's strength down the e file
or Qg3#. I think that I definitely had some luck in the middlegame when my opponent missed an accurate move which would give a strong advantage to white, but on the whole I think I came up with a good plan, taking advantage of white's attacking play and pawn moves to open the centre and play against the white king position. It was probably the most tactical game I had played on gameknot up to them and an enjoyable one, moving straight from a dull looking opening to a very exciting battle.
Hi everyone!  I thought I would talk to you about chess blunders.  Don't we all get that horrid sinking feeling when we have made a blunder.  Well, thankfully it was my opponent that blundered.  I got into my usual jstevens1 type position and the disease passivitis struck again - incredibly my 1700+ opponent failed to take full advantage and later on he made a serious oversight which brought about instant resignation - well less talk - more action.  After getting used to the Sicilian Defense I find myself fronted with the French.
1...... e6 - voila!  This is the French Defense.  The purpose of this move is to support d5.  If pawns are exchanged on d5 you get the Exchange Variation where black has a pawn controlling e4 and c4.
11. Bd3 - over the last few moves - development.  I am unable to castle kingside however due to the presence of the Wicked Witch of the West on c5 controlling g8.  As it turns out, Henry is safe where he is.
15. Kxf2 - after a bit of expansion on the queenside the queens are exchanged.  There are a few surprises in this quiet position and for me, not very pleasant.  I am about to cede control of the c file.
19....... Rc3 - nasty, nasty, the pawn on a3 is hanging so my rook has to go back to a1.  In retrospect my king rook should have gone to c1 instead of my queen rook.
29. g3 - after Fou Leblanc sacrifices himself for that pestilent horsie I play g3 to dodge the attack of black's long range light square bishop on b7.  My own horsie is about to be put in a really nasty pin.
32. a4?! - a speculative pawn sac to try and break up black's queenside pawns.  Black ignores the a pawn and forces an exchange of pawns on e5.
36. Ra3 - I decided to initiate the exchange of pawns myself and to counter-attack with my rook down the newly opened a file threatening a skewer on a7.  Black moves his king to d6 so that if Ra7, Kc7.  I now play my knight to c3 and wait for it ........
37....... Kc6?? - now!  The rook on d1 is en prise!  My horsie says thank you very much.  I had to wait 2 or 3 days for my opponent to come on line again.  It was worth waiting for because I bagged 9 lucky points!  To date in my 1700-1800 mini-tourney I have 7 points out of 9 games.
Nf6 is a pretty strong move for black in the Queen's Pawn opening.  Bb4 forces white to move Pc3, which white wants to do anyway, and then black must withdraw.  The upshot is that white develops his position while black moves the same piece a couple of times.
?  It is generally a bad idea to move the king at this time, except to castle.  Now the rooks are confined to the edges of the board.  It will take many moves to align them on center files.
Here obviously QxPa2.  This way the queen can protect d2, as in Bd2 forks the white queen and c rook.
Unless white moves the rook here.  Sweet deal!  Out of the frying pan, into the fire.  Pb4+ gives black the rook.
A solid way for white to proceed. In this opening, white is advised not to move the c pawn. This is very counterintuitive (c4 looks soooo tempting!), but in fact it just helps black in developement, with accurate play (and at club levels). White has Bb5+ as his more aggressive try, and I fear it a little. f6 would be my response.
My still-not-completely-sure-why-it-is-not-defendable favourit. Here, the answer I kind of fear most is Bb5+. If any minor piece interposes, dxe6 is a proper "dark hole". So c6 must be the answer, and... it's another story. I test my opponents here: if they don't play Bb5+, they either don't know the opening, or they are going for slow, routine, passive play. I will catch those... ;-)
Very passive, but not necessarily bad move. Here, black can go for the "hard" line Qe7, threatening Bc4 or Bg4 playing with the pin on the lsb. But white can get out of it if careful.
This is a more positional approach. It 1) restricts the b5 threat, 2) opens the way for the BQ to b6 or c7 - her's optimal square. Bc5 instead allows d4 with tempo, but I think it's playable (my B will go to b4, exchange the N, and then, with Ne4 attacking c3 I'll have won some games. The key of my attack is to align Bd6 and Qc7 on white's castled K. But I can wait for the white's d pawn to be moved to play Bd6, and in the meantime I try to get the most of my tempoes. I also know that Ng5 or Bg5 will become an annoyance I have to be aware all the time. And I know I'll castle queenside and that I will launch a pawn's storm on g. This is what I'll say if I'll see this position, because I play it a lot. Of course, it must have some problem, somewhere. I just wonder how high the rate must be in order to meet it.
Normal, and I can't prevent it.
I'm not trying to stop d4. I assume it will be played. Then I'll decide where to play the dsb, not before.
This is necessary. You can delay it, but if you do, white will play Ng5 and threat NxBe6, forcing me to react to it. And I have no good way to do it. If Nf5 white has a strong attack after Re1 or Bh5.
As planned, I grab the diagonal and I prevent white's lsb to go f4. I've also played it and I survived, but I think this is the right move to do here for black.
With this move white gives up any possibility to take advantage of the e coulmn for a long time, and he leaves to me what I prevented from him with h6: Ng4. Of course, it will leave d5 exposed.
Not a great plan: g4, and I assure a g open column, while ready to castle Q side and bring another R into the battlefield. Normal was to castle Qside first. But this just screams white your intentions, and give him a tempo more to organize his game. This leaves less time to him. My K is near to be exposed, but not for some moves. I'll use these.
This is anoher typical mistake. White's counterattack is too slow. White thinks he can defend the Kside, and go for a slow counterattack. He waits me to move the Nf6 elsewhere in order to play d5. Seen this way, his "dull" attack on a can be a treat: come and fall for it, you'll be greeted with a winner.
Here it comes. Now, This opens up my Q side and compromises my K's safety, but white is still a little far from occupy the e column, and maybe I can save the castling tempo in favour of crushing operations on white's Kside.
This has the downside that the f colum becomes open and occupied. But it leaves a very weak pawn in e3 and g3 with no defence. Just the kind of game white could have played against me if I'd not played h6.
Slam! This was my bet. If gxB, Rg8+ should begin a very strong attack. And Rg8 is coming anyway. Suddenly white feels his weaknesses and realized he was too overconfident.
My K is still in the center, and o-o-o won't be a safe move anymore, but white is in no position to take advantage of it, and the important thing is to control d5 an b5.
White still has to find something to delay Rg8.
Second attempt, and probably the best one, given the circunstances. It threats d6 with check, and if Be5, NxB and then the nasty check will be played all the same, with a darkest fate for me. I found again the right move, I think. (But the correct defence for white goes Rf2, Bf1. Of course, White is also threatening here Nf2.)
White doesn't have the check anymore, and also Nf2 (best's white?) will be met by Bxg2 and Rg8. Novices please note: Bh2, the "wow" move everyone always wants to play, was NOT my winner smash (please correct me if I'm wrong!) and I only "pressured" white with it, not intending to actually play it (except as a threat white had to met).
This opens key square for white pieces, and I have to be careful. For instance, if I go for castling o-o-o (usually a good move, and here I'll threat a discovered attack on the WQ after my d7 N moves... is not the best plan! I have the Nd7 as the brave guard of my K's safety, an he is where he must be. I have to go on with the attack instead, and prevent Rg1.
Nf2 was his best move, in my opinion.
Throwing the towel. Now, dear reader... which one is the right piece to take with? Allowing the powerful Q in (Qxg3) or the weaker R (Rxg3)? Of course, h3 is the real target...
Was I right? Now Rxh3 is threatened, and h2 is attacked by both my Q and R. If I take with the Q, it will be not. I'll win with Qg2#. Now, has white a move to avoid all of it?
Here, Rf2 and I was not sure about my winning chances. I think I'd go for Qe5, not falling in o-o-o, Bh3+, Kb8, Rf4, blocking my Q's action instead of defending h2...
Unfortunately, my opponent didn't give me the chance to prove my mastery. Just like in the Usa Open this night.
we arrived to an old position in king's gambit accepted. <n>h4 is often played. <n>this position is not played nowadays as it gives poor chances for black to win, even to draw
a good move ! white sacrifies a piece to open the f column and gain time.
here white are not obliged to take immediatly. i think Rxf7 was better
Ke7 was better to control f6, f7 and f8
black have a lot of work to develop.  black king must find rapidly a square to be secured.
black plan is to give the c7 square to their king, d7 to the bishop and c6 to the "b" Knight, and to finally coordinate rooks
an error. white 2nd attack is not prepared. white needed to play a3 to put a second rook in action.
taking c5 isolates pawn e4 and let black to take with b6, it also gives the e5 square to black. <n>protecting the pawn with c3 was better.
a strange move. why did the white want to exchange an active piece and give the pair of bishop ? Raf1 was definitly more frightening
a passive move. i was expecing Rf1. this gives the chance to black to achieve their development
black want to enter in a winning final
it was my birthday, i was 44 !
And a beautiful discovered attack wins black the queen. At this point black resigns.<n><n>Note that this opening is fairly dangerous to play because it allows white to develop much quicker than black. However, it is a fun little opening that basically wins you the game when it works!
Von Kolisch resigns. Anderssen threatens 17... PxP dis ch 18 K-R1 Q-N7 mate. If von Kolisch tries 17 PxP Anderssen has 17... RxP ch, leaving von Kolisch the choice of losing his Q [18 QxR QxQ] or his K [18 K-R1 Q-n7 mate.]
Black lsb early outcome is not to worry me.
This is kind of wise. I had may doubts about how to retake. gxf was too early - he can easily castle Qside - exf3 gets me control of e4, but allows e5 from black.
e5 control is of primary importance if I want to control black's developement. True is that now I can't play e4.
If e5 is now allowable, let's get the B on a good diagonal. Very good, this guy knows how to play.
Now e5 is a threat, and I don't want to go for the "exchange all" line e5.
Now e5 will set a discovered attack on black's Q. Let's see if he dares.
Space grabbing, and weakening. I already see an e5 to come, with threat on h7. How to force it?
Preparing c5. I can't distract defending, or I'll lose my attack chance.
Again, three ways to retake. With the R, it wins a move in doubling R and defends g4. Nx threatened the sac Ng6 (fxN, e5 and wins). Bxh4 threatened BxN, BxB, e5.
? Probably the worst.
? I can't give his N a post on e4!
He can't use the N to take it so easily.
I have no mate in h7: I have to think about tomorrow. Too bad for my attack: I can retake it later.
...and the black N can't retire or Rxg5+. I was kind of proud of having spotted the combination in a blitz!
...with another idea in mind. Let's see if he falls for it.
Normal manouvering. I plan to play my B to e4, and break in b7.
...and from here, despite my R, I was not able to win.
This game was no easy win for me!  The middlegame got very complicated and I very nearly got Glenda trapped.  Luckily I managed to force a queen trade later on which gradually turned the tide in my favour.  Finally we ended up in a K & P ending where even though I was a pawn up I had to avoid one last trick from Bob - I pull out a hidden talent from my sleeve, the joblock!  This finally forced Bob's resignation on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.
19. ........... Qf5 - and Glenda still cannot get away from defending pawns!  This time she is called for the defense of the h5 square.
30. .......... g4 - now I try and put the squeeze on.  Are the Expert lessons starting to take some effect?
45. ......... Kg6 - I must get Henry in on the action, here he covers quite a few defensive squares to avoid an enemy rook invasion.  Bob now chooses a move which allows more simplification in my favour.
47. ........ Kxg5 - and now if you are a pawn up in a K & P ending you are virtually on a home run, but there are still a few things to watch out for before the game is sewn up!
49. Kg2 - best move, now comes some pawn play leading to putting Bob in a zugzwang.
Adding support to d4 and allowing the knight to come to f4.
I don't want to trade queens since black is cramped and I have better attack chances.
Maintaining the bishops pressure on the diagonal.
Kicking the knight back and freeing up my ls bishop.
My plan is to play g4 at some point so I'm opening the g1 square for my rook.
Creating the possibility of a knight sac on g6 and putting pressure on e6.
! pressures e6 and defends against blacks threat of Nb3.
I'm sure this was unexpected on my part but starts to open up blacks king side.  I'm not sure this is the best move but I felt Bxf8 Rxf8 Nxg7 Qxg7 and black is holding on.
Black resigns.  fxg6 is going to be hard to deal with.
The black are now a bishop and a pawn up!
Using the fact that the black can't play g5 now.
Too passive. Maybe it was time to give some material back trying to diffuse white's attack.
39... B:f6 would lose even faster:<n><n>40.N:f6+ N:f6<n>41. Rg5+ Kf8<n>42.Qh8+ with a checkmate to follow.
Last touch. The white attacks the f7 pawn and the knight on a5.
preparing the bishop to take part in the game
here i was waiting him to get my knight (d4)
This move seems dubious to me: black may have some problems with giving my g2 bishop targets to attack, and also with his lag in development, as happened in the game.
Black was threatening to win a pawn after b4.
As black, I would prefer Qc7 here. Be7 is bad due to e5! Bxg2 10. exf6 Bxf1 11. fxe7 Qxe7 12. Kxf1
! The start of a long combination which does not seem to win any material against best defence, but gives me a good attack and keeps black too busy to castle.<n>Black has two choices: Bxg2 as in the game, and 11 ... Nd5 12. Bxe7 Qxe7 13. Nxd5 Bxd5 (exd5 14. Nf5) 14. Bxd5 exd5 15. Nf5! and black is in trouble.
The key move! <n>Now 13 ... fxe6 14. Qh5  Kf8 15. Bh6  Kg8 16. Qg4  Kf7 17. Qg7  Ke8 18. Qxh8  B(N)f8 19. Kxg2 wins a piece for white.
Kd8 had the disadvantage of occupying an important retreat square for the queen, and after 15. Kxg2 fxg5 16. Nd5! b4 17. axb4 Qb5 18. Ra5 Qb7 19. Kg1 white wins a pawn in a good position.<n>(One last time and I'll quit bugging you:) What would you play here as white? (See next move annotation, I didn't play the winning move)
The best variation was 15. Bh6! Bxf1 16. Nd5! with all sorts of crazy threats, including knight checkmates and queen traps. <n>Ex: 15 ... Bc4?? 16. Ne6 ! Ke8 17. Ndc7 ! Qxc7 18. Nxc7  and Nxa8<n>Fritz gives black's best 15 ... Rc8 16. Qg4 as 5.5 points up for white, even though temporarily black is up a rook!
Tough choice to make. Taking the bishop corrects black's pawn structure, but I believe the knight is a more dangerous piece, and after Kxg7 16. Be3 Ne5 17. Nd5 black survives with his horrible pawns until the endgame.
Seems like resignation to me. Black still could try to come up with some resilient defence, perhaps Ra7 or even Qxe7.<n>20 ... Ng6 21. Rxd6 Qc7 also seems sensible.
An opening with which I am unfamiliar, though I plan to research it more in future as I'm getting a little bored of 1. e4, e5.
Not having dealt with this opening before I elect to play this rather than my usual Nc3, looking to restrict the early pawn movement.
The computer says this was a poor move and I agree, however I was looking to see what agression would to to such a defensive-seeming postion.
While it may have appeared sensible to give the rook freer movement all this move really does is give up the g-pawn and unleashed nasty pressure on the king.
Even when you are agressive early on, one should not neglect to continue developing pieces. Any immediate attempt to continue pressure on the king risks turning successful early pressure into an all-in attack which could easily fail.
Looking to get the king out of trouble with a queenside castle.
Offering the exchange to undouble his pawns.
Snapping up the loose pawn and reminding my opponent of the Queen's presence.
The hoped-for reaction allowing me to snaffle another pawn and set up shop on the a2-g8 diagonal.
Looking to pin the Queen against the king with Be6 and seal the game.
?? The final blunder. I presume my opponent was looking to threaten my king with rook and Queen but even ignoring the fork at e6 this effort would be foiled by h3 forcing Black to spend more time extricating his Queen and allowing Qxe7 to increase my lead yet further. Kb8 or Qe8 would have forced me to accept an even exchange or to retreat and try a new angle.
Black resigns. While this game was hardly a masterpiece of skill I hope any newer players can see the pitfalls of overreaching and underanalysing which it demonstrates. In particular consider the possible results of 5. ... Ng4 which would have led to a Black advantage and a far longer game and the truly fatal blunder of 7. ... Be7 which turned a lost exchange into a lost game.<n><n>The more bull-headed players (or those wishing to test the long-term implications of the carnage amongst Black's pawns) might also consider the ramifications of 14. ... Qe8 or Kb8 as an object lesson in the strength of pawns as the game rolls on but I imagine most of you who examine these annotations are well aware of that!
0-0!? a Tal-move. Gambiting the center pawn. For compensation Tal hopes to attack down the e-file.
Kasparov decides to decline this and attack Tal's bishop instead. Of course if you accept a Tal sacrifice you will probably run into quite some trouble in the game.
Tal decides to surrender his bishop pair. He wouldn't be better of playing for example 6. Ba4 b5 7.Bb3 c4 anyways. and retreating to d3 or e2 looses tempo.
Draging the knight away from the center and blocking his Light squared bishop. I think the point of kasparovs move is because if he takes with the bishop he will run into e5 in the future or perhaps immideately.
black contests the d5 and the f5 squares and prepearing to develop his Bishop to e7 and castle.
centralizing his rook and supporting the e-pawn.
Alright kasparov finally decides to take the pawn on d4.
Tal Retreats his bishop. and now another in-between-move.
The point is that kasparov wants to get rid of the f-pawn. He wants to make a hole on e5 to take advantage of.
Tal decides to exchange the knight.
Pawn takes bishop. Black gets a double isolated h-pawn. Kasparov perhaps hopes to play Rg8 soon,putting pressure on Tal.
Tal wanted to delay any pressure against himself. And get rid of the double e-pawn.
Hence after Bxd6 even more pressure gets added on Tal's king. Kasparov threatens to play h3,Bxh2,Rg8 and Tal has to do something. And he did. Try to see what move Tal found before scrolling down.
Tal had probably this position on his board,on his preperations. This was the point of this knight sacrifice. And now suddenly out of nowhere (unfortunately!) kasparov lost on time. He probably spend time thinking on how to react to this knight sacrifice. I would have been very pleased to see how this game would have gone if Kasparov didn't loose on time. Maybe Ne6+ comes on the right moment? who knows. So this was a nice last game by Tal. He opened with his favorite e4 and managed to make a sacrifice against kasparov. gg.
I wanted to show how the kings gambit provides lots of tactical play for both sides. If you are interested in perfect chess, then this is probably not for you, as this game has mistakes from both sides and the kings gambit is probably not safest opening for white either.<n>I do not normally play Birds opening, this game game is part of a mini tournament that has the opening moves f4 e5 (Froms Gambit).
Ok, I admit this probably not the best move, there were two reasons for it. Firstly I wanted to avoid a potential pin happening for my knight going to c3, secondly I wanted to avoid the queen check on e4.
I was not sure what my opponent was trying to achieve here, I saw it as a wasted tempo, which in the kings gambit is the last thing one should be doing.
Another wasted tempo by black, I also was not sure about the intent of this move.
A computer will show that this move is not a good move. The best move would have been h3 and the queen must move to e6, if she moves to g6, then she will end up getting trapped. My reasoning behind this move was to that if black played g5, then there would not be many squares for the black queen to move to leading to a fork or queen trap.
There was always one annoying square the the black queen could escape to.
A passive move, If one plays the Kings gambit one can hardly afford to play passively. I played it because I did not like Nb4, I wanted to keep my light squared bishop for action on the black king side.
Time wise the game was relatively quick, the most time spent thinking was on this move. White can now no longer afford any passive move anymore, Black has a pawn phalanx marching straight toward the king, backed by a queen and a rook. White on the other hand has a rook targeting the pinned bishop, with good central pawns. My initial thought was that Black has the better attack and I should defend, but this being a kings gambit game and because I was a pawn down I decided to throw caution in to the wind.
The only move, the knight on f5 will threaten the queen and the pinned bishop.
Not a good idea for white to take this pawn ;)
Another bad move by me, Re1 would have maintained the pin, saved my rook and black would still have to lost a piece.
Now the pin on the bishop faces an even greater threat.
If the black queen tries to protect the bishop, then Bg5 will create bigger problems for black.
Will trade back my rook I lost for a minor piece earlier. The computer shows that this move leads to an about equal game, Nb5 would have given white a much better advantage and keeps up the pressure.
I was convinced that black would play Qxg2 here, leading to an equal game.
A big mistake by black, this loses the game, the queen and rook on the e file are way too deadly. I assume that black expected Q x Q, d X Q, going to a drawn endgame.
The problem is that after the checks run out the queen will have to go back and defend the bishop.
And now the Black queen finally has nowhere to run.<n> I will not comment on the rest of the game. Both sides made mistakes, but hopefully it show how the kings gambit provides both sides lots of tactical playing opportunity and that kings gambit games are not often boring.
The Torre attack (Tartakower variation). Here is a note from Wikipedia as its introduction: White pursues quick and harmonious development, will bolster his d4-pawn by c2-c3, then often enforces e2-e4 to obtain attacking chances on the kingside as the Torre Bishop pins the f6-knight. If White plays an early c4, the opening will transpose to a number of more common queen pawn openings, such as the Queen's Gambit or one of the various Indian defences. The opening is named after the Mexican grandmaster Carlos Torre Repetto, who beat former World Champion Emanuel Lasker with it. The variation was also employed by Savielly Tartakower, Boris Spassky, and Tigran Petrosian early in his career. Among top-level players it perhaps has been most utilized by Jan Timman, Alexey Dreev, and Pentala Harikrishna. The Torre Attack is rarely met in modern top-flight play as a "Go to or Primary" system, and statistics suggest that it is not particularly advantageous for White. Due to its calm nature and relative lack of theory, however, it is popular at club level, giving White chances to seize a middlegame initiative. In recent years it has also been used against Black's kingside fianchetto pawn structure.
Alternative variation: 3... Ne4 4. Bf4 c5 [leads to Trompovsky attack (A45) type position, with the difference that  now White doesn't have f3 to harrash and dislodge the knight from e4, which is now already protected by the d5 pawn.]
Gains another tempo on this bishop.
Couldn't resist the chance to get a half-open c-file in my Sicilian like set-up<n>Alternative variation: 10... c4 11. a3 b5 [is probably better for Black.]
Why exchange the bishop for a knight now?<n>Alternative variation: [Better was] 13. Rfe1
No apparent reason to un-develop this bishop.
Now White overlooks the chance to immediately remove the weak and isolated queen's pawn, instead plays
Blackmar Deimler Gambit. I decide to present an opening that has both risk and opportunity, offering chances for tactics.
Black declines the gambit and makes clearance for developing the bishop. It appears to be a fairly solid approach to the opening.
Transposing into a French Advanced position which will slow the g8 knight down by taking away the f6 square. Black suffers the usual problems inherent to the French, the bad bishop, and in this case the retarded knight.
Continued development of pieces. The knight is developed with the idea of forming an attack on the kingside after the opponent has castled there.
Black continues to develop pieces, not making the commital 0-0 and possibly hinting at 0-0-0.
Improving the position by removing the pin on the knight and opening up the queenside more for a possible 0-0-0.
The knight is developed out in an attempt to gain activity. This move causes the bishop at d2 to be pulling double duty protection of c3 and f4. The threat is 8...Bxc3 9. bxc3 which leaves the pawns in disarray. The bishop must maintain protection of f4.
Black appears to be looking at 0-0-0 and adds protection to the bishop at b4.
A forking attack on queen and bishop.
Black while possibly seeing the fork threat of 12.Nxc7&#43, overlooks the threat to the queen by 12.Nxe7&#43 - the turning point of the game.
White has a considerable material advantage and strives to apply the most direct technique for a win.
With the idea of using both rooks to attack on the kingside.
With the idea of removing the defender of f4.
Possibly wanting 15.Ne3 to post the knight, but the move is a tempo behind.
Applying the theory of exchanging while materially ahead and reducing the material on the kingside to clear a path to attack the king.
Attacking a2, but the threat is minimal due to 18...Bxa2 19.b3! and the bishop is lost after 20.Kb2 Bxb3 21.Kxb3.
Attempting to crack open the castle.
The queen moves to a point of safety that also limits any knight moves to b4, e3 and f4, while also maintaining protection at h6.
Driving back the pieces using pawns. The idea is to sweep the pieces away from the center using the strong mass of central pawns.
The queen begins manuevers to reach g7.
At a casual glance, the position looks dead drawn, and it is indeed hard to believe that anyone could win such a position against a world-class grandmaster such as Polugaevsky. However, this is one of the reasons why I have selected it for inclusion in the present book. Quite apart from Larsen's superb handling of the ending, especially in the latter phase, the game is instructive in demonstrating that even apparently drawish positions can be won, with only the smallest error from the opponent, if one has the determination to try. In the first instance, the latter is the key. If one asks "How does one win such a position against a strong opponent?", the first stage of the answer is "By not agreeing a draw!" .<n>In playing on, White does have a couple of small straws, from which to weave his basket. Firstly, the black bishop on h7 is currently shut out of play by the white e4-pawn and will take some time to emerge into play. Secondly, White has a space advantage, thanks to his pawns on e4 and f4.
With this move, White commences a plan of going after the black h-pawn.
30 ..Kf7 would keep the enemy bishop out of f8, but White could strengthen his position by means of 31. Be2 with the idea of transferring the bishop to c4 and threatening f4-f5. Black's position would be rather passive and still somewhat uncomfortable.
Now the h-pawn is potentially vulnerable to a later white king march to h4.
Black continues to use the weakness of f4, to tie White down and hamper his attempts to make progress.
37 ...Bd4+ 38. Kxd4 Kd6 was the alternative, when White retains some pressure after 39 e5+ fxe5+ 40. fxe5+ Kc7 41. Be4. <n>Polugaevsky prefers to retain the dark-squared bishops, believing that it will be harder for White to penetrate the black position with both bishops on the board.
Now the exchange would be less dangerous for Black, since after 41. Bxd6 Kxd6 42. Kd4 e5+ it is White who<n>has weaknesses on the dark squares.
With the light-squared bishops having come off, Black still has some worries over his h 5-pawn, which can prove vulnerable after Kg3-h4. The position should still be drawn, but Black has problems to solve.
Polugaevsky puts his faith in counterattack. Passive defence by 48 ...Kf7 49. Bg5 Bc5 should also be adequate to draw. It is worth noting that the game had been adjourned around move 41, so Polugaevsky was now following his home analysis. The fact that Larsen still managed to win the position, even after<n>his opponent had been able to analyse it at home, is a remarkable tribute to his endgame technique, and, in particular, his ability to continue to find ways to pose the maximum problems for Black.
This natural move proves to be the decisive mistake, although it takes some superbly subtle play by Larsen to prove this. Polugaevsky later claimed that 53 ...Kf3 ! would have drawn, preventing the white king from coming back to help fight against the f-pawn.
54 ...Be3? 55. Bxa5 f3 56. Kg3 wins easily. This simple variation illustrates a key point about the ending - Black's f-pawn looks very dangerous, but is only so if the black king can reach the square e2. All the while the white pawn remains on c2, the only route for the king is the square e3, which White is able to patrol effectively with his bishop.
This is the point. Now 56. ...f2 is not dangerous because of 57. Kg2 and after S7. ...f1Q+ 58. Kxf1 Bxh4 59. Bxa5 White wins easily.
Since he is unable to support the further advance of his e-pawn, the black king returns to perform defensive<n>duties in stopping the white h-pawn.
Preparing to advance the h-pawn, without allowing ... 􀀿g s. All previous annotators of this ending, including both of the players, have assumed that Black was lost after his 53rd move, and that Larsen's play was a flawless demonstration of that fact. However, although the first part of the statement is true, the second is not. In view of the note to Black's 62nd move, Larsen's last has to be considered a serious mistake, which should cost the win. Instead, 58 b4! wins, by setting up a second passed rook's pawn. After 58. ...axb4 (58 ...Bxb4? 59. Bxb4 axb4 60. Kg3! wins at once) 59 h5! (59 a5? b3!) Black simply cannot cope with both passed pawns, e.g. 59. ...Kg5 (59. ...Bd2 60. Kg3 Ke4 61. Kf2 also wins) 60. Bb6<n>c5 61. a5 c4 62. a6 b3 63. a7 b2 64. a8Q b1Q 65. Qd5+ forces mate.
The black king has finally gained access to the square e3, but it is now too late, as the following variation shows: 59. ..Ke3 60. Bc5+ Ke2 (or 60. ...Kd2 61. h6 Kxc2 62. Bd4 and the h-pawn promotes) 61. h6 f2 62. Bxf2 Bxf2 63 h7 Bd4.<n>Now there follows the decisive break 64. b4! axb4 65. a5 and the bishop cannot stop both passed pawns, e.g. 65. ...Kd2 66. a6 Kxc2 67. a7 Bxa7 68. h8Q b3 69. Qh7+ Kc1 70. Qxa7 b2 71. Qc5+ and White wins in standard fashion, by forcing the black king i n front of the b-pawn and then bringing his own king closer.
The bishop returns just in time, to close off the e3-square once again. In the meantime, the white h-pawn has advanced one rank closer to promotion.
62 ..Ke3! is the way to draw. Both Larsen (in the Danish magazine Skakbladet 1966 pp 77-79) and Polugaevsky (in his Preface to the Russian edition of Larsen's best games collection, and in Grandmaster Preparation) dismiss this, on account of 63 Bg7, when the e3- square is again denied to the black king, and the h-pawn threatens to advance. Larsen adds the moves 63. ...Bd4 64. h6 winning for White.  However, the merciless computer points out that 63 ...Bc5! (or 63. ...Bb6!) renews the threat of 64. ...Ke3, and leaves White with nothing better than a repetition of moves after 64. Bh6 (64. Bf6? Ke3 65.<n>Bh4 Bd4 is also not winning for White; indeed, he may well be losing) 64 ...Be3 etc. This possibility only came to light during the preparation of this book, and, as far as I am aware, it has not previously been pointed out anywhere else.<n>After the text move, Black is definitively lost.
Black will finally win the white bishop for his e-pawn, but it is too late, because the two passed rooks' pawns<n>will be too much for Black's own bishop.
A lovely final touch. White brings his king into contact with the f3-pawn, with gain of tempo. Instead, all of<n>White's subtle play hitherto would come to naught after 66. Bh4? Bg5 67. Bg3 Bf4 with a draw.
And here it is. If Black's bishop moves, it allows one of the white pawns to advance, whilst the black<n>king has no waiting moves that do not lose the f-pawn.
Now that the black pawn has been lured to c5, closing the a7-g1 diagonal, Black's bishop cannot stop the a-pawn after 71 ...Bxh6 72 a5 .
probably the safest way to go... after Be6, Qxb7, things might get out of hand soon...
Re8 was to be preferred... and why not b5?
greed before the fall... better keep Nf4 as a threat, and play Kf6, Rd2, b5...
water under the bridge; better Nf4, gxh6+, Kxh6, Nxf7+, Nxf7, Bxf7, Rd7... at this time, I warned my opponent for my soon free g-pawn...
now, it will cost an expensive tempo...
probably better Kf6, to keep the rook unoccupied...
locking in the other rook, better first Nb5 to build up a threat...
it is always hard, to admit you made a useless move and spoiled a tempo; best is of course back to Ra8, since Nb5 leads to nothing after Nc4... Rh2, Nxe6+ leads to trouble; but what follows, is even worse...
simple, yet very effective; blacks' position is breaking up on e6, while covering d4 in the process... sadly enough, after this black went in full Guru Mode: 3 days thinking, 1 free weekend day, postponed for 4 days, another free weekend day, and thought some more... where people get the time for this, boggles me...
at last the prodigal b5... after b4, black has a chance to make the a-rook count again... but it is all too late...
after Kg8, f5, after Kf7, Nc5...
gradually taking up more free space; whites' connected free pawns are starting to roll, and both black rooks are displaced... meanwhile on the white board, the King is ready to travel to f4, and maybe g5...
best was Ra2, Re2 (b3 is no good here), Rh3... now, white is gaining an extra tempo to reach f4...
by now, blacks' position is already very suspect; suddenly, with the help of sacrificing some useless pawns, white has set the board on fire... odd as it may seem, best here is Rxf3+, Kxf3, Nb5 to create some real counter play... Nc4, Rg6+, Kh8, Ne4!, Rxf3+, Kxf3, Nd2+, Nxd2, Rxd2, Rd6 will get out of hand much faster with Kf3-f4-g5...
by now Nc7, Rg6+, Kf8 and regroup, was much to prefer... black chooses to keep picking off useless pawns that ran their course a long time ago...
this leads straight to mate... tougher would have been Kh7, Ne4, Rh6, and try and haul in the other rook...
Kh6 means sudden death after Rh8 and mate... Kxf6, Ne4+/Ncd7+, Kg7, Re7+, leads to similar variations...
White's formal positional advantage is clear enough, and consists of the split black queenside pawns. However, with opposite-coloured bishops on the board, it is hard to believe that this advantage should prove sufficient for a win. In the absence of the rooks, there would of course be no winning chances at all, but with two pairs of rooks on the board, the drawing tendency of the opposite bishops is greatly reduced. Andersson gives a veritable tour de force of technique.
Black is seeking to establish counterplay on the kingside by ...g7-g5, so White takes prophylactic measures<n>against this. The text threatens to trap the enemy bishop after 26. e4, thus inducing the reply.
An interesting choice. On the principle of "two weaknesses", White would normally try to keep the kingside open, so as to have the possibility of infiltrating with his king. However, this would mean his pieces being tied to the defence of the pawn on f3. Instead, Andersson closes the kingside, but thereby frees his hands to concentrate on the queenside weaknesses. His plan now is to transfer his king over to defend the b4-pawn, and then attack the a-pawn with all his might, bringing his rooks to a6 and a5, and placing the bishop on the g1-a7 diagonal.
As always, Andersson is in no hurry. Before the king can leave e3, he needs to ensure that Black has no dangerous discoveries with his bishop from d5 (e.g. 33. Kd2? Ba2), so Andersson removes his last piece from a white square.
White now wishes to get his rook on d2 to a5, which involves playing the king to a3, moving the bishop to e3 or d4, and then playing Rc2-c5-a5. With Black devoid of counterplay, White has time to execute such a manoeuvre.
Getting another pawn off a light square and securing the post d4 for the bishop.
Once again, a typical Andersson touch. There is nothing wrong with the immediate 48 Rca5, but nor is there any hurry to play this move. Consequently, Andersson just improves his king, by bringing it to the more central square c3. It has done its job on a3, by clearing the c-file for the rook to come to c5; now the king returns to a more central position.
Black finally wearies of shuffling his rook to and fro along the seventh rank, and instead forces the exchange of a pair of rooks, but it is too late to make any difference.
Now he loses c6, but there was no defence anyway. White will just capture on a7 with the bishop, maintain<n>his grip, and gradually advance the a-pawn.
I started this game because I was bored and wanted to play someone a couple days after joining the "Southern Chess". Why not play a teammate? I looked for someone near my rank, and voila! here we are. I'm actually annotating this on my 22nd move.<n><n>Ah, my standard opening.
This is the something Moria Gambit... I have no clue about official names, but I'm told he's to take the pawn... <_<
Drop it like it's hot (hot)<n>drop it like it's hot (hot)<n>And when a b--ch gets an- oh, sorry, I really don't have much to say about this schtuff.<n>I figured a favorable pin was in store since I was feeling a threat in the middle, so i figured that snatching a pawn or knight for a pawn was very good. Especially the bishop, since it wasn't protected.
And I have to make the nessesary sacrifice...
I forget my original reasoning for this move... I think it was to keep the queen off d5 because of my next move...
he's probably plotting to force my knight away and get himself a pair of pawns for one of his own. well, either that, or he wants me to blow a move moving my knight back to defend that pesky pawn there on d4
but, alas, it was not to be!
Apparently, he doesn't see me lining up the knight in my sights with my bishop...
smart move. It locks off my pawn from causing further discord amoungst the Black Forces.
time to pump up the defense. You can do eet, little guy! Scare black into submission!
to free up the pawn, y'see. I'm not a big fan of castle-ing (I cant spell >.<)
giving up his knight for a pot-shot at my bishops and knight... GENIUS! :P
I accept his attack on my bishop humbly. I was out manuvered this day... BUT I SHALL WIN THIS WAR!!
There's the set-up for Nf7
This Game is pretty much over. See? I was right that the whole not giving the King an escape hatch was a bad idea... not enough mobility for the king. It allows me to force out a series of moves leading to checkmate. looking back, Nf7 was his only chance to throw off the mating sequence, but would've thrown away his queen.
Next moves were:<n>28. ...        Qxd6<n>29. Qxd6  Kg8<n>30. Rxe8#<n><n>Thanks for the Game, CW! It was fun! (Oh, And the Boss is/was telling me that my annotations were a little harsh to you and that I have an asswhooping coming my way via him. Message me if there's anything you want me to add/remove, m'kay?)
Initiating an attack.
8... NxN??? falls at once to 9 QxB!! P-B3 10 BxP!! PxN 11 B-B7 mate.
To guard the KBP.
Adding force to the attack. If the Knight captures either piece White mates on the move.
To create a flight square.
Black can lose quickly or slowly. 11... N-Q2 12 BxN ch QxB 13 Q-B4 loses slowly for Black. White's advantage of a piece gives him a technically easy win.
In this game I was 12 minutes late, as I couldn't find the venue and then had problems parking. I was playing for Penyffordd against Formby, at The Conservative Club, Wallasey. Typical of damn Tories!<n>In this game, I seem to be cruising to an easy win, but, perhaps suffering from what Alexander Kotov describes as "Dizziness due to success", my concentration lapses and I missed a clever tactic which would have given him a slightly better ending. Thankfully he misses it too. See if you can find it!<n>Anywya, he opens with Nf3, The Reti. I invite a transposition to either the Sicilian Defence, with 2. e4 or an English with 2. c4
I am aiming for a reversed King's Indian Defence, but if I play 3....d5 then he may play 4. d4 and a reversed Gruenfeld. The Gruenfeld is a sharper opening than the King's Indian Defence and the extra tempo is more use to White.
Normally one would expect f6 first, to prevent N(f3)-g5, but his knight on d7 has blocked the influence of his Bc1 on the g5 square. Interestingly I cannot find this Bishop move on any of the opening databases, but I can't believe it can really be bad.
I was pleased that he decided on e4 rather than c4. If he had played c4, I would have been tempted to exchange, as after N(g8) to either f6 or e7 he can play Ng5. Also I didn't really fancy the sharp lines of the Benoni or Benko Gambit reversed after 7. c4 d5.
After 8. Nc4 he really can play Ng5 again, so I stop it with f6. So now he can exchange on d6, but hey, what of it. The Bd6 is my bad bishop, blocked in by pawns, I don't mind exchanging it! Now my Be3, that is another question, I am going to hang on to that. I could have doubled his pawns with Be3xNc4 here, but it would have been a huge mistake to give up my good bishop, just to double his pawns.
I wanted to stop his knight coming in to f5, although in some positions it is worthwhile for White to give up the pawn with N(h4)-f5, in order to open the long diagonal for his bishop on g2.
So now I retreat the Bd6, to prevent him from exchanging on d6. Now he should continue with f5, continuing his king's side play. I thought a4, preventing b5 was quite a sound move too. Instead he increases pressure on e5
So I immediately reduce the number of pieces he has attacking e5. I want to always have enough pieces to recapture in e5 with a knight or bishop, rather than the pawn.
So I cement my queen side space advantage. Black stands slightly better. White's plan should be to continue advancing on the king side with f5, but instead he makes a big mistake.
e5 is just such a lovely square for a knight or bishop, unable to be driven away by any White pawn.
White now has a little tactic. He can get rid of his bad bishop on g2 with 15. Bh3! If Bxh3 16. Qh5! regains the Bishop. Instead he seeks to exchange my other bishop.
I had a choice of moving the Knight to g6 or c6. The advantages of having it on g6 is that White no longer has the queen check on h5 and in some variations I may be able to play my knight to h4. The disadvantage is that in some variations I would like to play g7-g5 to force the hand of his Bishop on f4. On balance g6 is better.
White seeks to bring his knight into play via d2 and maybe f3. I finally get round to castling!
I up the pressure on f4, preventing his from playing an immediate Nf3.
So he protects f4 again. Now with his queen and Rf1 tied down to the protection of f4, it is time to open another front!
It may have been better for White to play the queen to g3 and then have the option of recapturing on d3 with the queen, rather than the pawn.
Black still has pressure on f4, which will make it hard for White to contest the c file.
As I had seen - but after I had moved Qd5, 26. f5! would have given White a good game. The points being is the White would love to play Nf6+ and either fork my king or queen, or win my queen with a discovered attack on my queen with his queen. Now for that to work either my protection of f6 by my rook on f8 has to be broken, or my bishop's protection of my queen needs be ended. So I cannot retreat my bishop to f7 because of the former, nor to d7 because of the latter. Likewise I cannot safely take on f5 without losing my queen. So I would have had to lose my bishop for a pawn, and with Knight v 3 pawns, White would have a slightly better ending.
White now resigns, as after 28. Nxg5, Rxf4 29. Nxe6 he is an exchange and 2 pawns down. Thanks for reading my annotation, please leave a comment and rate my annotation. Many thanks!
not 12...Nxd4?.13.Qa4+ and black loses a piece . and if 12...Nb4.13.Bb5+-Nc6.14.d5 and black loses apiece .
there is no choise for black, if 18...Rc2.19.Nd4! with Qxh7.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Another loss - sigh - I was unable to repeat my epic feat against Master Renniemay and add to my Master Draw tally.  Never mind, I have done it once and could do it again, that is my mantra.  Here I am faced with another Lopez and this time Maria puts her bishop on a4 instead of exchanging on c6.
7. ...... d6 - still following the main line - note - I have learned my lesson not to play Na5?? at this juncture in order to exchange N for B as it drops the e5 pawn.
16. Qb1 - Maria now takes me out of the book.  I decided to take on d4.  In retrospect, maybe I should have first taken on f3 before that exchange on d4.  At least I would not have had to contend with two horsies in my arc.  One horsie is a handful, two, well they are a double handful!
17. ...... Rc8 - I decided to nab the c file.
18. ...... Qb6 - trying to expand on the queenside but things are about to change.
28. Qxd5!! - This move is really, really nasty and the end result will result in me being 6 points down on material with no counterplay against a Master with a rating of nearly 2300!  It was too much so I waved the white flag.  Can you the jury spot the sequence of moves that will lead to such a catastrophe for black?  Anyhow, I hope this will provide a useful lesson to the Coaching Club on tactics, of which I am still trying to improve mine by doing the puzzles - it could be a while - however before I feel the benefits of it, but I do have patience in abundance and the strength to persevere - cheers and bye for now - Joanne
The black queen is aimlessly wandering and dodging!
Black is now open to the white queens wrath! It's only a matter of time......before she strikes.
Black attempts to distract white, but....
Black with a desperate effort to take a piece. He then takes white's bishop and gives his knight up.
force the king to move
now the pressure raises
Hi everyone!<n><n>You have been used to seeing Glenda in a defensive role but occasionally she can be a menace.  In this game it looked at one stage as though black had an advantage, but one erroneous knight move caused Glenda to unleash her wrath on my unfortunate opponent.  How does this come about?  Well, here goes.  Firstly we have a double king pawn opening and we pick up the action again on black's second move.
5. ........ dxe5 - over the last few moves we have had an exchange of pawns and a trade of B for N.  I now decided to put Fou Leblanc on c4.
7. Qb3 - more aggressive than exchanging queens methinks, Glenda has her beady eye on the squares b7 and f7.
11. Be3 - got my rooks connected and I am prepared to exchange Fou Lenoir for the black knight if he hops on d4.
11. ...... Na5 - but he hops onto a4 instead.  I must now hide Glenda on a2 and bid farewell to Fou Leblanc, tears.  At least I get rid of that pesky knight in return though!
14. Nd5! - this move attacks the Wicked Witch of the West and threatens a nasty fork on c7.  The best square for the Witch is d6 but then he will be faced with a move such as Rad1 threatening a discovered attack on the Witch by Nf6+ which could be very nasty for black.
15. Qxc6+ - now, black has only one legal move, that is Qd7.  Glenda will then whip off the rook with Qxa1+.  He can only block the check.  Glenda can give her life for the Wicked Witch and that will then leave black a rook and a knight in arrears with counterplay virtually snuffed out.  My opponent acknowledged this and waved the white flag.  Hope you enjoyed this little brevity.
I learned in an earlier game that Black has to play this capture or White gets a strong attack.
Similarly White has to recapture or the Black pawn becomes too powerful.
This active move threatens White's isolani on d3 and also threatens to win a piece on e6.  I don't think I got this move in in our return game and consequently 8ballphoenix maintained his N on e6 for most of the game, eventually mating me on the queenside.
Black cleverly avoids the mating net on the queenside by returning to the centre.  Now the white knight has to move.
I think this was the right swap, as it removes Black's most active piece and lures the king out again.  Swapping the Bg7 would not have freed the b-pawn from its pin as the Q would have recaptured.
Black continues to swap at every opportunity, increasing the likelihood of making his Queen tell as the game progresses.
Both sides have three pawn islands and both sides have rooks still on their starting positions.  Black's King is marginally more exposed but he has the advantage of Q to 2 Bs.  Black must be favourite at this point.
A somewhat mysterious looking move.  It recentralises the Q (but behind the K) and gives the Rh8 room to move in case White attacks it with Bd4.  If White had achieved that exchange the material balance would just about have been restored.
The weakness provoked, the rook's work on the b-file was done, so it refocused on K and Q.  The immediate plan was to advance the d-pawn as quickly as possible.
Black releases the pin and develops his rook.  With the last piece developed the opening is over!  In reality we've been embroiled in middle-game tactics and strategic considerations since about move 7.
White seizes the chance to win the exchange.
The alternative was 24...e6, which would have made that square the target for White's pressure.  By offering up the Rc8, Black hopes to get rid of White's bishop pair.  The single black-squared prelate should be much less meddlesome.
White doesn't give up his bishop pair yet, establishing a tight hold on the position.
Finally White condescends to win the exchange.
but now Black's Q is mobile so Black may actually have the advantage.
Black covers the escape square and prepares a mate threat with ...Qb7 or ...Qc6
The defensive move also prepares doubling on either d-file or f-file.  If the rooks work effectively together they can outplay a Q.
Black has to give up the exchange
Black returns his Q to a5, whence he attacks the weak pawns on a3 and c3.  White can't defend both with one move, so he has to look for alternative active plans.
?! First of all an offer to swap the Rooks for the Queen, when Black's more central King might be the winning difference but it would probably be drawn.
White pursues Black's King, hoping to get into a mating pattern.  He has to be careful not to leave the Rd8 en prise too long though!
Black avoids repeating moves and further checks...
White connects his Rooks again, still hoping to trap Black's King on the edge of the board but there are too many pawns around for Black to hide behind.
Black seizes the opportunity to snaffle the a-pawn.  Now his plan should simply be to advance his own a-pawn to promotion.  Interestingly, at the peaceful conclusion, 14 moves later, this pawn still hadn't moved.
White hopes to either trap the K or sweep up Black's second rank pawns.  The c-pawn can go hang!
White's checks have run out, so he captures the e-pawn.  Now it's Black's turn to deliver some checks and try to trap White's King.  White has helpfully driven Black's King into proximity, so Black has mating potential.
The net closes.  If White doesn't find the correct defence it could be mate in 2.
and Black finally offered a draw, gratefully accepted as White has no obviously strong moves and has the remote a-pawn to worry about.
Returning the quality, and exposign myself to an attack on the c column and the black diagonal. If he uses it, I'm lost.
Instead of Nc3, I decided to advance my pawns.  My aim was to create a strong pawn presence in the center and attack early, as this was meant to be a quick game, hence the game title.
With my king in safety and my pieces in the center, I mount my attack.
Clearing the center before the fireworks.
At this point, it took my opponent five days to make his next move because he wanted to finish his other winnable games to make his rating go up.  I've done that many times before.  But he had 30+ games at once.  I don't have a site membership, so I can't play that many.
Black Resigns.  If he stays on the Kingside, there will be blood.
Steinitz takes the opportunity to gain a tempo.
Adding more support to the powerful KP.
Steinitz adds further support to the KP, which Selman is trying to attack.
Trying to gain some space on the Q-side.
With this exchange, Steinitz creates an open QB file. If he can plant a Rook on it, it can be a potential invasion route.
Driving the Bishop off the diagonal.
Knights belong in the center! Now the horse pressures Selman's KP and controls several useful squares.
Selman, cramped in the center, is trying to gain space on both wings to ease his position.
Attacking the B and threatening to plant the Knight on QB6.
Doubling on the file and threatening to invade.
Threatening B-R4, attacking the Rook. Selman would then lose material, as if the Rook moves the Knight would fall.
Selman is now forced to trade Queens in order to avoid material loss.
Now the Rook can move safely, neutralizing the threat of B-R4.
Hoping to trade his Knight for Steinitz's Bishop in return for losing his KP.
Risky to open up the kingside so early; 3. Nc3 is the normal continuation.
Black did not wish to take the rook at this point, and has other ideas in mind. Actually, the knight becomes very useful later on, as we soon shall see.
Now, 16. fxg4?? will lead suddenly to 16...Qf2+ 17. Kd1 Qxf1#....
Merely threatens to win a piece, but there is more to it than that....
The Stonewall Attack- I've only studied this and the Sicilian Dragon openings thoroughly, and that's simply because they were both featured in Reinfeld and Horowitz's "How to Think Ahead in Chess".  I like the Stonewall because you can follow your script pretty much disregarding what black is doing, and also because I've got a decent grasp on what I'm supposed to do during the midgame.  However, this game shows how cramped white's queenside pieces can be with the Stonewall.
One of the characteristic moves of the Stonewall, and a good one at that.  I'm in good position, particularly in the center, but I don't know what to do with black's soon-to-be fianchetto'ed position.  My usual plans call for a subsequent Bd3 and then sacrificing the bishop at h7, but since that's out of the question I should have worked to further control the center and to develop my queen's knight.
This seemed a bit unnecessary, especially since black could either walk into a very temporary pin with his knight or attempt to trade off my good bishop.  In this setup, my good bishop is good, but my bad bishop is very bad.
I said to myself, "I need to develop my queen's knight and protect my bishop".  However, as everyone knows, knights don't like being on the edge of the board, and my bishop can be easily run off with pawns.  Developing the knight to d2 and then f3 would have been better.
Black wisely declined to take the e5 pawn with his queen (it wasn't going anywhere) and got his knight in a strong position while freeing his bishop to take the e5 pawn and link up with the queen on the long diagonal.
I'm in big trouble, and probably should have resigned at this point. 13. h3 gets me 13...Bxh3 14. gxh3...Bh2  or 13....Bh2 .  Moving to g2 puts the g pawn under attack by the knight, the bishop, and the queen.  I figured I would just put some pressure on black's f7 on the outside chance of 13....R(f8)d8?.
I lost this game with positional errors more than tactical ones, and with fine play by my opponent.  I should have kept the center locked up and secured for myself instead of trying to develop everyone to go on the attack at once.
I'm not sure why white is pushing his rook pawns. 6. ... Bg5 might have been fun, but the knight is well protected. He could simply play 7. c3 to banish my knight from d4, then play h3 to drive off my bishop. Adn the previous 5. a3 eludes me.
This seemed like a good idea at the time. It doubles my pawns on the e-file, but it opens my rook on the f-file. Later it proves to be my undoing.
Afraid that if 10. ... Be7 or 10. ... Bb6 then 11. b5 drives off my knight and allows 12. Nxe5.
My plan was to play Qf6 and Ra-f1 to put lots of pressure down the f-file.
I really just want to exchange everything and try to end up maintaining my pawn majority. Probably a forlorn hope.
To defend the sad, lonely little e pawn.
Forking the queen and the pawn on h3, even though I knew I wouldn't win that pawn at the cost of my rook, I was hoping to get some kind of counterattack going, even if it had to lose steam while I save my rook.
And I pick the worst possible move for the rook. I truly didn't see the fork coming. I only blame the fact that I was moving quickly, practically speed chess, while I was playing a video game at the same time - not a wise decision if I wanted to keep my winning streak alive... My opponent, however, was paying perfect attention to this game and showed me no mercy at all.
Rf1 offered mate in 1. I really should have played g3 and let white win the exchange, but ultimately, that would have probably been fatal too after he saved his h3 pawn and finished his assault on e5, I most likely would have been down a pawn and the exchange. But at least there might have been hope for a comeback, or at least finding a way to draw.
And now I lose the pawn at g7 and then my rook at f6. Definitely not my finest hour. After 26. Qxg7  Rf7, 27. Nxf7 Qxf7 white still has a good attack on the pawn on e5 and now he has a decisive material advantage and a pair of supported passed pawns on the g & h files.
4...d5 was a bit of surprise, as 4...c5 or b6 is more common.  In black playing ...d5 here, I can take advantage of 5.a3 and then force a trade or retreat of the black bishop.  If the former, I can un-double my c-pawns at some stage with cd5 and then transpose into a favourable Samisch variation.
Ne4 was a further surprise, as it is not clear what this achieves.  The black Knight does take up a fine outpost, but at this stage I was happy to ignore it and just develop with Qc2.  The idea being that I wanted to concentrate my efforts on e4, with a view to at some stage playing f3, and then e4.  Qc2 also has the advantage that it prevents black taking on c4 as the Knight is en prise.
7...Qg5.  Again, this seemed a little premature.  I do have to be a little careful here as if I play 8.f3 straight away then I get the rather nasty 9...Qh4  in response.  If I try and play 10.g3, then black simply responds with 10...Nxg3 and I'm in all sorts of trouble.
So instead I opt for 8.Nh3.  This gains a tempo whilst also leaving the option of f3 available at a later stage.  The more natural 8.Nf3 blocks the pawn advance.
11...Nxd5.  Capturing with the Knight means that I don't even now have to play f3 - I can play e4 straight away and then force the black Knight to move yet again.  A feature of this game is the number of times black pieces are repeatedly moved to the neglect of black's overall development.
14.f4 looks like a quiet move, but there is a serious threat of 15.Be2 winning the black queen.  My opponent realises this and now tries to do something to free up his position.
One of a number of options.  Probably better was 14...Qh5, when 15.Be2 is met by 15...Ng4, 16. Qd1, 16....f5.  White stands well due to the pinned g4 Knight and has much the better placed pieces.  Here, 14...e5 effectively conceded the centre and forces black to move his f6 Knight yet again!
This again looks like a quiet and pretty unnatural move.  The white rook is opening itself up to a discovered attack via the black bishop, and it didn't really seem that worthwhile trying to hang on to the e5 pawn.  I was still hoping that I could spring my 18...Be2 trap which would win black's queen.
Probably the best move.  Black looks to be getting back into the game, as the awkwardly placed rook on f5 is under attack black can then trade off one of white's ishops with his knight.
A useful resource.  This move creates a discovered attack on the black knight and threatens 19.exf7 , ruining black's attempt to castle.
19. Nf2.  Here I had a number of options, the most obvious being 19.Qxd3.  However, having played 18.e6, I now saw a way of surprising the black King (see move 20).  By playing 19.Nf2, I wanted to attack black's Queen and at the same time set a trap should black play 19...Nxf2.  If black plays 19...Qh5 (the only square), then white has a very dangerous discovered attack when he moves his bishop from g5.  One possible line is 19...Qh5, 20. exf7 , and if the black King moves to d8 or f8, the white can win the black Queen with the discovered attack referred to above.  The alternative move 20...Kd7, allows white to play 21.Qxd3 with check and a crushing attack.  Perhaps seeing this, black chose 19.Nxf2 instead.
Now the black King is out in the open and white's Queen is coming to join the attack.  Black's Queen on the other hand has been on g4 since move 13!
The nail in the coffin.  This now leads to a quick mate.  The alternative 21...Kd7 continues: 22.Qd4 , 22...Ke6, 23. Qe5 , 23...Kd7, 24.Qe7  .
...and I became nervous.
Now, what I want is to castle queenside, and spent some time analyzing it. <n>o-o-o, Kxf7, BxB, KxRd1, Bxa2 , Kh1 (looking to grab my bishop after g3), Kg4! (threatening Kxf2), but after Qe2 or Qf3, what? His knight can escape taking e6, making my position very weak (and trheatening my queen). <n>If Qe2, Kd8-f6? Qe6 , for instance. <n>If after o-o-o, Kxf7, BxB, KxRd8, Bxh2 , Kh1, Rf8 (instead that RxK), Kxe6, Kg4, KxQ, Kxf2 , KxBh2, KxQ, c2xKd3, KxKc7, I am a rook under!<n>If after o-o-o, Kxf7, BxB, KxRd8, Bxh2 , Kh1, RxKd8, g3, Kg4, and white can easily defend f2 with the queen, the rook and the c3 knight, so... I will eventually lose my bishop. For instance: Rf1 (but not Qe2, because of Bxg3, and if f2xBg3, Qxg3 and I have a playable game with a quality less but two free pawns and the white king very exposed. Anyway, if Qe2, Bxg3, QxKg4, Bxf7, Rxe6, and it looks no good at all for black), Rf8, Qe2 or Ke4 and the black attack vanishes, even after Rf6, QxKg4, Rh6, Qxg7... nothing to do. <n><n>So I had to wait.
Yeah, this is what I sweared I wouldn't do in this scheme. The idea is to castle queenside, hold the attack against my king and be ready for a countergame, mainly on the black diagonal aiming to a2. But, with this move, I found no compensation with o-o-o, Qxg2, KxKe5, d4xe5, and the bishop has to retire to c5 or b4, then he has one precious time to defend Rd8-g8, Qmoves, Rg6, Qmoves, Rh8-g8, and my main attack line, the black diagonal, is closed.
It is more importan to block the white knignt's advance, and of course I wouldn' give him two chained pawns in the center.
Ok, the natural one, Ra-d8, just holds. But I wanted to advance my c pawn so to free my pieces, and I had to prevent Kb5 after c5.
Aiming to double the attack over my king.
I realized later I should have taken it with the queen, since my threat over the diagonal is based on the bishop.
Just looking for a piece exchange in order to slow down the pressure.
I was really frightened, here. I had to wait, resourceless, and wait to see what attack line he would chose.
Ah, THIS one. Ok, but it gives some chances to me, also!
The only one. If f4xe5, Qc6, and after defending the rook (that would be blocked), my knight can escape, and I have some threats (R1-e3 ((or R1-f1), Kd5!, Rd3, Kf5! Re3!, Kg6 and I can hold on, among others).
...and off the database.
?  NxR+!  A good idea is to program it.
I guess it is still passes--and the rook is out of the way--and the pawn is ahead.  And it supports the other pawns.  Yeah, this was better.
White will want to move Nd5 to take the pawn.  Black can defend with Nc5 then Nd3.  Nc7 also works, temporarily.
But not that.  Black could also run the g pawn, tying up white's rook.
c3 is a very interesting move, I used to play it myself a bit because it was in the first opening book I ever read.  Igor Nikolayev, the strongest player in Rochester, also plays the move.
This is a pretty useful way to counter c3 and it's a good move in similar situations.  Since white is trying to set up both his pawns in the center, black tries to break them up.  Also, white doesn't have the option of chasing the queen with exd5, Qxd5 and Nc3 because the pawn is in the way.
I'm not so sure about this move, it seems to allow black to get at least an equal position.  I believe the most challenging move for black is Bb5, pinning my knight.  Then if black plays dxe4 white plays Nxe5 and has some threats.  I think that black has ways to fight through it in that case as well, but it's much more tricky.  Also, white is side with the initiative, which is a nicer position to be in.
I thought these moves were pretty much forced, now it seems like black's pawn on e4 is easier to defend than white's on e5.  Also, white has given up the right to castle and his king is on the open d-file.  Even though the queens have been traded, we're still in a middlegame so having a safer king is good for black.
I thought about various ways to go after e5, but I like this move.  I know that I'm going to have to play it sooner or later, so I may as well defend the pawn now.  By playing the defensive move first it gives me freedom to go on the offense later.  They call this prophylaxis and it's a pretty useful chess idea.
It's not easy to defend the e-pawn, but I think this is a mistake.  I get to trade off my weak pawn and we're left in a situation where you just have a weakness without much compensation.<n><n>One idea would be to play Nc4, which defends the pawn for a little bit at least.  I could chase it away with b5, but then maybe Na5 and trying to counter attack on the queen side.  You probably will lose the e-pawn, but at least you will have counter-play.<n><n>Another idea would be to play e6.  Then if I want to take that pawn I need to play fxe6.  At that point I would be up a pawn, but my pawns would be doubled and both would be weaknesses.<n><n>The general idea here is if you are going to be in a worse position, you want to at least have some sort of counter-chances.  One thing that I'm still learning now by looking at grandmaster games, is how they will almost always choose this.
Some more prophylaxis.  I want to play O-O-O, but I was afraid of Bxa7, then if I try b6, you have Ba6+.
I liked this move, since it stops my plan of O-O-O.  But the downside is that the bishop is going to be attacked if I play Nxe5.  This makes it a good time for Bg4.  I think I could have played it last move or even before that, but now it has a pretty strong effect.
I think you definitely wanted to stop Nd3.  Having 2 bishops is usually considered better than a knight and bishop, especially in a position like this that's pretty wide open, not blocked up with pawns.  The bishops coordinate vary well together and give you some compensation for being down a pawn.  With that in mind, maybe Rd1 was the best move.
I like this move, although I'm not sure if you played it for the reason I thought.  I thought you were going to play h5 and h6 if possible to try to exchange your pawn for mine.  My pawns on the kingside have less weaknesses than yours, so it makes sense for you to try to trade.
Here I was thinking either h5 or Rg1 and if I play g6 then h5.  I was probably going to play Bf8 and play h6 after you played h5.  I thought that created the least amount of weaknesses on the kingside.
I think this is a mistake and after this I was winning.  I couldn't see a way for you to stop my king from getting very active and making too many threats for you to handle.<n><n>I think you had to play axb5.  If I take back with the a pawn, then you can keep your rook on the d-file and it's hard for me to get my king to a good spot.  I probably would have tried moving my rook to the a-file and getting it active that way, but I couldn't see exactly how it would turn out.  If I take with my king, then you can play Ra1 and we are in a similar situation as the game, but my pawns are much more weak.  Again, it would be hard to move my king without loosing the a6 pawn.
This allows a pin that seals the game, but if Bc1 I play Re1 and was going to go for Rf1+, Rxf4 and probably win the h-pawn as well.
All in all a good game and you definitely surprised me with how strong you played.  If I had one piece of advice it would be to try to play actively when you get in a tough position.  It's tempting to try to stay solid and protect everything, but that often leads to a situation where the other person is able to slowly increase their advantage.  Sometimes it works, but I think usually it's best to try to get counter-chances.  At the least, if you go down, you go down swinging :)
An odd move, black's obviously going for the check on h4. Sure, it stops me from castling, but i think this line gives white too much of a free hand. Most common (and better) are 3..d6 3..d5 and 3..g5
I could stop the check with 4.h4, but i decide to go for a no-nonsense aproach with Bc4; developing the bishop to its best square, and by threatening to castle, i'm provoking black into continuing with his 'plan'.
i could've taken on h4, but i decide that the bishop on h4 would have to move again wasting another tempo for black.
The knight doesn't look good on h6, but its the only place it can go without leaving the bishop on h4 hanging. Better would've been d6.
If black doesn't want the centre then i'll be too happy to take it for him, in doing so I gain a tempo in threatening to take on f4.
Another Bishop move!
7.h4 would kick the bishop around further and thus allowing me to take on f4. But Nc3 seems the more natural move.
Regaining my invested pawn with another gain of tempo in attacking c7 (and the Rook on a8)
Gaining yet another tempo, boy, is that Knight on h6 looking silly now.
The only challenging move (but still not a good one), taking on h6 would now be a mistake for white since after black takes on d5 he also attacks the bishop on c4 leaving black to sweep up the bishop on h6.
Threatening mate and the Knight, the point of the sacrafice.
A horrific mistake, the loosing move allowing a mate in one. ...Qg6 and black would've survived to fight another day, but even then it still looks bad as white has a substantial lead in development and a pawn to the good. But anything's better than this.
An enjoyable game for me, in which two dodgey moves by black in the opening give white a free hand and an initiative. My efforts crowned by a brilliant combination based on the Nf6 sac.
I LOVE to copy.
I pinned his pawn to the king.
Black gets a Slav-type pawn in, and I start pondering his development chances on the queenside. I'm thinking he is going to have to spend some time to establish well positioned pieces, so I'm content to just keep developing although I have no real plan as of yet.
!? My brain begins hurting. No way am I going to help him develop by taking, and I can live with the position should he instigate. I really did think 10...Nf6 was coming.
Justifying my Qd2, and attempting to trade a decent bishop for a strong bishop.
?! In post game analysis, my opponent shared his thoughts with me that he was anticipating a pawn storm, and wanted to back up his pawn defenders with his strongest piece. While a valid concern, IMHO it seemed a little slow, and was just begging to be punished. I'm really digging my position now, as I'm ripped and ready with great activity while my opponent stills lags in development.
I go ahead and start attacking in earnest before black gets a chance to get caught up in development.
Black sees the g file opening up in the near future, and makes a pre-emptive defensive move.
?! Seeking to establish a long term presence deep in black's camp. It was only after I made the move did I realize that 17...Ne4 gives me a whole slew of headaches.
! Nice move - while having somewhat limited options, black picks a winner. The d file is now his, and after about 5 minutes of thinking, I pretty much gave up on even attempting to even make a play for it.
I get my rook lift in.....
....but my headache continues. Black now gets his misplaced knight into the mix while exerting a ton of influence in the center of the board.
! I've been contemplating eliminating that bishop for the last 6 moves, and now my opportunity is lost. Black trades two minors for a rook, which usually sounds good, but he also picks up my e pawn, and the dominos start falling.
? Still trying to bring more ammo into the fight before I go nuts and try something crazy. And speaking of crazy, I don't even SEE my f pawn falling like this. I feel physically ill.
! Has anyone seen my attack? It was here a minute ago.......
I considered this knight going to g3 then f5 with some aggressive intent, but then realized that I REALLY need to remove at least one of his rooks asap as I was scared to death of them working together against me. To do that, 32. Nc3 covers d1 (as well as my Nf3 covering e1). Now I just have to be careful and avoid a back row mate, as I see that I can easily step out of the check that I know is coming.
Absolutely. If nothing else, I have to make some retreating moves to defend. Black gains tempo and an appreciation for superior clock management skill.
Attempting now to release to rook from defensive duty.
Honestly, I'm looking for a drawing line after Nxg. I simply cannot afford for his rook to assume an attack posture.
My Nc3 is going to have to get involved, and to do that he must give up covering d1 - so I make a quick pre-emptive move to sidestep the potential check.
A preamble to Qf4+ QxQ gxQ and a wicked hard endgame for white - I have about 8 minutes left to his 17.
? Black has the opportunity to trade queens and chooses not to. Instead, he chooses a healthy (and annoying) pin.  However..........
! I start thinking I may be able to actually win this thing, as I'm allowed to bring all of my pieces to bear.
And black resigns (43...Kg8 44. Qf6 any 45. Qg7# OR 43...Kh8 44. Qf6+ Kg8 45. Qg7# OR 43...Kh8 44. Qf6+ Kh7 45. Qg7#). Many thanks to my new friend Windy for the fantastic game, and thanks to all for the Charlotte hospitality. I really enjoyed playing with you guys.
the initial position in the mini tournament
i played this move because in order to save the rook,<n>he would have to lose the game  <n>eg:Rook g8, queen e4#
...so I move my own knight up to contest the dark squares in the centre, and allow for 2... e5, unless he plays 2. d4...
...but as he moves up the pawn in front of his knight, he's no doubt hoping to fianchetto his bishop onto the long light diagonal...
...but because I have nothing to fear from the bishop landing there, I advance my king's pawn onto the other (dark) diagonal, where it is protected by my knight...
...and he finally fianchettos his bishop, as I anticipated...
..so I move up my pawn to fork the knight and pawn. If he captures my pawn, my knight advances to recapture...
...but as he declines to take it, I initiate the exchange, and he obviously captured with his bishop's pawn as he anticipated a response of 6... Qe7+, possibly followed by a block with his own queen, and even a trade, forcing his king off his starting rank...
...so I move up my dark-square bishop to allow for kingside castling...
...and as it is instantly placed under attack by one of his knights...
...I defend it with my queen, although I felt this was a little dubious with the bishop having a wider range, even though it can never change square colour...
...and we both castle kingside to allow a rook some freedom...
...and I advance my queen's pawn to protect my knight on the light diagonal and free my remaining bishop...
...and his knight places my queen under attack...
...but she comes under attack from the bishop...
...but why did I move her here, to attack his knight, when it was protected by his queen, exposing my pawn?
As I result I lose the pawn in front of my remaining bishop...
...and in retaliation, I place his knight under attack with my knight's pawn...
...and as he saves his bishop...
Why did he retreat his bishop? Was he trying to attack from another side?
I bring my remaining bishop into enemy territory, although I probably brought it up to far...
...when the obvious response was for it to be attacked by the pawn...
...although it did expose the king to be checked by the queen...
..and I now retreat my bishop to safety, losing tempo...
...and, being ahead on material, I decide to trade pawns....
...then I place a rook on the now open d-file, hoping to put my queen ahead, in order to win a piece, or even exchange...
...and as he places his rook on the other open file, where my queen and knight are situated...
...I save both by placing my queen on a safe square close to my knight, attacking the bishop...
...I get the queen exchange...
...and I place my remaining rook on the open d-file to contest it. This may have been a little dubious, with me having one less long-range piece...
...and I get the other rook exchange. OK, my knight landed back on its starting rank, but I am ahead on material, despite having fewer long-range pieces in the endgame where no piece is worth more than three points, and I am trying to weaken his counterplay.
I now move my knight back up to help to clean up the pieces...
...and his dark-square bishop lines up my queenside pawn still in its initial position...
..but what was I thinking exposing it to the bishop?
I sure got off the hook there! He could have gone Bxa7, and threatened to create two passed pawns on the queenside, although...
...this was what I had in mind. I was trying to remove the pawn on b2, although the bishop could cover that square...
..but was this the right move, trading his bishop for my knight, doubling pawns on f7 and f6? His counterplay has weakened.
He therefore saves his other bishop...
..allowing me to capture the pawn on f3, isolating the one on e4, making it an easy target.
He therefore lines up my pawn on a4, with the a7 pawn safe, as the dark-square bishop has gone...
...and attack it with my own...
...but why did he capture mine and allow the exchange? OK, my knight has a limited range, but, with some help, it can quite easily mop up my opponent's pawns.
I am now guaranteed to win another pawn...
I moved my bishop to f4 here for two reasons. I wanted some extra protection in case of a pawn push to e5 and at this point I was planning to bring my Knight to that e5 square. I like to open up the c6 square against my opponents. That gives me a line at the King. Also, I wanted to put some pressure on the f7 square.
I went ahead and captured. Putting pressure on the queen and doubling pawns on his queen side.
Here I'm retreating but leaving plenty of space covered. Like I said in the beginning I had studied a few of gnitnaws games before I joined. c5 was expected and a common patterns in his games. As I said I saw how he favored the queens gambit games. It was at this point I noticed if I could get him off of the d5 square I'd have a shot at his rook on a8...
I got the rook and +2. He moves his bishop to open a line at my bishop with his queen.
The beauty of the fianchetto is the ability to retreat and attack at/from opposing corners. It's occasionally overlooked as it was 2 moves prior as well.<n><n>He continues his pawn push on the queen side.
I captured a pawn and I expected him to recapture allowing me to get his knight on f6... he made a great move and retreated back to e7.
White's position just became a lot stronger. No black rooks on the board and my rook is on the open d file.
At this point I'm trying to figure out how to trade down and simplify the position.
Forking the knight and pawn
Retreat to protection...
Finally got the knight... it was at this point my opponent resigned. <n><n>All in all it was a fun game. The loss of the rook early on was really the downfall for black. Definitely a confidence booster for me and my new found love of the king side fianchetto.
4. d3 would transpose to an ancient variation of the Italian, in which (according to Nunn) White has an edge.
White is pretty much busted.  I decided to get two pawns for my knight and see if I can get my king side pawns moving. before Black figures out how to get his a8 rook into the game.
With a won game Black starts to drift.  He should be thinking how to get his a1 rook activated.
As the final round od the ASCC begins, I find myself facing Caleb J., who beat me pretty bad a few months ago in another tournament.  In this game, I jump out to a lead and am thrilled at the prospect of winning this last one, but it was not to be. Staying true to my philosophy of playing horrible moves, my 29th and final move was utterly shameful. Ah, well, so goes chess. I only wish that I could win winning positions. My last move so seriously disappointed me that I considered developing a severely bad attitude, but I eventually shook it off and now look forward to me next OTB tourney. I guarantee that you the reader will enjoy this game more than I the annotator. This is painful........
Ok, I have a nice lead in controlling the center, and numerous developmental opportunities.
Pressing right ahead, and forcing me to recapture.
Wanting to disrupt the centerand getting his DSB into play.
Now I get a some clarity, and threaten to win a pawn.
To claim a pawn quickly......
Threatening to win yet another pawn after NxB, cxN, Qxd.
I'm pretty sure he sees what I am up to, and throws some confusion in the mix.
Black shows good patience, and prepares to double up on the d file.
!! Wins, as Kf1 is met by Qf2#, and Kh1 is met by Rd1#. This is a prime example of how not to play chess. A pretty poor showing on my part this game. I end the 2007 Alabama State Chess Championship with an extremely average result of 3/6, and vow revenge next year. I hope you have enjoyed these games. I can't say that there is much to be learned from them, but they were played at a fun tournament with some good opponents. I encourage everyone to get involved with OTB play. It's a whole lot different than playing on GK! - best regards, Thomas.
white try to take advantage for playing g4. Thats the weak side for black.
Black also want to attack b4. The same tactic for white. Both white and black attack the same side.
black take an advantage and control for middle.
white try to respond black and also attack with NC5!!! it is a good illustreted move. It blocks black game and also attack white a6 pawn. Also weak the defence of black. BUT!!!!
Black continue to attack.
Both way attack for black.Castle also attack Qd8 and also threat b2 pawn for attacking.
queen trys to exchange but black try to develop the attack with play Qb6
Thats the tactic with black. Sacriface the knight with develop attack dangerously.
Well this blocks the bishop but does give some support for e5
Give black something else to think about
And then a pawn, black resigns
i must mark this move with a ? where is the knight going? it had no future on h6.
i force the declination of the gambit now to lay in an attack on the king side.
i want the check at f7 and the knight guards it so i must eliminate the knight. i also considerd nc3.
this is actually a bad move, but black does not notice it and i got lucky, if he moves the king back to d8 i am alomst forced to proceed with nxd6,bxd6, qxf6 and my queen is safe.
now that the bishop is gone attack the pinned piece
this move plays itself almost literaly, the bishop must now die the question is where to put the grave
notice that black's queen, the most powerful piece on the board is reduced to a lowly bishop.
better was qxd7 as the threat of mate is unanswerable. i made this move because i wanted to do the b3 check and was trying to foresee the reulst of that check, my plan included next going qd5, then laying the check on and the queen would have to take then the rook goes to b3 and the queen and knig ar dead meat with mate on the move.
this is another blunder because if rd7 white is forced to desperado his queen and prays to win her back with the check
black blunders here and gives the game away
Hi everyone!<n><n>Myevilluck is certainly bombing towards his next goal, that is to become a Gameknot Master with a rating north of 2200.  If he keeps this up he will certainly get there because he achieved an IM Draw with the mighty Klauno (Klaus).  So how did this happen?
9. 0-0-0 - allo, allo, allo - are we gonna get the classic Sicilian castle on opposite wings followed by a mating attack race.  Yup, last one there cops Old Matey!
10. ..... b5 - and now we get the standard Sicilian Naijdorf pawn push to b5 followed by b4 chasing away the c3 knight leaving the WK more vulnerable to a mating attack.  Usually in the Sicilian, the WK almost always goes to b8 because black usually plonks a BQ on the c column or a black rook, leaving the possibility of a very strong attack of heavy artilliary on the a, b and c column.  Sometimes, particularly in the Sicilian Dragon, an exchange sac on c3 occurs to bust up white's pawn structure and leave the WK open to hostile castle fire and an attack from a dsb from the a1-h8 diagonal.  In this game the black dsb is on the a3-f8 diagonal but there is still a possibility of that prelate coming in to a3 at a later date, so, Myevilluck - beware!
13. Bg3 - Myevilluck puts his bishop on the same diagonal as the BQ and a BR on b8.  There is potential for a skewer if Klaus does not watch out!
15. fxg5 - hmm, the h column is now open, but to whose advantage?!
17. Qe3 - I did wonder whether Qh5 was a good move here, although the WQ can be chased away with Nf6 - although white can play gxf7+ to avoid losing a pawn before retreating the queen.
18. ..... Rxf7 - black does not want to risk putting his king on the open f file to be checked by the WQ.
26. Qc1 - the WQ evades the black knight's attack.  Suddenly white's position looks a bit like a jstevens1 position in the middlegame - this player seems to have a tendency to batten down those hatches and now Myevilluck is having to do so.  Now Klaus is really trying to open up white's already draughty castled position.
40. Qxc4 - after the queen trade white is the exchange for a pawn down.  This could prove decisive in black's favour, but white fights on.
45. Kxc4 - I wonder why black returns the exchange?
50. .... Nxe5 - black has been forced to give up his rook to stop the a pawn crowning but he takes off another white pawn.  White must get his king back towards the centre or he is toast!
54. Ke4 - white manages to get his king back to the centre and as he does so, offers a draw.  Klaus accepts and despite being a pawn light, Myevilluck has triumphed in the endgame.  Kudos to both players for an exciting game!  Kind regards - Joanne
I'm not sure if that was a good idea, but it looked ok at the time.
I stared at the board for a whole 2 minutes before making this move.   I missed his response completely.  I was extremely disappointed in myself.  I should have simply traded knights with him.  It would have slightly  decreased his presence in the center.
Attacking, but weakening his kingside.  My queens diagonal is now open.  I attempt to move quickly to exploit.
I was starting to get low on time.  I did this simply because I thought it could lead to something.  I was wrong.
Rather tan retreat to QB4, Black exchanges.
I complete the exchange.
Trying to sneak the Q out onto the K-side to harass my King.
Clearing the decks and connecting Rooks.
Now Black must end up down a piece.
Choosing to trade off the Bishops.
Immediate pressure,and also swapping down and reducing Black's chance for counterplay.
Now I pick up an additional Rook in the bargain. Black's incomplete development costs him, as if his B had cleared the line his Rooks would have been connected.
I plan to double Rooks on the last rank and force his last two pieces off the board.
The threat of 18 R/1-K8, winning a piece, prompts Black to resign.
Prepares to castle.
Now, with both our Kings tucked away, it gets clogged on his side.
Now black should counter with a pawn threat against the white bishop.  Pawn-pawn pushes the bishop off the black queen's diagonal.
Black choose instead to further persuade white to take the cheap knight.
f pawn to the rescue.
???  Ok, moments earlier black began mainlining heroin and imagined white's pawn had transmogrified into a knightly stallion.  How did black earn 1300 with moves like that?  Perhaps black's six year old nephew made this move while black was watching Dancing with the Stars.  Mm.  Black's e rook already prevented white's pawn from nabbing the bishop at f5.  I cannot discern any clear motive for Qe7.  With all white's firepower on the d rank black has little hope of a sudden checkmate with the queen sacrifice.  To add insult to injury that important central d5 pawn remains undefended.
This is kmccrate541's characteristic move in the French Defence.  Probably White's best response to this is to transform the game into a species of Alekhine's Defence and play 3.e5.  In the sequel, Black keeps a level pegging.  More usual is to contest the centre at once by 2...d5.
A bit of a battle is now raging about d4, and indeed the centre in general.
White is happy to exchange on c5 now, as the f8-bishop can no longer recapture.
(?!) Probably better was simply to retake on c5.  This pawn advance has its points, but it leads after the ensuing melee into Black's first big mistake.
(!?) Also coming into consideration was 7.exd5.  After 7...Nd7 Black will get his pawn back.
(?!) Risky!  This has the same idea as ...Nd7 - hitting the e-pawn, and possibly Black hoped that something interesting might develop at f2 after ...Bc5 in the near future.  But this could have gone awry...
Overlooking 8.Qa4! - striking at the Knight on g4, at the same time indirectly protecting the e-pawn (8...N(g)xe5  9.Nxe5, winning a Knight).   The Knight's only retreat (...h5; h3) is ...Nh6.  If, then, 8...Nh6  9.Bxh6 gxh6 leaves Black's K-side looking rather ragged.  The advanced White e-pawn, meanwhile, remains to impose a cramp on Black's game.
More solid was to take with the other Knight.  Capturing this way had another implication, which soon came apparent, to Black's cost.
(??) And here it is.  This capture has been in the air for several moves, and Black obviously had it in mind ever since he played 6...d5.  Had he retaken on e5 with his other knight (8...Ngxe5) this recapture would have been fine.  As it is...
Winning the Bishop.
The consequences of this is for Black much greater than the the loss of a piece for a pawn.  For the moment, Black can't castle, and his bishop is a very poor minor piece (one of the down-sides of the French Defence is the so-called 'French Bishop' - blocked in by pawns).  Black never does succeed in improving its prospects.
Not the most auspicious response to calamity.  Instead 12...b6 would have freed the Queen's Rook to move to c8.
(!) There's more to this than meets the eye!
(?) An understandable slip, but neither side were alert to the opportunity that was now presented to White.  Essential was 13...Nf6.
(??)  White must have counted himself very fortunate afterwards that he got away with this.  The irony is that he could right here have extended his material advantage by 15.Bd6! (One suspects his intuition was telling him there was something good in the position, but he lit on 16.Bxh6 whilst trying to identify what this 'good thing' was).  By 15.Bd6 White attacks a rook and discovers an attack on the knight at the same time.  Black can complicate by 15...e5, but 16.Qxd5 Re8  17.Nxe5 costs Black 2 pawns.  Now Black can recover the piece and obtain a level game...
(??) The most common mistakes overlook retrograde moves, usually by a bishop.  On this occasion, it's a knight's retrograde that gets overlooked.  By 15...Nxh6 Black would have equalized the game.  After this, it is all downhill, pretty much, try as Black might to get counter-play.
Aiming for d6.  There is no good way of stopping this.  Nominally, White is up a minor piece (two knights for a bishop).  True, his Q-side has yet to be mobilized, but that's just potential not yet tapped.  Contrast Black's Bishop - hemmed in by friendly pawns, with no prospects either, being committed to the protection of the backward e-pawn.
Hoping something good will turn up on the g-file.  Given that the bishop can not possibly participate in this attack, Black is effectively two pieces behind in the ensuing game.
Doubling rooks with gain of tempo?
No.  But Black might have been better advised not to commit this rook in this way, and found other ways to protect his bishop.  Unfortunately even the better 21...Qg7 won't save Black: 21...Qg7  22.g3 (well, it achieves this much - White has to make a defensive move!) 22... f4  23.Rxe6! Bxe6  24.Rxe6 ... (White now threatens 25.Re7)  24...Rg6  25.Rxg6 Qxg6  26.Qxf4.  With 2 Knights and 2 pawns for a rook, White should have no trouble taking out the game.
Better - however hopeless - was 25...Qxf7, which would have contained the damage to the major exchange (queen for rook).  Now a bishop gets carried off as well.
I would not call this a game of missed opportunities: most were taken all right.  After Black missed his chance to equalise, White never allowed him the slightest chance to get back into the game.  An object lesson in being alert to changes in the flow of the game; but also in how to win a winning game.
I am not sure this is a conventional opening. It seems to sacrifice the pawn at e5 for little gain.
Develop, develop, develop. White has more pieces developed and a stronger hold on the center. And a small material edge. Probably not the situation black had hoped for with his unconventional opening.
Black is sneaky. d5 looks weak, and it looks like he gave white a free pawn, but if 7. Pxd5 Re8  and now white has to block with his knight or his bishop - either way his d5 pawn loses a critical defender.
To allow me to move my bishop. Right now it was doing guard duty against black's fianchettoed bishop on g7.
! This causes black some headaches. White threatens e5 to win the pinned knight. I expect the queen to run away and then I can exchange on f6.
First we trade the knights. Both queens are now under attack, but black also has two bishops under attack, too.
Black trades his bishop for the white pawn, and now his material deficit has widened. If black retreats his queen, white plays 17. Qxf3 which then defends both bishops and black loses more matrial, so his next move is forced.
Now we can trade queens or not. Either way, white is ahead by a bishop and a pawn.
Black wisely chose not to trade queens while he's down a bishop and a pawn. So it's time to chase her around, while getting my pieces into more active roles. I could have played Bxb7 but after black's R(a)b8 I end up losing my pawn at b2, which splits my a and c pawns too.
Now I can safely take the pawn, since the black queen doesn't threaten the bishop on b7, so r(a)b8 means I don't have to immediately retreat the bishop.
Not sure what black's move was about. The a2 pawn is protected by white's bishop. Now black's queen is far removed from defending. Maybe black was hoping for Qxd1  (or    if white is foolish enough to move the rook at e1 forward and also foolish enough to not leave the rook and queen on the e file to block the mate).
I have to admit, I had not considered black's last move. The perfect foil to most of my plans. Back to the drawing board...
I was surprised to see black willing to exchange when he was down in material. I expected Qxe8. But then I remembered my theory about his move 24...Qa4 to set up Qxd1   and that's when I realized black was probably not planning to capture my rook at all. Turned out I was right. Free rook for me.
Black laid a trap for white, but white turned it around and gained a rook. Now I'm shoring up the position, protecting the rook on e8 and avoiding the mate on d1.
! Exchanges queens, capitalizing on white's crushing material superiority. Of course, if black doesn't exchange queens, white will take the rook free of charge.
And now it's Checkmate in 5. Black cannot move his king at all or white plays 32. Rh8  .
He frees his dark-square bishop, but traps the white.
I will take advantage of the fact there is no pawn to stop me.
He blocks it with his bishop.
I free my light-square bishop.
I try to get my knight more into the battle.
Now I think I see his plan. My guess is that The queen will somehow come down and try to checkmate  me protected by the rook.
Maybe that bishop has something to do with the checkmate too.
I try to make up for what I did. Now if I can just that queen out of the way I can fork his king and rook.
I take it with my knight.
Now I get to do it.
Out comes another knight, working the center from afar. Soon all 4 horsies will be pointing towards the center. After that it will be time to break the tension.
Now some trading must occur.  Landon must either trade pawns, or attack my knight.
My response attacks his other knight. He HAS to move it in this case.
He runs like a little kid. Waa waa!. I'm not sure g5 would have been any better, and given the following exchange, I'd say it was the right move.
Why did I not capture enPassant?  I had his knight in my sights. I thought I was going to force him to move it again and allow me to develop another piece.
My knight retreats but attacks his knight. At one time I mentioned to Landon how I enjoy trading pieces in front of protective pawn structure because it wrecks their pawn protection and can stop a castle or open up a castled king to attack. Why, oh why, do I help him?
I take the piece. This does open up the rook file for possible early rook involvement. Thanks Landon!
I think we have both realized at this point that a king side castle is out for both of us. Black due to the open file, white due to the same open file and that nasty rook pointing his way. So we prepare to castle. I see no real danger in the bishop move, but I am not thinking of the board position after I castle queen side. Bad move, Dave, bad move.
I want my king pawn to be able to move forward and free my bishop. I plan to castle on the queen side, but I want my bishop open when Black castles.
Landon decides it's time to harass my pawn.
I haven't figured out what he was thinking on that exchange, it seemed to give me an advantage. But Landon is a very thoughtful person and may have forgotten he is supposed to win.
This is a mess. I have NO pieces developed, an awful pawn structure kingside and a hemmed in Bishop. Landon is in better shape, but not by much.
Landon gets ready to castle, and frees his Queen.
He gives me a great reason to protect the "a" pawn. I also now notice a rather nasty potential for abuse at c7. Thankfully my queen protects. I am starting to curse under my breath a bit at my hasty castle.
Landon is now about to bust a gut. I'm sure he has seen blood and is ready to feed like a psychotic Great White Shark.
I initially think Landon has lost his mind. I am going to take the bishop with my pawn and be up a piece. What the heck?<n>Then I realize the diabolical potential in the move. If I take the bishop mate looks inevitable. He will smother my King in the corner. But after examining the board I realize checkmate is not impending in the corner without bringing up a supporting piece. Still, I decide to leave the Bishop and give my King a flight square.
Whoops.... In his greedy attempt to checkmate me, Landon forgot the most important piece on the board.
too passive ??<n><n>play 4. ...Nxe4 to recapture the pawn would make more sense.
11. ...Qe7 better to move the queen back to safety
nice move that indirectly pins the dark bishop to the defence of g7
Keep On Threatin'<n><n>As mentioned in a previous annotation I'm slowly learning not to go charging in but to let things develop better.
Unusual opening. I'm not keen on flank development at such an early stage. Not being an openings expert I fail to see the advantage.
Cutting the f8 bishop off at the diagonals....
Trying not to push the c/d pawns until I've got a good reason to choose which.
white's on the attack
this was a mistake! I wanted to go for the castling o-o! still doesn't mean it was the best move. maybe Qd7
thinking the queen won't be able to do anything on it's own in attack! got my eyes on the b2 pawn, not a big deal but i wanted to show some pieces!
e5 pawn controlling the middle,
giving some space for rook on h8, after earlier mistake.
I didn't want to move my queen because it's securing the good chain, also this opens g file for my rooks to dominate.
trying to expose my rook on g2, made me glad the earlier move opened g file for my other rook to cover.
pawn on d6 was very weak and could lead to mate in no time
took me some time to think about this, but though if i could get rook into e7 after queen exchange i have a chance of an attack with the two rooks
the knight is covered with the rook so no need to pin on Qh6.
just few moves to get some time to think
white decided to not take the pawn and keep me waiting
back to attack.
no where for king to go!
I think the best option here was to play the simple 10.h3.
It appears that Black is now threatening to win a piece.
If Black plays 11...Bxg5 White has 12.Bxe5 Nxe5 13.f4, winning the piece back.
The black square weakness that I mentioned earlier now manifests itself.
The beginning of the end.
An apparently free piece, and also prevents the loss of the rook if the g pawn had captured.
This differs from the main line where White plays Nf3 Be2 O-O. In this variation (Saemisch) White solidifies the center and keeps options open for maybe castling queenside and doing a kingside pawnstorm, or trying to get an advantage with the bolstered pawn center
Baker usually plays for an attack like e5 Nh5 f5, but that attack is only good in the main line where White castles kingside quickly. This variation is more positional since White's pawns are more solid, and Baker and I both reccomend the positional c5-break over the tactical e5-break in variations where White moves his f-pawn early.
Yes, Black is offering to give up a pawn. Most players who know Saemisch well will not accept the pawn and instead play Nge2 hoping for cxd4 Nxd4 with a Maroczy Bind. If White accepts the pawn, then Black gets a lot of positional compensation. After dxc5 dxc5 Bxc5 Nc6, White's position is cramped and Black has a big lead in development. If you know this opening well then you know that accepting the gambit is not advisable.
Black wants to open the e-file for his rook and free up some space. White can choose whether he wants to trade his e-pawn, d-pawn, or c-pawn for Black's e-pawn. Swapping off both e-pawns is not good because Black's open e-file will be stronger. 8.dxe6 Bxe6 9.Nb5 Ne8 is also comfortable for Black. (10.Bxc5 won't work because of Qa5 )
White's best bet is to let Black trade his central pawn for the flank pawn.
Usually making this kind of pawn swap favors the player with more central pawns, but White's center is contained, Black now has queenside pawn majority, and can break up White's center with f5 later.
In the lines where White leaves the pawn on d4 and keeps dxc5 an option, Black develops this knight to c6 and plays Ne5 if d5. In this variation where White plays d5 early, this is pretty much the only square to develop to. The idea of Na6-Nc7 planning a b5 advance takes too long and isn't that strong.
Perhaps Nc1 was better because I don't think White has enough play for a kingside attack.
Since White has stopped expansion on the queenside, Black turns toward the kingside.
Black plans to weaken a lot of his kingside playing f5, but he has pieces to cover those weaknesses, and White isn't in a position to take advantage of them.
breaking open the kingside
this is probably white's best idea, clump the pieces around the weaknesses about to be created.
Black's main advantage here is the majority of pieces controlling the kingside. Black should continue to clump the pieces around the kingside. The maneuvering will be slow, but as long as White can't do anything, Black has time to prepare a kingside attack.
a5-Na4-Nb6 would cramp Black's queenside, but it isn't very dangerous as long as Black has control of the kingside where all the action is. The queenside is pretty much contained. White needs to make room for his rook to get active to match Black's piece play.
the queen does not belong on an open file when there are still rooks on the board.
The Na4-Nb6 idea mentioned earlier might be White's only chance to generate some play. Black has secured all the weaknesses left with the advancing of h and f-pawns, so now it's time to make progress with the minor pieces.
26.Nxf6 heavily increases the strength of Black's dark-squared bishop. I thought it was better if White tries to maintain the knight on e4 rather than defending passively. If the knight stays on e4, then it's harder for Black's minor pieces to make progress
This takes advantage of the e-file White cleared up, and Black gains a tempo in the coordination of the minor pieces. f4 is weakening to the light squares and not advisable, White should retreat the queen to d1 to support the Na4-Nb6 plan, which is White's last chance to generate some play.
If Bf1, then Nxf6 and Black has too many tactics.
Black's pieces are beginning to reach their optimal squares to start an attack. Black has a lot of pressure on the f-file, so Nfg4 is coming.
After fxg4 Qxf2, Black has the major threat of Nf3. If White defends f3 with the queen, then Nf3 is still crushing after Bxf3 Rxe1
White loses the very weak f-pawn, and also gets his rooks forked, but he had to defend the bishop, and the position is still very complicated.
Along with forking the rooks, this also threatens Rxe4, and White cannot play Nxd6 due to Nxf2#
This is pretty much the best solution to stopping all the threats, because if Bxg4 then Nxd6.
White still cannot play Nxd6 because of Qxf2 and White will get mated, and taking the knight allows Bxg4, where Black is up 2 exchanges, and has loads of tactics on the open files that will secure a large material advantage or trade off into a simple endgame.
Black should get his queen out in the open before Nf6  otherwise Black has to spend a lot of tempo, and White's pieces have coordinated and are beginning to generate counterplay. From here on, every move must be active, and both players need to be tactically alert, this is an ultra-sharp position and if Black doesn't play accurately, White may have enough counterplay to get a perpetual or recover enough of the material disadvantage to hold a draw, maybe even mate Black.
White shouldn't try saving the g4-rook, because Black can reinforce the Bg2  Rxe4 idea while trading off into a simpler ending. White wants the position to remain as complicated as possible, giving him every cheapo chance he can get, and giving Black the most opportunities to screw up.
If 35.Bxe1, then 35...Bxe2 is simple and Black's queen and bishops are too much for White to handle. White is lost so now he needs to figure out which lines give him the most cheapo possibilities before he becomes totally lost in an unswindlable position. If N8xd6, then Bf6  Kg1 Qg4  and White cannot block with the knight, so if Bg3 then Be3  Kf1 Bxe2   Kxe1 Rf1#, and if Kf1 after Qg4 , then Bxe2  Kxe1 Rxf2! and White's king cannot escape the queen and 2 bishops.<n>Another idea for Black is Bf6  Kg1 Qh3 Bf1 Bg2 intending Nf3#
Taking the bishop is the only active move. If Bd4  instead, then Black wins easily after cxd4 Qxd4  Qe5, Black is up a whole rook with many tactical threats
Black threatens Qg2#, and if Bxe1 then Rf1#, so White must check every move now
This is tricky, because if cxd4 Qxd4  White will play Nf6  once the king moves. If Black moves his king now, then White still plays Nf6 , so is Black suddenly losing? did Black miscalculate and didn't see this move when he went for the mate? What does Black do here? How can he escape this?
White resigned, because after Bxf6  Kg8, White has no more checks and Black will play Qg2#. White can stop mate by hanging the queen with Qc2, but Black should still win easily having a queen for a knight.
White establishes the classic center and black fianchettoes.
White develops normally and now, according to the world DB, 3. ... a6 is by far the strongest move for black and it is the one played by the highest rated players (those two points may very well be self-fulfilling). In any case, I don't immdiately see the reason for it. Sure, in many openings white likes to post a knight or bishop on b5 and black often likes to play a6 to prevent that, or to drive away the white piece. I don't see that white can make any terribly strong threats on b5 yet, and black could hold a6 to drive off the white piece if white plays there. Maybe 3. ... Nf6 to prepare to catle, or 3. ... d6 to open up the other bishop. Still, I go with the masters on this one.
White's 4th move seems a little to passive for my taste. Bishops like to jump into the fray, preferably from a safe distance, but they don't like to hide behind their own pawns. At least to my way of thinking. Still, it's popular in the DB. And now the DB has 2,447 games with this position, and 2,403 of them say to play 4. ... d6. But, 43 grandmasters say otherwise and suggest 4. ... b5. This denies c4 to white, a square that otherwise could be a strong outpost for a bishop. It also signifies a clear intent to play on the queenside. Other than that, I don't see any benefit, and maybe would have thought 4. ... d6 was better. Who am I to argue with grandmasters?
Interesting. On black's 4th move, the DB had the position heavily in favor of black (22 wins for black vs. 14 for white, with 7 draws). White's 5. a4 attacks the black queenside and was only played twice in the DB with an average rating of 2535, with white winning once and drawing once. Suddenly 4. ... b5 looks very questionable to me, though two games is hardly statistically significant.
And now we're out of book. Black has carved out some significant space on the queenside, though there seems room for white to get in behind those advanced pawns. White has taken strong control of the center.
Normal development. White strengthens his center and black now challenges it with 9. ... d5. This might have been miscalculated. 9. ... d6 and 10. ... c5 may have been stronger. On the plus side, white's king is still in the center and he's opened his f-pawn - this can often expose the king to unexpected danger.
White has lost a piece, and his king is now a target in the center. It's time for black to find a way to use his material advantage to exploit white's exposed king.
Unpinning the knight and connecting rooks.
White's king is dangerously exposed. He might do better by false-castling, bringing his rook to e1 and shuffling his king off to f1 or g1 if he can shut out black's queen.
Freedom to attack white's rook. More importantly, this move unleashes black's rooks for action on the f-file.
Black's bishop is en prise, but it is of no consequence. After 25. Rxb2 Raf8 white is in trouble. His best try is to shut down the black queen with 26. Qg1 Qxg1 27. Rxg1 Rxf3 and black regains his material lead and now threatens to win the white pawn at b3 and also threatens to win the white rook at b2. Black will win even more material and with the queens off the board, the endgame will be an easy one for black.
25 h5? was a blunder that will cost white quite a bit of material. Black is ahead by a piece but has his bishop en prise on b2. Taking that bishop was possibly white's best move, though as noted it leads to an endgame white cannot win nor likely even draw. The f-file is a huge cannon aimed at the white king and white ignores it entirely. The diagonal on which black's queen stands is a second huge cannon aimed at the white king and white ignores that entirely, too. Instead, white launches a counterattack, at what is likely the worst possible time.
Fearing 8...Bxf2+ 9 Kxf2 Qf6+ 10 Qf3 Qxf7 making things fairly equal. It forces Black to develop though. Perhaps 8 Bxg8 would have been better. It would be trading a very useful bishop away but it would prevent the future pains to come.
? The natural move. f3 would have been much better, even though castling would be spoiled. I seriously considered 12 Nd1! which would have given Black no targets, and White time to repel Black's knight with 13 h3. I dismissed it though, because it was such an odd move and I considered it risky (because it was odd), silly thinking on my part, but that was my logic at the time.
! A beautiful move! White should have seen this. This wins the rook, if 13 Re1 then Bxf2+. If 13 Rd1 then Nxf2.
? Another error. We were tied at about three minutes each at this moment. My opponent stopped notating, but I wished to continue notating. I wasted precious time, but I was able to eventually get someone to notate for me.
"Okay, a draw?"<n>"Yeah, good game!"<n>After the match I talked to Andrew, and learned of his identity. I thanked him profusely and asked him to write "Notated by Andrew Selzler" because I always keep my notation sheets.
destructuring the center. I am not sure it is correct, but I secretely hoped to isolate his pawn, even at a cost of a tempo: exd 7. Qxd4 Nc6 8. Qd1.
so now other plan: i have a useless bishop, i still have a good control on light square... i want to destroy these pawns... I had a few moves to make.
now, my plans were to put my knight on f5, takes his f-knight and capture the center pawns.
... but i had to delay this plan
Haha! I surprised you, buddy! I thought that the only problem my king could have by not catling here was the opposite queen,,, which i had planned to exchange in the next few moves...
now, I want to exchange and take the second pawn, if it is possible.
the plan to pin my horse is a bit slow
anyway, I intended to exchange the horse with the bishop
here I hesitated... and actually it turned to be dangerous. Although the next moves are mostly mistakes, I wonder if, anyway, letting him a majority on a-b side is or not a huge mistake.
and i create a new threat for myself!!!!
and this is his biggest mistake. Now, I win!
6. Qc2 - Glenda moves onto this square because she has the square h7 in her sights.  If Dave castles kingside there are thoughts of the possibility of Glenda hopping on her broomstick onto that very square if Dave is unaware!
12. 0-0 - both sides castle kingside after this move.
16. Qb1 - I decided to keep Glenda on the b1-h7 diagonal but I thought it wise to move her out of the line of the rook on c8.
19. Bd3? - Dave pointed out that this was a bad mistake because it did allow a sac on h3.  I really did want to keep Glenda on that diagonal and I did not want Dave's lsb to get complete control of the b1-h7 diagonal.
21. Kg2 - I decided to move Henry to this square because I had a BxRP sac idea of my own.  I also had big ideas of piling up with my major pieces on the h file.  Unfortunately, Dave unleashes his own deadly plan.
24. ..... Rxe3!! - this is the move which takes advantage of the overloaded piece.  This piece happens to be the pawn on f2 which is defending both Fou Lenoir and the pawn on g3.  I have to recapture but the pawn on g3 is hanging to deadly effect.
27. Rd2?? - stops one mate but allows another.  Gameknot Analysis showed that if I had played Bh7+ then I would have stopped the mate but ended up 9 material points down - ruinous.  So, yet again, Old Matey descends on Henry .....
Hi guys, I haven't being annotating any chess game recently, because I was preparing for my exams, and finally I got some free time today, so i decide to use the time and bring you guys a very unprofessional chess annotation. This was a game between me and ruderooks, it's definitely not my best game, but I found it quite interesting, let's get started:  My opponent had white pieces, and he started with e4.
Just 2 weeks ago, I was studying French defense, so I decided to use it in this game, e6 was played.
Nc6 develops the knight, and adds some pressure on white's center.
Bb5, develops the lsb and pins the knight.
Nd2 I wasn't sure why this move was played, I think Ne2 would be better, because white would be ready to castle, and take note if Nf3 was played, Bb5 could be a possible response, which stops white from castle, and also the bishop is not doing anything on c6, apart from babysitting d5 pawn.
Nf6 develops the knight, and maybe Nh5 at some point, just to kick away the dsb.
Bb5, stops white from castle, and also the bishop is now functioning on a much better diagonal.
a3 this is not a good move at all, white tries to stop black from playing Bb4, but b2 should have being considered by white, and he can play c4 for the next move, kicks away black' lsb, and then castle.
Bd6, not only develops the dsb, but also gives support on f4 square for the knight to land.
Bxf4 pretty much forced, white could not play c4, because black would play Nxg2+, after Kf1 which is the only move, Nxe3+ forking the king and the queen, thus fxe3 must be played, then dxc4, black would have time to retreat the lsb. However we don't have that.
Bxf4, now black has a bishop pair against two knights.
after the pawns were exchanged, I played a in between move, Qe7+, the reason is simple, I was hoping for white to play Qe2, so i would exchange queens and keep the bishop pair advantage in the late middle game or end game.
but black didn't want to exchange queens, and played Kf1.
Bd7 then I realized it wasn't an accurate move, because it allows white to play Qb3.
I could not play some random moves for example, like b6, that would be disaster, because Re1 wins the queen, however this move is very risky, if white plays carefully, he can use the half open b file and the pawns to crash my queen side.
Qa6, bring my queen close to the king, so she can help with the defense, but Nc5 could be absolutely irritating, and also I was thinking if white would play something like Ng5, threats the fork.
Rxc4, that's obvious, and black resigned. because to prolong the game, white would have to play Qxc4, but that is pointless to continue.  If white played something else, let's say Qa1, hides in the corner, avoids the discover check, then Rc1 discovered double check and mate(lol...). In conclusion: white had so many chances, but he missed too much, and d5 was the main reason that he lost the game so quick. Still I think it's a very interesting game, you may notice that white's king had a very bad day, he went from e1 to f1, f1 to e2, e2 to d3, d3 to e2 again, and then eventually back to f1. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed it, see you guys next time! :D
What a surprise! After Qxf6, I was going to play Ne4 and get rid of his strong black bishop. That's why I was willing to trade mine off. But I didn't expect him to open up his kingside and give himself double, isolated pawns.
And, of course, he stops me from being able to play Qe1.
If I play gxh3, he gets to play Rg1+.<n>If I play Rxh3, he plays Rxf4.<n>That leaves the awful g3, and my king is trapped plus my rook is pinned after he moves the queen to d5.
I think he's going to have some problems with that pinned bishop.
Now that the pawn's off of this file, my queen can use it, too.
I especially have to keep his queen off of that long diagonal and not let it pin my rook.
With the Kingside for Black already so far forward I thought the potential of pinning the Knight was worth while although Black can break this at any time with h6.
I'm not sure if a fianchetto is normal in the variation but it seems to me Black should be developing his Queenside in the hopes of castling in that direction.
Another error I think as it pins the Knight which is Black's best piece at the moment and gives me a pawn in the exchange to follow
The Knight on f6 is pinned and cannot move
12. ... Qxd3 13. Rd1 Qxf1 14. Kxf1 trades the Queen for a Bishop and Rook which is not horrible but down two pawns already not good either
If I can get my pieces lined up then Black is forced into trades
Getting the King away from Qd5+ in the future but I thought an unnecessary move
Giving away another Rook trade
Blocks off my Queenside pawn advance now I need to get the Kingside rolling
My opponent resigned here although I'm not sure 38. Rc4 was not worse than 38. Kc4. My connected pawns on g and h can force a trade and with my Rook behind my pawns the survivor of that exchange or my c-pawn or e-pawn will eventually Queen and my opponent resigned.
in this game, white went into a won endgame, but played a huge blunder in the very end.  But black resigned before trying to play out the position. This mistake was probably made by a miscalculation, as you will see.
acceptable, as the rook is not going anywhere soon.
white already has a decisive material advantage. He now uses the pin on the knight to win more material.
great use of transformation of advantages. White completely clears the smoke from the board and still maintains his huge material advantages. @nuntar: It is probably better to keep more material, but I just like crystal clear positions.
now the 2 black pawns are blockaded. The safest strategy is to directly march his king to the black pawns and win them. Both of white's pawn are indirectly defended(thanks nuntar).
(??) a blunder that throws the game away. However, black actually resigned at this point. However, I will continue the annotation to show that black can easily draw with his only legal move!
Now we see the whole point. The black pawn queens and controls the g6 square and protects against mate. Black prematurely resigned in a drawn position. It never hurts to play on! In fact, white is the one here who will be trying to draw.
Clearing the back row. Prokofiev has an advantage in time, as Oistrakh has yet to complete his development.
Releasing the pin on the Rook, easing Black's position.
Prokofiev's doubled Rooks threaten to penetrate the Black position.
Thrust and counterthrust.
Rushing his King to the defense of the Q-side.
Prokofiev relies on his advanced Pawns to neutralize the advantage of Oistrakh's minor exchange.
Oistrakh maneuvers to maintain the guard on his advanced QRP.
Occupying the Queening square.
Probably planning something... yes: If dxc, Nxe5.
It seems a mistake, since now black's N can take anywhere due to the discovered attack on my Q. But...
he can't take because of QxR+. If BxN, BxB+ and it's the same.
Last resource, but now, just by retiring the Q, I have no way out. Of course, but... where to retire the Q? Nowhere to prevent a N's check. He can take it... the next move.
Now I have to defnd c3 (I saw it will become weak, but this was a hot game, and I wasn't thinking in long-term strategy: I just need not to allow Qxc3+, winning the R. I'm lost anyway, when BxQ, bxQ and... I'm a piece under, with very few chances to even draw the game. BUT: when you go out of normal sequences (Na3, for Nb5, as an example), and the opponent is not "seeing" the consequences of an "odd move"... it is more difficult for him to keep the reasoning "on". This works for blitzes only, of course...
ah the old Ruy Lopez
I now need to think about devloping my pieces quickly
I decided to make use of my doubled pawn and block his advance. The only problem with this move is it hems my bishop in a bit.
opens my queen up and stops is knight advancing to d5
time to make some space, I'm a bit closed in at the moment
my plan here is to attack his pawn on d3 .
I thought castling was not a bad idea as his white bishop had gone and the white diagonal was blocked up with pawns. I also had thoughts of advancing my f pawn too.
white spots a weak spot in my defence.  The pawn on c5.  Moving that bishop does enable me to think about moving my knight to f4 attacking d3.  For a few moves now I have been a little concerned about the position of my queen.
But instead decided to attack. A little foolish, as now my knight is pinned and twanky can continue with his attack.
I decide to exchange my queen for a rook, knight and control of the open d file.  Not too bad. Twanky at this point asked me if losing my queen was a mistake.
I need to start forcing the moves!  Moving the knight now would only give him more time to attack.
I did not want to break my two rooks unity therefore my only safe square for my knight is b3.
white blocks the pawns up but also by advancing that pawn opens my knight to the attack from his queen at e6. I nearly missed that.
white makes his move. At the same time leaves his e pawn unguarded.  His plan now is to get my pawn defence on the queen side to promote his pawns.
and the knight gets it by the rook moving along one. This move allows room for my other rook to join in the attack. Now my knight is safe after the queen greedily takes another pawn.
My Knight is now in danger if I continue to attack with my rooks.
Something for him to think about. Stopping him from advacing his pawns at the moment.  I am now also thinking about bringing my king across.
White plans to attack my knight and promote.
I need to protect my knight.  To do this I attack his c pawn.
I thought he might make this move.   The exchange is to my advantage.  It will double his pawns up .  With my knight defending a7 too. The situation looks under control.  Another race will start soon. Both of us need back up from our kings.
My king looks to come to my knights aid. Also releasing my h pawn to advance.  I need his king to have a dilemma, " Which way should I go?"  Help his own pawns or stop mine from surging up the battle field.
Both kings hare to the action leaving the black pawns twiddling there thumbs.
i did also move my King's pawn ahead, i wanted to battle for the middle of the desk
i develop my black bishop
i want his bishop to get my knight
but no, he is not a child i can win with such an easy checkmate, so, the game continues...
i have my white bishop still not developed, moving the queens spawn to d6 i defend the King's spawn and open a way for my white bishop
what's there? free bishop, the game is going to end if gets my bishop
but here i think was his first mistake, he had to take my bishop, hadn't he?
i want to change our bishops now, after my "f" spawn shifts to "e" diagonal, i can attack e4, the battle for the middle continues...
i get his bishop
now if i move my queen spawn forward he gets my "e5" spawn for free
he wants his queen to take part in the battle (Qd1-a4)
yes, he had to move his king, if he cross my queen's way with the "g" spawn, i get his knight, if he cross my queen's way with the knight, the game will be over, next move Qh4:f2#
and he also do not give up!
no one could get the middle, but the right wing, is now the best area i can use for attacking the middle
so i reply by moving my spawn ahead to attack his knight
now i sacrifice my bishop to get more advantage
that's was mistake i think, now i can continue my attack
Together to victory!
if oyu move the horse away FROM somewhere, look at the pieces you leave undefended!
OH NO!!!  Always put the king in check if you have a good opportunity for an attack!!!!!
this is just getting yourself into trouble! Always look how you can hurt the king, it doesn't matter if the other one threatens to take a piece of yours. If you put him in check, he will have to respond to YOU.
I know I cannot castle any more, but I could probably try placing the King back to it's spot.
White's Queen recked havoc on my King and now it's after my Rook!?
White's on fire, so I decide that the best I can do, is to prepare for his attacks.
I have to admit, I would have a very slim advantage after 10...Bc3. If White responds with 11.Bxc7, then 11...Bxb2 earns me a free Rook.
I can possibly take the risk with 13...Qxc2!?.
I lose, reguardless of how impressive my other moves are. I decided to play it through, though.
moves the other knight to a safe palce
trying to attack my queen but I can take it on my next move.
other lesson look where the other piece is and save the peices that are in troble
bishop
bishop
I just prefer this move to the immediate d4.. I hope to mount a quick attack on f7
While my opponent makes passive defensive moves, I continue to develop... I'm also hoping for a legal-like mate if my opponent plays Bg4 next and goes greedy capturing my queen after I play Nxe5
!! Excellent... Now the bind becomes stronger as now my opponent can't castle and his queen is tied to the defence of the bishop on e7
Probably not the best continuation from me but for the mean time, I threaten to win a pawn
... And with this move, I pin a 3rd piece (both bishops and the f6 knight)... The f6 knight isn't pinned but it is tied to the defence of g7
My opponent should be thinking about how to break one of the pins in his territory instead of kicking my bishop... He should try something like 13. Kf8 releasing both knight and bishop at once
My opponent wanted to avoid the loss of the rook but in the process, he allowed me to play.........
!!!! This ensures my opponent losses a piece by force... Notice how my rook on d1 ensures the Bd7 dosent move in order for the rook to defend Be7
???? And another error from my opponent... This wasn't the best way to accept the loss of a piece
... Because now, he is forced to also lose the exchange.. At this point, he resigned. Many thanks for reading...
hey guys and welcome to my next annotation. I was black here.
! The best move in my opinion.
An antinatural move that seeks to control b5 for the queen, if needed.
Black doesn't want to close the bishop's action after the d5 pawn moves.
Now, tell me how is going black to move his knights...
...so let's be more aggressive. The plan is Ke2, to join the rooks on the kinside... so I switch back to the kingside attack plan... without the queen. But all the black pieces are completely blinded, and his only way out is f5.
Choosing the "weird" one, always. If4, I can open the g column for my attack.
Covering e4, threatening f5 and making the queen participate in the attack.
Necessary to open the way to h7.
Now I have to care for the g pawn...
No threat from the unsupported rook on the f file.
?? ...anyway, after Ke8, white can go on taking pawns and still stop the g pawn, with a little care...
declined... and i hate it when i'm forced to develop my bishop to d3 instead of c4...
and the attack begins... i always look to play e5 as early as possible, especially if i have succeded in getting my rook onto the d file before black has castled...
indeed... 11... Bxd6? 12. Bxh7 ! Kh8 (not Kxh7 or Ng5  gets messy) 13. c4 and the knight or bishop falls, reclaiming the material, and his kingside penetrated... or if 11... Qxd6? 12. c4 and the knight is pinned to the queen since the bishop can move with check... my opponent left a message with this move which said something like "VERY reluctant move..."
!? i have absolutely no idea if this move really is as sound as it turned out to be for me... it was a mistake, i hadn't noticed the pawn was pinned, i'm not going to pretend it was all a trap... but from here on it's an all out assault...
black gleefully accepts the mistake
16... Kxh7 17. Ng5  Kg6 18. Qg4 and black is in deep trouble...  and then if black chose 17... Kg8 18. Qh5 would win queen or mate... note how black's bishop is out of position after taking the rook... had he declined, then Ng5 would not be safe and black would be able to safely claim the aggressive bishop...
build up the attack and protect the bishop...
no surprises, stops me playing Qh5... when i first analysed 16. Bxf7 ! my intention from here was to play 18. Bb2  Bxb2 19. Qxb2 ... but i overlooked 19... e5, which saves for black... i assumed f6 was forced... so i had to abandon ship and find another attack, and quickly...!
! i was going to lose a piece anyway after f6, so why not sac the piece instead...!
and, though i'm still down heavily, his kingside is destroyed, he's about to lose a rook, and there's still the small matter of the knights, just waiting to be attacked... not to mention my awkwardly placed passed pawn...
and there falls the rook
it doesn't matter he can attack the bishop and save, even if i moved the bishop, he'd move a  knight...
! the problem with Qh7  was that black would then come out of the exchange with a tempo, and had he played b6 before i could take the pawn, my c pawn is blocked from advancing... this way, i come out of the exchange with one more passed pawn...
! wise... after 24... Nxg6 25. axb7 Rb8 26. Qf3 and i have a protected pawn on the seventh with another pawn close behind to back it up...
this surprised my opponent... he though i would want to avoid the queen trade, since i am down material... i felt the less pieces on the board, the more chance i have of holding him off and pushing my pawns... also, it was crucial that i kept the initiative so i could claim his b-pawn.
? ...but unfortunately black doesn't realise it... the losing move... there was much more chess to be played, i have absolutely no idea who would've won the endgame had black played a safer move than this one... if anyone feels like analysing it, please feel free and share with me your findings...! personally, i felt Bd4 was stronger, i'd have had to return my rook to c1...
what else is there? 31... Bxc5 32. Rc7 and black has lost a bishop and rook for two pawns, and still has the kingside pawns to contend with... anything else and i get away with a whole rook...
black resigns... now the error of Bxa3 is clear... his bishops are fatally out of position... black cannot stop promotion... maybe if it were my last pawn that promoted, he might've tried holding out for the draw, but this is an easy win now... with his king out in the open, his pieces are just begging to be picked off by the agile queen... and even if he did manage to hold off the queen, i'd just advance another pawn until he breaks... <n><n>so... a question i hope someone can answer for me...<n><n>should 15. b4 be a ?, !, or a ?! move...? i have no idea if it was a good move or a bad move... i just know it turned this game on its head... hope you enjoyed the game.
Take amoment of silence to take in this chess greatness.......................................................Okay enough!
defending carefully and preventing b8 knight or queen going to d4
...hum...i have to keep my b1 knight and be carefull of ...Nc6 ...Nb4...Nc2+ wining the a rook. And if i whant to play b2 b3 to open the f1 bishop diagonal, i have to prevent c4 c3 with Nc3
normal attack to free my f1 bishop and preparing attack to the king withthe a4-e8 diagonal or the a2-f7 one
ok, but my knight can go to a4 and stay there safely
now he has to defend and i won a tempo
the plan was Nf d4 ...d4xf5...e6xf5 and Bxf7+! ...etc.
continuing the plan. I supose that black prepare castle
now it cancel my plans and be about to castle. BIG regrets. I will do it any way d4xf5 e7xf5 e3 e4
chess and winign a pawn is coming after exchange
i whould like to take this b4 paw and gontinuing chess and opening the center to take advantage of the discovered king situation
threat the rook and preparing f4 f5 in way to mate on f7 (of course i know it wont happens so easily !...)
defending the knight
I thought i will threat a mate, forgeting the rook on a7 ! but i won a paw and open the f coon anyway
i should play now the terrible Bc6+! winign a rook or a queen if he move the ing on e8but i forgot it, it will come after some inacurates first moves
now i have to find the mate
if he plays f8 or g8 i win the b8 knight
He doesn't want the position to open up yet.
I want my rook in the center to open things up there.
The bishop is in the way there, but there aren't many places for it to go, and I didn't want to help him develop his Ng8.
? I failed to notice the knight was en prise.
Protecting the pawn and attacking the bishop, now e6 looks fragile.
Gains a pawn, protects my pawn, and opportunities to cause other problems in the kingside.
But now the queen is perilously close to my king.
There really was no way for black to avoid losing a rook.
Trying for counterplay on the kingside.
Sacrificing his rook for a dangerous attack.
I threaten mate, so he has to keep checking my king.
Black resigns, because of 38...Qxc6 39. Qxc6  Kb8 40. Rh8  Bc8 41. Rxc8#.  Undoubtedly my opponent and I made many mistakes, but it was a fun game.
54th GK Tournament, I'm black. My oponent opens with my favorite move, so I give him the Sicilian to chew on.
White chose the Alapin Variation, intending to build a strong center with a pawn at d4. Black's response is the main line, pressuring the white pawn on e4 and inviting white to delay his push to d4.
Still mainline. Black's knight seeks to prevent white from playing a pawn to f4 where it would support that advanced e5 pawn. This position bears a little resemblance to Alekhine's Defense, one move delayed with the pawns on c3 and c5. That extra oomph in the center makes this stronger for black than Alekhine's is.
Tempting white to give up the two bishops to double the black pawns in the center. Howver, d5, d6, and c5 isn't a tremendously weak formation.
OK, I admit, I found this line in the GK World Database and it appeared favorable, so I played it. To me, it looks like 6. d6?! is a dubious play at best, giving up a pawn for insufficient compensation. However, given the moves that follow, most of which is rooted right here, the compensation might be more than it appears.
This is where black would like to bring his king's knight into play threatening the white queen and chasing her off, gaining a tempo. But that knight has already been traded. This is still continuing from the DB.
Well, drat, white gained a pawn and all black has to show for it is a lead in development. Is it enough?
White runs his queen off to safety, but now the white king is in grave danger. With 12. ... b5! black sets the wheels in motion for a kingside attack. Yes, kingside. Black would like to play 12. ... Bd5 followed by 13. ... Bxf6 14. gxf6 Qh5 to threaten mate on h2. But there are two flaws. White has 13. Qd1 to protect his knight, and white has 15. Qxh5 killing black's queen from all the way across the board. Such a pretty combo ruined by white's queen. So black offers her a sacrificial pawn to get her onto a much better square. Better for black.
White didn't sense the danger. 13. Qxb5? loses quite a bit of material for white, but the checkmate is not a guarantee yet. Still, white is in trouble here. He should have asked himself why black threw away a pawn with 12. ... b5! and if he did, he may have stayed away from the poisoned pawn. The threat now is that black has 4 pieces (two bishops, rook, and queen) all ready to spring into action against white's king, and his queen is too far away to help - so is his undeveloped queenside.
15. Qc4?? loses the game. Black cannot force checkmate, but he can force white to give up his queen, plus more material, to prevent it. 15. ... Bxf3 is how it starts.
16. Nd4!! This is my favorite move in a long time. Double exclamation. White's only option to survive is 17. Qxd4 cxd4 and white has lost his queen. Further, black still has a decent attack, though white may squirm out of it. The beauty of this move is that Black wanted to play 16. ... Qg5+?? to force a checkmate but he cannot. White would simply reply 17. Qg4 and black's attack dies, leaving black two pawns down with nothing to show for it. However, from d4, black's knight obstructs the white queen. Even if white captures the knight with his pawn on c3, black wins by checkmate.
I would like to think that when black's queen moved here to h4, she gave a friendly little wave to the white pawn on d4.
Final position. A point of interest is that, prior to playing 19. ... Qxh2#, black is behind by 5 points. I mention this because I have been commenting on several recent annotations that counting points is not always the way to win, as this game demonstrates. Back to this game, white could have delayed a few more moves with 19. f4 Bxf4 20. Kg2 Qg4+ 21. Kh1 Qh3 22. Qxf7+ Kxf7 23. (any) Qxh2#. Did all of this stem from 6. ... d6?!. No, not all. But it set the stage. I'm going to have to dig that up in a book (it's not in any books I have) to find out how much of this could have been played differently by white, and if 6. ... d6?! really is better than it looks.
The best, I could think of... Black has to clear up his development...
Probably not best. I disliked 11. Rad1 Qc7 12. Rfe1 Ne5 13. Qg3... 11. Nxc6 leads to nothing...
Probably the last opportunity, to stir up some dust... 19. ... Qh5 seems fine for black, with a dead equal position...
Who am I, to call this inaccurate? This was the least of my fears...
developing with tempo
no need to take it yet
and my bishop is free at last
now i have to deal with that g7 pawn<n>if he moves the knight, there's a checkmate threatening
i didn't want to block my bishop again with Qd7and this way with my queen on f8 no need to worry about potential checkmate
defending the pawn
didn't want to exchange bishops and ease the pressure
and a nice combination leads to resining
Another passive square for the knight.
Trying to develop his knight to an active square.
This is the reason why I played my knight to d7 in the first place. Note that 9. Nxe5 dxe5 10. Qxd8 Bxd8 is more good than harm to me. If 9. Bxb6 axb6, I have an open file for my rook.
A strange, stubborn move. If Nxc4, to recapture gives doubled pawns. However, after the recapture, there will be an open b-file for either of us to use, but there is no reason why I cannot place a rook on the b-file first. Also from a book - grab an open file as quickly as you can.
However, I develop my bishop and attack the lonely isolated, doubled c-pawn.
He defends it with his queen - not that now after Rab8, he cannot play Rb1 because my rook is defended and his now isn't.
A passive square for the queen, and to support the c-pawn.
He castles, and after planning to play Rab1.
But I have other plans, eyeing the c-pawn and the loose knight on c3.
Oh dear, a most inadequate way to defend the knight.
Now not only do I win the pawn, the queen has no safe square to go to which it can defend the knight.
The queen returns to e2; I gain the knight, a tempo and the d-file.
This gives me no choice but to take. My queen is on an active square and I don't want to move it.
The pawn recaptures; now all is looking a bit better for white, despite the fact that he is a knight and a pawn down; all his pawns are strong, save the a2 pawn, which is defended now by the queen on e2. His bishop is in an active position, and his rook controls the b-file, perhaps eyeing to come to b7! What could be better. Flip the position and see yourself as white, compared to black, who has three groups of isolated pawns, and all his pieces save queen on inactive squares. Yes, maybe I am a knight up, but positionally?
Cleverly thought of. The rook sweeps out onto b7: if Bd6, this blocks my attack on the d3 pawn, and Bf8 gives a bad bishop.
But Bd6 is better, and it gives the bishop a better square.
Ne1? This move messes up White's 'what was a lovely position'. The d3 pawn is just about defended, and the knight looks ugly on e1. If a rook comes down to the back rank and pins the knight, disaster shall happen.
A great, sound move, in an attempt to get rid of the d3 pawn, and my doubled c-pawn.
Again, this ruins the position even more. Now the white pieces are in chunks; queen and knight on the back rank, doing nothing, and rook and bishop on the seventh rank, doing nothing: Not a pawn for a pawn - though this does leave the e4 pawn protect after the pawns are exchanged.
23. Nxd3? Actually, though it may seem like a good move, what is best is Qxd3; exchanging queens, and then Nxd3 after the queen swap - this loses a knight to Bc4.
I take the knight and threaten the queen, ignoring the free rook on d8, providing that there is no check available. This also threatens Qc1+ where mate would soon follow.
The only square in which to defend mate.
?? I can see into his mind - he intends to play Ra5 and perhaps get his rook into the 'game' - but this loses a bishop.
And the bishop cannot move since 27. ... Rb1! pins the queen. If, of course Bd3? then comes Rb1, 28. Bc1 Rxc1 and all is looking grim for white.
I am attacking his rook, but his queen is more important. Of course, white can wriggle - after my queen has moved, it is no longer covering the c1 square and so ...
And Bc1 - white is hanging on by his fingertips! Is there any chance to win?
Threatening Qxf2+ - of course, I could have taken the rook, but the pressure is on for him anyway, so I decided to increase the pressure. I don't like being greedy.
Hiding in his cove.
The only move. To be honest, is there anything black can do here? He could go Nf2, Ng3, Nf2 but he wants a win, not a draw! Is there any way to win this??
I've never been impressed with the Sicilian Defense.  I realize it's the most popular response to 1. e4, but White doesn't have to head into the myriad of Black's homespun preparation and still get a fantastic game.
This move of the late Yugoslav IM Rabar is considered Black's strongest.  White gets, at worst, a promising gambit for the price of a pawn and if Black goes astray, he can get crushed.
In my humble opinion, the game is dead even.  Black's extra pawn is very weak and will fall at some point in the game so I'm not even counting it as a material advantage.
Now it is two knights vs. a rook and a bishop.
Now down to business. I now think I can pull this off.
Black prepares a break in the center, at d5.
Accepted. Another option in e5, that leads to a well-known kind of game.
The best response, according to theory. c4 gets white into troubles - you must know it to realize.
I can't stop c4, so I develop. This bishop is going to be exchanged for the f3 knight, sooner or later. A key point of the game is to choose where and when.
I wanted to keep my c pawn mobile. If now c4, white has kinda returned me the tempo lost with the knight's moves. I forced white into a set, but it is not proven that it will be good for me (black).
Help yourself... just where I wanted you. The only chance to "prove" this opening is for black to manage an attack on the kingside, and castle queenside. White's pawn storm on the queenside must be feared, but it has to be seen if white goes for it quickly enough.
Simple developement, but best would have been c6, wasting a tempo but providing c7 to the queen.
I considered f6, but I decided that I had to be careful about the weakness in e6. So...
Wanting to open the column. Bg6 is the natural move, but remember I said my chance was to attack on the kingside? So...
I take my chances to begin a pawn storm. If NxB, hxB.
I have a spare tempo to hide the king, but I need two to get it castled queenside. And two to hide it in g7. In the meanwhile, white will lose a piece. But I don't want to take it with the pawn... here, Re1 would have made the game for white, on a quick look.
Now the bishop is pinned, and white must lose it. But it has counterattack.
I know I will lose the knight, but I wanted him to move his pawns in front of the king, while taking time to hide my king, and get activated the rest of my forces. Ng4 does nothing.
I have to find the way to activate my queen and get space for castling.
If I take with the knight, it will be pinned. But it still was better that this.
Let's see what can I grab from this. By the way, Rf5 was good before and still is. If Qxg4, Rg8 seems good.
Now, black probably wins, but it still to be demostrated. My opponend abandoned the game.
it's a bad placement for the d pawn, in this kind of structures both the d and the b pawn can rapidly became week and be captured
attacking both the bishop and the pawn, I expect Bb5
and the mentioned pawn falls
more space and some more restriction on the bishop
the queen is in front of the rook but then the bishop is closed, so it's not possible for white to play Rd1, if Ne4, I'm able to exchange queens with Qd1+ Qxd1 forced, Rxd1+ and now is Re1 Rxe1 Nxe1 or I'll force it with Nd5 attacking the rook with the idea of Re2 Nf4 Re3 Nd3 wining a piece, so white must play Re1 and allow the exchange of rooks also
and another piece is exchanged, and I'll get another pawn also
? Rb1 and black would have had to give up the exchange in to R+N vs B+2N endgame
getting the exchange, if Bxf8, I'll save the bishop with Be5+
f4 isn't better due to Nxf4 and a threat to a discovered check with an attack on the e1 knight, as an example of a possible sequence: Bh6 Nd3+ g3 Nxe1
or better yet I'll win a pawn, and if Nd7+, I'll win a knight with Ke8 and now if Ne5? Nxe5 Nxe5 Bxe5
and white will lose the knight... so he decided to resign
to unpine the c knight.
Both kings in safe. Now white's plan is to take control of the center.
To fire the only piece black has on the center.
Now black has 6 pieces out against 2 for black. Black will soon be ahead again in material but, to achieve this result, will have to give most of the pieces he had out.
Mistake, black has to develop instead of carring on playing the same pieces. Furthermore, the knight is now on the queen side where he can not get very dangerous.
To free the white rook and take the black queen. (if 13. ... f6 14. Ne7+ Kh8 15. Ng6+ hxg6 16. Bxd8 taking the queen ; if 13. ... Qe8 14. Re1 and the queen is lost as well).
As he cannot save his queen black tries a counterattack but it's another mistake. Black trades the only piece he has out (the LSB was dangerous for black at this spot but the queen will take and play exactly the same role)...
Black fights untill the end.
The rope tights around the neck.
8...Kh8<n>Black's first move after castle is in order to protect the king a bit more.
.....Black wanted to protect his king more with 8...Kh8....and then he moves two moves like h6 and g5....Debetable decisions.
Bishop raid part three;
To free the Queen to attack the king.
Black doesn't want my rook of course cause if 41...Kxh5 42.Qh7  Qh6 43. Qxf5  Qg5 Qxg5# completely forced!<n>And maybe with Kg6 only an excellent player could escape from a checkmate combo.
And here black resigns. His decision of push g and h pawns was bad. Maybe, White's only possibility to win was attacking the king by the queenside. What do you think about it?
This is my favourite opening, Petrov's Defence. Black wants to open up the position, but his symmetrical moves are unlikely to lead to an active position.
Note that Black's pawn on e5 was still en prise. White could have taken it with the knight with little worry, but castling was his first mistake.
This move forks White's bishop and knight, as Black's pawn is backed up by the knight on f6.
Black can't save both the queen and the pawn on e4 at once.
At this point, one has to wonder how in the world could Black stuff things up.
Mistake number four by White. His rook is en prise due to Black's previous pawn push. Black needn't waste time on defending the knight.
Black wins a pawn and also places one of his own deep into White's territory. The pawn is immune to capture by the White queen since it's backed up by the bishop.
White makes up for the previous pawn loss, but his resulting pawn position is not quite as powerful as Black's. However, though it may not look like it, this is the pawn that will later give Black tremendous fear.
This is the critical moment. White has a pawn on its way to promotion, but it can be easily stopped. Black, on the other hand, is as oblivious as ever. Note that Black's bishop is pinned. It can't move as that would place the Black king in check.
And now Black's troubles begin. He thought that he would be able take White's new queen but failed to appreciate the pin placed on the bishop. This would still not be so bad if the move didn't place Black's king in check, but that is not the case.
Another break in White's series of checks. Black can now try to get something underway. It is of high interest that Black hasn't simply resigned. He has two rooks in place of an extra queen, though one of his rooks is tucked away on h8 doing nothing.
Black no doubt longs for White to capture the exposed rook on h8, as he can then play 34. ... Qxb1+ or 34. ... d1=Q+ or even 34. ... d1=R+, since he would threaten so much. However, Black has forseen this and decides against taking the rook.
Black's hopes of glory are now wiped away. The rook, in addition to the bishop, is pinned against the Black king, and the pawn on d2 is now open to capture.
Black now takes action. It is his turn to harass his opponent's king. This looks fine, but in reality, Black's bishop is open to capture by White's queen on d2, as the rook is pinned. However, White fails to appreciate that.
Black is very daring. Sacrificing his bishop, this move looks like insanity, but, in truth, Black gains an advantage in attack.
With this, Black defends against White capturing the rook on d6.
A very good move by Black, as his rook on d6 is no longer pinned to the king.
A beautiful game, not just in the moves, but in the astonishment it conjures up as well. Black was essentially down a queen but still won, with White giving up both of his queens to prolong checkmate. And, curiously, it all happened in exactly fifty moves. If you wish to leave me a suggestion for an annotated game, or want to leave me feedback, please drop me a message. Your help is appreciated.
I said I'd try the queens pawn one day! You beat me to it!
now this is not standard queens opening, but I do like to prepare the fianchetto for castling king side... Even if I don't end up using it.
knight out at f3 and cannot now be threatened by the bishop.<n><n>(though this is really a wasted move giving me time to take the advantage)
... but this could be better ?<n>can't really budge the bishop except with the queens knight.<n>and Its stopping you castling on the kings side... You'll have to start developing your queens side... (come to think of it - need to develop some major pieces meself)
ok thats logical but you still can't move the knight 'cept to go backwards h4 Nxg2<n><n>though Nc3 will still budge me and you can now recapture with bishop nicely.
ok time to develop and apply some pressure in the center.<n>knight currently pinned on f3 so can leave that situation till Nc3<n>lets apply pressure to the easily defendable d4.<n>And build that Fianchetto at the same time....
ok totally open on kings side now..<n>may switch my castling plans to the queens side..<n>f5 can now be met with en-passant (might be a good option?) exf6 stops the knight progressing forwards... if it ever could...<n><n>(another wasted move? whats your plan John?)
lets apply some more pressure to the pawn.<n>Hmmmmm how did I get so aggressive here - I'm black<n>should be taking things easy!
ok you're forced to the defence of the poor solitary pawn.<n>If I could attack with remaining knight? e7 f5 two moves to get there (threatening bishp on e3)<n>-- hmm there is also, of course Nb4 attacking c2 and rook in corner!!
ok, did some thinking around Nb4 ... but it's too easily defendable by Na3 ...<n>looks like it leads to attacking possibilities but nothing too promising.<n>Like the idea of offering John en-passant, and if he takes I'll shift e pawn -> f6<n>looking also to open up the d file ... castle on the Queens side... and have queen, rook, bishop and knight bearing down on poor d4.
ok took e.p<n>I'll recapture with pawn - and look to d4.<n>could end up with a pawn on e4 if John decides to take the bishop
ok. So you got fed up waiting on that knight and bishop trapped in the corner!<n>This may not be the way to shift things.?<n><n>I'm sure Nc3 is a much better move ... Looks like I'll have something to exploit here...
ok, its still on to open up the d file and put godawful pressure on the easily defendable d4 ... but in the meantime I also threaten the knight with queen which will have to retreat ... losing some time ... wheres he gonna castle??
Now to continue with the plans of a few days ago .. I belive this is sound.. and looking at it now John cannot now defend the pawn as that ill advised knight move to h4 now causes problems! gotta retreat and the pawn is lost.<n>Just what is the correct order to take?
You did what you had to do!<n>Now I have looked at the order in which to win the pawn only to find that things are a little tricky in the pawn taking department ...<n><n>especially with c3....
Need more ammunition - so to proceed...<n>- with correct placement of Queen so as to not come under threat from bishops or knights. and ...<n>- look to castle on Queens side.. bringing more pressure on d4 or ?d5?<n>remember!!!  be patient wait for a crack to appear....
oh well, we'll be needing to stop your bishop taking on a7 'before' casteling. <n>May create a save haven for knight on a5.<n>Settling for easy option after wild sacrificing fantacies !!
wow! very sexy indeed :-) didn't see that one ...<n>I play a quiet move and you get all haughty. hmmm have to think ... doubt setting in. If I move the knight to a5 Im asking for trouble (either queen swap and kiss castleing goodbye) or b4!?<n>though might be forced to, if you are looking to progress d5..?
ok - there's alot going on and you are just too dangerous as you are currently setup - especially worried about your two knights attaining b5 (Qn) and d5 (Kn) and then c7 having a very dangerous set of linked knights right in my castled den... supported by queen and bishop is disaterous for me ... So I'm gonna weaken your bishop and not give you incentive for progressing the knight on b1 to a3 and b5 ...<n>Gotta keep my kings options open here! might need to go back to the open kings side?
well you don't have to take my bishop of course <n>And as mentioned earlier your advance of both this knight and other knight to d5 and b5 is worrisome ...
so .. protection of d5 is paramount - may well castle on the kings side soon to connect the rooks.<n>your best moves here? - what I'm really worried about? na3 and 0-0-0<n>the pressure could become unbearable.
not atall....<n>'cos I'm sure your impatience may have cost you a pawn!<n>just for a *moment* you don't have enough to protect d4 ... and your easily defendable pawn becomes mine ??<n>- I've also thrown some conditional moves in here to disconcert you :-) though you really *must* take with bishop and then decide on whether to keep the queen or not?
take with knight to protect against dangerous bishop to e5
ok you had to protect your rook somehow!<n>this also opens up knight to b5 ... but I have enough to protect my pawns now and consilodate surely?
protecting pawn on c7 and connecting rooks...<n>one of my conditional moves ... not analysed too deeply but need to protect the pawn somehow.<n>I need to leave it where it is as it stops your knight travelling to f7 !!
Now this move is truely awsome! and may win more material.<n>not being fooled into leaving the knight there and protecting with the pawn to c5 ... this gives you too many attacking opportunities...<n>from this 'white' square I'm protected from your bishop and control many important sqaures within my own boundaries, including c7...<n>You may end up with your bishop back on h2 and fully blocked in too..
ok, you didn't like the idea of being forced into the corner with your bishop - with my pawn to f4? supported by knight?<n>You may well then lose both bishop and protecting pawn before too long then..
ok, this knight now becomes attacking to d3... <n>Whats the term for attacking two pieces at once with a knight? there's a term for it ... gone completely out of my head!<n>I'll quite happily swap off rooks here too; but either rook -or- knight to d3 is strong.<n>of course if you allow me to take your rook on d1 then when your king retakes ; both king and rook will be just in the right place for me to threaten knight to d3 and f2...
but this is the best reply !<n>this stops most of the trouble my knight to d3 could create...<n>and you want to retain the d file understandably.<n><n>you will not retain the d file !!
ok, you didn't retreat the dangerous bishop when you had the chance ... so I will take and target your defending pawn ...<n>hopefully I'll be 2 pawns to the good and game over!<n><n>conditional moves thrown in to scare you!? but the knight *is* coming in to d3 attacking pawns on b2 and undefendable f4.
ok J, now your in damage limitation! I'm not worried yet concerning d file.<n>Even if you do manage to double up your rooks - I can retreat the knight to the awesome e6. and begin to think where to apply pawn pressure.
but you don't have time to double up the rooks in any case! before going further behind on h3.
now you wren't expecting that ...<n>but as I'm now 3 ahead the quicker I can swap off the material the better.<n>I've still got the awesome Ne6 to come.
recapture with king ... may need the knight to defend isolated pawn
c3 looks good for you here and I may well lose the pawn in the center.<n>but then again I have both flanks ... If only I can get rid of your troublesome knight your king wouldn't know wich way to turn...
now this is a *mistake* defending my pawn too early and giving the pawn on a7 away too. <n>you may have won 2 pawns back during this rapid play.?
ok, nows the time to make these 3 pawns count...<n>force the knight off the board in defence of rampaging pawns.<n>This move also stops you approaching solitary pawn on e4 ...<n>- wow is that still there ??? hopefull back to 3 days per move now - that was frantic - nearly lost it in the corner..
ok, if it was a scrifice to allow your king into the center and the g pawn, you are forgiven. But it's not gonna do you any good!
ok my king can enter the fray too - needs to to help pawns reach thier destination.
take the g pawn and watch the h-pawn fly :-)
Now I'm totally prepared to march the e pawn home.!!<n>This was a very good game on your part - one mistake at c4 was the downfall! otherwise you were way on track to apply horrible pressure after my early dominance. Solid till that mistake, and from there your opportunities were limited as you know?
Taking on c5 seemed to allow him to develop his bishop...
His pieces did not seem to "point" at any side, and long castling gives me a rook on the central d-file - open thanks to my long gone pawns! My a2 pawn would pay the toll eventually..
En route to c4 or b5 - either way his attack will build up on the Queenside.
Here it comes! He has to take on d2 first now, and when he does that, I take back with the Rook, and then load a 3-piece battery on the d-file before he can defend it. I figured his pawn and knight would eventually fall, leaving me a pawn up.
Obviously, I have to take with the Rook(s) first.
This is where the problem arised. It was either Qf4 or Qg3, since otherwise I would lose the opportunity totally, and I retreated an extra square. Perhaps it would not matter that much, after 22. Qf4 g5, where I would still have to retreat back to g3. I decided not to give him the chance for another pawn push - especially when mine were standing where they started, so I did this. Would Qf4 have been better?
Oops.That a2 pawn has to take one for the team.
I took the Knight anyway, since otherwise I would miss the opportunity totally (after Black's move Nf7, the Rook on d8 is defended too).
It seemed to simplify the position at the time. On hindsight, this was probably where the balance tipped towards him, now that my pawns are doubled. Already behind in rating and endgame skills, this move was quite suicidal.
This just allows him to simplify things even further. I'm not down, and at the time, it seemed like I would be able to get a draw. It was certainly an improvement over all the games I had previously lost to him, and I was optimistic ^_^ - but perhaps just too much.
Checks at 17 and 34. Would it be checkmate on 51 had I not resigned?
?? This move weakens the kingside pawn structure for no reason. At this point I allready saw a potential bishop sacrifice on h6.
Developing and bringing my king to a safer spot.
This bishop needs to go to d3 anyway, now it's like an x-ray aim on h7 and soon I'll play e5 to unleash it's full potential.
I want to double up on this diagonal with my queen, so I have to move my bishop first.
First get the knight out of the way and simultaneously clear the diagonal for my light squared bishop!
! Nice move! It's also nice to see how all the white pieces are active in the attack. (the knight on c3 will jump to e4 in some lines to assist.)
I like this move..I've been reading this book called 'Excelling at Chess calculation' by Jacob Aagaard, a great book by the way, where he speaks of finding 'candidate moves'. Ofcourse taking the knight wins back material, but I decided to look a bit further and found this move! It doesn't threaten anything for now, but black should really feel the pressure on the kingside building up.
? This move loses instantly, but it's hard to find good moves for black.
15...Bxf6 leads to forced mate after 16.Bh7  Kh8 17.Bg6  Kg8 18.Qh7  Kf8 19.Qxf7#
In this game I was down but didnt give up and delivered checkmate.  I start off with the modern defense.
I attack his knight to threaten to ruin his kingside but he can easily defend with Be2.  He castles long instead
I take his bishop with initiative and attack his rook
I attack his knight and most importantly get her majesty on the c-file in line with the white king
I move this pawn to give my rook flexibility.
I make this move to attack the c knight blocking mate
Here playing black on a challenge asked by Juanefe. Against d4, I play usually Nf6 giving me the oportunity to play the king indian defense, the queen indian, the nimzo or the benoni. I'm not a big fan of the queen gambit, I find these games quite boring most of the time. The dutch, mostly the leningrad variation, look pretty interesting but I'm not experienced enought with this opening to think about playing it in a ranked game. Maybe in a close future.
Well, to tell the truth, this move surprised me very much. I didn't seen this move quite often and seriously didn't know what to play against it. Black still have a lot of choice and could transpose it to something lookliking at the QID, the KID or even the benoni. I think c4 is a little superior finally because it take the center right in the beginning, giving a lot of space to your pieces.
I was thinking about to transpose into the benoni. With the knight on f3, white couldn't play the dangerous taimanov variation. This opening have his proper name, the Spielmann-Indian Defense. The name come from of Rudolf Spielmann, one of the best attacker in the first part of the last century.
?! Black have good results generally with the Spielmann-Indian. I think the best way to fight it as white is to advance the pawn to d5, going into the main lines of the benoni. By doing so, white continue to keep his center pawn and take more space. The benoni is not considered as one of the best defense for black, but I really like this opening because some of my favorite players (Tal, Velimirovic) could do miracles with this. Anyway, it's rare that I enter into the main line of the benoni cause it's rare beginners know them (and I'm not going to help them to! :D). I don't like that much that c3 move because the knight will not be able to use it if black don't take the d4 pawn.
I think it's a lost of tempo at this point of the game, but it's still playable. White have now the option to do b4 to threat the c5 pawn.  I think Bg5 would have been better here.
The fianchetto on the queen side is often used in the nimzo and the queen indian. With this kind of position, there's a lot of chance than white castle on the king side, so the bishop positionned on b7 can create some nice attacks.
?! Well I'm not sure if it was that much a good move. I think it was a kind of high risk high reward move. Losing tempo but taking space and countering white's development on the queen side. It can pay as it can be a problem later because there's possibility that white find a way to take benefit of the weakness on b6 (only the queen can protect it right now)
We're now both ready to castle on the king side.
?! White underestimated me here. With 5 pieces protecting the d7 pawn, there's no way white can dream of taking it, the only purpose of this move is to do Qf3 to threat my rook. On a bullet game or against a weak player it can be a strong move and give a won game early in the game but in this case it will only result as a lost of tempo. O-O would have been better here.
! To me it was a great move, giving me the option to continue with f5 and even attacking on the queen side with Nc7. The computer analysis doesn't have the same opinion.<n><n>Computer analysis:<n>Inaccuracy: +0.37 » … Ne8 10. O-O d6 11. Ng4 Nc7 12. Bd3 f5 13. Nf2 Nd7 14.

?? Well I think it really didn't worth it for white to lose a bishop and a knight for a rook and a pawn. It was too early in the game to make this kind of sac; white didn't have enought advantage to do this and it didn't provoked anything. White still lack of development, not coordinated for a great attack and his pawn structure is not that fine.
Thinking about to exchange as much pieces as possible to finish this off.
Exchanging the pawn to not have the burden to protect it later, giving the possibility to dismantle the 3 linked pawns. My plan here was: 16.cxd4 f5! 17.O-O fxe4 18.Qd2 Nxe5 19.Bxe5 exf3 20.gxf3.
! I didn't liked the idea at this time that white exchange both his knight and bishop on my knights, moving my queen to c7. If my queen move, the white queen can get the d4 pawn. Nc5 will give me some counterplay later.
Forcing the queen to stay back, threatening e4 and give the oportunity to advance my pawn to d4.
?? Missed a very good chance to get a very big advantage here! Rxf4!! would have gave me the chance to gain another piece for free! I have made a quick move without analysing the position, just following a plan I had in head since a couple of moves. I thought by going to Qb6, there would have a lot of activity and combinations possibles.<n><n>Computer analysis:<n>Blunder: +3.53 » … Qb6 21. Qg4 Rf6 22. Nxc6 Bxc6 23. Be5 Rg6 24. Qf3 Bf6 25.

Now white have some open lines to create threat to a lot of place on the board. I have the advantage on materials but white can mate me pretty quickly if I don't move carefully(There's a lot of tactics for white here). My knight must protect f7, my dark bishop must protect f8, my queen b8 and d8, my light bishop a8. The position is now almost equal with a very little advantage for black.
! Finally found a much better solution, with the move of the rook everything had changed. If 31.Qf4 then d3 32.Qh1 d2 33.Rd2 (Qxe4 then dxc1 and I've got a queen) Qd4 and I have a fine position.
?? White was trying to swindle the game. I can't take the rook because I would lose my queen or be mated.
And I am obliged! Now it's time for the pin...
Puzzling...it adds little to his attack, and gives me time to do...
...THIS! I am now ready to exploit the hole on d5.
I guess my bishop will have to retreat...
...NO SIR! I always favor removing both of the opposing knights from the board over both bishops, and HERE is my opportunity. Here we go...
...Now his big decision must be made. Exchange or no?
Forking the king and that pesky bishop
Protecting my bishop
This was expected. However, I had little hope for the kingside pawns anyway.
Supposedly forking the rook and the bishop. However, the counterattack proved devastating.
I want to force the king towards the g and h files so my queenside pawns can promote.
Testing to see if he will go to the h file
The killing blow. He can forget about winning now.
NOW I am going to promote that pawn, and the knight is STILL pinned!
After this, black resigned. Black's only true mistake in this game was to underestimate the power that my queen had in the opening and the middle game. After I gained the material, black was toast. Thank you for watching one of my few wins. Feel free to send any comments as to what I might've done better. Thank you! :D<n>-Russell
Black is playing the notorious Hedgehog Defense which was pretty popular in the 1980s and early '90s. The idea is that Black can build a shell nigh-impossible to crack if he keeps all his pawns close to home and doesn't do anything "crazy" ...like develop his pieces beyond the 2nd or 3rd ranks. As weird and unchesslike as all this sounds, the Hedgehog actually is a difficult defense to overcome. White's soundest plan requires patience: it's simply to develop normally and to gradually play to gain space, controlling the first 5, and then 6, ranks of the board, constricting Black like a big python and working for an unstoppable breakthrough. If Black can survive this process, he can generally catch White napping at some point, and suddenly start playing "real chess" with pawn breaks and piece-led attacks of his own. Back in the 80s, the Canadian GM Duncan Suttles was a virtuoso of the Hedgehog, and occasionally used it to beat or draw with world-class players much better than himself.
Resourceful. If 12. Kh2 (a plausible move) Qh4, winning the N on g3.
After 12. ...Qh4  13. Kf2, Black has nothing.
-- ! -- Getting the King out of Dodge. Black's current attack will fade if he can't threaten to Queen the h-pawn AND harrass White's King at the same time.
-- ! -- Look what happens if Black can get his Q to d3 in the current position.
Despite White's weak play, Black has still reached the point where he's virtually run out of useful moves, resulting in this somewhat all-eggs-in-one-basket attempt to fertilize the attack. Sure, a sacrifice netting 3 pawns for a piece almost always looks like a good investment; but then you have to be able to *do* something with your extra pawns to make the speculation worth the risk. Now Black goes from a starting point of being a minor piece down for 3 pawns to being a Rook down for 2 pawns.
-- ?? -- Black finally cracks in a big way.
Black's attack has vanished and White is now 2 Rooks to the good, so Black throws in the towel. Far from a perfect or even pretty game (what with White playing just weakly enough to keep the fires of hope bright in Black's breast), yet still fun to play as blitz games go.
? This gives away a pawn and allows me to re-offer the exchange at the same time.
I'm trying to get the queen away from the area of c7 so I can do Nc7+.
I suppose Black is trying to get some control of the centre and develop his DSB.
At this point, I decide to try for a mate.
Checkmate! Feel free to comment and give constructive criticism.
Evan's gambit accepted. This game shows the danger of letting the center of the board be controlled by white. With accurate play, black can come out stronger, but not in this game. The more the end nears, the more complex the game becomes. Pay special attention to moves 17-21. I hope you enjoy.
Because of this sacrifice, white gains a tempo, and is aiming for control of the center.
Not sure what this accomplishes, the pawn on e4 is stopping the knight from advancing to the centre, blacks Queen is boxed in, and a move to g6... well?
Freeing the King of the Bishop pin, and bringing the guy to safety
Because of the knight on e7, white isn't too scared to develop his f-pawn and take control of the center even more.
The idea is to launch an attack on the king-side, using both Rf1 and Qf3. Tempo is very important in this game, because white has to win back the lost pawn. When black is ready developing, whites advantage will be lost. Somehow I feel this move isn't accurate enough though... If anyone has ideas (Qh5?), please let me know.
Pinning the knight and setting an exchange which gives black a pawn extra, with an extra attack on the a1 Rook to boot
Here blacks plan for taking back the centre is revealed: when the f-pawn can be advanced to the strong f5, Whites centre is quite weakened. There is one big flaw here, which will be exploited for the rest of the game: Black's Bishop on c8 is not yet developed, which keeps the Rook on a8 from entering the game.
White thinks development is crucial to a win, so the knight enters the game, connecting the Rooks, freeing a1. Only one problem to deal with: the f-pawn
There is one big weakness about pawns: They cannot take a step back. With this move, white forces black to take with the Bishop...
I can hear black shouting: I NEED SPACE!
And yet another piece getting active in the attack. If I were black, I would exchange the Bishops now...
Nice move, because white can't take back with the pawn (Rf8) and thus has to move the queen to a safe spot
Now the attack is turned around: Black has to move the knight
Attacking the f4 pawn, while Bb6 keeps the King blocked. It seems black has some nice options now...
This is a big mistake from black: It seems he can take the bishop in the next move, winning a pawn at the end. However, a winning position is also defined by the number of ACTIVE pieces in the field. Ra8 and Qd8 are doing nothing... so, how to exploit this?
This should teach black to take back when you can. Bd4 is the most threatening piece on the board now. Qxh6  is an option now. Take a look at blacks and Whites possibilities.... none good for black without loss of material. If you see any other option, let me know

This blitz was played on a lazy night, and it is not a "great" or "very interesting" game... we both made a lot of mistakes, and specially a lot of overlooks. I annotate it because I wanted to share some thoughts with my opponent, but I was disconnected. The annotation is mainly for us, but feel free to read and comment. I'm sure more experienced players will find funny my comments, the way I got "completely lost" in the middle of the game, and my opponent wasn't daring enough to take full advantage of it. Some nice positions for strategic (more than tactic) analysis can be found in it.
The b2 pawn is poisoned, as known... except that now it isn't, because of the f4 bishop. First overlook prize is mine...
Fiinally, white has gone for the exchange. The g2 pawn is poisoned, too. The exchange theory holds.
White has sensed I did it for a reason, and preferred to castle. Good.
Of course, o-o would have been wiser. But I wanted to grasp some tempoes, and the rook in d1 is just a temptation... When a pawn storm would have opened white's king position. This move is a horrible blunder, as white can go Qg4+, then Qxg7...
Assuming the bishop's control on the black diagonal was not too dangerous.
White blocks my pawn with his queen, half-condemning it to passivity. Well seen, I'm not able to safely push the pawn while white has his dsb.
Providing a square for the queen, and blocking the white's dsb. It was a bad move, since I need to avoid to expose the only barrier my kingh has.
Opening a line to a5. I have to spend one more tempo because of my bad last move.
Instead, I reassetted my pressures. But it was not a good move. I'm lost, at this point, I must admit.
This is a kind of position that only can be broken with a sac but... it is not easy to see. If I could have two pieces on the b column, Bxc5 becomes a possibilty... but I can't!! The queen is dued to c5...
I have two tempo to triplify d3's defences, if white decide to go Rd1.
Preparing to go h3, if allowed.
I prefer to open the column this way, since I can't avoid that.
So I can defend. But I am still unable to coordinate my pieces. I have the two rook dued to the defence of pawns... ugly!
The simple b4, here, takes advantage of the fact that if I take the pawn, Bb6 will win an exchange.
Just to see what would he play. Everything so to open a column for my rooks.
And this was a blunder, a tough one. Now, if Bxc5...
3.  ........... Bc5  - the Guicco Piano.  If the next move is d3 then this will transpose into the Guicco Pianissimo.  This is usually one of the first openings that beginners are taken through because it is an example of where the minor pieces should usually go.
11. .......... 0-0 - white has put quite a bit of pressure on the d4 knight, although it is well supported at the moment.  According to chessops database this position is deemed to be equal.  Both kings now get tucked away on the kingside.
16. .......... Ng6 - Ion stated here "I've had a look at the game, and I reckon you might have had the whisker of an edge in the early middlegame. A line like 16...c6 17.Ne4 Bg4 18.Ned2 Bxf3 19.Nxf3 Rd6 and then pile on White's isolated d-pawn would have given you the initiative (assuming the line is correct). "
22. Re7xe4?! - why not capture with the rook on e1 maintaining the "Bone in the Throat?"  My queenside pawns would have looked extremely edible to said white rook.
26. .......... Rfe8? - Ion stated here "But the mistake that really got you into trouble was 26...Rfe8. 26...Rfd8 looks much better to me, after which the game seems to be even. Later, instead of 31...Rd1  I probably would have tried 31...b4, to force off a pair of Q-side pawns. But maybe your move was at least as good. White never seemed to get much attack once the f-pawn went. Probably he would have been better off protecting that pawn (31...Rd1  32.Kh2 Rd2 33.f3 Rxb2 whereupon White just rounds up Black's a-pawn). Then Black would have had to defend on both sides of the board. "
29 .......... Rd8 - Oooh dear!  I am now a pawn to the bad.  Best plan here is to firstly try and pick off the IQP - I have queenside pawn majority at the moment then activate my rook - vital when you are a pawn down in R P endings!
37. ......... g5!  A vital move here - holds up the advance of the h pawn and Henry can now sandwich himself neatly between the two doubletons on the g file should we have a white passer on a7 to contend with.  It is essential that the white rook will not be able to check Henry in order to get a queen.  It also brings my g pawn a little closer to g1.  This will become a factor later on.
42. ........ Kg6 - and here is the sandwich and Henry is the filling!!!
44. ........ Rb2 , would you believe it, Paul and I agreed a DRAW here!  It seems incredible but should the white king try and come to the aid of the a pawn, the black rook will clean up the white g and h pawn.  Incredibly the g pawn will crown first!  I offered the draw and Paul accepted.  What a relief after being in such a dire position in the middlegame and a pawn minus to the bargain!
Trying to fork queen and  Rook, but soon I was in trouble.
Robles are solved  and now the tide is turning in my favor
Swallowing the bait.
Black played well enough to recover from a mistake and force white to resign.
With this move, the Queen is setting up to attack my King by attacking the C5 square and potentially threatening a checkmate.
My Knight to the rescue. I simultaneously threaten the Queen and protect against the aforementioned threat.
I decide to push a pawn attack on the flank because the Bishop is preventing me from Castling.
The Queen moves yet again, now for the fourth time. White has lost momentum and position. The control of the game has shifted to Black with more of the white side of the board under Black control than the other way around.
I press my attack with the view to allow me to Castle
Success! And with the retreat of the Bishop, the Bishop is moved a second time forcing White to lose time and space. The board clearly favors Black at this time.
I position my Bishop to threaten the F1 square.
I continue to open, to bring my pieces across the board to threaten the King and to protect my advanced pieces.
I threaten an exchange
I respond by retreating. Remember, I like the long reach of the Bishop and will happily trade Pawns.
I accept the exchange and capture the Bishop. Although still behind in points, I am comfortable with the board.
I retreat to a position that I can attack from.
So I have an idea. If I can get my pawn to the last row I can threaten to Queen and if I am challenged before, I can accept a Pawn for a minor piece exchange, and if I am really lucky, a Queen for a Pawn exchange....so I protect my Pawn with the Castle.
I offer an exchange.
White accepts by unusually offering to sweeten the pot for me by throwing in the Knight for a Pawn exchange as part of the bargain.
I oblige, and
My answer is seemingly innocuous, but it is designed to give me access to a forced check and a series of checks to mate. If White was to prevent the ensuing loss, she would have to at this juncture take the Knight.
Once again the offer of the Queen exchange
This time a Bishop check that ensures the capture of the Queen on the way to mate. White sees the writing on the wall and resigns.
Yes... my opponent attack e5 by fianchetto.
Winning move, the white king will pass to the black forthress
The rook protects the knight, however, the f line is now open for the f7 pawn.
The f2 pawn is under pressure from black, white decides to take the bishop.
The knight is essential in the attack on f2 pawn. However, the e4 square is guarded by white's rook.
Threatens to open the f line. White's rook cannot move to f1 because of the knight guard.
The h pawn protector turned out to be crucial here. Many thanks to okat for the game!
To put the bishop in fianchetto.
Black hurry to put his own bishop in fianchetto too, contesting white the h1-a8 diagonal
May be a3 to develop the knigh on c3 and play on the queenside.
Both player almost finished the development. White as more space, black can operate on the c file. b4 pawn is not really weak as it can be reinforced by a5. I consider game even.
Nf1 is better, to "rebounce" on e3, then d5 or f5. On b3, the poor beast has nowhere to go.
Played to avoid Rfc8 followed by b5 and Qxb5. If black do not take, b3 lock the queenside, then action will switch to the kingside ans white can breath a bit.
!<n>If c5, then b4 win. So,
To exchange white active rook, as I cannot give him the column.

Conditional moves up to mate
Black declines to take my d pawn which could now push to d5, with the trap line of 3.d5 Nd4? 4.c3 and Black would lose that knight, even if he makes his best try now of 4...Qh4. White can defend his e pawn and pick off the N later, tho he must use some care in doing so, to not fall into any tactical error himself in the process.
White has taken away Blacks Castling rights now, which is the only slight advantage he can claim. And it may come to nothing since the position is not a very volatile one and King safety is not a strong factor. Since the pawns are even where facing each others on both wings, that tends to make a drawish ending as well.
WT can trade Bishops here. But then the prior remarks about the K-side pawns would not apply to those on the Q-side as well. And WT would have a pawn on b3 to defend from BL attacking it with his open file and potentially would end up having to tie his pieces to that task. Which makes no headway toward winning. But overall, this is a very drawish looking game irregardless.
The king becomes more centralized now for the endgame.
Knight endings are inherently drawish in theory, but inherently not drawn in practice, for they seem to bring out the error potential of any player who does not understand their nature fully or who tends to play a bit too quickly. Indeed it is my ending of choice to enter when possible if I am seeking to score against any fast moving players.
The WT Knight is looking to post on g4, and BL needs to move his own Knight now to avoid losing his h pawn.
Black needs to play the logical follow-up of a4 now, having commited his King to action on the Q-side when he moved it there. In fact, BL may be considered to be winning after either response to a4 by WT, those being bxa4 or b4+. But it is a blitz game and a N ending.
Pushing the h-pawn because besides being the most distant from the BL King, it is a point of theory in Knight endings that Rook pawns will be the hardest for a Knight to stop from advancing toward promotion.
The N must be attacked and forced to move since it aides the e4 pawn to keep out the BL King, letting WT's King stroll on into the action now himself.
Ke6 would have given WT some problems to straighten out. And he can but it takes many more moves and a repositioning of his own N.
Notice here the blockading action the N provides with help from his K. WT would like to be able to keep the BL monarch at bay until a Queen provides the denouement, if possible.
6. Nh3 - Freddy has developed his knight to this square in some of my games before.  Although the knight is on the rim it can go to f4 or g5.
7. ...... g6 - black plans to fianchetto his dsb.
8. Be3 - Freddy clears the decks, he is now ready to castle queenside.  This bishop move also supports the d4 pawn and points at h6 with possibilities of exchanging off black's dsb and exploiting the holes should black choose to castle there.
8. ...... Nf5 - good move - puts knight on a more active square and black has the option of moving his bishop back to b4 or to put it on g7.  On balance, despite my previous note I think g7 is the better choice.  Black now starts a pawn roll, hoping that white will castle kingside with 9. h5.
12. ....... gxf5 - leaves the g file wide open for Freddy, but how can he exploit it?  Black no doubt would have liked to have put a rook on g8 but unfortunately for him the h pawn is hanging.  It would be very dangerous for black to castle kingside here and his queenside is clogged up.  The centre is very solid so the BK looks safe, but white is Master Freddy!
13. Nxh5 - the h pawn falls anyway.  Oh look, nasty, nasty, Freddy's horsie is threatening to come to f6 and fork the BK and the BQ!
13. ...... Be7 - black must now develop his bishop to e7 preventing that royal fork.
17. ....... Nc6 - the queen knight develops at last, but black cannot castle queenside as Freddy's dsb is nicely anchored on f6 - that is even if black manages to get that lsb out!
18. ....... Nxd4 - this seems a reasonable try, grab a pawn and attack the enemy queen and make way for his own queen to come out, but with that passed h pawn I am not sure that was a good idea.  Maybe Rh6 and if Bg5 then Rh7, blocking the h file followed by Ne7, blocking out the white dsb and adding a defense to g8, this would enable black to play a move like b6 then Bb7 then 0-0-0.  Black never gets the chance to do this however.  Freddy now does something absolutely surprising ........ wait for it ........
19. hxg6!!!! - here it is, here it is, a brilliant queen sacrifice.  Note that the h file is open and a white rook can go to h8 and surely this is mate?
21. Kd3 - the WK evades the knight's checks.  Black creates a flight square by capturing the g6 pawn.
22. Rh8+ - The BK's only legal move is to f7.  Freddy could win back his queen here, but he is after the BK which cannot run away.  Freddy now doubles rooks on the h file.
25. Rh5 - Freddy restricts the BK and does not bother to take the BQ.  Black tries to protect g5 with Nf3 but as there is a pawn on g2 this protection does not last.
...doubling White's KP and destroying his ability to castle K-side.
Rice is unafraid of the grandmaster: he intends to attack.
Zuckertort clears the obstruction to his center Pawns.
Doubling on the KB file, aiming at the weak spot on KB7.
Allowing Zuckertort to remove a guard on KB7.
In addition to his central passed Pawn, Zuckertort now threatens to convert his flank majority on the Q-side into a second passer.
A move my knight to b5, pinning his knight on c6 for the moment.
He moves up his bishop to unpin the knight.
d3 to open up my queenside bishop.
An interesting, though not unusual, move.  Ne7 provides an alternative if I decide to swap pieces at c6.  On the down side, a number of his pieces are temporarily blocked.
Moving my bishop to g5 effectively pins his e7 knight until he can move the queen out of danger.
He pushes the attack and has me retreating a bit.
Since his pieces are somewhat stuck, he moves his G pawn out to get his king bishop in play.
A move my knight off of f3.  My goal is to move my queen on to f3 for a possible mate.  A bit obvious because...
He answers by moving his knight to block the move.
My opponent doesn't see the mate I have next turn and decides to chase my knight away by moving his C pawn.  I was honestly expecting him to move his bishop to C6, but ultimately, that wouldn't have prevented mate.  At this point, he really needs to do Bg7, move his queen, or F5.  Probably the best move would have been Bg7, since he was probably trying to develop that way anyway.
Trying to unravel the pawn chain
This is my latest battle against kaboes, who, as I write, is currently 2nd in the Fast Ladder.  I'm 71st.  My record hitherto against him doesn't look bad but I think all my wins came relatively early in our history.  Anyway, looking for a hoick up the ladder, I decide to play a solid opening...<n><n>This commentary was written before reading the computer analysis.  I've then added computer commentary.  I think this demonstrates that I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time!
I look to disrupt his opening as much as possible with this potential pin of the N against Q, discouraging the Black e-pawn from moving, or so I think.
Now Black has the advantage of the bishop pair
Here come the pawns anyway.  This seems to be easier for Black to achieve with the Dutch than with, say, the King's Indian, since Black doesn't have to muck about with his KN to enable his f-pawn to advance.  The computer prefers 9...0-0
Spotting the opportunity to plant my N on e6, I sidestep Black's offer to swap.
Around about here, I remember trying to calcualte the pros and cons of each kingside pawn move.  No advance to the 4th rank seemed to help me, so I settled for this more flexible option.
Black develops his last minor piece and appears to threaten either to castle queenside, having ruined his kingside, or to try to undermine White's pawns with ...b5
So I demonstrated against the queenside, discouraging ..b5 and preparing an attack on the castled king's position if he went long.
Now it was my turn to launch a pawn storm :-)
?!  Onwards and upwards!<n><n>But, of course, the computer calls this an inaccuracy
Now there's an empty file for me to try to exploit.
Black, in turn, exploits the pin against my undefended Queen to protect b7
Moving the Q off the d-file would have sacrificed the d-pawn but I couldn't see a mating attack that would have made it worthwhile and Black's Q defended the Rh8 which might otherwise have been picked up after 22. Qb2 Bxd5 23. Nxd5 Rxd5 24. Qb8+ Kd7.  I don't remember considering the possibility I've just seen now, though, of 24. Qb7+ Kd8 or Kd7 25. Qxd5+.  Black would not, therefore, have been able to respond with Bxd5, so probably 22. Qb2 would have been stronger here.  22...Rxd5 would have sacrificed the exchange for the sake of defending b7.  It will be interestign to see the computer's take on this.
releasing f4 to Black's pawn, which solidifies the kingside somewhat, leaving White free rein to attack.
White prepares to double on the b-file.<n><n>The computer calculates my advantage as +1.47 at this point.
Black easily defends that threat and also covers b8 against the trick Qxa6 Bxa6 followed by Rb8+ and R1b7+
?  Now there are all sorts of possibilities in the air.  White has a potential revealed attack on Black's Q but the two squares where the N can check from are both covered by the Q and the Rd1 is undefended.  After the game, kaboes stated that he thought I could have done better from the Q and R swaps that follow, so perhaps 29. Nb6+ would have been better?  29... Qxb6 and if 30. Rxb6 Rxd1+ followed by R8d2+.  The computer:<n><n>Mistake: +3.44 » … Rhd8  28. a5 Qc6  29. Nb6+ Kb8  30. Nxd7+ Rxd7  31. Rd5 Rxd5  32. exd5 Qd7  33. Qxc5 Ka8  34. d6 e4  35. fxe4 Bxe4<n>Best: +2.13 » … Kb8 28. Rdb1 Rc8 29. Nb6 Rcc7 30. Nxd7+ Rxd7 31. Rc2 g4 32. Qxc5 gxf3 33. Qxd6+ Rxd6 34. gxf3 Rd4 35. Rb6 Rd3
Now it's a straightforward 5v5 K and P ending, each of us having one passed pawn but Black's K is nearer to White's pawn and White's K is outside Black's queening square.  Black has the advantage (-3.31 according to the computer).
Now, to maintain the threat to take Black's pawn, White has to move one of his other pawns.
Now the computer still thinks I could have done better with f4 but the scores are damning either way:<n><n>Mistake: -15.51 » 43.  Kc2  h4  44. gxh4 gxh4  45. f4 h3  46. f5 h2  47. f6 h1=Q  48. f7 Qg2+  49. Kd1 Kc3  50. Ke1 Qxe4+  51. Kf2 Qf4+  52. Ke2 Qxf7<n>Best: -12.98 » 43. f4 c3+ 44. Kd3 Kb3 45. fxe5 c2 46. Kd2 Kb2 47.

Because this doesn't lead directly to mate, the computer calls this a blunder!  The mate in 11 is one for Freddy:<n><n>Blunder: -13.40 » … c3  43. f4 gxf4  44. gxf4 exf4  45. e5 f3  46. Kd3 c2  47.

I believe the Sicilian (1...c5) is the best response to e4. Black opens up the position too quickly in this game and gives White a lead in development, which my friend exploits nicely.
In the Center-Counter Defense, Black wants to get the queen to c7 after c6. Black usually gets a more solid position in this opening, but White develops much quicker.
Black usually wants to get his light bishop out in the open before playing e6 so that the bishop isn't cramped on c8 blocked in by pawns
I'm not sure if this was the best move since b2 is weakened, but White certainly has more control of the centre despite his pinned knights.
This is a mistake by Black. Bh5 is better since it retains the pin and the chasing move g4 weakens White's position. Even after Be2 Black's bishop still has a purpose on h5 since if the f3-knight moves, Black can trade his bad bishop for White's good one.
Clearly the more logical piece to recapture with
This is Black's most active move, but his position is still horrible after he let White have the bishop pair. And if Black tries to fork White's pawns with Qb6, White can play O-O-O
This move doesn't appear to be dangerous since axb4 would result in Qxa1  but looks can be deceiving. Black should simply move his bishop here, but he ignored White's "pointless" move and didn't think ahead.
This is a big mistake because now Black's king's position is very weak. Taking that into account, Black's king would be mated if a piece could check it somehow. There is a well-known mating pattern against Black's king's position, where White sacrifices something to remove the b7-pawn so a bishop can get to a6 to deliver mate. Accomplishing that mating pattern doesn't appear to be possible, but it could be since Qxc6 bxc6 Ba6 would be mate if Black's queen wasn't defending a6.
Suddenly Black is totally lost. His queen is far from the action and can no longer defend a6. Black's position is weak and underdeveloped due to developing his queen too early. And castling queenside was definitely the totally losing move.
I'm not sure if Black even saw the mate, but if he tries to stop it, then White takes the queen and has a massive material advantage.
Recently, I've been using the latter, even though it does offer Black the chance to force the swap of my LSB by playing ..Na5 before I've provided the B with an escape route.
So now Black plays the more conservative 8...d6.  An immediate 8...Na5 would have given away the pawn on e5.  8...d5 is now less effective with g4 unavailable for Black's LSB or N.
and now I have time to create my bolthole for my B.
This B has now made 4 out of the first 10 moves, which seems to go against all opening principles but it has also caused Black to use at least 3 moves to push it back, including putting his knight on the rim, where it is dim ... Now the B bolsters e4 and points indirectly at Black's castled position, with plenty of potential for effectiveness later in the game.  The Ruy Lopez is typically a slowly developing game with plenty of potential attacks forthcoming, once White has established his pieces on good squares.
Typically, Black plays to restrict the power of White's threatened central thrust.  Black usually follows up by recentralising the QN and developing Q and B.
?!  Surprising and, I think, not very good, as it unleashes my e-pawn.  I'd expected either 11...Nc6 or 11...cxd4.
Clearly the point of Black's previous move: Black contests the e-file with this rook and probably plans to redevelop his DSB on g7.
Even though c3 was now available for this N, I preferred to perform the standard Nbd2-f1-g3 manoeuvre, as on c3 it would be attacked by ...b4 and either have to retreat to e2, blocking my R's file, or advance prematurely to a4 or d5.
Black continues his plan and I continue with  mine ...
!?  This took me by surprise but I couldn't see any advantage to this over the more normal ...Qc7 or continuing with redeploying the DSB.  Later in the game, though, the Q provided a useful defence of Black's third row from here.
Recapturing with the N wouldn't have been much use as Black would have taken the pawn on d4 with impunity.
I'd expect Black to retreat the N to d7 immediately.  This forces me to decide between blocking the attack with a piece or moving my Q to e2.  I'd rather not self-pin, if I can avoid it, so ...
and, surprisingly again, Black changes plan by blocking the attack with his DSB and attacking my DSB.
In the interest of completing my development, I was happy to allow Black to swap on g5, whereupon my N would take up an attacking position and give the f3 square to my Q, thus forcing Black to defend f7.  I felt that my position was building up nicely into a good platform for a devastating kingside assault.
I planned to play Nf6+ and, if Black captured with the Nd5, exf6, providing potential for later delivering mate on g7 or at least using the threat to win material.
! Black activates the QN, forking the pawns on b2 and e5.  Now came my longest think of the game as I calculated several different lines and move orders.  Eventually I decided to sac the e5 pawn with a view to prosecuting my attack and winning back material later if I couldn't deliver mate.
For some reason I had overlooked this, so I had to don the thinking cap again.
A good square ... eying the Ra8, should Black disconnect his rooks and building the pressure on f6 and f7.
Now I was looking at putting R or N on d6 and penetrating on the dark squares with my Q.  Both this move and the previous one would have been unnecessary if I'd played 26. Qf4, though Black would soon have threatened to shift my Q with 26. ...Nf8 and 27. ...Ne6.
Relieving the skewer and maintaining the R on the e-file.
So Black swapped the Bs.
Black opens the diagonal to my f-pawn and Kg1 while threatening to march this pawn to promotion
Counter-attack! ... but this merely forces me to move my Q and I find a good square for her.
unexpectedly avoiding the opportunity to attack my R with ...Kf4.  Now I sank deep into thought again, worrying that I had to continue delivering check until I could mate him, in the mistaken belief that failing to do so might allow him to deliver mate himself.
?? played in a suddenly defensive frame of mind, brought on by the feeling that I'd kept missing things and I couldn't afford to allow myself to be mated.  I should simply have captured g6 and, if Black checked on my back row, played Kh2, where the K would have been safe long enough to allow me to deliver mate on g5 or h5
looks clever but doesn't win the pawn back.  Simply 45. Qe4+ would have rounded up the c-pawn, and then defended a2 and attacked a6
the game consisted on a Slav defence resulting in a queen side pawn majority for black in exchange for activity and more space for white, eventualy white managed to create a passed pawn but black remained with three pawns against one on the queen side, the exchange of queens and some more manoeuvring lead to two distant passed pawns for black against one blocked central passed pawn for white, the transition to pawns endgame would favour black, so white was forced to accept a technical drawn rooks endgame
so white has the initiative, I'll just have to hang on, and latter try to exploit the queenside pawn majority on the endgame
again white shuffles his pieces to create a little more pressure
and gains space also
an illusion if I had any thoughts about Nxf4 with a discovered attack on the queen... but one never knows!
finally I'm able to castle in to safety
white is concentrating his efforts on the queens wing and on a minority attack
castle is fine here, as it frees my rook to action on the other wing if needed, while protecting the king
for now I'll have to keep the position closed, to benefit my knights in relation to white's bishop pair
pointless... unless white wants to exchange his dark bishop for a knight?
he does want to exchange bishop by knight
I'll give him an incentive to do so, and in the process avoid f4 with tempo
now Nxd6 Qb6+ hits the exposed king if I can capture the d6 pawn the endgame is clearly better for black
! inviting the exchange of queens... white has more space, but I'm exchanging pieces at a steady pace, so he would probably have a lots of problems to solve in the endgame, we are reaching it fast!
time to get back some space, my pawns can also promote, although I'm a bit behind in the start...
blocking the pawn, now if I can exchange the bishops we enter a theoretically drawn rooks  endgame, were black has the upper hand and white has to be careful with the distant passed pawns
to create two passed pawns, white has to capture the b pawn as if not I would have two connected passed pawns and a laborious but possible win
some more pressure, threatens c3 with tempo and maybe, if allowed, Rb2
due to my weak first rank I need to bring the king to the centre or create an escape window with my g or h pawns... the king in the centre can be more active so I chose it over the other option
next I'll move my king back to the king's wing to block any passer, and then only black would have a chance to win, so I expect white to go for a draw
? allows me to exchange other pawn... Rf7 g4 g6 and the f pawn is exchanged leaving white with two unconnected (ergo easier to attack) pawns
white have either to defend the pawn or give check, moving the king would lose the pawn
to prevent Re6, next I'll march my king back to the king's wing to block the pawn, releasing one of the rooks from defensive tasks... let's see what white has to say about that, the main idea for white is to try to exchange at least one of the rooks and then try to push the a pawn foreword to get him under more pressure
white started approaching the king to the fighting area...
denying white access to g5
to get my king closer to action also, and defend the 6th rank
the only open column for white's rook to infiltrate my field...
white's idea must be, to play Rg1-g6..., but if Rg1 I have Ke7 and Rxf5+ then if Kxh6 Rf6 forces Rxf6 Kxf6 and I'll win because white's king is trapped on the h column
the advance of the a pawn forces white to exchange yet another pawn
now I'll get my king to back up my rook and even if white exchanges rooks, the recapture with the king assures the draw, a I'll be able to control the promotion square
keeping the king close to the rook as planed
to get to h7
Rh7-Rxh7 forcing the exchange of rooks and I'll play Kf6 after the exchange to block the king on the h column forcing a draw
I'll keep moving my king, the rook stays on f6 until white decides to exchange...
now I'll sacrifice the h pawn to try and force a draw... if Kxh6 Rf6+ Rf6 Kf7... and white's king is trapped on the h column depending on his reply I can even win this game if he plays with as much objectiveness as before
not yet, it's hard to abandon one pawn advantage to accept a draw...
can I get to g4?
if 84.Rg6 to block I'll play Rb1 and defend the h pawn from behind...
now I'll give some checks either on b7 and b8 and if white plays Rg7 or Rg8 I'll play Rb1 to defend the pawn from behind
I've changed my mind if white plays h6 I'll play Rb6 and keep defending from the side, if white plays his rook along the 7th rank I'll play Kg5 threatening to capture the h pawn with the king
and now:<n>if Kh8 I have Kf6 <n>if Rg7 I have Rb6 back to the initial position for the second time
I'll keep my king on f6 or f5 and shift my rook along the b column
two after h6 and with black king on f5
white can still use the f column to do this cat and mouse game avoiding the draw, but after it he has to go back or lose the h pawn
Pawn Steamroller. I had my eye on chasing away the knight at c3 so I could win the pawn at e4.<n><n>I should have paid more attention.
Not 11 .. Nxd5? because after 12. Pxd5 there is no escape for black's pinned knight at f6.
Not 12. ... cxb4 because 13. Nxb4 let's white put two minor pieces on the black knight at c6. I would have to bring back my bishop with 13. ... Bd2 which feels like undeveloping. Black couldn't play 13. ... Qxb4 because of 14. Bxc6  and 15. Bxa8.
After all the exchange, white lets up a little of the pressure he had put on black, but my plan to come out a pawn ahead has fallen very flat.
Well, I didn't get to win the pawn at e4, so I attack the pinned knight. This move doesn't really work, because white has 16. Ne5 or 16. Nd4 to threaten the black queen. It looks like an even exchange, with the added threat that black's queen is the only defender preventing white from playing Nc7  followed by Nxa8.
The pinned pawn can't take the knight yet, but it doesn't seem to be going anywhere. However, white still has Ne5 (prevents black from playing Qd7).
White missed his chances to save the knight so it's time to take it. To be fair, I hadn't considered the counterattack option myself or I would have taken it sooner.
Wanting to dislodge the knight from its camp in my territory.
This turns out to have been a dubious move. I was thinking along the lines of 22. Bxf6 (to break pawn structure) Pxf6 23 Qxa6 Qxa6, 24 Rxa6 Rg8  25 Kh1 Bxf3  . Or some other variation involving a rook on the open G file if white exchanged with 22 Bxf6.
The plan is underway. Now I expect white to chase my king around for a while but once I get him out of danger, maybe I can find that checkmate. However, I began to notice that now white as both rooks in powerful places (or soon will) and they support his pawn advance against my one rook. My other rook and bishop are on their starting squares with nowhere to go. There are a lot of variations from this point that end up with white promoting his advanced pawn, or forcing black to give up material to prevent it. I'm working out variation after variation and they're almost all bad for black - I have to play very carefully here.
After 26 Ra3 I was suddenly very afraid. Everything I was considering ended with white playing Rb3  and Ra1  . I condisdered Nd5 so I could block the checkmate but that would cost me my bishop. I almost didn't see 26 ... Bd5 until the last moment when I was about to play Nd5. I guess I was panicking a bit, after all the variations I had been running through where white promotes pawns or crunches half of my pieces. <n><n>Lesson learned: panic is bad...
Out of the clear blue sky. I was expecting some effort by white to double his rooks and try to promote his pawn. It was so annoying that we were approaching 30 moves and my bishop was still sitting on his starting square, locking my rook on his starting square too. And then white completely forgets about his bank rank. Maybe that hole at g2 lulled him into a false sense of security.<n><n>What I didn't expect was white to leave his back rank unprotected.
I think this is an intresting move. It will be hard to develop the queen and connect the rooks, though.
First, develop my LSB, so I am then ready to play e6
Develops my queen, protects the c6 knight and connects the rooks. 3 in 1!
Chasing away the bishop,
An interesting move, probably played with the aim of retaining the bishop pair if Na5 and playing b4.
Another possibility was Bg4 pinning the f3 knight taking further control of d4. However, the bishop on g7 will aid in the control of the central dark-squares.
Covering d5 and preparing to break open the center with d5.
A better place for the bishop is on g5 where it pins the black knight.
I played this instead of exd5 because the only way for white to safely dispose of the knight is to take with the bishop which gives me the bishop pair. Taking with the knight fails to exd5 B moves Bxb2 winning a pawn. If white doesn't take then I can double his pawns.
I believe black has a nice advantage because he has the bishop pair, central control and more space.
Getting the rook off the bishop's diagonal.
Developing the bishop, although it appears to have no future here, I plan to play c4 to try to clear up its diagonal and turn white's cpawn into a potential weakness.
Blocking the bishop's attack on my a7 pawn.
I now plan to target the d-pawn and prevent it from becoming a powerful passed pawn.
I prefer g3 followed by h4. placing his pawns on the opposite color as my bishop.
Placing my pawns on dark-squares to keep his on light-squares. I think g5 was stronger.
Bringing my king to strengthen the bishop and help blockade d4.
My king has now replaced the bishop as the blockader of the pawn.
Picking up the d-pawn and he resigns.
So now the queen starts to get eyed up.
? only reason for the question mark is this typical every day move gave me something to aim for. A plan to get Qc3.
As i refer to in the first page this is where my opponent advised me he lost heart and felt he lost the game and threw away his victory. My low rating little plan had worked.
Since I have been reading alot of annotation from marin, heinz etc they usually talk about keeping tempi so instead of steaming in i thought about keeping tempi as long as i can and cause black maximum trouble especially as whites position aint great. also i got a message saying "weaken my kingside then" those messages make me suspicious so i took my time on this one, amazingly about 2 days....had christmas shopping to do though as well.
thought this was best forces black to lose castling rights and leaves his king in a position where i can get to him. also keeps tempi firmly with white.
I really wanted to play Rhf1 here with the possibility of gaining material but looked risky and wouldn't work as Bg5  so would have had to move king first and thought that was a waste. Also last time i took a risk against this opponent i paid for it.
best place for bishop to be, prevents Rd6  getting his bishop there was simple but also very elegant. (i appreciate nice moves like that, whatever the rating whoever the player)
keeps black from harrasing king and allows me to concentrate on greater prizes.
was tempted for the swap but again i had an upper hand and the bishop can only cover certain squares itself so the knight is much more valuable.
starting to make tempi work for me in terms of material, however black now gets to take d file and strengthen his rooks position.
ties my rook up but i still have advantage and blacks bishop is now more in the way than i would like.
Black resigns and i snatch victory from the jaws of a easy defeat! <n>my opening was terrible and had no right to win that match however 1 mistake and a period of tempi allows for a nice little match.<n>I'd like to thank my opponent for allowing a rematch to a lower rated player who should have been a easy victory!<n><n>Lessons to be learn't from this match:<n><n>Keeping tempi rocks!<n><n>and the big one: If you lose dont be sore about it smile and move on to the next game and take what you have learn't from that game. There is no need to be unpleasent and say "your lucky". chess, i feel, is about respect, humility and fun.<n><n>Thanks to my opponent for the game and my motivation.<n><n>David.
i tried to attack the opponent queen with my bishop
exchange of bishop
i am in a very dangerous situation..tried to escape from this..i castled my king
one of my best moves again..tried to attack the opponents rook
here actually i wanted to play Ne5 to Nd7...but i did not have support to my horse..again changed my mind and went to attack opponents queen
According to kibitz28.txt
Since I know where White's King is going, it makes sense to begin opening lines on the Q-side. The position of Black's Q of course may become precarious, but for the moment there's no danger. For example, 15. dc5 Nc6  16. f4 d4 will clear an escape route before White can trap the Lady.
Black plays to open more lines while waiting for White to push to h5.
! -- Activating the Rook with effect: c5 is the square.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This game was another nailbiter.  I looked destined for a 15-16 point loss when I found a match-winning trump card.  My a pawn.  I had the black pieces and I went for a kingside attack in the late middlegame which failed leaving dmaestro with a dangerous passed h pawn.  This gave Glenda a new role - a blocker!  She did that really well but before she was reduced to this ultra-mundane assignment she managed to remove white's a2 pawn leaving my a pawn passed.  It was a real worry that white's dsb controlled the a1-h8 diagonal, protecting his own passer and preventing mine from queening.  But somehow the game turned suddenly in my favour.  Anyway, we pick up the action on move 9 where I choose to move Glenda to e8 (recommended by Master Freddy), white replies with 10. Ne6.
12. f5 - answer - he backs it up with a pawn.
19. ...... Qa4 - Glenda has had enough of sitting pretty on e8, so she gets on her broomstick and flies to white's queenside to see if she can boil up a cauldron of trouble for white there.  From a4 she also has h4 in her radar.
23. c4 - blocks Glenda's path to h4.  Aha, says Glenda, I think I had better go back to e8 and try and create a disturbance in front of that white king!
26. ...... Kd8 - I try to amass my heavies in front of the WK but Henry must now find a safe haven, I just hope that d8 will do.
27. ...... Rxf3 - I sacrifice my rook for white's lsb plus a pawn to break up the bishop pair.  There are still 2 white rooks plus the dsb to contend with though.
29. ..... Rf5 - a retreat but trying to keep some pressure on the WK.
30. ...... h5 - heading for h4 and to try to win the white dsb.
39. ........ Qxa2 - my rook on e7 is pinned and lost next move so Glenda decides to take off the white isolated a pawn.  It turned out to be a match-winning decision.
40. ....... Kc8 - Henry decides to stay on the queenside.  Glenda will cover the kingside.
42. ....... Qd4+ - Glenda finds a tempo-gaining check to get her over to the kingside.
47. ...... Kb7 - it took me nearly 3 days to come up with some plan and I decided that Henry should try to shepherd my a pawn to Glendadom and at least make dmaestro give up his dsb in so doing.  Well, no harm in trying ......
49. ...... a4 - in for a penny, in for a pound, at least I now have the full 7 days on my clock!
50. ........ b5 - backs up the a4 pawn.  Yup, a pawn trade comes up but now Henry can support the a passer much more easily.  Dmaestro can curse his c2 pawn for it has been an effective screen!  I bet dmaestro wished that his rook could capture his own pawn so that he could stop Henry and the a pawn dead in their tracks.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is my third game in Master Freddy's mini-tournament about the Sicilian Grand Prix Attack.  For me it was third time lucky in respect of clocking up my first win (although the Low Draw with Yoshark - which he annotated, I was extremely lucky!).  In response to 9. Bxg4 I try a different response, g6 to see what happened there and it certainly worked out well.  Anyhow, on with the match.  We pick up the action on move 9.
18. ....... Qd6 - now Glenda lines up on the d file.
22. ........ Qd6+ - white now waves the white flag as I am closing in on the WK.  After the first two matches I see some light at the end of a very dark tunnel!
pushes the B to take or move.
Ba4 is usual, so you must have some logic for this. c4 is not a bad square for B but moving the B twice to get there is not a good idea unless you have compensation for the loss of tempo. In this case the logic is not apparent to me, and it shows you not following through the plan you initiated with move 3. Bb5  In summary, the move is not especially bad, but you broke a few tips - always play to a plan (even a bad plan is better than no plan) - and avoid moving pieces more than once to reach their development square. The result - loss of a tempo
good developing move. I would have looked at 0-0 - only because black needs 2 moves to castle and therefore 0-0 has more potential to apply pressure on the e file, and discourages Nxe4
I need to focus on my position rather than easily defended attacks
There is no point throwing pieces into attack unless I can reach an improved and sustainable position
This is not so clever. Obviously Qxf3 is the threat but you want N on g3 right ! which unblocks your Q and R, and defends f3. Always think carefully before pushing pawns. In this case you need mobility to defend the exposed K. Your N is in the way and the B on h3 cuts down options
When you make a mistake (last move) take special care with your next move. This pin looks dangerous if it continues - can you step out of it ?  Rf1 compounds the mistake
I strongly recommend you make a plan to play your favourite opening. Do not wander off the normal moves unless your opponent varies first. If he does - check the popular responses in the Gameknot DB and figure out why/what/reason that move is good. In the other games I looked at, you were inclined to make the odd blunder, in this game just a few weak moves. I think you need a check routine, before each move, to elliminate blunders/weak moves among the moves you consider. You might also benefit from a check routine/plan that takes up after the opening phase to give your play some focus.
I've never really liked this move for white because of black being able to force the bishop to waste a tempo or two while gaining the center.
? allows black to gain two pieces for a rook and pawn.
White allows me to save my rook to do one piece for two pawns.
I decide however that I like the pressure on the king better than the the rook on c8.
White tries to break the center open to activate the rooks in order to get some life in his game.
I want to open the playing field up for my bishops.
Threating the simple Bxc2 and then discoveries.
Attempting to break open the kings position.
The bishop is now threatened and I couldn't find a good way to keep it where it is.  Bd5 was possible but I was thinking about the back rank mate threats white could have after fxe5.
?? here is the critical error c3 was a slightly better choice though I haven't looked at it completely.  I was thinking c3 and if black decided on a sac Bxc3 white would play Rc2, trying to hold down the defense.  27. axb4 may have been bad since it allows for the following combination.  Have you found it yet?
I get the Priest out in prep for Castling Kingside.
h6 to discourage an attack on the f-Pawn.
Discouraging the g5-f4 marriage.
A safe, quiet place to wait.
Bishop pinning the Knight to my Queen, telegraphs the Black King's intent to Castle on the opposite wing.
Knight before Bishop on this option.
Knight attacks the middle, and the Lady.
A mistake to not play Nf6.
The other Bishop forces her to run.
A premature attack on the Black Queen, but the horse can reside safely for a moment at a6.
Trading for the Knight, apologies to my Bishop!
It would be better for the King to capture the Pawn.
But Black will pay for the greed!
There's something to be said about the beauty of symmetry.
Allowing the Bishop to retreat while holding the diagonal in the face of a d4-push.
I sacrifice influence on the b4 square for play on b5. Black should probably play Nxe4 or O-O sometime soon.
Black decides to keep a Knight posted on the untouchable b4 spot. This threatens a possible Nxc2 and fork attacks in the future. This move also appears to leave my own Knight awkwardly en prise. A possible (read mundane) continuation is: 9.Nxd5 Nxd5 10. Bxd5 Qxd5 11. Qf3 which retains material equality but obliterates my centre.<n><n>Edit: After further review I realize this is a horrible position for Black.
9. Nxf7! In the heat of a blitz game calculations are rarely exact. I played this move in the hope of getting some tactical fun out of what seemed like a rigid position. At the time it seemed dodgy but I have not found a refutation to it. An even stronger play was 9. Nxd5 Nxd5 10. d4 Bxd4 11. c3
All guns to the fore now.
... but I don't need to axe both Rooks and a strong pin like this incapacitates 2 pieces for the price of a pawn.
Prepares the long diagonal for the Bishop.
Time to bring this puppy home. I had to keep an eye on the clock.
This was a glaring error on my part. I knew that the instant I moved. I should have played Qd4+ instead. The Bishop is awkwardly placed making the mate process longer than it had to be.
This is definitely a learning game. I hope it is an eye-opener to others interested in the sharp attacking possibilities of Classical lines.
If c3, dxc3, and Nxc7+, Kd8, NxR is answered by c3xb2+, winning. So,
No rook available for the e column, so I have to defend.
...planning to take advantage of the pinned knight. But I have to free the way for the rook, first. So I proposed another exchange.
If c3, Bf5.
But he went for the exchange.
I threat the exchange, and avoid the annoying BxN (future) threat.
Wise is to defend from c3, but again, I tried to be "creative" and "attacking".
This is more to free my rook. It looks as I have a huge edge.
And here I blundered badly. Was this position winning for black? Yes, probably. I show the following.
An opening experiment; I usually play the Sicilian. In this game I prepare to defend against the Ruy Lopez.
The Archangelsk variation. Black neither takes the pawn nor commits his bishop to e7.
The M�ller Defence. The dark bishop is developed to an active square, but there are two drawbacks, both of which are illustrated in this game. The bishop serves as a target as white pushes into the centre, and black ends up with a backward c-pawn.
Now that black has castled, the bishop switches to the new diagonal.
Black plays to pre-empt d5 followed by an exchange of dark squared bishops which would double his pawns (though he might have the better bishop as compensation). The knight aims to regroup via d7.
Aiming for g3, a regrouping allowed by the relief of pressure on e4. The subsequent threat of Nf5 was a theme of much of the middle game.
Trying to solve the problem of the backward pawn on c7. However this only creates more pawn weaknesses, at d7 and shortly also on the a-file. Ultimately these will decide the game.
The intention of this was to draw the rook off the back rank, giving my own rooks first bite at the c-file, but this was not effective.
If 27 Rc7,  then ...Rc8 and white has nothing better than the exchange of rooks.
For the most part, when Black tries to wade in via these more passive pawn-openers, I enjoy going for the center immediately. However, Black has an intriguing variation in mind...
Not e5 just yet. I want to make sure I have some decent stake in development before I start launching a Queen-chase. And frankly, f3 is an amazing square for White's knight in the openings.
Black continues the plan to pin my knight, threatening a doubling of the c pawns.
Black's Queen doesn't have many places to go. If Qg6, then forced becomes Nh4! Qh7, Bd3 g6, or else the Queen must be given up. In this line, the kingside is cramped and misplaced, and slightly more defensible for Black would appear to be aiming for a O-O-O. But this would require at least two more moves of development, and White already has an attacking synergy. If Qd8, O-O-O is virtually outright discouraged and Black has lost massive amounts of tempo. White has a clear advantage here already- which you're about to see me blow completely.
Ugh. When I was looking through this, I was telling myself that I didn't really care so much had Black played Bxc3, because if Bxc3+, bxc3 seems to help White move control of the center along. White would have pawns on c3-d4-e5, which allows my side of the board more space to pressure Black for being too cramped in. The doubled pawn on c4 could go to c5, and help me control virtually every dark square that I'd need to pressure Black's King wherever they decide to castle. So I play this, thinking I can keep boxing Black in, while completely forgetting that this was just about my worst possible move. d4 was so central to all of my attacking and defending plans. This was just an awful case of a brain lapse on my part.
I mean- seriously, I told myself my Queen had this square covered, but how in the heck did I forget the fact that my king now has two pieces pinned to it?!
So I continue my plan to capture on d5 with the Queen, (cxd5 would come under fire after Qxe5+, which I can tell is coming at this point), but in hindsight, I was cursing at myself for being so greedy and careless. A huge White advantage thrown at me within the first two moves of the match, just for me to throw it right back in one huge overstep. I was pretty flustered by this point.
Not Qd2. I wasn't comfortable putting my queen in front of the king with the Bishop there. Also not Qd1, as allowing c4 and e4 to have fewer defenders would be dangerous at this point.
And here's the dropkick. Do I block with a bishop, or the Queen?
I figured the option that allows me quicker castling was probably safer at this point. Now that Black's energy has returned to the board, trading Queens probably wouldn't be in my interests either.
Black takes the chance to castle while I struggle to get back on my feet.
Hiding my king, developing the rook and breaking two pins, but even after all that, Black is still much better and with more tempo for the time being.
Blocking the mate, but not by moving the other pawn to f4 because Black can launch some nasty attacks on the exposed king, starting from ...Bc5+!
Now, Black plays this. As to why, I haven't the faintest. In merely ten moves, the entire position is thrown right back in Black's face. An opening blunder, followed by my own throwaway, and this begins probably the biggest meltdown I've ever had the joy of unfolding in a game of my own...
There weren't many choices. Black does have Qe6- being met by White's Rfe1, to play Qh3. But the Queen doesn't do much there. Any further back kills the Rook after Bxd6, so if Black didn't want to retreat the Queen, this is his only alternative as any other square is a dropped piece.
My own Re1 isn't going to be as strong now. In fact, this becomes Black's strongest defender. It's a pretty good move to beat me to the open rank, but...
Okay, let's see here... Black cannot play Qa5, or- a3! c5, Bxa8 and White takes the Rook absolutely free of charge and the Queen is too trapped to do anything about it. So if Black can't play Qa5, the other line was 17. b4 (Qa3), b5 Qb2, 19. Rab1 and the Queen falls after that- so Black cornered both royals after not answering 15. Bf4 with ...Qe6. Was there really no saving this queen, besides spotting this overly convoluted trap all the way back from his three moves ago?
Anyway, if not Qe6-Qh3 all that time ago, the Queen enters the enclosed Black Queenside corner, never to return to the game again, along with the lonely Ra8. I never dreamed of the bishop on d6 being as damaging as it has been at this point!
A waiting move, mostly. I want to keep d6 under my control, no matter what the cost is to keeping it this way. The longer Black goes on, forced to pin the d7-c6 pawns, the effective score for White is a LOT higher than just "+2", as now I only need to deal with three pawns, a rook, and a knight.
A desperate attempt to open the corner.
If Black captured, White plays cxb5, NOT axb5. The only pawn freed from there is the pawn on c6, and it just cannot be allowed to move under the current circumstances.
With Black's Q-side on lockdown, I start turning my focus to the kingside.
One rook, one knight, three pawns. Once they fall, the Black King is left staring alone in a faceoff with my remaining pieces, and that will never change for as long as the c6-d7 pawns are pinned. And it's about to get a whole lot more ugly for Black: with the rook on e6, capture is unavoidable.
In the end, it's decided against, and Black captures my strongest piece.
In return, Black's remaining power pieces remain imprisoned, and they will never reach the King to save it in time, as all that remains for his safety are mismatched pawns.
The King comes to shoo my Rook away.
Black desperately tries to free his queen, an attempt that just walked the King into an apparent Mate in 8. I didn't spot the forced mate from start to finish, but here I had a good idea of how to build the mating net. Can someone walk me through how the Mate was SUPPOSED to go?
But with d7 frozen in place, the other Rook can enter the mating trap without issue. Gameknot still says I'm wasting time, and that I'm still within Mate in 8.
-And now it's Mate in 5. So the computer states every time Black attempts to free the pieces, it's a losing blunder, but honestly, what other choice is there?
I was surprised to see him back into the corner, though. It's a fantastic flight square, really- somehow, I couldn't really see how I could Mate with only the four pieces. And I had to act with more precision right away- if I screw up the next move, Black plays Bb7, freeing the rook to defend, and it's only going to get harder to threaten the Mate!
And here, I think Black realized Mate in 2 was unavoidable, and signals having given up.
And here it is! The completed Mating net. Trying to get better at these, but all the sharp play this game demanded from me in order to keep on my feet made playing my opponent so much more fun. There was a lot of unusual play, unusual play that I had to keep myself focused on careful, calculated moves, because I saw the punishment in overstepping too soon before the game had ended. There was another game as Black I had due to the League setup, which was just as fun, albeit it more obvious and quicker. Hope you enjoyed reading this game as much as I enjoyed playing it! Thanks for reading this annotation! :)
Probably 5.Nf6 was more accurate, to defend d5 a bit more thoroughly.
Developing with tempo.
A bit dangerous to bring the Queen out so early, but White's got a lead in both space and development so it's up to Black to prove there's anything wrong with this.
Black has no good way to hold on to the d-pawn (again, Nf6 at any point before this would have helped greatly), so he drops it in exchange for a bit of freedom and chances at counterplay.
This threat is actually a bluff, but it's not an obvious one. If Black takes 10...axb5, White will win an exchange after 11.Qxa8! Qxa8 12.Nc7+, regaining the Queen with superior position and a Rook for a Bishop.
? White is fooled by the bluster, and retreats--e2 is the best square for the Bishop to land on, but now his Queen is lined up against Black's Bishop and tactics are in the air. Probably best were 10.Qa3 or 10.O-O.
! Seizing the opportunity, Black reclaims his pawn, opens the long diagonal for his KB and is about to trade off White's good Bishop to boot (after 11.Qd1 Nxe2 12.Qxe2).
? This error is more subtle than the last--and much more devastating. Now instead of a strong position, Black can sweep up a concrete material advantage thanks to the WQ's lack of mobility.
! White finds the best response. 12.Qd3 would keep the Queen at the cost of giving Black the Ra1 for free, but this loses the least material: White gets a Rook and Knight for a Queen and pawn.
Allowing Black to pick up the d-pawn with the Queen, and preparing to blast open White's kingside.
Taking the b-pawn is just greedy. Black needs to castle and get his pieces into the game--at the moment he's technically ahead, but White's mobility is vastly superior so it doesn't even matter.
Claiming more space and freeing up some troubling weaknesses.
22...Qc6 was better; at the time I wanted to keep up the pressure along the a7-g1 diagonal but Black should be using his Queen to create threats all over the board, rather than trying to force any one particular break. Black's next several moves reflect this bad thinking--there's a definite advantage, but he's just not making the right kind of choices with his extra power.
?? Big mistake--subtle as usual. Black can pick up the DSB for free now with 29...Qd8! where White can't spare time to defend his Bishop on d2 because of the threat of ...Qg5+ Kh1 Qg2#.
?? White allows it, and despite Black's reticence, he finally gets to plant his Queen where she belongs.
Too early, and therefore too weak. 34...Qg1+ 35.Bf1 first would allow Black to threaten ...Ng2+ Kd1 Qxf1+. The text allows the WK to flee to relative safety on the queenside.
? It's too late for this now; Black needs to regroup, get his Knight out of the corner. This just chases White's King off to where he wants to go anyway. From here on, Black continues to play just inaccurately enough--too comfortable with his perceived lead to actually capitalize on it.
Inaccuracy after inaccuracy. Black needs to play ...e5 and solidify his position.
? And suddenly, Black is not only drawn despite his material lead, but lost altogether. Failing to keep the Bishop under guard will allow White to play an eventual Ne5 and Black will have to drop his Queen to prevent mate.
1-0. Black makes it easy on himself and moves without looking at the consequences: it's mate in two after 49.Bg7+ Ke8 50.Nf6# (or 49...Kg8 50.Nf6#). Black's continuous assessment of the situation as 'winning' despite his position's obvious flaws led him to a series of inaccurate moves and, eventually, a totally needless loss. As the saying goes, 'Pride goeth before a fall.'  Many thanks to toughplaya for the fantastic game! I'll be annotating the second game in this match soon. As always, thanks for reading, and comments are much appreciated!

?! The Latvian Gambit. Black trades material (sometimes quite a lot of it) for open lines on the kingside. It's quite dubious and basically never seen in master play, but can be strong against unprepared opponents--and in blitz, everyone considers everyone else unprepared!
Not going to give a lot of analysis on the opening except to say that 3.Nxe5 is more popular. I have a big series of annotated games in this opening, so check those out if you're curious about it.
The e-file, and the e-pawn in general, will be vulnerable until the BK can vacate it, usually to the queenside. Opposite-flank castling tends to favor whichever side has more midgame attacking possibilities, and with the half-open f file, the situation looks like it would favor Black at the moment (as it very often does in this opening).
More pins on the Black Knights. Development is just about even, though White is playing more aggressively whereas Black has a better central presence, but more threats to respond to. I think 8.Bxc6 was worth a look though; opening up Black's queenside.
Unpinning one Knight momentarily, though it still can't really go anywhere if Black wants to castle queenside. This move also has the advantage of defending the Knight that needs defending--now White can no longer break open the BK's fortress with Bxc6.
Allowing White to win the e5 pawn if he desires and setting up the desirable opposite-wings castling situation.
?! Sacrificing the d-pawn for development and general center control. This also unpins the Nf6, and leaves the Rh8 free to relocate to the f file or whatever other file needs its presence in the forthcoming attack on the WK.
!? Choosing to hold tight to the center, this move doesn't prevent Black from losing a pawn, but it critically ensures that if White wants to win material, he must open another line against his King.
I think it would have been better to just move the Bishop back to g5, rather than opening the g-file for Black's heavy pieces.
Let's take a second to analyze. Black has the bishop-pair (though his DSB is pretty worthless at the moment) and some beautiful open lines against the WK. His center is decent and he has better activity, but he'll have trouble in an endgame due to his worse pawns. White, on the other hand, lags in development but has a solid position and a very strong Knight at e4. His other, more lackluster pieces can also be quickly activated by initiating a queenside attack. I'd give Black a very slight edge here, but only if he can convert his activity quickly.
? A few moments after this move, I decided it was probably a mistake. It's intended to provoke 15.g3, but 15.Ng3 is a far superior way to eliminate the threat; forcing Black to move the Bishop again and clearing e4 for a Queen or Rook. I'm not sure what the correct move for Black was in this situation--14...Rhg8 15.Ng3 e4 looks interesting--but I'm pretty sure the text is inferior.
? Not only trading a good Knight for a bad Bishop, but also forcing his own hand as to the response to the Kingside threat. As I said above, 15.Ng3 was much better, allowing pressure on the backwards e5 pawn and gaining tempo. This move is where it all goes south for White.
Tying the Queen to the defense of the Knight, and putting indirect pressure on the very weak f2 pawn. This also threatens to win material outright with ...Bg4! White's choice to trade off his Knight has left him struggling to find enough material to defend against Black's onslaught down the open files.
?! Trying to be clever and gain time to play ...Rhf8, but this aggressive move isn't particularly sound; 18.Ng2 or 18.Re4 are both effective counters. Probably 17...d5 or 17...Rf6 were better ideas.
This was the planned move, and now additionally Black is hoping for an exchange on f4 followed by Qh5, giving him a chance to set a nasty trap for the WQ. Ng2 is no longer an option right away, but 19.Qe2 or 19.f3 are both fine.
Critically, clearing the way for the Ra1 to get into action, but this Queen is actually on really thin ice--she must be exceptionally careful not to get stuck on Black's side of the board with nowhere to go.
! Closing the trap. The WQ has exactly one place she can run to.
Look carefully. At this moment, White has exactly one way to save his Queen from the carefully-prepared snare. Of course he can't play 22.gxf4?? since 22...Bd7+! wins the Queen. The only way to save her is 22.Qa8, where after 22...Kb6 23.Qb8+ Ka6 she can escape through d6. Obviously at no point in this line does gxf4 become an option, since if it's played without the WQ guarding g6, gxf4?? Bh3+ is mate in two.
?? Not good enough. White avoids the various discovered-check lines and flees from the mating threat, but leaves his Queen in the lurch.
I knew d4 was a standard opening move. D6 is probably not the best response but I knew e5 was what I wanted to follow with.
C4 is what I think is the Queens Gambit opening. I followed with e5 which I knew could result in an early exchange of the Queens and remove my ability to castle.
D5 to control e6 and c6. This also restricts development of my N on b8. Bf5 to develop a piece, establish an early threat.
Nc3 to develop and provide more control of the center. Nd7 to clear space on Q-side. Because of the cramped nature for my DSB, I wanted to maintain more tempo for the easier castle to obtain.
E4 to threaten blacks LSB and also establish more center control. Bg6 is the only safe spot for my LSB. The downside of not playing 4...Nf6.
White and black both move to protect/threaten the e5 square.
Bg5 to pin Nf6 to blacks queen. Erroding blacks threat on e5. Black response of Ph6 to start removing the threat.
Black finishes the exchange and is up a pawn with solid footing.
White threatens the unprotected black N. Black refuses to relinquish his footing on e4.
White further prevents g5 positioning by black. Maybe an attempt to relocate his N. Nf3 may have been a little hope chess. I was unsure of the best move. I started a bad exchange to force white to make a tactical decision.
White Kxf2 was not the best move and denies white a castle later. Black pushes to e4 and threatens f3.
For lack of certainty black castles. Activates a rook and opens up room for both rooks to move.
White moves his defense on the 3rd rank. Opens a window for black to exude massive pressure.
Cat and mouse. Black claims rook.
I saw moves e8 and c8. E8 would've been a wasted move if white pushed to promote. Kh7 was made simply because of a lack of understanding on why the best move was truly the best move.
e5?!  The pawn push creates an isolated pawn on c6 and doubled pawns on the e-file.
f5? is a premature attempt to chase the Knight.  Better was Bb4.
Qxe5!  White has a fork against the Black Rook on h8 and the f5 pawn (the e6 pawn is pinned).
cxb5? If c5 Black had winning chances to capture the backward pawns on a4 and c4.
I think i went wrong in the opening in this game and my opponent developed a very strong position and had a positional bind which i was fortunate enough to overcome and managed to win this game which was very important in the tournament we are both in as with his score of 100% i considered him a serious rival for 1st place so knew i was going to have to fight hard. The game was certainly very interesting and though a draw should have been a fair result we were both clearly playing for the win.
Indicating that perhaps the grand prix attack is on the cards with a quick f4.
My standard response as the accelarated dragon is not too concerned about it.
Bg7 is probably better followed by e6 and the Knight finds a home on e7. The Knight move is a bit premature here and leads to a problem for me as you will see.
Giving up the opportunity of the grand prix attack but still a good move as he has developed 3 pieces and is ready to castle whereas i have developed one and i am no where near ready to castle.
So i can slot my knight on e7 but the problem is that he is all developed and ready to go and i need 2 more moves that i have not got.
Of Course it has to be taken.
Thats the point he can recover the pawn at will but is threatening Nd6+ which may be very strong and at the same time Bf4 is not out of the question increasing the pressure. If i play d6 then he could play Bg5 or take the pawn on d4 and i have a weakness and i am still no closer to castling and his attacking potential increases and i am going to be in trouble very quickly.
I decided to live with the check and hope hye will grab the pawn as i want to retain the possibility of playing d7-d5 in one go and the flexibility of my pawn chain.
Got to be a reasonable continuation for white. He now just needs to get the files open and his rooks active whilst my pieces are in disarray.
Since i have allowed the check i have to keep hold of the material to justify my existence as if he ever regains the pawn i am simply lost.
Treading a tightrope with this move. My only developed bishop is now rubbish but i must keep the material and try to sure up the position to survive and i figured if i can get f6 in as well his attacking chances will be stopped for a while.
Putting the question to the queen and attacking the Knight on d6 and finally leaving room for my other Knight to move to
I can get away with this since his queen is attacked.
Keeping the pressure
I had to judge that Nxe5 does not work here as i can move to f6 with my queen covering the check if he followed up with Qf3+. I had both fingers crossed in case i missed something though.
Trying to pry open the lines
This i believe was also a serious error because of what happened. I think Bb3 was fine and in keeping with his plans but this led to complications that slightly favour me.
Now because the queens are off i can grab it.
Now the problem of Nd2 is revealed. My useless bishop has been brought back from the dead and my King may find refuge on g7 connecting my rooks.
I was starting to like my chances here. My position is by no means safe but it is starting to look like a position that has potential unlike 9 moves ago when i was waiting for the fireworks and expecting to get crushed in short order for my greed.
Normally in Dragons you shrive to keep the dark squared bishop but here every tempo counts and exchanges are helping me free my position so i exchange it off to give me time to make my king safe.
Kg7 was my first thought but then i am willingly going into an endgame where he has a bishop against my knights so thought take the Bishop.
So i did as he can't take on f6 really as after Kg7 both pieces are attacked and Rxc6 is met by dxR and my pawn structure is better and i am the exchange up.
Hurrah. Now whilst this might not be a picture perfect scene i am sure that many of you never thought black could survive including me and now if i keep my head i am a pawn up and have winning chances for the first time in the game.
Happily i move to f8 and my confidence grows.
This Knight move is very good. I did not realise how annoying it was going to be. The piece is a monster and controls a lot of key squares. My joy last turn was replaced with a gasp as i struggled to find a plan against it.
White too clearly has problems and can't see a clear plan as looking for cheap checks is not going to win you the game. I think after 23.Nd6 this game is drawn but i was happy to see this.
Since i have nothing to do with my rooks as they have no where to go and my Knight is happy where he is i figured try to pawn storm him to gain space.
This was the other reason since i knew that this was coming but it is really pointless as it does not do anything
Getting ready to double my rooks and play f5 if allowed
Happily defending and now i might be threatening to play f5
After this i was not convinced. Exchanging his weakness on e4 for my pawn on f6 did not appeal as if you take all the pieces off bar the kings my pawn structure is much better.
I want to know what he plans to do and want to solidify my structure with my other pawn on g5.
Defending and planning to meet g3 with Knight g6 and g4
My knight wants to touch base with the e4 pawn and defend d7
Great move. Now my attack has come to a halt and Ra3 may be threatened so what can black do??
Common theme IGNORE THE THREAT my plan is to give back the pawn with the break b5 to activate my other rook.
in keeping with his plan
I was at first surprised that he did not take the pawn but then i saw why. If he does after rd2+ he has problems as after the Natural Kf1 Rc8 threatens mate and my rooks are going to be all over his second rank.
Threatening to take the pawn with tempo.
He wants to get the rooks off so he can survive.
So the killer blow comes.<n>A very exciting battle and i can't wait for the rematch in the 2nd game of the tournament we play!!!
The grandprix attack.
Here my opponent breaks away from theory.  Usually one waits to push the pawn, reserving the option of moving it to a5 in one move.  The rook usually moves to the b-file to push the b-pawn after that.
I wouldn't put my knight here.  I would move pawn to e6 and then knight to e7.  The knight on f6 becomes a target later on.
A proactive attempt to keep the attack going.
Weaving the mating net.
His last desperate hope was that I'd miss Rxa8 and allow his rook to take mine.

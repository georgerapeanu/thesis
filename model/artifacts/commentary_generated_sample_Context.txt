the idea is needed to go to d5 with very classic space advantage.
A past while Kaul.
??? Now black has a 3 knight for quite two pawns. But black actually has the rest of the game and material advantage
Standard teano, Carl is Nicking doy by the Sveshnikov, attacking the f6 knight. The move lies for the center capturing with the sacrifice of the pawn, currently, threatens to win the Queen for the first time.
8. Bxc6 - Black's game is, now ehere has the extra pawn(disloy I'll proceed on a disadvantage at this point, but I think I got rid of it).
Black has 2 bishops.
Ok, so foolice one of pawns - material at a disagth towte squares, and putting pressure on the weak c-file. White has more central manR to life, I rate the queen and the black white queen. And with Ne5 myself, this can remove his own pawns still activity on the queen and two kingside pawns. I must think of this would be a good move, up. But that's say, I've traded down a pawn and have plenty of time recently things worked.
The fact that white gets doubled pawns, has managed to make an open game.
Basic attempt to defend the pawn to be a very open file, which in thorntable position white has more development.
now with the initiative white is mating. Black has almost won dretarded his queen.
! This is the abilities for the black 7th move!
According tournament, Chess Victory on OCCO, Wholy should black's army fork against Black's King which plays a very early.
Ignoring the Knanderi opening...
This line is also called Botvinsky Iulged. It is the usual line, or else it holds the lookar the power 2...f5 [And Black can also try] after 3...Qxd4 with 4.Bf4! Nc6 4.Nxe4 ! we're sound ( white) leading to an opening line and even simpler. <n>Qa8 5.Qf2 Nf6 5.Qh3(His is called Muzy moodern opening with Na3 which would seem to solve used the point of a long flow end on or he did not expect. But it is unless Black can proceed to lay the Master f rook moves to play d7 later and leave it not stopped.
End game, I use to now, it appears yet too early.
I actually considered this move in single line, but sound player, or he overlooked the Queen, allowing black to castle kingside. As a result, I was my usual defense this setup by placing his rook on an e file, giving the option for posing the present forces central pawns while creating pressure on the diagonal and developing the King-side and opening the e pawn.  The c8 pawn would be to be captured for a response (1. ... f6 1. Qe4 Bd7 14. Qxd5 Rc7 16. Rxa6) After this move, black can still be discussed. However, it possessentially this time and deserved his game 'vention' as well.
This is a huge blunder since I must do not want to exchange with my queen.
My opponent throws away a queen checkmate).
Let Material sufficient
over this, I can recall I've made some other mistakes in the game and I have tired it.
My here begins....<n>11.hxg6 Kg8 19. Qxd8 +0 - Material/cand Steinitz had a resource understanding.
! The best move
I think it's my turn
YO DES!!! NxR, if I recapture, the Queen? 22. Bxe2+  24. Qf3+ Kg8  25. Qxg6+ Kg8  26. Qa8+ Kxf3  26. Qxg7 Kg7.
This position seemed somewhere better now.  My h4 pawn is pinned, but Black's 5 pawns will not be trying to exploit within g8.
Interesting, a mistake since I've never been playing the French Defense. White does not want to play Nb5 here, now, however, stray... this game surprised me because White will play Qg3, having a spent time a possibility of a powerful day. But here we reach an important game by this variation. The computer play my move for rule: This transposed into a "bad" move is something active, not!
The second Bd5 to trap the N quick's defense (d4 is significantly strong, never play the centre, and the knight can go e4, e4 h2 for the pawn on the Black c-file), this would be sometimes serious significant positional ensues White's advantage.
Takes my knight. I figured though I have some flag: this should be a very good solution. Let's critical moves seems like a little to me know where the exchange on d5 is blocked.
White takes the opportunity to put the LSB on an open scheme.
I have a passed pawn. I steal some problems almost always Nd5 may have been slightly better - considering White's standard options in this position.
I think this was an ok-o. Blundraw after moving Ba3?? Bb3+ Bb1Nxc3 12.gxh6 gxf8 22 minority attack on the queenside
Blunder.
A good move for black, but it was not the best move for black? This just gives white an easy win!!
He takes...
Hmmm: 26...Rfb3 ffins the White King: on e6, when black wins easily. A traful in a draw has lost vein game which I am worthy of annotation - Joanne :) Certainly resign has all the moves.  I am still a plan.  There are sound this point,  White's problems (Show differently is when he had on to 24 moves), but the central wrench improvement may have been hopeless as good for white.
A game, I like this game is a very far-votexim move to an interesting chess during a chess mini tournament and I'm sure the destroath.
i have played this so I could say black has more comfortable and a good attacking position so I can take it.
This is a bad position for black in this opening; he temporarily opens the flank for Black's bishop.
black has other choice, to maneuver his position (pain).
At this point, Black had enough protection for the pawn. Black had a disappointed DB and now is stuck on the usual diagonal. Once again all what I'm still finding characterous.
This is a waiting move.
? No choice either ways checkmate!
The Nd7 calls Variation. This is a complete lead in development well, but I still have the already open d-pawn.  Black has the ideas before 3.d3 or ...d4 attacks d4. Black is feeling chalobilized the queop attack line if he opts for it, allowing it to develop the center with c4 would be one of the key defenders of those pawns that, so flawsh very much involved to the game.
the final line, semi-opening c6 for black.<n>Also this is advised would be a popular line of you having done the playing these positions and overwhelming tradition (3. d4). I often play the Scandinavian doesn't just play as many times, with him investantly centories, almost every rarely for it as a particular teeling. Nevertheless - reveal of it it stagged a strength wishing as white vs.
move it the queen out of the book and positional play has transposed into the Sicilian QGA; this looks good if black separate most White minor pieces with either check on a7, and with no immediate danger he has.
? This is not bad.  When black played 4...cxd4, white has a strong center pawn majority on the black position.
Oh no! But after which, I first won this game if he can work with. This is a very triversion and fleom!
Black has two passed pawns or he'd have left him with extra tempo.
Now White checks his king on b6 and then takes back the time to play f6!  This is the only the only time I thought I might make but for parity.
black recaptures pieces, pulling out the king on the back rank. The knight has gladly changed the Black King.
Black takes my c file pawn (And if this is a favorite opening, well)
good decision, ¬è3 ... Kxg3 7 Rh2#. Alats crowning a lot to black. It was technically the final trick at the moment, in fact, his knight is safe at h2 to defend my kingside pawns nearer either of the pin and even the game-together. Black resigns and even after this position I could have left aded a Queen.
Black now is perfectly foolish enough, but the win is just a matter of an ultimate combination and black clearly has no chance.
i did this?  I sure is probably a very good move for white
Black thus exchanging off his opponents pieces. The assault is somewhat done by White's passive Bishop.
!? (opening a6g5)
Black doesn't seem tough to get a grief with my pieces
I want to attack with queen and pawn. This bishop was stuck at move 3. It looked hard at the time, just been better (which doesn't move so interesting and increases up material)
I am uncomfortable with this position.  I can have their B favoring more it.
I retreat... but I mean an open line for my rook. They are also good.
See? And Alapsey!!
While seem late! When you are down on material and you can no longer trade the bishops. and the queen wasn't doing nothing. The difference by this move. He could have played 20... f5.
...so I take back with the pawn, and I've got one simple tactics involved. I already had enough time to take advantage of it. I don't see any good moves of the game, but if I can play Rd1, or Checks. Thankfully for reading for viewing yourself. I made it more moves like but I guess the opening wasn't to basic again, so this move was played with all the positional mistakes and it is very swindled. But I assured you would have to meet e2 instead. 23. Rxf3 Nxd2, or Bxc3+ is the only point of time I believe hard to. The main line White was still in the middle game! So computer did it as well, where I don't mean you me done when, and invites a direct threat. The sac is the mark general of being forced and it's future wind grade in the CHENY dsb and somewhere usefulness. However, thanks for playing, I wanted to 31.Ne2 and to we could won a shortice very soon though.<n>*White saw the sac: I had to play on viewer the kingside. Pawn on 3 with e2...Qa5 24.Rf2 Qxh2+ requiative
I resigned a draw- like this, but this is often in my previous spot. I now have a feeling I see what he probably would have played in chess and I was playing for a hopeful position but I don't see what the ideal move played in the game lost but notice, and I decided to be down.
If black does this, it was terrible to the King a bit longer.
This was a tough choice for me and it's sometimes refuses on it.
Trading Q for a knight, and saves it from the beginning of the game.
So the game reached position.  So far from books.
I overlook it. It is just a matter of time to get repeat.
prepare to exchange the bishop in return.
He had done this - why he played 27. ... Kd3 29. Qh5+ Bxc6 20.Nxc3 Re7 28. Qxe5 with my attack on time.
Normally sac a piece to take advantage of the habit. <n>It was encountering here so I thought that I didn't give my own mind as long as I intended. It usually leads to the closed game for 4
takes pawn
This is my first game I showed 1 e4 opening to avoid in. I hate it. I tried a move when playing move 2... d5 chess.
Two wins the try in this opening
6. ...... g5 - the black Knight repxP but on move 6 they've line in most Tarrasch.  Man any day, he hopes to get his LSB out.  This is a perfect later gave black awhile in the Sicilian or two tournament.  Although have three times I should have taken with the e pawn or maybe he play account of the main line which I have had played and even further one to generate squares that on the queen-side.  Analysis hope to make the year I your opponent.
Hi everyone!<n><n>How did I play a game a well thining out of such my bunch.  I went back with the Ice of my annotations because I am gifted where Mashly my friend issue on blitz whitz games could have resources to teach a superb at this part of the time.  Let's know from in a Sicilian but a nice chess gentlemory at a blitz, though I find way out.  Now, too exactly, here, dame down to Philid.  Here last round to spot for my opponent in...
And here both of the point of the French players go off--She goes to. The most commonly played move however I think the resulting style of ratings.
open lines indirectly most likely when my opponent seizes the d-file so I thought in this positional game at the moment. I was not threatening either, however, for the state of the opening starting  White cause a better developed endgame.
White wins a pawn, but 10.Bd4 shows White an extra pawn sacrifice.
We have a thorn sentarious position in this opening, heads for his pawn drops, and I let him recapture.
...and this is the first choice.
He has left his bishop on g6, threatening c1, and Kxe7 is lost.<n><n>there is no more denically forced...
Simple with this old - the highest wind by Tarpov or Petrosian variation.
Keeping the pressure on it.
This is not a normal square for the DSB and d6 is also normally piling the pressure on the e5 square. Clearly this leaves the diagonal open for the light squared bishop.
Finally a King rook shift. Nothing isn't sitting on f3, so Black clearing her post at home e5 with gxd6 strong play on the queen side.
Offering the exchange of rooks here is the most solid move Black has reached according to my backZaitinimaevniagued maintaining the strong friend of the binding her own evaluation of triuly building up immintage of a wide open Rook. 9...Nc6? was probably preferable, and my actual threat is to maintain a better position. So, at the same time for now that I'll have a better center, however I have little long find the better way to attempt to proceed, and leave his e-pawn advance. White will notice how I castled to defend and soon latter I'm queen just...
Now the h-pawn is lost!!!
a notast amount of pieces and feature out how lost.
This game was played in 1745 and played quite pretty good games throughout the databases here. This managed to feel a Queen's pawn still very unsound which can prove a difficult spot against such a weak opponent. We'll see how this works without being a departure.
CHAMCT players find out too normal 1?.e4 specific opening rarely what has given me the conservative play. It leaves me at GM Frixnified and the idea of extremely weak pawns against the opponents and opens the position.
I opt for the Ruy Lopez I put. It is not her best, but we'll see in chatess, afterearing somewhat english lines after this move, black has a tempo and is ahead from development. Perhaps it does try to slow down the inevitable effects and play like...
Closed because of this is the classic opening.
He takes.
Good play on the long term with it, but he can't help further advancing his pawns, so this he'd allowed me to move it.
I am totally saved his kingside opening now.
!! Of course, black gets better developed a minor pieces. But black has to give me a chance at winning the exchange.
I would have pulled the other B hard for this strategy.
Good move here.
I don't know !
Black resigns instead. If 31. Rxh7, QxN, Kxg6, 32. ...f5, Qxb6 33. Rxf7, d6, 34. Rxa3 Re6, winning the rook. Indeed have 34-1 moves agressive, though I'm going to think about all the pawns soon require to redevelop the pieces and shake that it wrecked superiorly instead of blocking his King.
If Black takes then 42. Kg6 loses.
From protecting the knight although his king was the pawn, it seems even better's no for him in any hope of pushing pawns...
Kxd2? ............. simplifying, White looks to try to win. He is down an entire time victory.
Black resigned.
CHEES This would have relief. The Black Queen should be owned that being a threat longer, especially when black was behind, and this is lost anyway.
Obvious and this results. I realise this is a draw. This games won was desirable for Annotations of a very good reason.
So here you begin to think adopting Black typical Queen's side in the thematic Indian opening companison to him.
The logical move. The black knight was attacked by its Chess and after 4 pieces, all in effective.
Black has little choice but to make sure not the LSB.  It however advances the Pawn from Glenda there first.  However, Black is 2 pawns down.  This can't win even a piece earlier, however, sacrificing the gambit pawn for full force.  While White is in trouble, Deep Blue did not be an easy win for White.
Bishops Queen's Gambit, Qxd4
white continues out his attack on the queen.<n>Everything is more usual.
developing the h8-moves was on development.  It gives white some problems.
This is unsure of a response to the purpose of N-R5 which he looks developing. Time to find a way to attack. So I chose this with the idea of a weakness too late?
This leaves Black's g Pawn in the center.
Black makes his spite trade of the enemy Pawns.
White has only taken moves to defend it onto the Q-side.  You start getting helped in the lines quite well as Black were heading for open f file and frees the queen.  The only way is to bet if black is taken that Black's fed h-pawn isÔøΩweed and white queen aims at f1, victory and his position??
Any third game. The position is lost, but a wing zw= (+0 brilliant and I had the time. Re7+ can checkmate on gameknot, thanks to 28.<n>The biggest problem is for black.
Instead of this flag comes from the battle of the Bard. Vany funnyeanwhere is mate in search one of the good games. You really wanted to try prepare an exciting game for?
Black elects to play ...c5 or h4. It also leads to a losing position if many wins 3 pieces for White. I would like to stay on both sides and say the game seems difficult for ;-) I am a good part of a 50000+ player after which I post attention a queen out against a rook which is a key defender than forcing your e pawn to assure this time, and I gave up having to expose my queen. This time, knows how to fight for going! It was, his goal here is to real-tle as I took the pawn being 2. c4. My opponent was black in over the bait. The lone purpose is for. <n>Somefoldry 3 minor pieces to just a rank mate. And so a solid one set up after the fact that he intention could be able to breaks sticking and the f-pawn
Black seeks for promoted passed pawns, so I must be done for it...
But, what sadly.
This was a fairly good ordinary reply.  The knights knight game is a very interesting game, where both sides can not last much against a exciting player at it, and it shows a menacing factor in one!
Unpinning the pawns, it is only a comput of the Timer's favorite match.
Probably not in the another?  I say, that I were my piece and look at the last2s...
?! Good play! The unmoving momentum has been 300 Many, with an exchange nowhere for the black pieces, black cannot prevent anything on this move as his thread at all, I have to retreat.
I don't know how. A very good opening in the center.
I wouldn't. Too many experimentless games this duty, black couldn't play d4, but at least it looks far too early to have less attacking options, and this actually stops how its tactics worked yet with a pawn advantage is harder for white to fight for the centre.
normal i prepared developing the d4-pawn while preparing Bg7-f3 indicating the knights.  His tactical situation strategy has shown me the game disadvanced into it prize and congrantly pressureded.
Now the game is in the 11th move of a Petrosian and this is an improving position for White. Dike 12...b5 entertaining keeping the ideas even more pressure for black, with more space advantage
Not really sure why this is not. I wanted to add time to center control, to jump to solve these positions uncomfortable position for me. I am not sure how we are but this works? I'll try I far, hoping for a real advantage due to all of black when pieces are locked at the help of whites king. So White's game turn to advantage.
Having made the threat harder as this was the threat I was able to give him a free move, but with it, in its own danger I almost developed.
White attacks the f pawn, and traps his rook.
this will provide a hind duck queen.  Black has cleared the double pawns but well is not pretty well played.
maybe , 22.Nxc6 would be the best move
Here is very absolutely the right move of the Queen when they may be absolutely dangerous.  The only good move is to force the trade.  Notice that it is not really clear how Black just responded.  Be6 as a suicient move, just as 24...Bc7.
CHan you see it?
The key and last move really good -- this position was "It's extremely well".
And it is, the situation is lost.  Blatewed at this point, and I hope if you have control of time before before KIn an open attack.  I was learning that I have utilized him and he's a draw!
My reviewed position on the endgame, and Black resigned in 1-0.
Note now, with the showing: ...Rc1: such as the mate moves else and this opens an escape square for his rook. Anyway, comments are tied after 66.Kb1 - which I mean some other mistakes sequence and pawns it is attacked.
When adeÔøΩevens or is a 300% wins a pawn in the game, Black's position is changed and is obviously cramped. Let's continue when the sensible threat of retreating the c8 rook instead of e7 the most unusual square for my bishop
He takes back
The King's Gambit, not superiority by Black, but Black gives up his center.
Notice how the development remains can lead. I moved around and don't know why I didn't put it. However... I have to find a better choice by attacking my queen
And black has a surprise really, playing very well, extending the immediate 3.Ncxe5 ?? is so bad. White has two pieces developed, nice and potentially with few pieces have weakening the Black Knight or the black f pawn, but the firm space is struck right down but as, then I haven't done the king-side yet
This is my problem. Whites 8th highly coversed Big Cenoni (most-losestero vs).
So here it is: normally, I had a pawn. I have to have two pieces developed, knights and minor and my opponent's indian defense, and I must say that don't want it. Later for opening moves, simplifying what I was part of the match.
Now white has to defend from the chance to use his h-pawn.
Black has now a passed pawn.
Not sure how i am going with this loss of material when i also exchange (or promote on c7, but it'll have a change of challenge that I have. Here, this does give up two result of Rc8, and wait at once. Thank you for what I was when determined my attack against this position.
I'm not in this opening. It comes for the figured best chess and isn't that play the Caro-Kann, even his favourite reply, very limited and experimented.
See?!)
White chooses to defend the rook but allowed Black on a6!
!! Getting rid of the most active piece. This move should have allowed Nb5 would win the exchange.
Checkmate. My win was commented and didn't see this one.
Hi everyone!<n><n>After annotated game  I lost a game I could reconada of  also annotated ;-down this one.  However, of course she ended a pawn up, if you not see a couple of rating points over the board while you can come off with.  Once again, I had challenged the accewannotation of this one.  Here is how I matched, there is a result of a double disaster which.  When the second ones and obsuccessful off with 1.4, she will reach another setup that he wouldn't have an advanced techndred king and pawn to be back conced for theheers.  Although white manages to win a pawn or two even if only 1 pinned.  This allows Black to play 1. ... Nc5 and almost 3.  The advantage in a Wick Witch of the West tries to contest all overall edge this is very error, I decide to be sound.  Just about the ratings:<n>13. g3 c4 d5  6. Nf3 Nf6 <n>6. cxd4  Rxc4 Nc6 against Ka harmon Trah disruz. <n>    <n><n><n>It has become, challenge off in the centre and possibilities and a slow ending....
theoretive move. I expect you to try it first, it's not for long-mid-not-to-looking to hold on to the center, but it starts off very sharp squares, while playing 2 target on the c-file, and the d-pawn in response to 4. ...b5.
This move is rather than incorrect anywhere the variation.
He prefers to stop a battle for a moment.
At this moment I am very happy with the extra dsb, but I don't see why I can move it.
This move costed white a tempo
Of course, this is not the best square for K- qd1 and also threatens Nd2 and in the process.
...and the game was lost.
33. .... Qg6+ - playing this here but I hadn't saw an extra move after 28 of this game for black.  Not too risky but lucky, and my opponent has a good idea to settle on manoeuvres, spend before recking the pressure on whites queenside.
now the bishop is needed. The glad d pawn has almost even energetic problems and the only favorable square is to play Kf2+.
Time left to address the d pawn
Black pressuries back the g-pawn.
(!) I missed his trading off Bishops don't learn how time I've made this exchange liquidation happen on Black's K-side. The real problem was an idea. Black's pieces are facing exactly more than two connected passed pawns, the rooks plus it also so happens to work.
The game would have won this move -- but black didn't get a win for the pawn attack.  I felt like play ...Kxd2, losing the g pawn before.
36. ..... Rd6 - I plan to continue a pawn push role in defense, but this is will the win
This was obviously a mistake, but i think it is too solid like 65. ...h3 coming to defense. Here, In reaching the comment original lines, we both. It was a harder puzzle of why. There was great opponent from this position though, but played the best error.
not to haven't to take too any commanders before making it before resigning. How to think this game is logical for the annotations instinctory, so take the first pawn and removilities the piece that can work out of the opening up with the middle-squared bishops;-he was pretty much of deprived an unclear positional advantage because of the chance for it if finished views in queen exchange can convert care to the advantages of their queen's counter-side pawns. The possibility of his pawn formation is to get traded up for his bishop, keeping my passed pawns down until the queen is almost removed from the pawn. His Rook becomes a nasty opposite coordination of attack trains easily. 99-0, knight in chess is far approximalty for me than possibly computers. If you were enough, or less thankfully thanken they are slaorgarily even play it. Aity they were all have been in it's time control and than good to break the chess, always analyze play whate on the previously tactical board. <n>This appreciated around your val moves cleverly, getting plan no choice on the game chend control of your rank, it, even if you don't have the way some reason for A Hart sk, and to accept as they like it fuggishing, more or less likely to be difficult than ose to play Sicilian in the middlegameitz‚Äô-game, have acrior structure of a little opening up..ngusge why matter virh that every possible game through great game of the advantablish time.

A king pawn centre.  He is playing white and begins to get a bit of interesting...
d4 opening.
not book
With doubling the pawns, White can at least miss a tempo but exchanging the Q or developing of his lines.
Possibly in a sense i wonder only for both substances
And this could be very high real estentfort, my opinion under harassment minor pieces:<n>3. Qa5 places the pressure on King. Knight on f1 and Knight on g2. I cannot play Nf4, which leaves him up position and with no way; White had no hopeless control and treats the initiative. Umbalance!!He has already been contributing to the kingside. This is just cause of mobile amount of greater knows of holes does!
All this is in the annotated game. 41. ... Qh5 23. Bh4+ After 23..Bee6 offering an material advantage and it can easily won up resload up for Black, now white will have another chance to posit initiative either win
The exchange is prevented however...
However, I didn't get another checkmate but I don't want to leave him up losing the lost one. But I felt highly enough and it saves a white rook and a win.
Drawing the lost of my lone pawn. If black takes on d4. <n>NxN,  NxNc5 would make the wrong move. But after   18... Bg5 29.Nxg5, white plays 20.Qd2 (or ). Kf1 is scatack of the game.
I love to defend so this
I don't want any counterplay with this threat.
he doesn't understand this and I have my Queen to cop up it in exchange for two pieces
! Playing the checkmate in two and seeing the threat of fxg6   BxR<n>Ne7<n>Black has a couple of times, things't seem to be a second time at what I did, but still I decided to play Nd4 without allowing this attack, but I didn't see it, although I could've calculated a master. Nh5 was preferably the right move. With the other hand, white's powerful bishop and queen are outside extra piece. If it's hard survive we exchange, White may have all lost another pawn. It's time black position is highly cramped and Black has time to have defensive given the initiative, develop his Queen is much a comfortable conversation on Black's king.
Black realizes this move, the move heavily disappointed his development via f4 and h5 is lairly weakened, and I'm ready to attack black's LSB by activitting the bishop. Would Black can make a difference.
Another temporary in our part. Zukertured now, it does violations just a couple of moves.  Interestingly, an aggressive example of this is:
suspect, securing black's queen, but his rook has the gain of some pressure on black.
He takes with the black king?
23. Rxe6+ - my maintained exchange of minor pieces when compare my rook.  I think this was the move that when you are inactive.
!? Will fortunately trade...
And so i think the game is lost, since i could not even resign now. Piet Queen move<n><n>Please rate this annotation on the game, and it felt it could do not help in time trouble helps.
?? The bishop is overwhere. His play is lost. This is probably more useful than the Knight being breathed and the computer analysis had was sealing nothing with this move, and positiono temporary (at least, actually Meanwhile we shouldn't understand the first piece), but it is hopeless
We play it, but for the most common alternative move for white.  I wasn't able to choose my defense for a kingside attack.
I employ his pieces are still developing getting winning for his pawns.
Hoping to play a favorind on this opening before this...
What's this?
what happened and skewer White's queen's Rook. Make it is often a crushing win. His pieces will join the attack.
Black would have any better defence: ...f4, RxRe1, winning my rooks for a rook.
Mistake.<n>Pt actually wondering how many players could I lost silly tempo and add it to the win.
Placing the Bc5 in the sicilian and probably are the starting position I have to prepare Bb5 at c5 if my d3 pawn takes the opportunity.
At this point I rean solidly lought this ricky gives me time to focus on d5.
!? White wins the exchange, but black wins the chance to d getting compensation for the pawn.  I think Because of the problem: 8. Qxc5!  Nxf5 8. Qh5 Ng5? 9. Nc6 cxb6 10. cxc4 [Qa6 [Amplixending the half-opening file.] ) 10.Ndcxd7+ wins a knight but it doesn't hinder cause White's position was so hard to see what kind of there is often?
I take a pawn.
time wouldn't't be the only chance to trust his position with c4... against a pieceetying the White Queen and pressuring the White side. Now White can't recapture with the bishop allowing the threat of forcing b7 to c7. <n><n>What of bind.<n><n>Uspect a pawn/move move should have constrained by this B verstagy settle as the h-file for both sides, controls a long way and weaknesses no real danger and advantage.
Opening the "bination" to win the game.<n>What done a matter of pawns for black, so woes, it just try to tell it so I just let him off. Tradov mixing my rook into a simplified endgame when the queens are defended.
Black should focus on castling
Black continue with the uncommon combination....
Hoping Next's position, this is white who humbody on white's homeas.
still I saw that after his Queens swap which would have been in another exchange for black, but now it is hard to find White avoid seriously behind his intuitive Q-side attacking. [ Notice that we can lock the bishops up and reach an isolated d-pawn.]
19.Qb3?? Qe2 - it's a furry for this game
White blands on the queen side.
This is one of my favorite strategy as it controls the centre.
29...Bxh5? 29. hxg5 c6 30. Rxa6 Rxg7 31. Rxf3 gxh3 22. O-O Nxe4
Hello everybody so, this rook exchange for a queen and D3.
Normally this is main line of move. This is an Ongive Philidor's system, but we fall in story.<n>... The line Open Variation.
9. Bb5+ is my best move for opponent.  Resigned to put a central driven away from the bishop which is wished to move on.  It stands clears like 8. b6 the way will prove an acsuss to protect d6.
for my opponent saw this hell Espasses the screwed army, trying to attack.
This didn't make it.
After a mini-tournament, white is winning. It seems because black has the small advantage of his two connected pawns.
This is what I played the Bird opening move here.
this is odd move.
check! white went for a draw. I would have kept the pressure on h7.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Unless quite my thorn on Gameknot Annotation tournament, my King's Pawn game!  Well my monthrough I was quite happy with myself and my luck on my opponent.  This is a sufficient rating of oldrnds against Freddy himself and is on a very strong 1000+ 170+ my  Knight-200 and then just gave her rating until move 80 without analyse Retrivin.  This man recommended a launch, Glenda and Matill, Wicked to Carlsen.  He did a previous game by Mon which I.  Ion and prayed it!  Anyhow,, Glenda is rare for the stalemate.<n><n>reheld Freddy could vert's game... Lowsen's pocketitife- and conjected *STimoakes make it a good me win for you (ollowing the more differently) costly kept and spanching material.  Here is an opponent might have been the fellowed Freddy responds.  Here is a while I made that I scenariously after senton move 40 occupying him after e4.  Eber Ke2!
Black has an articipated by doing this rather that move in the DB.  This move iso black's defense, hoping to share the Knight on d4 to be without any serious responcement of his f-f5.
IRuddenly miss their time of time. Get off, picking up a pawn.  But it is also pander to havoc with move and losing a piece for a piece.
This is the Spanish Opening.  I had already used book moves to.  Black's next move is excellent and g3 wanted to be played, though is my poor choice.
This move was played in devastating for White and a long time over the rest of this game.
...but his queen still has the option of a counterattack.
That looks unmoved
This bishop move takes us out of Sicilian Tromportion opening as used before the spirit of the Grobing Gambit.
Another mistake. It removes Black's move for promotes. But black.
My king is preparing option to thus far
The rook comes back to the a-file. It's protected by the blockading pawn on g5 it will be be a target. These should be seen that black would still have a nevanced decision to consequences for the next moves.
23. Nxf7++!!!  The crucial moment in one check.  He has two pieces for two attacking each other. *<n>The promotion would have been Rxh7, and, ..Qh7#) My King is now lost, and the extra protection is attacked and the king and his/light is gone.  The last hope of  your piece<n>19%15) The him 20. ... Na3 is a good alternative.  There are except my extra piece to bring and have this bishop to the f6 square, and it is the very good thing to make it in the middlegame.  White keeps himself out of the potential attack on g6.
He could have played Rg3ch, but still, IOTARUSATTS BOIBT ANORW meaning you find good!.....
Black regrets according to the his stokogthal Q-side, but this sort of guarding f5 and the rook at the very route whilst attempting to seek his N a p.
This is how the "threater" completely made. Trying to finish the win
Black resigns.
this is just a bad place, and Q side Pawns on the 2-1 diagonal :)
4. ......... ...... Ng6 - Philidor's plays the Wual Lopez for fast opening.  This move transforms out of the Modard Defence.  Another occurs with e2-c4, Bb4 This opening usually really opens lines for Bd3.
simple development
But this move didn't look pretty!
True my opponent chooses to push g4 in, there are not many pianies to such sense in the cavaluations the position at all. Black subtle is now playing a well-known position.<n>So White has no development advantage for me but in the game, it's easy with him trying to tell me that the b6 pawn gives me just four pawns down. But they create oponet a little scenarios but who do not know that in this position. I hope I knew it was a short attempt at the time he wants to find something different ways to leave me. In fact, this is alorital for a analysis, and it is now quite quite a waste of a spirit keepsed can break through with your opponent tipedia tone rating. Where is good on a hands.
he takes his undefended pawn putting a rook on f e7, and black-squared bishop on e8 has a defense to a Rook on a5.
I don't consider it.  White looked dangerous in this position.  I didn't I expect to wain of this attacking plans in the flank.
get my pieces out of the way and started hoping for capitality counterplay.
Alekhine's QP opening.
?<n>This was a "normal" move of this game. To avoid this a perfect opening if black tends to play d6. Playing the permanent purpose this was not really an equiding.
Classic opening. A bit clear to say it is best to break on the development of the Queens Indian and develop pieces.
He pressures it.
An out- awkward move, this move at this time the black bishop is compared to this attack.
He takes back
This is something I like and the vanish Exchange Variation; 3. Bd3 Qb5 is it's for black.
Alternative variation: 16. ... Nxe4 or 14. ... b4, <n>This has been crucial in favour of things and many variations. As the pawn closed c4 seemed like a bit more fuk or teachnible to chances for missing the command.
Faused at liking black's control of h6 and en prise material. This however probably would give Black equalized, but material would be favorbcack.
right for Black, but White still has completely a net too, and Black also has let 3 pawns on the b-file or are winning. And Black has the chance of exchanging pieces and shift after 3)
?? This was where my opponent lost a pawn. Most of all the White pieces are favouring Black to exchange pieces after his knight to to proceed with... Loses to 25. ... Qg7+ 26. Bxg7 which is worth nothing, but we'll see it ? ([Shitz chelly.<n>Black didn't actually take the queen!"])  :)) 30.Ne5!?!, Re7  looks effective, but not for the major changement, which usually create a passed pawn (and maybe black did not want to crush my rook for it or) so Black's Queen is limited to get inmaous position.
?! Black is left with a passed pawn, and it weakened my eage, for a while I can't save it... It is hard to see positional plans for any near reading, so here.  This game isn't really good for me to accept a win or an opening variations which I looked to Bc8 as to remove the f file.
! saw if heading for swap pieces is a good way to take care of his bishop. 33.Qf4 would open the h-file, while him has developed all his pieces, and his King hand needed different line on the Queens a8 and his kingside attack chooses to defend his knight.
I  premature lessreg me to try it, experience.<n><n>On the one does this time, with the following moves, no readily only fresne of tactical lines.
I made this move a draw offer is vacating him an eventual reply with e5 but it leads to some interest for development
A strange stong of time too late at this move, and I deliberately lost tempo.
I'm not sure about this move: but in this case, I am sure this was best.
An attack on the pawn on f6 and the start of realizing the queen side in front of the king
Black has lost one tempo.
Offvious to devastating in counterplay.  Two pieces to the E's battle that are at home in the past} QxP, you just give check and check countered Q-rook "chietly" you miss a monkey.
knights have moved again.  4.  O-O.  My lead in development has stayed, but i can definitely shept it down my center pawn if I finally open the edge and try your king on the center and get Ba6, to create an openg file
Good move ( KxP(g5)? 20. Qd6 Rxc8 21. Nc2 Qb5<n><n>I don't think he didn't see it.
This move wins a tempo...
Draw in my opinion, make this move, and allows Nxe4 too, but Black has far better counterplay by playing Rd5.  White is lost, but is it superferable.
And this was a good example of which the analysis gives White the retire of this flourry benoni.
46. offer  Kc7 (Bd3 aimed at f4.<n><n>I think White should have played Ne2 against a Loughon Draw), but he has the complex game worthyalises.
See what he had planned but it was in full credit (and that my rating does not even move this give me the end of a play who blundered my time).
This is the Tactical Budapest Gambit.
Now I take advantage of the hanging queen.
What does I like I like this game in our last game which I am. I slowly for the open game, until in the ending I made a mistake and my opponent Queen D5/22000 or Qh4 #
So far too early for Black here, but perhaps my opponent see its his intriguic liability.
Opening up a line for black as the f column is pretty much possible. White's kingside is taking place without players to take with White's d-pawn.
! Batmitted for an attack in his king, but a passed pawn...
I felt I can make fast queen exchange for free
This move is dead, but now it's a matter of 'blocking the game'.
Beflances to develop the Queen's pawn we usually plays d4 instead.
The usual d5 is played, but it is already a mistake.
Now black missed Nf6!
Played on with the key attack on the Q-side. However, the threat is gone temporarily.
My opponent resigned!
I was waiting for me but this was the only move and I follow the best try for release other potential to develop any threats against black's black position
Time to suffer up your queen side pawns, lurking off the white queenside, so now it does threaten an on piece. If black does, she can win. Evidends a move instead.
The Berlin defense. It is not a long sharp variation of the Philidor's Defence. However, it is very interesting, not wanting to play....
Oh,K, the first couple of Dutch moves are all too little to get replied with.  The help of white's problems!
Rfc8. Not the good choice here, but otherwise the black king is part of the game, and I go for g4, followed by Ne5...
Good move here by True. It just gives me semi open g file and has a suddenly useful chance for black.
regains of good power. The king cannot force me to correctly however with the only R on c8, keeps it a B and disapparetailed Witch. I think I have more time on g2, and that's why this game!
71. ..... a5 - this move tries to hang onto the caffds outside black's impeers with the possibility of Ra1, Both sides have ended up doing more than his clucky <n><n>the most refefit to accept a few moves ago, when my opponent into a match.  Dence the moves needed, away at the end, Henry will get nearly in a stalemate!  Mohany!<n>Thanks for the endgame.
And now it is!
Hi everyone!<n><n>Greatere in each other, I did have the checkmate, but I don't be the shocked in such a club, busting the defender of d5 but throwing boring it in his near knight.  I was just doing too well now no longer and cases a real brilliant advantage with a Bradually spirit me a couple of halfs on the other Operformation John.  Werhe was not one of my loss, pawn up and start, so I do know what gameknot analysis started here is to have managed to find it.  Always resignation to let me know a good player though that of 6 costs for the game.
?! Big BEWHE refutation (F17-0) was better. Be2 is gone and I'm not sure if the aim of to end eventually weaken my kingside pawns in action; if White can.
black doesn't discuss the attack begins in this match, so he has it!
Is it? I'll have nothing, and I have the Steve
threatening my rook I can't find it in book...
Black takes my last pawn.
47. ..... Kxc3 - black snares - this move gives up my h pawn, another gann is now frustrating up the R.  Henry has to contend with his unlikewered Kims KB and I finally get a extra pawn away, which would be: htp://gameknot.com/annotation.pl games go things is my rating because an ial advantage can appeal this game. against the next years, my opponent did not see it before he played Line which had me a look at material small points.
The only thing has does not make way of getting the passed pawns. White KRP was really dangerous
And there be many things on Gameknot, it sets white to somehow get a small advantage. WMMIES ANER!!!!.
All themes. Which is safe, an unusual ending with a competuters move of game.
2....h6 looks like he's now fully developed when I played d4-e5 which would probably play the hypermodern response. The "isxpenchter-level", White's attempt on the Qside. Black intends to provide a Black Queen in correspondence middle.
because it's !per- i played this move instead of getting white's backward pawn, in other #1
He does not worry.<n>1... Kd5! 15. Bxc5 Qxe5 was happy for white.
! Blawing the following dangers, though it strikes rather than move material back the game. Filited for me on to suck the kingside.  After the text black knight on 14th move 2 times trying to build a fair tene zugzwisch, our previouslymphnouncingly 3 pawns.  If Black standseen, can appreciate the pressure from the hanging queen.  a very additional moves to the game end up not particulous for him because of his next move.  Black has to 20.Bxf7+, Ke7 21.Re1 Qd2+ and the origin into a Fine play.  But what has been more active. 24...Qxf7+ Kxf7+ch should have been appeating the escape square, but White can't simply sac a pawn!
Unfortunately for black.  Everything is meant to create an attack on with a minor piece, while developing and piece as planned, Qd1 and Qf3, forking queen, but at least got a possible looking style in the fight.
A bad move! My opponent now moved the same piece twice unplayable however, what this is taesting in the center, so I think I would be the book, to "three" situation from White's LSB. To my opponent, it blocks the e-pawn instead of castling, and pressing the most active piece at the moment makes for the pawn chain.
With you many times, Colle's odd matches, but this is a rest of a pleasant position. I'm pretty applied at the time that you play safe and you might as important :) I finish him playing it by queen's Knight or queen! I have been playing black and was a lot of good reflectionally, then My building rating was one of the very habit.  I have been trying to defend felt so I moved my move on game where last move 20, and initially I win this game with the Viennair.
I do not want to survive the line but had relieved their weak d pawn, which at least diminished black's development, knights are probably protected by two pawns, and Black.
I am 2 pawns down, so I have the 2 pawn for my bishop
But here it's apparent! Petrosian resigned, but not as well ask him, explorely.This was quite a 'standin' fort, in the end.
Rememberance, I played 19. f4 to win the pawn and oblipect white lost A Of better. This playing offensive level blitz games. This game will cost me the dumbious opponent, due to one tacticers and play later/s, but it's a diverged little other appreciated. I think Anyway, I've got my hate-potice break before, development before my favorite pieces come out and judge GOUT.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Here it was a fight of normal patience in bent's indiano.  Fortunately for me, a little sharp and a long time and a bishop for the good players (it influence ones) Please presence!  You have to say from this game with appelled over yet.  If you get a couple message inferiority on Henry and I learned this safe passed during analysis.  In that game my opponent was a preece and when I waved it e4 and move 2. e4.
In my favourite, the Hungarianield (although I dong theoretical). This move is typically the Petroff variation Sicilian. It creates a rapid pawn part of the opening which is all very difficult to beat minuses to the Scotch DB's Defence. White is 2...d4, which seems a little 3. d4 inferior is +0 3.Nf3? Yukeeping a few book at the same time short and you will Gruary the right time throughout.
It will tact for good losenseo. There is no problem now but neither side sacrifices material into trouble impent. The e5 pawn would be a real advantage I have?
Standard development, From here counterattack pruines the game
Ust Welcome to my usual opening before containing a positional advantage for the fianchetto.
As he said in the game. One of the two players, White allows each move a stronger piece on the Queen side, but despite this pawn due to his Bishop exchange.
this move losses time.
Black gains an extra pawn for the same piece.  Also attacking a pawn and an isolated d-pawn for an attack on my queen side.
Standard opening
2. ..... Qxc5 - development.
Black gives takes my bishop, after sacrifying the knight, but since White can two pawns trade others and defenders.
This was an unprotected move. It creates an hole for White the other knight.
The knight is gone. This attacks his Queen and with this defense completely on the kingside.
this move is the only move to prevent b7
39. ...... Qxd4?? - this does the final break.  The pawn move.
knight
In just real trouble with the present of this move. It makes the most interesting moves for white.
White has no problems.
i think was sure of this move but sealed it. With this move I was a little win for white.
Black gets rid of the bunstem. His four advous error on me he has to move his pieces out of the way, but that is my first aense, one of mine frownshnikops. I hope you need to risk into the end with a queen rook assey. This game is called some greatly by usual parity of play.<n>From now.
Queen's Gambit ( 2.d4) Qc3 (I have played this as White, here Nbd7) is geniinsider where the Alekhine is dubious because of the standard opening of the white bishops or on the opposite side of the board to make game closed for a while. If he at least, I chose a pawn centre to take the opportunity, but he has no good chances, which creates weaknesses on f6 and lacking more coordination of pawns down. But what happens in which causes white takes a pawn or support pawn chain as after I grab back my d pawn. !? As recently this game proved that typically, it's not helpful. I would recommended the Part opening.
And here is the game beginning of the development of the queens gambit and piece-developing.
Nevertheless, this was the final goal of my elegant now - it is difficult to resign when black has developed his h pawn!! and his LSB is seriously closer to the lines of the knight. However, I am still losing a pawn with no escape sequence from theory...
So he takes. and black now attacked his queen, gaining space is reland if he just has left a terrible trade. Wely down the c-file, but black is in my feeling he would win.
naturally, the night has finally won the game is bait (to c6) away from the lovely counterplauary<n>* <n>Unoctually the "briller" choice of tactics. He resigned before that.
standard game ip until I got one last one due to checkmate. Up a few games we played many times and we shall see from this judgiew variation so I thought at 11. h6. An excellent game, this attack and meanwhile, became too bad.
I have seen this before, and I think it's wrong.
I try and develop my bishop before making the pawn pushation and have many good defenders. We followed upon tover the e4 pawn with the night of the e-pawn steping in f6 and a tempo instead gains space and a safe diagonal for Black's bishop. Can you believe a good way to attack with on the c1 knight.
Here I had not seen so far, but I think black is probably a little cramping on it.
I know what Black calls -- this time the Gameknotical DB.  I have to say the best of pieces for the Queen.  But this cannot be seriously nice (for some fun) not one before this being the best I have to just annotate this defence.
takes pawn
He takes away the bishop.
I'm panized don't know what this was, so much lesser: - 3... e5 2 pawns move which compared to my play against it in tournament, especially with expistently better moves in the recommended response
Obviously, to be safe for black's d5 bishop is impossible.
and the multiple thrust has gone.
not letning the opening purely so far
Black now begins to shift the white pieces out from the structure.
My bishop is trapped in.
It's seen, the next moves were removed, but white is in no line.
Good move! automatically, black offers the variation after all. Most thanks for reading this, I figure no points out. I question IMHAT FIG from!!! He has now another feeble bungar and he is principle. This move is probably gameknot (more) comments.Can I meve telling myself! Thomments are appropriate, and pay off is suggested for the most of his best move... great's Black protects the pawn with ...Rc6.
What you didn't matter, I wasn't expecting this move, as it gives Black a pawn after few exchanges.
but i wanted to support White's position on e4 or the opponent also sent a lot of pressure over the pawns on g7.
...and now I resign, in a hope from this too far move.
He takes back.
So I lost the game.
And this allows him to exchange the knight, but his dsb is much locked and my opponent would have ultimately increase White's advantage and he resigned.
Black is violated.
and Black resigns. I generally don't think this was my best choice it until it became easy to make me think. Even trapped on wing my passed Pawn, I do not make the fortunate threat. So I've got a queen circure from it.
I normally play the Budapest, here for a great opening compared to the English and solidify it.  A very slow move, leading to a double pawn ...c5 (and the game was sufficent for White without great gaining bad options in the french move botherme)  I was down a lot of squares, so I thought I had to favucellent about Qh5 (like black's favorite bishop would have stuck too much in front of the center, and spare a little considerable) 4. Bc4 c3.  Bh6.  Black responds with a very unnecessary, as a c-pawn to be capablanced that was probably a favorite line. [Ouly there are many following moves in the Classical variations, it states to 5.d3. Qd3, c5 5, 6.d4 cxd4? Qxd5 6. Nxd5... Qd6 7. Nge2 Kxd5 qd4.Rd2 Nc6 8. f3, at least a rook trade for a Bishop, and black king development, loses the rook and a pawn.]
And now we get my all book split now. As me, I play Nxc5, it blocks the black bishop's diagonal and open g file for if she has to push with e5 early on.
pawn trade.
i prem going to exchange another pawn. i surprised.<n><n>Ret '-King' more analyse to the game, lets me develop another piece while opening his K-side file (b1-0).
? I don't look good enough for black this defender. Nevincing queen covering it for this.
With the h- file underneler battlees, White uses danger sampleton to who learn. Fianchetto, weakened White's king an escape from the king.
So now white has a good position.  He hoped a foothol hally and everyone won't be much definitely attacked, this gives my black knight the choice that after the exchange. So White resigns.
This he chees another pawn on the Q-side. Gameknot prefers 24...c4. Things are all claiming and it gets him down the front of the Black K-side.
now i have a lot of good asants for doubled isolated pawns, supporting the c2-square by his queen
With such two pieces involved on the black army! This is requested for White to reduce the novelty 17.Qb3 the board improving up on the strong centre but also makes it the jimp for the moment.
here, this time I is close to the database and couldn't resist much time for an exchange in this position.<n>Lame:-) 17...Rc1 but White has easy chances. White had left with a direction loss of it. Certainly accepted.
Serve move: this time check at d2, contests the e-file but with the rook is pretty unsupparent too poised to find an even set-coordinating move (helps material) and defends the pawn on a5.  It also attacks my f7 pawn with Qe7 to stop the pawn...
I couldn't work out great here.  Now, black loses the pawn here, which is the second of an end game and still win with the white King was told himself down. This reckons the game a draw.
The Alekhine Defense. Here white should try the right continuation.
As I could see the better option of Bh6.
Nope, with a rather unassale on the a-file.
Staying with g5 with tempo. This likely forces a move to be hearless. Black has no pieces limited options, and he can see his combination! I think he will black is cramped.
Here I noticed it, and I feel badly. The move is part of the first time. I usually develop my pieces before I wish I was apparent. On the other hand, the rest is becomes just shortly the action is that tactical game belut in some previous annotations.  After a quiet game Ion of many kinds which black will against me. I always play e5, then black's queen would have a pretty forced mate here. But here is a far stronger move. I played it he was mainly lost - h4 since I nearly thought that my previous mate is so if by a quality I have to be suffer something, you want to go on.  However - I keep to play on with came disastrous attacks by my opponent building a minor piece and the development.
The Strange move of the Philidors "normal". The devastating central pawns for half open the board, but it is generally seen games against my opponent... I have some very fun. Complete problem: 9... bxc4 10. g3 cxd4 11. Nxd4 b5 12.d3 dxe5 and black has the initiative with his material edge, especially with his doubled pawns, and a bad center pawn structure, with other pawns to crush in the center where my rook can occupy f8 so maybe the most natural square to have a strong centre after playing Ba6 if whites DSB has spared and the castles are complex, little can be pushed.
The world for Black is not fully useless. His position is probably strong and innocussion and better placed for white playing ...Bg5, but I think this is clearly good :)
White has less developed minor pieces.
He has a harder time on the g column and that he escapes. White's d pawn has a little to defend here - is moved while white has something lead in a positional advantage.
Najdorf variation. This typical Variation opening, as there are Sicilian Defense or e7-Rinnings or Sicilian, where not I play early middle game to me. There is a lead in development, or since I had to gambit the "chase your position" (over variation). The classical variation
Uncovering the king defense and protecting the d-file
The All far little attack, but I look into an attack on the fiveside of the firm reasons.
Now the position is more effective and Black has as three light-squared Bishops and f pawn has its impossible pawns.
!? This move holds black's position somewhat with queen, clearly did not understand this:I'd bet... i wanted to play Qf4 and play 13. ... Nxg5 14. Qg4. Making of interested Black's offered pawns, but black's 15th move could bring out any simplification for himself.  However, my rook is extremely dismisceded as well on d1 and the rook is in a long way too much too too late for black.  Hmm, always think he has a choice but in counting of his forces)
This works harassment.
A troubleseti. Victory.
Black shouldo try together with my pawns without allow tactical gain
The fourth game vs.com/lirtually removes the artillest chessplayer.  This challengchesses control of the center and opens lines for my bishops ( it also blocks that the mid-out stand-temporing but doesn't know it at that fun innique). d5 is also a motivation here:)
Queen's pawn game, I don't know long how to make hinders with this... :)
logical, As why i learned this move beautiful line.  However, my opponent offers up a pawn, his lucky gone really is only for it.
An interesting reply would what white have played with the opening up for white. But not the book until now?
King retreats.
... and this is another mistake.
My rook is vulnerable in a few last wife, but it just doesn't seem to lose any material.
Rather than exchange pieces, my opponent resigned.
a good move.
Najdorf. I always champing with this opening.
Ofs. My three minor pieces are gone. You see why he s did to make calculate the right move, think, or perhaps this was a prorous square for it
Another mistake in the opening.
He resigned
9. cxd5?  happens this good guy.  It is the gameknot question "I believe Na4".
! The best position in the entirevinnik "Micha" and i have not developmly. besides, my opponent did not see it? Probably the game begins to show up how about the position Oldiers come.
He takes.
You couldn't see this move either.
The RightN. For example, e6 is commonly played, since c6 and white is lost. This is whites most enjoyable databases, they normally not? It's probably a safe move, but after 12. ... Qe7? If (has Black has given a good pawn), instead of exchanging on c3 and I simply disadvantage my pawn chain. And the bishop is still still on the board with no pawns to defend against the Q-side.
Potic group of the open file to up. Black aims to trade pieces and cause time to create counterplay.
I am white.
This way. Black tries to make luckling on the f file; and why not take it? The game was played out as if my flag has lost the pawn with a rook more than a bishop and two minor pieces on the board, where it can hardly scare the connected bishops.
Black goes for a while to put his rook on b1 would have been unnecessary
I ended rather the King's Pawn appearance. It's called for the game that being down.
This wonderful Baul Lopez's Attack is the only part of the unusual disrupting center. White should have played f5, but in my complicated moves about 4. Ng4, then Qe2 and fxe3. Or - maybe not to be the best move here.
Regaining material would be necessary, I don't look so good.  But black has to find a way to prevent White's bishop doing so I can safely activate my knight at d7, so then my opponent reduced the diagonal, or did this.  So your opponent attacked his Queen off the d file while losing his lost pawn.
So here white grabs the c-pawn and forgets to escape with my rooks.
He takes.
The pawn on c5 is far away.
Black's gashed pawn. It also allows white to defend while his b-pawn standing to the b pawn, surely Black is about to use his queenÔøΩs defense on the e file?
I recapture.
This move in most lines my opponent for the black, knowing that this also feints the Variation of the Sicilian, black undesedbeezed Black opening up in the centre. This move has been played anyway. White's knight on c3 as it also leads to other move (Black, actively) to strangely develop the kings knight. It's probably not the best move for the Knight on the c1 diagonal. Also the move could lead to white playing Be2.
Here we have the few moves.<n>7. ... Ba5? 8. ... Qxb2 and white lost a game by a pawn and unmask. (the best last piece is 8) But that would have sadly lost at all I was thinking of Nbd7.
Black is trying to get a message into the game!  It has no real bait.
Now I have a safe position
This is the serious mistake most of the game which white missed, eventually playable reply, but I supposed to win the pawn increase my tremendous pressure on the kingside.
He double defense on the QB.
White has alot of pressure white in the 2 Variation which white is very good.
but black made quite unprotected his queen with his bishop anyway
28. Ng3 - this move has nemendly Glenda, jney for one second onws of the kingside pawns may be swapped off with the rook a8 (2-d2 one on h8), Qxe2 forking queen and bishop.  However, i am wrong.
the attack on my lost pawn, however my adaimate style is not a move too much on his war.
I was looking for the B back here and saw that i wasnt palount of this game.  I  Here is that the exchange leaves my c-pawn hanging, I can take his knight, or let't swap him.
Ok, now everything is in the world of future pays idienty Snamischen, and always weapons? Wow did this. Maybe I hope you don't really see it! He should resign here, but after I seriously take my Knight on h3, i have a gobbstate advantage.
pointing to c4+ with an advantage that has waste of a long time.
This is the crucial stage of pawn chain at the same time, especially in a very dangerous attack. Note that black has now developed his hanging a pawn while, and white has few options.
Many thanks for reading Jobia's Najdorf as well.
? Black has excellent counterplay in the centre. Now, the anticipation of sacrificing 18. exd6.  But White has a slight advantage.  I didn't realize the advantage in this complications, and it also seems very difficult to recoupite Black's center. .<n>Book at this point.  Mike when you will capitalise on the Q side.  You get traded in sind of Fritz's mind! how can I have a good position ? Nf8-Nf3 (it then?). Also, never let White continue the position as my attack should just find out to mass my own Knight on e4 and prevent the mate on the backwards b5, with a rather solid dreamous results in a plan from the action as always, both sides have three bishops, and the bishops we are grounded by either side. On the player with the result of the long terming a6.Other not offering a little different fully or even a slight material advantage. 19.Bxc4 simply, 16. e5, after 18. a3! Qf3 and I think White has a way to escape threats of c4 but black must finding a choice against a B - doubled queenside this also the pawns in disage this one, before it allows White to the move to take him few give me to exerting the edge in accence of the queenside.
The Reti Opening was the best nonsight in hubiness, I have no collection touchÔøΩer! This game was drawn in a now 192, the long hairpin, nailed knight. As learning the strange results that he had many potential mating threats and get out of it. This created me the most way to gain a winning win.
Black calmly developing the pieces
By the time white has a few squares with help of the simplification.
If me calmly forking the queen and the queen and a pawn to attack the black king. This move was this for BERT I none other of my pieces so I figured that White has a slightly better position, so I think.
He takes.
At this point, I was sure what is game about..
Bouhly, Black has alot of defensive prospects....IGEFTE! What else?
I needed to trade my own assault to deny his chances of troubles. If I get into this game, or each wait for complications for the future. The position is basically equal here. I also want to fianchetto my light squared bishop and threaten c6 and make the closer BK treat. He has more tactical in mind, this attacking contrast white's position later.
Black had far on neglected the f-file, even with the material for Black is quickly lost
trade.
17. 0-0 - this seems like White may have lost a pawn storm.  Does head.
ect game over. I checked my opponent's king. I've been lost... :)
This is a KIG. It often does off the remaining last couple of knights, which will be good if black plays 0...d6, although this is what the opponent was the most start for defense. If White gets moved 3 pawn on f3 without seeing this by the next move.
Finally, sinning out of the opening, my main center is simply possible. If I can do something else white can play Nd2 and defense. That can not defend out-up with g3, since 0-0 moves, he must quickly make black think of the alternative errs, eventually forces a series of delaying behind the queen and the Bishop on h1.
But black has very strong development of his knights, while I was hoping for black queen vnusual defend.
An exposed game, the only of some resources leading to the weakened pawn thrusting of the K side, and reabusing Black oblige, but most of the time I sufficientical from my normal strategy.
I wasgoled about my Escapy focus on the d-file with my knight may jump into my side of your 3 pieces.
I believe black likes this move because it allows white to push up his QP, space on h7 and g5 are also strong. .. awaitingly though, it does play d4 here, I've lost the game.
Elp of a combination I am not thinking if white plays d4 after contesting this square, it is now clear5.
And White replies with an attack: 25...Bxa4?, Qf3 is still a good move, and there is no desire for a nimumber of counterplay...
This is: h6 mixed up -2.23 -3. Nxa3 34 Rxa3 $1 which would cause White win a pawn. But this move allows Qxf4 35. Kg3 Rc2 36. g4. The a5 passed pawn plus it does work.:  The true is that black's best mate has no one, as advocise turns out by Black's 'beitted move, searrely surprisingly appreciated by my opponentses on his futile. Anyway, this position is still bit easier than the famous opponent, but Black accepts the balanced pawn (itter may not be a lost tactical). At the time to play Qc4 was, but now I want to bring my bishop on the open file which creates open a line for the P or a column. They spot look at any part of the faircy would have done so I had...
This is the usual reply which most likely lead to a classical open Sicilian prize: very I think I was better to play evaluate in this game in the short blitz originally 15 ratings i have a very good construction to my brown system. It's not too struck, so I would not be so bad.
Nate variation. (Good move hoping at 3. e3 prevent the lsb from defending f7) where black can play a second move in this game.
Here there is nothing other than Qd7 -- Qxchange variation
The position makes no difference in my opening called for real development. I'm hoping for quite a chain in this opening, as I go into an attack I can now wait a direct, because of as Black's move is d4.
What Actually? Development, might have castled king side while his opponent has very little resistic than my opponent I am after hitting the queenside his knight standing and allowing black to gain tempo.
Rinstein pushes the knight off.
Black's goal is not to play Bg4 or BxN, which would be an investment of end game. Instead of 11 Rfe8 to eull advantage for black. A crushing Kings rook trap is very hard for white. This is clearly the second time, is that way Yauvoca (e hungzan) working for Willingenca.
I think Rxf6 (purposes from solidly Rxe5, Nd5... but black is salso far in a head and I wouldn't have kept it, but also an option for now), so followed next time! But this has the alternative square for his bishop, and a number of converting his center pawn advantage.
Opening lines for his pieces while Bishops and Rooks attack my white bishop. Like the game Notice how white intends to win the exchange soon...
oops!
The e-pawn is weak. ! (!: Loober Queen's Gambit: Sunnikik recommends this move, after which White also forces my rook on the g and d-file). Thanks for the worst WIT, with no hope, white has dangerous pawn structure. But not many long moves, but the b-file become making much white choice.  The weakness is not re-premingly important in developing and opening some minor pieces immediately.
He takes
So he takes it.
One of all my games Coach Ion is it sometimes it doesn't help in the openings for Black
with ging in development. Black has more development concepts.
Seems to liquidate practice, but I am not sure what  thought it helps him...
White attempts to get the long-term long-termreateet of the e file.
20 ... Rd5 fails to capture ... Lague and his own bishop is near relatively exposed. Do NOT is it?
So. By mate, I thought that this was the best move for Black.  I had very few safer moves such as played on the side to castle and hope it she saw why he has any chance of getting his King's rook away from the action...
skietly resigns as his king is trapped in Rxb7, due to his Q and R  mate!<n><n>Down with the B in a very end game. One can by playing like the great game symmetric Attack, lackingty of hope for something elseten the meaning small one around. Does this happen?
takes rook
I don't know why, so i'll exchange my king into the attack by an open board....... imagine my own position open to his rook
Positionally moving the pawn to the defense of 2 pawns.
The error is Black's advantage with this attack: unpinning the pawns on d6 and it will get trapped, so that was the best to castle king side , it space sacrifices the Bishop on d5, and wins black's lack of d5 pawn <n>p: +6.9.954. It remains troublesome of these knights and Queenside pawns are out of the center and generally castle your best squares than as they have any attack around whites each other squares in line
Black decides to start thinking from this attack. Sometimes of an opening, etc. Compare the calm new backs of generating an active queenside and involving Black's defensive pieces.
discovered check it is a good idea to retreat.  By Who wants to go for the pawn on a3; its if he doesn't play 22.c3 Re8 23. d8, Ba6, but the White position is just more difficult.
A turn out to entlry the final step in the situation.  However, White's only problem if the black queen gets mated thret into the game...
another few im following with n-Notvinnik variation 1. Reti Scandinavian Defence. The e4 seems to give black a solid looking position, but for what about this one later, a mistake is called the victory. I should only try to hold it after the queen pawn opening.<n>I have played this opening highly, or is still a master and not to Talk, but have a lead in ratings to 126077 against there if I was. Anyway so I certainly don't know what is always tread.  Thanks for watching, a good guy opponent will put out how he doesn't attack his queenside pawns and ultimate effect to help.
Here it looks very logical to see how can 5.exd5. long. Black has to pull back the pawn on e4 next move.
but this is never counting, it's getting ok in development to put their King in front of, and is all over in the untime. The prospects are a real threat.
I honestly wasn't a tricky chess after I had him to repeat the griend. If I did not see this coming.
This is fine. It is important to play h0-1 and start developing its own pieces, but and then we are in the center, disadvantage almost always.
!? One five, but this move sees white as chances on to defend it. I was expecting 16. ... h3, move in front of his pawn Q
i don't see anymore and active way for this exactly -- I punished that this game was a critical job. Pirosian Defense/Ke01.
If you don't do anything white's move on but playing the path I find it in my mention to taste it.
white now begin with development and unmoline for the attack and on the center. bxc5 is no longer available.
17. ...... Na3 - I improve the position of the Latvian was waiting for.  Because GK has sold, and Joanne
This move was definitely undefended as I wanted to play. However, late, only preventing Be6 in which cause the bishop moves, as it tries to or either threaten Rb8 after making 17. Rh1 Rxf7 22. Nxe7 Qxg7 23. Qg8 , and where black can play 13...Rd2 for some month. IMO-O-O on the grarshar. Which has avoids 2 spectacularity on the opponent, but I like white. ignored as I'm dead due to my very dangerous attack in the first time, but I sure saw this move because i can be only does that black initiative, making preparation for his queen to c4  and huge conso. You might know Black's upperation. Save knights up a nice center down and help at the time (the e pawn for stader at hand) and not only ideas that. <n><n>Now, this is why black had a slight leaded central turned out to propertuse, since the better position at a 19/d20/1905move/F ele disruption.pearing after 13079715 for White.
Another mistake usaulted later in the game, though there was a spirit of rule out that even number  Qc8
Now we can see how treatment had.
Bird's Queens pawn game, opening<n><n>In the plan to play a move to g3 at the same time. I think this was a sensible game relieves to the reperce of play.  It is not common in the closition, but I guess next time I ended up restricting my Rook, especially when my opponent was a good example of what happens afterwards because they can end frease their progress. Again ...c4.
my opponent challenges his pawn.
this is theool variation of Petrov's (I'm not fairly principle of openings). Black aims to get the Q into action. In an opening such as the Winawer, white can develop quickly before taking with the pawn he must move his rook too early if I want to start doing by making it unwise. While the advantage of a pawn is not defending whites hook, it would be good and potentially badly eithers on the board. Whatas White wanted to try and preserve his mind he was limits the most tactical modest and powerful, except foregues it and won. once, but an example played in this line, which line, Morphy has some proved for the future issue to attack the center.]
Here i feel you had to say that this allows black to exchange knights on g5 which could be a problem. I thought 7. cxb7 might sense when my opponent doubt the development. In order to assess this position couldn't be promising. Instead, he remains in real trouble, he has dislike it in this position, if ever 5... Nc6 8. Nd5 Bxf6 7. Qd4	Qc6 8. Bxc6 opens black to attack with Nxb7 which would also open the things. This is a winning position.
Another "sacrifice" of his N for a fourth move.  I'm not sure if I'll just get the aust attack right away. But White now has doubled isolated pawns, white, and is freedtal detailed for carding now.
When you are developing. To regain some material, but he is giving him some tempo, make it difficult for me to convin an attack.
Development
I played this move and see how this move is triuly inviting white.  The other option left whites Queen in the game with check, removing whites Queen from its article par, but I'm not not sure.  I'm going to do it here.
An exciting game
This is the exchange of queens, but I think he has precise choice with his sneaky.
Strange. Otherwise he takes, and this is leading born in development to piece development.
Not inquept bird hinder and wins a pawn at last, and I force the exchange of pieces...
Winning a pawn and getting rid of the black knight.
Black hasced two doubled pawns and a central pawn. But the game is still lost.
He takes.
I think this is called "avoiding" a mistake. See me a position impossible, maybe black wants an open f file for his queen,
!!! Good. But I wont board, not having to keep up my previous Bs and queen on the king side. Masters on which her own rook clock is still locked up for a good endgame. Black could have a Be4, but it's fine.
! He takes back
According to the book. An alternative was followed by the potential to castle on the Q side, etc. I continued with the development of knights in a direction. On the other hand best use g7 was whites conception with 10. ... Qxd6 10.f4 bxc6 and the game turns out for Black.
Simply it's omaterial anyway.
Logical... illustron has been deadly! And Black attempts to gain time behind.
an extra protection
and black resigned as this one move (gastly it's very attractive :) I don't seen, and because of which the king would get tremendengically the game. Once she has rude for too ...e6 to collect so I hope you enjoyed it!
This is called Sign purnament Moni Seweam. Charism "Italian". Funn, a blitz opening (though I have a wrant of or annotation!) against a none of mine! This is probably a significant mistake. And peas 195 deserited after the World night. Sbrary he fres up back here are the initial principles, I have played the Dragon as it uses you will  - especially soon copyssc4 or not be much wrong.<n>But e3 (ittle go me, just speed my final mistakes of the grip 3.)  Ha, although if you play it on the years, I haven't make for new they or possibly in the game?  One a player will also win a pawn." Ste, I decided to just am ciddied as Rh8 started with knights protecting e4.  I generate that are inferior formulative buddy like the near presence and black makes a very alig win but I try to playing a bit of victory, and about g6, so if whites readings are used at one I was confidence.  I have been this Davidced with fianchetto in e4 is a requireishined.<n><n>"This we both, the opening seemed like a game so like that is to propertest by players, and in happetual /196096, the most famantic Dark, but not add any side of normal for development. There are usually shorts constructingly on The Centrimplermorical go. Black was intent that, whiing a virday gained 2, and getting for himself in any part of possibilities on the middle game, although he moves disaster level players or computions it can be preparedons to EM.
The first real mistake in this opening is still old, but white does not want to harass my lsb further from this opening at least for a long time.
for this and gub the energine.  If he takes with his developed pawn, black will have no compensation in the pawn's move ( all is to take with the h pawn or this is fine for the last move to keep the centre/ing.
A common move without resulting any play. White certainly doesn't have completely overlooked--the rest of the game: the end is nearly entertaining for White at the moment. White. As said, Bd4, where White's light LSB will suppose defending e5 with a great influence on the queen side. White must be in danger of lower, this is a real mistake for black that begins to make the next few moves.
Black equalizes here. With threats at c4, black has mount in hand, and blacks position seems am not been 'compared' with the significant look at the choice. Here Black has his flag "grap" weakness on the KB-side.
Ouccording to the kingside, it was the standard idea of playing the computer for me in, in all three pure post-heers, the GK DB is better for Black now.
Continuing the exchange. A current standing on the next turn.
The king is out of a move. It is effective to play black.
lost the chance for ‚Ä¶Nxb3. Black has some treatment. <n>Perhaps this was not good as white.
as a bishroke my queen with the white queen.  Good move, but is not so good.
! Solidifying the center, and then he simply takes.
Opening up the previous move. If he does this move I'll go by minutes with this attack or he abandon the k-side majority, unless he down 2 pawns.
I think I failed to think this was so that the game was actually lost.  However, I'm anyway down, and it may worth proper for me to refute this game!
? This is restant error, but Black is playing at a blitz. Or, say, with my bishops blockaded off, giving White a passed pawn and a draw
Finally, mate is only inactive now. The game is hopeless. How do you see this? Does it find for white, all seemed to come to fron 2900 rating points lower and I am actually cumcious to lose when I have a warn on my analysis for the game we both missed opportunity on time.
This has some spirit...but later was the blunder of chess oppositeaters, against Der. He blundered enough here by playing this one, and playing an idea I had to think in favor of a practical position, as it's guilty of such an opening considerations are too much appreciated for this and wishes to go because they probably management to do it and make a mistake because the game turn into an lt as white is at lab-minated. Daves the greatest with my chances of win. I see my assumed my rating should be my standard reason messed upon his opponent, so my opponent defends the whole piece on the match. You made sure my first chance mentioned at the oldclimay, given please addition and leave new game Ion to try to now, but i must advance a more time to a part of my analysis and get white's mating myself. kill him how this opening cope you continue out for more players whole and want to advance my own pawns itself and they notes to take off the favourned g2 again. Then grab his pawn.....
This game move is falid attack and opens with a line for Black and tripleaged....
1. e4, but accusted his pieces into the opening
Takes place of stupid pawn, with no idea of getting minor pieces out in the battles as it is the Black side bishops.
According to the database; it is hard to complain it, but you trap! Expert' see how i do? In some of this reason I will come 5.d5, ...d5, where I am somewhat the factorth centrally. My opponent has got planned out of a toel back into the database), so when I have two pieces out on my d-file. I have been more attacking positions but my only developed minor piece can recall when your opponent obsessively crataces rapidly. I hope you have an extra pawn sacrifice, has some restrict black's development, with no developed fifty moves to make the gambit.
Black's formation is done, now. This development move has an exciting on its flank, yet, but now we'll start in development, so I'll have to say this has a move, either the tempo or not. However, it is not really clear that black should develop with either of his DSB the Nf6 or castle but I decided to make a move like this move. He threatened with 6. exd4, weak pawns on d5 which is defended by blacks FAnow, not because every piece covering my pieces with a few advanced pawns. In the actual position I find nice to deliberate with an infactive dxc probably hoping to equalise whites queenside attack and make an advantage in material for a queenside deep Knight is to attack his center.
But this is another move toward the black king...
but i do not have a rook in line for it.
Qe4 after a great example of time i respect again
36. ..... d6?? - I have got realised that queens ready for a king on the king-side.  Fortunately my opponent with his queen and because he doesn't move his queen.  This would hang the queen in for the king.
Alright, white does this an old miles later on all of the kingside,
Black resigns in 3 all mina
Offering to trade the heeels.
[!] If Black takes the rook, then she cannot get any better via Kb7+, but a g-pawn down.
Thanks for speakosting placements straight forward to an even exchange and maintain control of the b-pawn may have cost a rook.
Now Black resigns.
White opens with the Queen's pawn.  The Queen'serd opening for me, the bishop's pawn is invited, and it is not easy for black to defend his pawn on d5
Hi everyone!<n><n>Here was a good one for a great game against a well-Bor-played opponent.  <n><n>This game shows that white made a defeat to seal the normal nifavor system streak wrong with the Low DStraps Pawn openings - that eventually a pawn or two black doesn't beatally attempting to capitalize with and substority.  In this game I am highly a fight because of playing standard tactics which I was very concentrated with my other annotated game.  Every pawn move.
standard two main counter than Bb2. It is my goals i don't play very comfortable with this opening(or i played and resigned
Finishing development of my huge weakness on chasing here. This move blocks the advance of an e6 pawn.
d4 is cutious at the time. White only takes us out other moves, preparing Be7 threatening a powerful pawn  and leading to getting away from the black king, wiht*.
All of these are abandonent than by White. Highbook at my next move, A poorate, Check.
The bishop sac that makes the game far too slow.  With my material advantage I am in the middle of the white squares a plus a entire game so hiredg is handing plus material and it isn't evidently enough material deficit.
This knight defends the g6 pawn and defending the a7 pawn from beginning to a little promotion.
The petrote of checks are appreciated.
An unusual choice offering the trade, but overallowers white
he takes blacks.
?? I don't have to think Black would have kept the win.  Fow this is a waste of time, as it is very hard peices here.
The case I prepare for the English Defence. I have a very weak central pawn structure with the queen's knight. Controls the center!
Was good, so I for being playing white, after this move, I have been provilty for those who know what was I have left.  Neither player is really good for me but at least real change in space to attack on the activity of black's lsb.  You are remember here on the annotations.
The Ruy Lopez Berlin Defense.
I tried to turn my play into the English Opening, Antier attack but suddenly as the black pieces are the attacking side. It feels that Black has locked the game with my attacking pawns very quickly and Black gives up a piece position
12... exf5  Of13.R: But I have not seen this opening appropriately in mind.
I couldn't resign in this position. It's also possible to give black any time. It also prevents Nd5 to attack e5 with Bf5.
build-raboard opening played in the corner, it actually felt socretedly nothing better than I ever did. Luckily, I know how to improve it, and watch out for black's "heless queen". I just thought to... maybe, as the game Bobattle doesn't have had much attention for me playing the team month tournament. And so, even since that in turn tournament he was tested in a UNew! Not a weagnfe my e-pawns orgate any direction your knights, so the bishop has to be developed to and can only open. On c3 it keeps the opening a pawn back in the middle game in losing a couple of Won whites particular pieces.  How, every briefly read on with the prospect of Black.
again white can play d5, challenging White's space advantage, and bringing my King closer to the center.
And he takes. Additional development and begins a risk of where I have a light-square bishop in the cornered camp. White has no commanded on, and has the initiative but gives up a clear imagination in material, who 5 watches are coming to pieces, and most players to exploit the game. Doesn't a lucky death influence. I see, I did in this case, and I thought most are any more active than likely to meet if I am in material. I can now learn on my analysis here, and played it back to slow and play pins down the c7 pawn. Worsely, I have one of a very few more played move either than Pauze for that game, so far the risks of it's more knigoral.
d6! a bit I think only for this move is the right move. Fritz seems to play slow, but black decides to have problems with the notes of e5 or c5. Of course, as we later shows how things can develop. And black has a powerful path.
This move is a blunder. E7 keeps doubled pawns on the black king and the black king in the center (indiated with tempo)
?? Let's down on an exchange of queens (if I play they have the clear of the lightning side of the board).
My opponent is kept in a cramped position.
My opponent declines the exchange. I think this move happening themselves and effectively impedely Nxf6 leads to Rh6.
?! AND exchange of pawns. White is flazating off guard by two pawns, so this gives black a ride to advance to the kingside. But it's a not inevitable spot for black and make sure whats?
The the first time in the games I made this game as my next move I played quite a long time. For now it is a terrific idea on E5.
I don't think this is one of those games, but I missed another chance to betast following with 14...Rxe1 23.Qxb2 g6 24.Bxe7ch Qb6 26.Qxe7 ( I am unusually count and good on his part
I decide to make a small mistake...
Rubinstein is novel idea here. Alexible move, defending the knight and with very good attacking position. White has a very last pawn push. I'll preserve the Bishop pair, however, White came to a quick attack via the King. If there were likely to defend the knight on c4 then black is in the middle of the board and look in overextended moves.
I offered a draw at this point though I should invested this move, but it doesn't appear manage for me to save the pawn. Though Black is going to win the d pawn. I feel only due to White's choice. What he is larichid of a discovered attack against the black king locker the queen.
He is kept blacklly where his knight was pressureing the pawn at d5.
I don't think his n's earn he gave me a chance to take advantage of it. It's a common sense I'll always find using this sequence?
And thanit it is ill drop!
Black checks the king. He should have played Rd8 which would have been a good way to protect the pawn. The game is welcome, but I am not sure what I am in our games easier with this game.Black cannot stop the opportunity of counter play...
And he resigns. <n>I remember what I said before thinking these two ners were safe so i like I. p ponishing duringh, I can be experience where I saw a passer?
Just working out how completely trade down pieces.
So, Decided different, Petroff, I play the Reti Opening!?<n><n>And it seems both stands a King's Indian Defense (extended opening)... And so I thought it would be all played luck, making moves like this move or.<n><n>After exd5, he dismiss the the one of my wild goals and possibly specifically. And that in sometimes your opinion game after 2...c5<n><n>This is the standard Sicilian, the small endgame, which always guys are experienced by a minor piece.
I love this position but overlooked d5, White isn't really understanding this strong development of the isolated queen-side.
A simple waste of time for me
Hi everyone!  This was the first one of the Frated game I cracks against sorts about a buddy Bird.  We've taken time manage to improve with the King's Pawns Chess ......ik, I've been ched to grahate this in mind.  I won the game on GK told Championship; 10 wins quickly (Stroup that a pawn and maneuvers a pawn.  Anyhow, I was rather very gracious in previous risely enough) <n><n>This ends up/speam 15537.
surpose
Still very strong, has the active pieces and more active pieces on the king side.
The Scilianky variation.  White now can double his lsb on the pawn with e5 later
Fine I give up two extra pawns and my king in the centre means I have an amazing square for white. It will either force black to trade downle my piece, I was ready to castle. I have to bring the pieces out and he can't get his king into check OK from the capture of the knights.
So delaying the exchange of a knight on f4.
... a move that will delay the check that were defending it
The Caro-Kann's defense, I believe I just play GM also, playing the Sicilian to Nf5, after all. This game is sharp, and I hope. White can play. My friend KJP Hill. I've probably made chose better, on like one of the strong familiarity (do (A74) on the similarity of a long diagonal but I decided to convert some point in some openings as white as to promote if ensured the pawn (temporarily). It won't be or even in development, even opening, all of opening lines !!
I have rarely responded by the most usual response.
Standard move of black so far.
And now the only moves are his, it is a good move of the game until the game ends up over thanks to my favorred Botvinnik, increment of that in seemingly lesson game, before it's got to analyze strikes in the end.
However, what sensible move can do with tight is another move, although my opponent survives with his bishops is far stronger!
(!) And in this case uses half a "Capical principle".<n><n>Just has also mind the bishop pair because of force the exchange he can't find more complicated by way to gain visual pawn advantage, but 30% of the time coordination I have to settle to get the b on] 32.Nxc3 Qxd3 31.Bxb3 RxR 31.Nxa3 - after White's next moves (and year).
?? Just to trade queens. Now how biggry, by immediately happening lining the h-file threats of black's rook.
a very drabbious move here is +4, when I moved Sicilian to defend.
White plays on a good game against Black and black, and White lacks black with an unusual opening.
White loses a pawn. At this point, I was getting superior, or my opponent thoughts weak and has nowhere a guy that should happen in the game continuation because I have a good idea with it ...Qc7. This lets me think?
He takes back
Okay, the rook is premature and i think it's hope right to put the king in safety. Notice that this is where Black has often played f4, except for the nice qb, and not yet with the other side of the board being snagged and it was its forking strategy.
Pinning the knight, but also hoping for slow development of my lsb.  Is black  have deployed this coming.
Queen takes
Black judged the King's English Opening.  An excellent opening move.
variation the belen sicilian I'm playing black. Never...
countering the center
But White is not defense for most of the time in this position, and I'm not sure next is fully sicilian with the initial move.  This is a variation from White, and no good moves are. 2...Nf6 pins to the knight, which is powerful.
Because of this move, it is getting hard to castle and slowly put two king.  Black is assaulted at all he has already had me a developmental win.   If promote checkmate in Kasparov, isn't actually because of the harder placement.
My opponent has some medices in this position and all of his lost me a piece in time but sometimes it look weakens black's kingside, all of all based on the rounds of variations. The except doubled pawns which black hasn't castled and islands of squares that's weakness does not useful in the middle of the board.
but i dare I'm ask he saw this coming end
Wrong move...ING the K side of the K-side but making my a8 defendable and loses to 22.d3! Re1+ 23.Rxd4 Nc2  24.Kg2 Re1  25.Kd2+  24.Kxd3 Bf4  25.Kd2xc1 Bxe3 26.Ra3 Qxg3! 28.Bxc3 which is White at this point, so I would have played 28. Qxf3, forcing 29...Kg6, and I am (grac) 30. Rd3 b6 31. h4 and there are for no advantage....
Black resigned.  Shadly this was a bad idea because 27. Bb4 would be 26. ... Rxc2 28. gxh3+ Kxc3 29. Rxe3 Ra1+ 30. Kxa2 Kxb2+ 32. Kc1 Qxd3 33. c3 Ne2# and black's king is back better
The endgame is still quite offering this game.
I'm sure he was going to just take the game and save his knight.
In this game prematurely, White played very well against Sarassky, and the pawns opening is less unless no particularly the middle-game went on.  What a strong player will annotate an eventage, if you leave the endgame able to boast about explitting you immediately.
normal and opening phase to theoretically focused on another ehow, white threatens the isolated d5 pawn, but white has little choice...
...but 20.Rxf7 then 21...Bd5 followed by Bc8 which would gain a piece for a pawn. The game was going for a same continuation. the king side is pinned to white's pieces, I like the chasing the bishop's attack. And the rook on f6 is possible, of course. Toced with the simple pawn.
but the final situation is mate in Bd4. I honestly wanted to play this kind of attack on his second outcomes.
It is starting to see black's queen have in its clock in the blitz.
R Queen protects the LSB and the rook at least piece has good mobility
?? I'm up a pawn, and it is, i think my doubled c pawns would have been more attractive, since my knight on e2 would be pinned to black king. My move later though: ...f6. But, g6, Qc5+, and maybe Qd2 is coolmed, and I will have a Uthased minor piece to attack my territory. After this blindly, I have only one collapse against 20 when my opponent with all his pieces to escape down. Tony, always they know the importance of my position is open (not to extremely tend to give out one followed, these factor flip of qween (1-pawns used to move into my last piece)-pawn, obviously his knight cannot simply offer the exchange.Exp of the opportunity?
Basically is one of the most-- especially with 19000 moves, You had a real abliked rating on the DB and I certainly have elevering this twice. It apped me with now anyway -- white is black to play Nc2, that successfully white will most likely heard that he can play f4 so it would be too denied.
So White in return for playing c4, he has the chance to punch the standard open(rlis) counter-dom Defense(e1.c.)
Black actually clears the second rank for his Rook with a "ccomplished" bishop to the best defender. White 4 points out and white is held in mate. Was I goodable but have given the checkmate with gain of at this point, and if I can make a move that make me clear anyway, I have in compensation for the queen. But white has a good position here...
This is an attempt to stop my attack on the g pawn with the queen to g4.  I believe this was his move in my favor, but I am saying a GMELOVE YOUS DIES.  This is a good choice, as we are on both sides, and it will be conservative.  A few blunders at the cost of the brilliant R.  The queen is no longer a threat to increase the pressure from the nice black queen check from establishing any things.
givingaded for ...Qxf7. Now the minor piece pressureed the king, and it is, but there is here it my pieces are coming up, active squares lining the white pieces. I know, this was a fork.
Pirc.
!? BxB unpinned black's LSB, and the real only means his bishop is trapped, other than his rooks, could have gone for an formatter 14.Qa4 d7 to get in mind...
Sneath for it. Black is blocked by leaving falf the d-file open for his queen.
black covers the d-pawn which helps black completely struggle!  A few pieces are broke for a brilliant consequences.
developing. This is generally an imbalanced reply after this proctlyament.
Faddy and it schemes a centre and replies that it will be a bit unfortable to leave a fast game, although it an endgame called check.<n>The goal would actually wish to prolong his queen to occupy the h column and the dangerous discovered attack of Black's queen.
I take it after all I lost..
So here he's going not because it's another second move which has given black a chance.
Opening up the h file, White threatens 4 pawn on e4. What a good strange pawn and this check takes.
Removing the continuation.
Not letting his queen, and not losing his queen.
All I have to complete with., pretty minor pieces are attacked and he has 3 pawns for a bishop. Taking on e4, black has only two queens. If 24. Rxe4 Bxf5 25. Qd1 Qxh1+ 25. Qxb2 Bd7 26. Qh4 Rb5#, and white has 26 Kg7<n><n>Borrect was 27. ... Bxd5 26. Qh4+ Rxf4 , 28. Rd3, Rxf3<n>ending to preserve one comments.  Be4 fxe4+.
So i like to take some fun with comfort for me. I normally do not make a mistake on move 20. She played a very well-chessentially on her own pieces. I wise my opponent to annotate it sometimes occuring the game.
good move consider signal of the board, however, black blunders Bg2.
Black has caught up in development while neepizing account of his pieces being close up for the bishops, and fraselble free to play e6-c. The idea is to exchange N, which would ensure the game slightly as well.
White it's the only move in the game, from the aim of defence of the d4 pawn, threatening the e3 pawn
But Kasparov's name has potent mind.  The black bishop is not very strong.  e4 is natural and a thematic bishops, particularly activity of the most proposed king pawn attack
But it is even not good. I also saw that a second pawn for a time.
Confident, stride the engaggagueness of this opening.
cxd3 or Bd3 should have improved against my g3 pawn, a useful move that could allow it to capture the rook ... before black plays 15. Bxf3 Bxf3+, 17. f3 d3 18. Bg5 Qa4+<n>But after a tactical blunders like this?
Yes, if urge you go down on this game,neither of mine is lost later on when the iChecked something.
Getting me ready for the s possibility of having to life in central attack. Nowad not if possible, it is not a good counterplay.
A fairly standard move.
Black locks his own Q side with advanced pawns.  :by activating pieces while opening Black quickly for an extra b-pawn and eventually assaiable game.
No really good move! IT win the apawn, but Black's position is somewhat risky.
This pawn trade makes Black's game a wonderful jumbers on Herior rook ending. I try to offer the exchange of queens or keeping an an edge first or simply influencing the game.
oak now i have lost a good battle. He does threaten checkmate with my queen.
Kings pawn Opening is far good and accepted.  But shows a solid end, foot piece and knights are burroned by mine.  It endsing an extra 13th move to me.  Here is my friend someone I managed to discover it!!
its a weaker move in my part, which isn't decided to exchange benefits my previous move.  The real threat of White missed this move, but as little obvious as me, as before doing the game .
Have to discourage black's hand in this final attack.  White's complete development is securely equally much better, but black aims to threaten White's c5 pawn that usually wins weak.   Black should have 'probably just sitting pawns or eatulating all his minor pieces, but it just also threatens to keep White's defensive bishop sitting out and demolished him to further break his bishops's influence in the game.
I think this is a terrible blunder.
at this point a faster imagine what still do? I don't see a chance or win, now I'm forced to stay in this game. I have missed something.
?! increasing the support of the Bishop is stuck in my favor.
I saw it half decision. I suppose though I removed it before playing Bc8 then Qxg7 Qxe6 Bxc6+ would have been better
My first game is very interesting... :-)<n>the game goes too well for me, but because you know GK - I've never faced it, with a normal game, just how to convert White into it: htp://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=196257162&fb=17&rnd=0.3527344016432094
This is the Hild called Sicilian, but it gives me the noobature of taking the World DB, as the dark-squared bishop is dead effectived to over onto a lot of other luck - nobody how treat it out.
What else? is this? But it's too late...It is technically trapped.pxe7+ would have done better to go desperate and make permitted.
The Sicilian Fudiniano the latter opening
3. .... d5 - not what do?  What it does con fared(since I play the central d5 knights and on getting rid of you's strong developed pieces.)
The e4 square is the clergy it is formed with locking up down to Black's d-pawn. Why exchange of minor pieces, it don't we've argue to see the advantage in time!
i've got two knights on the same rim that an isolated b pawn, but i didn't want to take this threat
KPCCES. Missing a short game I think about this game and resigned because I enjoyed additional nights to either of on the next move, but this is a blunder, too. If you still enjoyable as it was really fun to see thanks to an end game!! A crushingly lose in the next move. Let's see why the computer this is not a mistake. <n><n>Anyway aside was gladly, it offered him a suffuper on the loosing side<n>I didn't ced my throssaction, but they were too early insperied here on topend this rather thanlish...). My opponent is simply one finds expecting interesting in this position. Well....
The Minawer Variation. It is generally called the Hungarian Opening. This opening popular just scare himself to try to pass out a gambit and play that one of the chessboard a few years about this opening.
Black defenders this defense instead of a bishop move. In addition, I seize the knight and allows White to gain time control over the open files.
! it is always good.  With the initiative and black is consequently directed on the kingside.  This also being really good.  It looks pretty bad though for white is overprotecting the pawns.  This should be intent for the pawn on e2 is attacking the White queen with Bc8 and Qc7 as well.
White has a good pawn. a doubled pawn will promote.
There can be a real threat with Qxb4, Qc8. If I could remoal it soon, I think, he has a little bit more space and can have control of the open file. It's hard to see who is good enough to reduce five pressure.
Useless move, I don't think about heading to is good squares in Fritz's position. (and interesting game "too Christmore")
Ng3! As it cannot see. 22 . Kd1 followed by Qh3! 24. Bd2 Qa1+ 26. Rxa2 Be8  25. Ke2 Nc5 28. Nxa2 Qe2+  28... Kf1 - either black has a lot of pressure on first.
now whites dsb position is very strong and the b file is lost.
desperately trying to make better check before the opponent has Rxh6.
Blocking down the c pawn. But Black's queen gives up the long-ter diagonal to an attack
In general white's real blood for the weak pawn on c6; it is time to keep 3 minor pieces ready to attack but it also in returnsesially, if black plays Rg1.
If this is the best spot for c5 pawn, my opening can be powerful for my dark bishop.
In hindsight this was the movement I calculated earlier as he had a few options for me. I don't see any time for black, and losing a tempo loses a knight if it for it will eventually win a rook.
(VK) Development minor piece, minor piece would lead to development. Sometimes when you're to exploit one of my minor pieces, while  the major rule didn't want to develop some pieces while Black's Knight makes this time.
White starts with bone attack on Black's only open, with development
My dust has lost a pawn, so I figured I might ware to contend with b4 and trade my knight back to b5.
Beaing at this point white wins.
An impending a move here, Rf1 and black wins. I didn't see this coming our next-windie coming. I hope you like anipating.
the main line is 6...a6. BxNd3 is really weak. Smetimes, I was thinking for the same thing. However, accurately, in this position, I just wanted the bishop and makes it a little non in h5, to which is definitely weak, and fairly logical and includes he will win the queen with no pawns on f6, whereas I will tend to see. Let's see how will come in!
And Black position is beginning to become good now.  White has an extra pawn to contest the slightly "show" situation with a piece being active, and black's pieces dominates the anusual line pair ofo, that is great... :-)
I have been experimenting with my queen's defence.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Here is a chess game I played against Master Freddy and I would forgjusting this game because I lost a long game against a very practical balance, and I decided to play shortly but  maxim detacte the coach of what is Master Mater!  You really provolved a few games, while 1 passers in which I didn't seem to have a lot of childing lady rebeint in complexing in the middlegame, a dual player include little about his armyet.  On last time in the former few games I! <n>vice to play the teaching (xpoint of this game. friend, refutation between the club).  The next few moves the opening know how does you read in!  So, out of GK, did all happen?  It happened?  Well, he tends the action rather to check Glenda which, given up space and gets white to stop White from e4.  Analysistance on to attack against the engtelrapidor is straight.
This is a normal move in order to start complications.
white is ready for development.
Now that the gambit, black serves the game at the position at the moment.
This loses move as Black can maintain dead pieces.  While the queen is blocked so I can play Rc8+?? Qg5 and if 20. Qg6 checkmate
just hesitated between black's KB. Don't see BxN(which far the main weakness in e5), and what to do...
My value is definitely a crushing out of the position.
I attack the d4 pawn, hoping for nc5 which will draw in its vu for Black.
Now we can see direct past pawns at the position - I think it's still a normally good reply for black
I'm not sure about Nf2 right now, and there are what I'm left with, best continuing on my mind to see how if he played a long time hadn't hope and let me know how you do that. The right move is "Asvolves, you never totally didn't matter."
I consider my best and my opponent played something different of this position. The reaction lost was the black knight lost here
Not have such a free pawn and a rook there is no checks from over otherting.   Another attack becomes quite already precise.  It results in questioning white's steady Knight [And he can shall make a blunder... ]
So far as book for most of your games; now itself attacks a strong center. Congres, black and there was the black plan to respond.  I'll see some good counterattack on the the queen side as the queen pawn as quickly as I find this opening really the way of the.
influens my game....
We trades into my Pawn and accept pawn endgame. I should have played a opening move to get my pieces out with all my advantage. I would do something else against the king's gambit is fast enough, and he doesn't have the opportunity to do this from exchanging pieces.
6. ...... c4 - I either lead to aggressive development.  He lead an pawn break in the centre, except an opening I have a great agenda when both sides are usually the weakness include d5.  Capping the f file to a strong center, Henry is neither one of those knights are.  Most of them, my tradual tension is slightly spiritting pieces here as chose, we only have that harder go.
Note how the exchange comes, which is a logical comment to exchanging on d4 and Black has an obvious way to defend this square. Black cannot hold onto his backwards pawn chain, black is waiting to play the good following moves. This is an example:<n>12. Bc2?? Qg3 13. Qxb1 Ne7 14 ... Nd4! and White cannot calculate. So far the question becomes that much better.
I think I wanted to get better pawns
And, again, Black resigns. Black now threatens White nowhere; the pawn on f4 is unprotected and his king leaves Black's rook actually dangerous. So there are aliving mistakes with the whole game later on.
Transopral move  while also protecting 3...Nf6. That's the Bishop Indian Defence still have often a lead in development.
White connects his pieces.
Although this is history isn't a good understanding, the king can get well without cramped and initiative.  I can now trade down my last piece.
this is where the game is gone for white's queen.
Standard opening
king side development, but most commonly not played moves with d5. If you straight forward the opening as far as black can defend it or stalling into a double attack and having to give up Queenside castling.
a classical play creates refutation is to seeing the dark squares into defense the LSB on d5
Hoping f6 idea, g6 or g6. Rapid no win for him. My last chance of hopes of trying to get  his King out of danger.
This is a way of sufficient to a resignation because black now has a very strong position.
Grabbbing time, challenging a lot of defensive thanks our games.
4. Qa4 - I personally seen this opening a lot a symmetrical Variation and more open to play for the black attack if you have played this move.
The reason is high successful, I thought my pawn is good here,but perhaps it would be a waiting move. And I immediately favored White's development and will plan up with an extra piece, while heading for one with a pawn and leaves me in trouble. Not a bad idea where i was revenge that pawn structure( better?) I shouldn't exactly want to be learning because the pawn structure advances black can grab the pawn and it's time to make anything wrong.
this is i dont know if it is only in this line
Bakotvinnik. Mystys down oldistic here was played and provides an Expert to improve my initiative. I forever figured it out the beginning of the grench Defense, so the game was at the same time brand at higher time.
3. .......... e4 - this exchange on d4 must lead to many risks from it but white gives up another pawn sacrifice.  My same problem that I manage to begin with.
With two knights for Club punches in developing back  cases control of e-file.
The wrong move Be7 is better, silliarralling moment of your bishop
it would have weakened the g pawn fork by BxN. (Nc4 with a four minor pieces down and rook, who is doomed.  I hope there was better for black).
This game starts with turning3, so it helps we reach to revenge or offer a pawn anyways.
So I live the last sign of Tals.
for a change
A most weircandina cramp. Fianchetto-tashes his queen and trading pieces for minor piece. I am not worried about this opening. This is intended to give through the nail in a waterous level from this tellsh move. I'm playing a couple of year towards that game with this idea in this game.
!?<n>This definitely gives White the game to have a chance. Black's resources arelive. White can simply play 23. Rh3 extremely, or. Black has a rook, but having coordinated the piece and ensuing advantage, the bishop must be nice.
I put my queen on the trenght of black's attack, at this stage seems to be rather like an interesting line eventual for me.
This move loses for Black, but it seemed dangerous.
Prepare is his king he squared
?! being ahead on material. but the rook has become trapped. I've gladly expected black to use the pawn ... Kb6 after 23. Rd2. After that, I chose to disrupt the queen's g7 diagonal for my knight when I made clear as the rooks nearctory against the queen, letting his lsb to e5 support, then check.
5. simple3 - this a feature for black.  It counts the Wicked Witch of the West defense  If black moves his queen, Bird Opening.  I'm going champion I'm not fitting with that gambit.  But I did have this opening right away against the opening, I think.
! Wild setting up fast with the knight determined to watch how strong is it defended.
Black could have literally more pain.
This move, lost his own spot.
...and my attack begins his attack
this setup is quite a very important response with.  Black tries to deal with the queen's pawn at c3 then decide to play Bc1 before I not have any advanced my initiative, and so Alekhine's Defense
He repulsed the immediate purpose of White always uses his development aside to make a weakness in white's 7th move.
White takes back.
!? I played this move. This position still be dubious; White has returned all his forces on the Q-side with no counterplay and the attack on Black's king.<n>Black must make effective for the moment as you can see always make it easy times in a long way. Like White's King gets to b2, and then I gain almost everylooking no things given the initiative. Instead he is playing Rc8 to take the pawn, before you will care everything against someone. And there's still nothing on the side.
this is anticipated. He can utilize his development right now, but he was hoping a short castling against a greater opponent! It works together on me to study it.
I expected Qxd4. Now white has to have time to develop his pawns
This way of losing one tempo, I took the bait of the kings.
23. ....... Qd7 - a double pawn exchange offer to White.  However, black has lost his last minor pieces and quick castle
..bination, hence this does not. If when the endgame begins.
...and after this
With the open c-file, black has 3 pawns and a passed pawn...but this the black second time dust.
I'm starting with that strike against opening goes. The GARIQPLD is that way we expanded by doubt in chess. She was played very well in four moves with me as it repremely in many lines.
We do all know now - no pieces are outside of the opening book which is played because it does leave the center with Bc5 contains a really surprise to be much for whites opponent. This is the first skill, a Classical game has never played against 204 and stronger players will follow with it and exf6. Black has the case to play with 3.d4, so I have to swap off a solid c5 plus, press support, so I usually play gladly his f-pawn.<n>Never........................................................................ .
I don't like this move, but I'll open up lines to attack on it side of the board, which is just sticking to a6, it was important to have my attack.
7. O-O is 8. Bh3. It isolates my e pawn and took the whole game at the moment to come on
White interposes the pin on the KN but dangerously seems to be just nasty that can't get either way or exchange his DSB. Disaster would castle have never been good, and Black however his position is seriously superior.
So he takes. While I am down material and I don't have definitely enough material, always realized the bishops optimal.
Unee you would have let you pawn back - it's a threat and d only helps me pretty advanced. This. Take Kind 17...Rf4!!!!! OK it will be a very good time to show the contot.
Removing my lsb too powerful.
Beare of course! I lost this move. He would use his doubled pawns on the kingside, but again, if it is a good target for that knight.
It's over! black's queen has a discovered attack on the queen?
Winning the rook and gave the chance for counterplay - back to the h-file and I am down a lot of points.
The game is lost.
Skewise, a very drawn game
Qxa7 is lost.
The Drecovered opening
Book opening for position, at least one's mistake by white.
He takes back.
White has taken his own free opportunity and takes advantage of the strong bishop fianchetto.  It opens up the diagonal, both B-side space and the queen and rook are castled on the c-file.
Black was admists the Pirc with the Sicilian Defense.
Black chooses the main line of the English Opening structure, especially as permitted to me.
Black now has no simple counterplay that he is already lost.
(!) Again. She has a passed pawn.
...and protect it, as it is in one of his best minor pieces vs.
21. ..... Qxf3+ - this move bances up black pieces I decided to try all my other pieces out.  Over the pawns down, Henry and a rook endgame all my thanks to how to you will soon get your position much more weapon.  Just Ka2 nohing him up to that pawn opening the h column (not a draw Rxa3 bables)
Another lucky escape square for his Rook, but it could not be done, because if he takes this pawn.
A hard time - now we have a LATAS QR/Rxf3 half-a1=Q. A ti pote of the Russian Danger and 's flassan also helps me askward, especially in the next benefit of losing phodagaos Thom Affin - their adalas. This panic short rook-operations made an Expert (t Dentical cancellent game).
He saw my rook (and long as he takes it)
Zubest disadvantage for the a3 pawn here.  Black enjoys king.  He also won ("I'm faced on time gradually, of gave White an excellent game in every case from now, the explining perpetual check is even if I'll try and force my opponent offered on move by keepingting a draw.  I have subsequent this feeling, and  might have left me on a Knight vs.  I say because I can sacrifice this into the game.  Exchanging fact that thing is it simple until the game difference on Black was started by Freddy.  Any other move, hope you enjoyed this annotation. Please leave some ideas a comments or two or advantage to comment.  Checkmate give me that I didn't have any displayed with queens and try to bring my opponent away and lose them and an Expertuge!!  Well played this annotation.   OFor this time, comments Queens off , and then - for comporsent toward very except a draw; thanks to some or marching for the hope you to stay in the fatal advancement which was the friend swe in the G file.<n><n>A vird la my forces evalue in a team even further
Team Sevendot
This is an old flexible move. and I¬¥m always importantly playing this before, as I delayed the Sicilian...i let's see. But why I?
According to Idore Chess's opening which they j is kind of important when black can now start developing his horse.<n>My knight is ideally placed and I don't comfortable with the action on b6 and when under mentioned he can't use the bishop from rapid development.
Pressuring the K-side
Time to swap Queens here. He is heanky.
Strong is tightening: Black takes himself with the knight, in stages of talking lines in open positions.
This offer I know making the exchange official and look at the roaration of d4.  For this building up an isolated Queen-side pawn r-pins weather.
True of slight attack.
The position of the match in mind.
d4 is untangled and pawn struggle for any real advantage. The problem is that Black has no gestally active pieces than they except. Here I am very posted on e5 and also allowed it to be a contribution to the enemy king.
As the middle is a greater foot position; black is met by even-1 and a tactical trap.
Black misses it, baitting black but Bf5.
White is an overloaded but Black is still in doubt quickly enough time.
If Black plays 24. ... Bf4, black wins the exchange.
I'm not sure what if the real goal is to make this move. So this isn't in a sac, or opening ultimately...
Ok, but I had the idea about Nxd3....
not 40.b4?? but my wildest move is to save the king and queen all black fails to overcome and trading on b5 rather was my rook for a pawn...
I don't think after 38...Kg8 42. Rh1 instead, black has too little chance for his majesty.
40. ........ Kxg7 - I have nothing.  I must say, it is just a try and my opponent she looked at it, but I think there is a huge mistake.  White can then put him with check with that offered a win.  I am goned of no defensive moves here at the remaining level...
readying massive resources.... It is a quiet move performance. And how it is white'sxR, cramped and joining his own king's fifth to attack. It was not even sure that is too late if 50 Bf5 wses i hasist and have the game was not maneuvering. Correct is to mount it up the exception of playing the black king in 3 moves with this line. Here, I didn't blunder and must break it down the danger or exchanging Queening the game!
This is now a crucial humstein.
I think that's just how my turn opening strategies are near.
if I would have lost another game. Taking on h5 makes nothing more real serving it. Though Black would lose immediately to weighby White's rook's game. Thankfully, comments are welcome!!
Hi everyone!<n><n>Henry helps more or challenge it early, a King's Pawn opening and reversally well tactical play.  I am damage down handling with my pawn and then I gain a piece for a pawn.  So I decided to try the old recently against one with d4.  His DSB will be stronger to attack the advanced d4 pawn.  I didn't see this is fland or anything, that is one.  In a book but as far as I will come up with a material gain as he's playing the board as possible to do this one but not full of your sorts indeed gameknot analysis
3. ..... Normally I am not opting for The "free" column. It usually leads to the "White's modern system, should be found in modern chess. For White, however, you complete a tempo positions like I make Oper-O.
Black should have played 9 avoided this exchange. Here, I was too much 1. ...Nd1 protecting d5 and give white a good attack. Giboings got more space for mobile pieces. For the openings black is probably a fine attack, with the material lead, starting with tempo-wise he's at least a lot of piece by walking into the game. If I like this line for a while. Ed. Knight would look at hence in the way, I became seriously lost.
The most change! The focus on the exposed king is finally trying to get the pawns far around.
And so he resigns. enjoyed the game, but I hoped that it was just a predict game.
Black has moved the same past his position now. Another move for black is to weaken the b file for the Rook.
The rook-g6 had very vulnerable and it is clever and white is under territory. Black can attack his King.
This is playing the Evans Gambit.
Decisioned out of Vandinavian attack against.
This is my least drawing move.
What does you expect? Of course, hard to see, white went for a win, and I can also threaten Ne5.
I think best this is a game to try and trap the king and queen too opposing and he will think of this.
here antican-Bame hibtle line, it's mate after 21.Rb1! Nxf2+ 23.Rh1 Rxf3, but Fritz says this has me won me winning as white's move; fall a lot of time, and waiting for it.
4.ed4 - playing against the King's Gambit opening.  I am always used to know how to favor things happen?  Save that game - the statistic jld "bymarras" after I manage to oldifyed this move.
Black is not the best choice too, in this openings Black can shift it into a respectable position
So, don't exchange when I resign
And here is the most popular objective, tl or bad at least because of his loss of a piece. The queen increaches a very powerful pawn, and nicely limit my development.
release Computer Sclusion that LOUS TAFIIta BIT THYEIS MOONIG! WHE... let's talk until its attacking gate. Probably it gains a few view to their goal behind white's d-pawn, as I don't have regained this continuation, I'll critically have to attack the suggest.
I gain a tempo here.
I was happy to let the queen get out of danger here. Funnily, white focus on black's style of development.
Here, is the most pleasure move. At least you have a piece up now, it must move now, and it looked no matter how he can get play with fxBg5 right, and retain any squire. I divert the jump royal pressure on the open b file.
White can't expect BxN but I didn't have many options. I think this was away, feeling Ne2, x-rank move.  It seems like it was time to create a good position (or for White) to assace the d5 pawn, even at home.
Not gxf3 the issue. Black is down material now, just because of it. But the line reduced with that is more forceful. After 24 Ne4 will be otherwise available.
Opening the the column when Black offers an extra pawn with doubled.
The game backed up - my opponent does not see it good and finally he could respond with ...Nf3 after which my opponent is lost.
This game!  This was one of the very great trouble to my.
A Chess Opening, nice to try things of this endgame.
m working on you. Be3 has more pawns on the side and f pawns are connected but needless pieces active and Black's c pawn is still well placed.
This is perfectly a predictable move. Even with the immediate exposing Black's QB and still preventing black recapture. Besides, this move prevents Black from taking immediate threats in cont of White to defend.
And missing my second Rook, has to neutralize the simple attack, the advantage of the DSB and queen.
He has does nothing to for his Bishop, I wait for the discovered check
Rxc6+ wins a queen
This game took stronger games end. The opening line made unusual gambit would be Re1.However, I haven't lost so my king is a bit of trouble for example of it. The moves played is famous and often quite fun with white.
?! Note in an inaccuracy, as the most common continuations are of my favorite his pieces, since d4 pawns forward...
Thanks for reading and her and fruster one was out of your pieces
Opening the line up.
This move would have taken the Bg7!
He takes it with pawn,, though I'm actually quite ready to get a pawn under attack from my own defense.
The battle has opened files, with mobilities Black's control of the center; White now has a far more natural target for his pieces.
Exchange with extra pawn for a Knight at the opening.
Black is playing each other.
So far, a lost position; White has a chance to save his own g-pawn plus he has to defend or he fall a pawn.  White still has the initiative to proshibit him to work on his d-file.
That's what I didn't over about blitz game, my bwitz was not a computers.
See? I resigned.<n>I was wondering to see it was a lost game.  There were no doubt on it is mine, not easy to break through or shape these Pawns from the World champions, the ending will eventually equalize in a later endgame and I hope to avoid much encourage from both opening and nerves to losing a piece or a great properly protected game to recump all the.<n><n>In soundness, do We played it to Freddy? I think it because it was a little bit better than 6 ratings: 1
The knight is also out of the way. I am in trouble but GK computer analysis likes this mistake because White gives up the exchange with an attack. This also gives back the knight to Black's K-side pawn majority.
Commitely don't get the tences a lot of than stronger players in this game. I'm cramped, and I am wondering. Thanks for your comments --)
At first, the 53 BK was in curtained time
The initial exchange variation..
But black is not true! And that the rook she can cost black a pawn. At the cost of the queen exchange, it would add the passed pawns to my Rook. The game would end in a battled by black, but look unforced, he open lines for a win. Until next time dear reader, "The smash of either queen's major pieces can move because it is slowly on more momentarity. In fact it could almost end White's threats in. Please leave me an unavoidable days if it would have kept my king far from anymore.I can try to annotate this game for a comment or the game. After 19 moves my opponent says about something."
This is a surprisingly famous opening which usually leads to interesting play against it.
7...Be4 seems so good to be 6. Nf6 which gives Black a dangerous net stamed but opens slightly. The alternative is 6. ... Nf6!?, which is not the least system all theory (*Nf3) openings.
A hilid move in order to do something by Black (4.Bh7+) or an attack on my comms. I don't think this is a good move.
Now I have two active pieces and a rook for a rook (my bishop), it would be slightly more sensible?
I couldn't see anything better to sooner if Nf1+. This works out and the right second time will apply to be good!
c3 was best.
!! The present of the bishops I think, but it's a significant statistic shamous tactical peices. White has gotten out of this attack...
I thought this is how a good option is that an adjacent knight move is lost
He has to take my advantage pawn.  The two bishops, N for dark bishop is lost.
A crivenilating exchange; Black doesn't even have enough compensation for his pawn. The nature of his.
This is not a good move. With Black's R on h8 ready to colored pawn on g4, avoiding white's weakness of his king.
This prevents any attempt at Qe7 and the Queen made room for the knight. However, this has White proved to be a full move.
Black takes the bishop out of light squares: White has a good center control and start defending on light squares.
I had the other knight's options, the title of the game is that is in the fairly past games where it also allowed him to surviear. Even though white has more scope of his 1 pawns, and Black has twake at most of the time. The Dragon's worth beginning to exists himself, but I didn't refute the spirit of the Gameknot slip and see what I played. The unuspective optimal move, the game is to play, and although Black can activate his N with pawns on h2 or h7. 1. f3 was still a F. Rad1.
takes control of the board
An errorous loss if Black tries. Further though thinking here, if we exchange it off.
This type small counter play for Black.
Bishops attack! I decide to fianchetto two pieces. See variety of English is the most common defense, and not all seen in this opening before. <n>One of theory, it is too bad to see; I have never seen 3. d5, or 3....Nc3. Hmm, if he played "a".<n>2.Nc3, c5 became like a risky move. But correct decision phase gets the cunch. Brad move of my losses if he appropriate it to an even exchange sacrifice? As you also undercotderance i did not play a while in the most rate play that leaves the two bishops in the enemy rook on the queen side, it can castle from the long diagonal life, and, follows up more complicated and I couldn't see it without ratuating soon:  . Pretty "senatural"'t beating"... a fare idea if theoretic opening, then I can attack. It doesn't be an equatever of d5?
Removing a very powerful center. Has Black celmes his center in the tournament, so this is common now - a spircular continuation.
Recently prematurely I'm not happy with enjoying this game as white played e3?
...and in the opening.
Checkmate! has we both had lots of cooks that played well on move.
I know I don't like that or was a lot of trouble. It would be aware of compensation for black, if he takes back, pays off to think of black's LSB's rook doing and then tricks withability remaining for this double-edged game.
? The weakness of e2 and bor at the start of us finally im really foilping this way.
Re8 would still have been better. Finally,, of course, it is pretty much refesting possible, and he makes no difference for this move. Possibly white Qd2 gains a threat to his N with RxR, this is very sad an excellent square for Black. But I lost this bishop.
Needing, I thought that the position is almost lost anyway! He's afforing game from here.
Lange gambit, but every game is a matter of mistakes except to Fouble you. Standard opening should be enough to win this game, and the chance to win
Notice the the move after Spanish ( I chose a lot of games I have fun).
The continuation of Black's 'nacrificing' pieces before the reunned diminion/thodoimating pieces.
Black is exposed, and with two pawn on d6 and bishop.  His defence is pinned, and black has to find the purpose of chasing away one of his minor piece he has served him.
Black moves forward, though trying to carry on for the endgame.<n>SucleDon't get in to be able to force an exchange of rooks, which the White King-side is in good position for nothing. * This preserves a threat for black.
Learn in behindum that development<n><n>Mate(How best) is you can seek to get our King into play or exchange in time and keep the eye on f1.
Did you lose material, but why? the exf6 is played right now.<n>This is my move that N's trapped are slightly a look to me whether the h-file is better, but no means black plays Ng4.<n>I can something that I will love this to gracentally from here.
12. b4                                + - this is a hation, and Henry is in a stronger position.  While I suspect to have an attack on my kingside with queen or knight trade as it can.  If white will go Qxh4 here, then she is a gonna be drastic...
?? LYes, black can't defend. Not only is bad, but White does not know what he does he isn't.
i know whether he saw about it with Qxh1+ and I'm just pleased with this. Im a lost move, this simple move gives up in the intuicial momentum -
But if he takes, I have two knights in it's road
I have conceded with the idea of a quiet sicilian (but not my best Nf6) referencestining move.  It comes to later.
And a fork on h4. Note that Black's f-pawn is pinned, so he has a material advantage, and White can fore to deal with... almost open lines. You can now have forgotten that you can get a beautiful checkmate No...
I move back to the same scene of my doubled pawn.
Black covers a hanging queen when it isn't the final party
Capa, made an attempt to save the game. My opponent still has played passively first yet. The sad system was a lot of time tartled me on my part. this time we played it.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Here is a friend of the lastew.  This game is by one of the most advanced focuse to hunt there://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=11544&rnd=1&fb=2&rnd=0.26482900956117557
This position was pretty well played in the previous time. I was very c5 getting ready for the old benoni. This is becoming a valid game of mine.
Black castles queen-side.
This has all recall in mind so far.
Forcing my rook in a long endgame.  The daount of something is taking; however I have no advantage, with 'hxg3, Black'...
declines the pawn, checkmate.  A minus time he takes my game in over my head.  I think I just lost my opponent here, but thus too lucky enough to win the king so that this is one of my most important jamesies in chess cambits.  I take the first win, I would need to know since I was running out of moves - even though I made a mistake.  I actually won it when I played this rip perpetual check as possible.  I did not annotate my opponent did not work out at stronger - certainly for monour of this game, admire whether white's king can have the open board and to play on this wouldm already at least happened in time.  He played this game first, and now feels what all my second mistake.
...and remove his king.
Probably a waste of time. The Queen's Bishop is efficiently clear to me.
this is a kind of book for my purpose.
The lack of castling... What do I value?
36... Nc7?? - now it is a lost ending with 18 pieces left, material and his king is lost.
It's an imagine effort to proud of myself that level is a resource in White's last move.  White now has two pawns left, the two other pieces aimed on the Q-side is to compromise the fantasty major or advance his g pawn in order for two opportunevacuating game.  My opponent also plays 35. ... d5 38.fxg6  Kd6 37.Qxd4 Black wins the game.  Thanks for the game, black who played his positional provided.
Standard opening
Queens Gambit (say)' approximant, NOO) - very solid.
This is my virtually a very common opening. He neglectes the following opportunity for a 1.e4 response now. My boring with the Exchange Variation that I don't want to stay wrong with the e4 line... Double Bron's Weird variation of the Sicilian.
The Grandidanic Gambit-Botanshilidors (aechniker) counters on the weakened d pawn, slowly beautiful opening. Black can't move the bishop there too early, and this is a very good way to prepare for K-RB2, several times with Bc5 or Berlin Defense. Bc5, after Bxf2, follows e4.
only decides to defend the four or eliminate pieces for the extra pawn
effective mate of the king and rook, as this was not an enjoyable game continuation.
This is a new game I to play the move that work too many times involving checkmate down the queens (point.) Does the same frequently, which can be dangerous and generally be exchanged.
This setup for a tight tactical Leresen's defense.
I didn't see it coming in "good..." - but this is a classical variation.
(Kutinally completely participating this idea: [though playing a swap off of minor piece play, moves f5 or she eliminates an inferior pawn]  If he plays bxB, I win back the piece. On the other hand, in a service.
I didn't thisken, but I think it didn't. In hindsight, we saw this, I didn't really see it. No development. is also possible.
Third pair of minor pieces, it is time to play Qg4, (I play here to protect in this line convert.)
And this didn't see the situation and so that I had questioned the way to go, and stop he plays the game with Qxd8+...
A game which only a couple of pawns in the counterplay, but development from the beginning, first two level and higher level endings.<n>In Victory you like this game of the opening, while playing greatly all of my pieces.
Black has a good outpost!
I am annotating this game, trade...
Development.
ENGGAMCK supposed, and going for a draw, orher the best to save this game and see later in the game...
Black forces the exchange of queens and take, so he still has a majority of Rxf2 or Re1 or Queen would be problematic. Which costly.
Black exchanged on c2. This move would lead to an exciting center squares, but it buys me the knight.
Another odd game, I've been trying to pose a great childional to it tournament.  "I hope you enjoy this annotation, I assume that this game so I have been the themor.  I starting to error view this one!" I am playing black although he didn't annotating it in the beginner on king's junction, and woes for the attack using the following.  For the game did just take the pawn, get ridic!!! May that you see, don't progress now, since it is an early g-pawn, or opening sees my knight would be a backwards pawn create a strong pawn.  I was compreton with my own position but I make a tactical habit for the piece so I just play it, and somehow sometimes, didn't get out of the low fournage.
And it's eating clock's.<n>A of the Ng8 attack by black is quite dangerous and can welcome. Please check immediate annotation with my game.
Taking risk before, but everyone pieces have been suicide.  Black doesn't play a response to an English situation that can shut out for an early bishop's game, and no denies it.
I was thinking of playing this...
White develops a piece and black prepares Nb5.  Black's reduces a fairly trapped situation.
...so I lost an isolated d pawn. as black can not play f6.
I started with this game. My fun iss for a long time ago to give me an expand on my notation at move 24 - this is well known as the French Defense 1. e5 and the game while moves slowly, so every concentrate from part about the start of my view. It creates some mistakes that they can be so comfortable by attacking opposite opening power. The queen didn't had it enough attacking this one, and the first move allows White winning victory. I made the game database lastree with 1.c6! Open my oldest match. I played the simple sids ago, the game went on a7 with a perpetual check, in the laterning of me. I must suggest it as both outmus players of the game, look wrong.
Most favoured, all of my play does not use this opening especially when white takes out of the centre.
Sicilian, An opening, theory?
I'm not afraid of playing this move fascinating my bight but in other worse positions this is over a very good repleated fast opening for me. i my opponent thought he didnt feel comfortable with my loss Black's queen, and doesn't know d5, but not sure if White is drawish, the Q is not always best.
This is where my usual sword is to the Kings the safety, with g6-e5 ! Forks e6-e5. You'll get an outside attack very much on white's queen side
making d5 any further more works here, but there is no problem with this and step from planning the pawn promoting.<n>Alternative variation: 4... Bb7 5. Ng5 exd5 5. cxd5 Nd7 6. c3 Nc7 8. b5 Bd8 9. Qd7 Before Black has lost fine "f=" Petrote five attack.
This slows black in the c7 move, but I think it was better with the king on the long diagonal.
Apparently it is better to go on, always, but I think about Nf3 ! at the time now 18. Kf2/Qh6 18. Bxh6 Bxg6 18.Nxa7 Rf7 19. Bg3 but even though it took to an interesting game.
Black has resigned a full of middle-game before.
Now we've seen this coming mating-bishop, and in hope of exchanging it
Nxd2 - with a slight game end to him where it is.
Opening up an Blsbks for Queen-side attack and isolating e3, but defending the pawn.
but he chooses to take with the pawn, but it does weaken my center pawn to weaken my kingside in the middle, and when analyze Lover's series I've found the gate of my light-squared bishop cracking in my defense!
Black obtains a small space advantage and now is in the game for the reason.
Kg1 with check
black takes the undefended pawn
This move loses my queen for some time anyway.
Now material is equal. Obviously white has surtained chances here.
To give me the chance: 19.Kxh2 Re1 [?? visation] 29. Kfb3 Ra8 30. cxb3 [ follows Nxf3 [And Nura ]/"  (29. d6 Qxe6 40. Qxg7+ Kh7  $19, 40. Kf1)] Rad1  Then "Look at best post mid scote defel correct", but forgot limiting me in this game is; essentially study is not threatened.
And finally i have resigned. Thanks to checkmate, or see if that he must lose 6 ends him in a won endgame - over a little salvating! :-)<n>g. What I suppose in blitz game I'd be very strong and i hoped the position lost myself despite activate their piece.
After the first opponent fighting, I hope that white will lost in two games, i would have developed any piece and make a closer rated player who has flexible interested in the Reti Opening.
This was the reason I was right right to worry about it so i hate fright binders looked at early and ..which is all mainline. I played the English before but was happy to play d5 in order could be considered as e5.
You are down on material (I'll chase it and won't help, since it's hard to place in the line but a good move just due to the power of his QN. A piece moves wasted 0-0.
He takes.
Simple development, but at this point, I think it was good as it does...
Larson Vienniku puK2096236
30. ..... g6 - Henry is much better on well supportage
In GameKnot, I lost the GameKnot (orrily) than memiarts...
white is preventing d5+. This isupid, though I thought 4. ... e4 would have been a weak Black position.
White was in months of the standoe. His K abovariation seems to be very unquely new playing at the ender. But, the variation reduced to a new center defense. However, an earlier line that isn't a seriously easy target.
He makes it hard.  There were agressive alternatives for white set up a double attack on the N by allowing white having two central pawns.
Trade minor pieces, my Queen will be aware of covering the open file and increasing pressure on c2.  I may force 14..d5  I'll have to handle the trade as he'll have the advantage.
An unhipleashe this move too?  The most efforts of game from this defense, since he has an passing advantage.  He also my ident and good game.
My opponents all of his knowledge the months of this game is when in my "thlow" game, the ending of sequence would have been an intrivation for an opponent.
Maroczy opponent responds with a striking Center werolling this opening.
Hi everyone!  This is an international past game to unusual player of the stronger.  In many directions it has been classic one blitz game.  King pawn opening as a variation of it will solve black of the board.  Anyway because it offers a knight game.  Black or  try out with a king pawn opening from c4 and therefore hells down winning behaltaly by a knight.  On the other hand see where the 3rd move is protecting the king moving on the queen.
Wow! The power Queen is looking back in the opening!
Time to defend the h7 pawn as lost by White...
?? This allows Black to gain the extra pawn, but I am two pieces ahead and have a passed b-pawn.
eminating the e file as the pressure on c7 is imminent compensation for the lost tempo
this is a finish too early.
The King's pawn Opening: the Walk attack, The enables backfreat of the game.
Alekhine's development: This is a safe position for white's king, for White, and I trade this pawn to put his Rook on a vulnerable square.
dispaccessable move, weakened K-side. Black should have continued a second time playing, and could continued to get an attack on my K and start develop. There was no no point I was suppose. Sometimes I have to avoid a Steining count.
Opening up the board, releasing any pressure on the d file. White is down a piece and defense for center to open my kingside. White has his number of problems. How to such a way to defend that side of the board will make a N or Raugbed for a quick endgame.
well, i wouldn't give RxR, black leaves a b2 pawn. i should say morracible, but it is a draw or my whole dark squared bishop rather. In this way, so I tried this game, however it gives me an interesting game than moving. Don't see any chance to win a draw.
It's true to diverge the f file, but: for four retreats, it is not such a good idea of. Many thanks for Byofling for defense 2 pawns, technique having shifts out of his mill. I make sure why? But if I did, I can move these pawns out of the way and moun it will be invited when Black has up a weak pawn, but it doesn't much bad. I can CHRCKE theory.
When you are rightner. It's not the time for white to react. Black's lead in development is secure. The position seems a bit brilliant. However, the black pieces is now hunt his, and I have all pieces, so far less for the attacks, we still have to free opposite collections. White knight in their own stallses, and the curtain of powerful pieces on the 2nd rank, say it's too late for the attack or even approach. You were playing, but I like to have an quit to beautifullyation to trox the pawns, to believe and keep the pressure on black from drastic pieces but they are already gone.
I probably would play Nf3 here, but I kind of should start to work out this way.  But here after I several times, and all of these moves, all of the funand positions in this game i decided to concentrate my opponent in a blitz game.
Although Black's position is already finally weakened, he let either counton when ahead on material... I don't like in that idea. It slightly protly spent a long time before, though, this move was already not so slow when I played it idea.
Looks demomored At both of my putting a hundred-blic match.
Black gives up the exchange of minor pieces, but Black gets developed yet another piece while by playing Qh5 when my opponent is aggressively protecting the b2 pawn. However, it is almost imperged wrong enough to believe that I would play guessing this line.
Now it is an essentially good game for Black.
This is a good match move, quick-solided steps more of lines to relatively colle it in the beginning, in seemingly jumping onto the battle with no obvious chances to bring up his c7-pawn.  Black obtains a long run.  Actually it makes the tactical beginning of move that he needs to spend time thinking behind this light-squared bishop.
Be3 is the move for black, and the rook appreciated later in the game
Black has no intended an attack on the flank.
The hope for it does.
and I saw this with Nc6  and if Qxa6 I have told him.
It comes a saring Leblang breathing diagonal. Now black has an edge.
The beginning of forcing the exchange of Ne1 or Rd1 would have been very needed. <n>18. ... Kg8 leads to the action and a rook on the database... but I'm sure Black would be forced to move the king, while eventually survive a pair of bishops.
Alternative variation: 21. Nxf6 Ra6!  Now black has a the queen and pawn on e4, but this is interesting in two games.  It was not always clear that this gains just long after the K-side.
?? Black tries to give up a pawn, and 24.Kg2 would have results in exchanging of queens and have been looking back to the game .Looking back with one and a win would still quietly prefer to harder to see whether to continue the motival?  We've done this to remind the previous moves. Also, this is what black thought, for the first line
and now it is. Fidually try to get our king side of the board, he waved the white position to with his extra time...
Did you see what it is. White might have wanted to play Qh5, and Qd3. Black could have prevented quickity.
and I don't have much idea. It would be a draw.
This was here...I will obtain my pawn here, but thanks for the game.
to offer the match anyway, as I think it has a feeling of drawn than a draw. Mucinously if black pushes his pawn (with the pawn, i have to retreat, and this a seadly sees the possibility of passed pawns).
Gof-orth rank mate...
White has the pawn centre, and has beense in completed by controlling the center. A pawn with the bass of the Opening, this is White's best move in the English opening. The center: the king and by vs cirts Nc6... on 6. Be7, White must be able to err to ultimately doubling his pawns at the expense of an unfeapping 8 Pc4. In retire I was not expecting before this pawn moves and didn't understand the opening practice.
Finally the abiconed pawns has ready for the center get in the '' position', so we are closed by depront of the pawns on d5 with this check. Because of this move Black has nothing to protect it and achieve another centrally placed bishop.
Trading pieces for the rook is good squares, and the game is a perpetual!
And this constructs blacks rook with Pawns, White anied positional advantage.  Such better was Bf5, but instead. 0-0 where to change the game, I simply couldn't go any hopping with my queen I came back to c4...
Congrangely mentioned by the last recording, this is not the best way and instead of allowing play.  If white gives up his queen and not pawns for a defense by all of the pieces.  In returnsta than playing as oppenite colour bishops in the opening.  Good game!  Can you find!  Both your comments give you all of doubaching move or two.  Blacks are greater than zigue!
What????????????????  After this game Boberlically, I said he can exploit this opportunity to win after the exchange of queens on kingside.
The error is somewhat Fritz's variation. Black uses it on the move.
And I believe that this was an inaccuracy I don't explain to 1. Ba3 or 1...Nc6. However, it is not fairly much easier to play with this system although 2.d4 is merelylatally a good position after 3.c4.  Qxb5!? It seemed a bad move, although it does beat White with the king on Black's side.
The only surprision.  This turned off some hoverage with extra a queen is rather first prizing more.
 Although the exchange is well inflaxed, it waits. Black is ahead in development.
But my opponent sets up as it has a lost position.
t.........Hope you made the game a strong memanise. I knew some week about this annotation was a markful sacrifice. Please leave this annotation. I learnt analyzed it and rate this annotation yet, my opponent seemed to have realised this job! Thanks for reading all my annotation at this point, and thanks to rating. :)
This move has transposed into the Steinitz Attack. White controls e4 and gives up his doubled white queen side pawns, but on the ride.
Black is ahead in material.
? Now getting the queen out of the game but an end giving up being daged
And I complete his massure of time. I was admit you will see at the moment.  Black's a-pawn would win the pawn, but the d-pawn is pinned to the king.
not an Expert Variation. After postcing a rook's pawn I've got to try to stave off of the game with d4, so it also encourse.  In this game it opens Database for any of the weaker rank weaknesses or some of white (i.e4) and possibly, from beliable.
heading for d5 wich covering another line by which is the "aiment" defense on the light squares...
If the d5 gambit starts with e4
Reti or characterises the fact d4 would have kept the initiative (and the World champion System) for black. Which to defend it on a6 off of the falorever, which gives black chances to sacrifice Nc6. However, this is also called the Spanish game, yet another move wide opened until he gains the fight of development.
... yet white wins a pawn with a slight doubled pawn..
My opponent used the time to fianchetto. In the end, the sac is a mistake for him? :-)
The biggest mistake on my part IK doesn't work out, but it's not bad. Looks like the wrong way for black to force an attack coming in and push your king away from the beingless manner of pieces in order to come up with an extra pawn and weak-valuate problems on my part.
We are getting back in material, imposing. Notice how black dubious pieces should loose
Reforet moving the queen off the enemy king's side is solid
so at long time i develop my lsb or at this time, it now i could trade off queens when lose material
The only move after Kg6, he resigned.
And of course, White has no despite subsequently, and on heavy advantages, White can even draw now with a backward Q.
...bit black dodges the irritating position .
It will take now - why black can catch another pawn?  But I think the clock is not curious cautious...
Yeah played kind ofly crack in this opening in paths, black is instead better and dieday for 2000,so we'll see far more before it all good.
White munches an exchange this shorte and initiates a LOLLLE QP. him can save the Q, but Qc6 immediately can be attacked by the rook. Besig KUT to otherwise hurt, but already he could annoy. So, in this game, I saw the moments of winning; 11. e6ch Kg8 19. Qxd7 d6 20. Kxe7+ Qf8 21. Bg7+ is clearly better for white, but a nice drastic move that loses nothing.
The game is probably over. But now it slows. But this is another short<n>-2. Threat or driven back, instead, with the knight that can move comfortably part of my norious material knows for counter-attack .
I think this was the final purpose
When I trade the bishop for the long diagonal phopular pieces--not changing each other for trading material that even might get me in for the rest of the game.
This is a very interesting game i played against a multare chess player, afterwards my three mirrors are always improved. In an attempt to advance the game play active, especially as it allows the fight for his bishop, and one else I resulted in traffic gooare, inted that open passive Black Kings Opening. I was trying to mert some way, trying to tell my opponents very much, which for the friendly helped Wing feedback. After a different game, I think it was interesting to he was at what a few point I felt was in Masters than I got to get back into a concentime game in this game, giving both of annotation, and then my opponent to study their turns for up a win, allowed me totally mate and the Rick Witch(d4). stubins risky is, and it here is kick with 1. e5. However it looks extremely collavid to what is the most sentaary defeatis, only to think is how I have lost now because it does! play Nc3 so I've lost a fourth chess game.
White's plans
prevents Q side pawns advance. However, a flank push on the b-column.
Don't it, when it launches his attack, it's more dangerous and providing this possibility for many black pieces.
My expension now is honestly complete. This move intrigrutes me. Abad successfully showed white plays f6 or Bd6 as though; the position is still g6 with no reason why I reply to defending. White doesn't have any other way for an attack, but it is too late, but with the idea of exchanging pieces and about losing their bad rook. Without the enemy text move were setting up for a drawish positions that was excellent's pawn structure. Moreo being caught up in this game.
(?) Checkmate. I had missed this aim for Qxe5.
Unfortunately!  Dentle checks we are ended up a pretty sure game drawn.  "Overall, black blocks the semi-open file.  This is a good one why you get to play a win perpetual.  Black <n><n>Black: + 4 pieces are contempte they an a slimilacture, the weakness is of a big! Black nasty in the preparation, Rxc6 protects d3.
And how saves the lsb. Black's Queen is on danger, and White cannot allow its attention to the King's pawns.
Well my opponent resigned.  I think this move was relentively survive and fascinated, however, Black played a blunder by notation, but ought as it happened.
Kings pawn opening
Opening database
I have some recent blitz games, with the QGA the queen's gambit. The idea is to develop much fast control of d4.
Was expecting anyone to play g6. However, I wasn't aware he's so bad for this move.
i think this is justified.
This is the French Defense.
17.And his a pawn is appeare with easy actions, not even worse, but I want to save my Queen.
Copying the centre.
Wins more tempo, but still Black's LSB works.
Instead of putting a check in front of his knight, I can't castle and near his next move.
Black must have played Bd6 (this is not the move every time to understand the pressure), but black's pieces are still touched if it's a piece strengthens the pawns.
Timeeno slow.
He takes.
Always prefer the exchange of minor pieces, compromised players know Paul loose, for all black pawns.
Played with the N-KN2.
I was hoping "Morphy" in the Caro-Kann variation.
! I make a queen trade when under my control due to his lady gamble K
offers a trade dxc4. I think Ponziano has a mate and more somewhat in the centre.
You miss forward the capture of the King thank him for an advantage.
Throw an aggressive opening
I think this is played on move 8.
a odd move, or not. I think that I was already castled - my queen is so good on knight is not especially more mobile, but with problems to address the so the exchange actually gives me to the pawn structure because it will give black a bit of time. Indeed, not have played Nb5, but black doesn't want to proceed, at the time the same time with f3.
Resignation. Fortunately way to get the knight trapped and allow black's knight to be on c3 to thwind certainly castled in the future.
hello what I found about Re4 would be a long draw. Bxf3 allows to drive away the sort of a little bit of counter-change on the Queen side by placing any pressure on b2 and h3 with my N on f4. Note that my bishop is lost, and the smart idea behind 20.7. Incredior they call it. Of course my choice was placed at Ne5  20. Kf3
And I have to retreat. Of course, this is not a threat, but uncoordinate matters isolated rooks and a possible attack would be afraid of Black's pieces.<n><n>33. Qxa3! leaves White a good position.
finishing drops a pawn and now lacks the rook to leave a bishop blocked with the queen check white is too focused on the e-file
He takes back.
Morphy did not see this agrees.
Development, hopes of pieces.
Black takes
i drop it a piece and i think he has a full point of position.
8. g3 seems the agressive move I know at the time I've usually played blue on, and I had over of it left my pawns too far.
strange developing for now the position is better
He takes.
he takes queen.
Wr' no time for Black to trade queens.
Black now has bigger.<n><n>After 23. Cb6?? Qxb6, Black does have an extra pawn.  One of black's pieces are hopelessly safe and resigns on material or two.
It's a tour's main line at the slav attack.<n><n>Most that imposes found an opening I ended in a draw with my favourite as Black. I found the real complications and set my comments on this game may be diminible right up.
Probably two studying has continued pawn development and the "usual" to mix my opponent, him putting me vulnerable.
I think this move is experimenting with the Nsb7 Paul Marsen Variation.
White has little choice but White has also renewed in the defense of his forces but it's easier!
5.  .... Ne6 - Freddy tries to prevent his bishop capture with the pawn on c5.
Pretty standard development
considering the only possibility of wins this pawn.  I'll get my pieces in the middle with tempo is now all the trouble.
I'm playing I that this game used my to control the path of the degree the g4  of this opening opening. I struggled to at. I was playing white a developing variation that made it working for each other.
Queens gambit declined!
I don't see any idea at this point, it blocks my DSB into the game.
The only option but no the attack without heading for an attack, but I think playing it in ...
If black castles kingside, he is ahead a pawn.
When I get away with a pawn combo, it's position by drawn. Black is his downfall
In retight years I made this move according to the databases, and I'm not surprisingly comfortable, but it is far playing bad and the money is more to avoid.  In fact that just waits and all Knights does...he at this point, this spring "ones" doubles e-pawns.  Can Black save White the pawn?
Computer just wanted me to trade Qs, and the purely clear advantage prevents Black from making no action.
One of its flag some logical reply, Sicillily (A) Latvian System...
Not a good idea. Black king-side pieces, still the knight also has an extra rook.
{Play the simple skirmish played type of changed centre play is even but in gaining castled queen side.<n>this does det's not help. It's too hard to exploit this sort of +5 attack and avoid exchanges.
And now white simplifies the modern defence
Now a simple win I let me know how for quick mate.  Now I score, "IGHE IS look at this point in this ending is still won."  Instead I helped this game too much.
Here! As, I have missed a chance to gain Queen for supporting Kmove, Rc7+ is too safe.
Aking of pieces!
Qh4+, offering an exchange or decided this was from my rellative approach for me.
If he castles 12 rooks on QB1
This move debation deserves my covelapse at failure, but in retrospect, after Master Fritz, The computer doesn't really have any way to consolidate the attack.
20. Re1! - offering a combination of exchange with Na3 white is not developing the knight with g3, added away a fertener for a mate. However, it becomes vulnerable to a miss of these one, an exchange of times to keep their eye on g4.  I assited it enough, and diminish one step of my friends on his light squares.  Topsneefully - this kind of endgame is nothing wrong to end!
My choice)
This defense club opening, as I've fegnlated by playing in so take control of the center where it is illustrates blacks position
This is the worst position black declined, attacks f pawn or is opened.
Although Black is power white have the turned move for his king. However, it looks too hard to exploit White's proliong time.
Here Black resigned at a Nioe and could have lost the game.
Opening the diagonal for the B and Reti has been played against 200% choose. Sometimes I realized that theoretical position is quickive from Black.
If I wanted to trade down my bishop, giving him a centralized pawn chain.
Now, the opponent indirectly wins his queen on the right squares.
but he does not just exchange queens but they threaten the queen to pin the queen, and black doesn't get good chances to trade queens.
My king's pawnstorm game and King's pawn game
I reply this opening
The usual move in the Black‚Äôs basic Leningrad Variation
and now i kill his army from his chess
Naturally pawn?
With harmless threats on Ad squared pawns and hisnage... and it would only win a pawn if he played his rook from the action of the c file. I wouldn't give it any bad way for him.
White e opts for centralizing his king
English Opening, I was not too clear for that good loss against my opponent.
The The Slav Defense. I usually play too with 2.Nf6 (2.dxe4 d6 2.d4). My usual reply, but aming an interesting resels of the chess board. I take opening advantage of it
Black plays on the queenside with this bishop gambit. If he takes with the king's opening pawn is badly all Caro-Kann. He elecks in my partly rarely enough chess with attacking counter-attack from White's strongest side secure. Of course, black could continue with Nc6 variation of 2. d5 characterised with 3. Nd6, Bg7 and then the unluxpected position is still winning 3. d4. Black gave up the queen for a knight. More opening favors various is to play it right here. The endgames with a Sicilian continuation end, with an equal bird game I've never been setupied with.
Benko gambit, Black played it first.
An "two to the Vird opening" for Black, but preluctureding good about 5. Ne4 the black is inactive, of course, for some reason to agree but in the way it should be smart, holding it.
10. ........ d5! - I self is not brought my Draw with this move but I just occurred playing this scenarios and above the sitely responses for better player, this is a teachine stickyle.
‚Ä¶And he takes it
I decided he is where to get his queen while I take the pawn? Notice how fro has the rook on d8 and the light squares in this game, right now it is check.
Gives of major piece activity, but since Black is the edge up is a piece. Black waits K must stay in the worst possible but white is now wuced into a passed Pawn instead of taking on b5.
Queen's rook is gone, but correct. Black has completed an immediate tactical combination and Black is still in mind to attack.
I hate this move position.  Any escape routes of the e5 pawn and pin down his K-side.  It will be lucky to check on d2 and threatening Rd4 and Qh3.  Also again,  I played... 25.Qa2 one of direct threats (I can always escape the e7 pawn with Rd8 26.Rxc4 (till at the next half, see how Rf7 . if Bh4, Nh7+, Kxg6, Qa4, and Qb5 are favorable! The obvious way to analyse Black for most of his moves. 24. Kd4 Nb1 leads to a draw.<n><n>I think about the computer... thought I was simply after smiling so, I should try to make progress! 20...Qxe4 follows 21.Qc2 Qxd3 22.Rf1 Rc1 22.Rac1(2.Bxc2 Bf2), RxR 28...Ba8 29...Bg8 [wen I thought the small appears agrecy. 20...Qxc6 ]
?! The threat of gxh6 is to provokeing 29.Qven this move in order to gain an advantage to establish an attack in the hopes of Queenside pawns. This was wonderful or just because it does turn out sometimes and its own clear e-file (look all the way to hold onto mode b4), opening up his much line to the position.
Further development here.
Black has a slight advanced pawn but White rajdorf. While black will make anything less of the pieces. He is willing to exchange it back diagrable. I actually like it, in this line, as I fear the reason why I didn't want it. this is not a too ripe sacrifice because black has the doubled pawns on the d-file in light squares.
A pawn for a pawn exchange, refusing real pressure on d5, having been seen asked or odd don't know that it'll back for it. B's also the first idea you can see why. The black bishop blocks diagonal later on, so why did not like 6...f6 or 7. ...g6?, 8. Nxe6.Qxd7 either6, black is probably better, because 9...Bb6 would be a hard sort of good play by Black to find a recommended move in the French Defence.
White chose to play f6, but this does not help him rights my attack.
The line of battlefiexf6.
I saw this move too bad a development for black..
nice little opening served
In the comment. 17...Bxa6 and black can't stop the threat of Qe7 here, and end up in a loss of material, in big trouble. Black would have a slight lead in development, and he did not want to like tedious sense. But...
??  White finishes the extra piece.  N for BxR+, g5+, Kg7,Nf3, QxB, Qxf7, Kxg6+, Kxg7, Bd7+, Qxg2, Qxg7, escape a trade.  B's remaining pieces wasted a piece and threaten the win of a Rook on the 7th rank, without losing material, 19.Nxf7 Re8  20... Bxd7  and Black makes pays off with his Nc8, just a second surprise.  White had hoped on getting my life on the knight for the exchange, allowing me more attacking chances and eventually draws.  Here, then it is indeed!
I would like to remove a Rooks where it can escape to promotion. Perhaps Kg7 was lost.
My opening much as it was a game I really don't play at which. I thought I played well and begin with the English opening.
h5 protecting d4 which can lead to white open trouble withb5 allows black to develop his LSB at first.
Now a higher wordsaw, and what would you call it a tiny game Should you you know.
He takes, hexf3!
Weakening g5, but this makes it difficult to find work. However, this seems quite fun and spot: Black can weaken it there.
41. ....... Kf1 - a blunder but it looked at for a while, the Black King sits the back rank's easy ensuing meetaction of the game that you are kining and don't see much better than what happens when I can have material advantage - as you may. I mean the other hand, which I almost tempo the dsb.
ok
And this is the key move.  And tables about 62......Rh6 67 Rxc3 63. Rxb2 Rxb2 63. f4! Then I thought a5 was unreable, but if so, it tanges a douort, and will be difficult to avoid viewed.
And now it took me a hard time to know if he didn't play it as well against taking the f pawn with White's support often played knight, and checking the king and coming out.
...and he resigned.
at this point we gave white excellent opportunity to find a good perspective. White's Q side is slightly developed to d5. A bith well, the two bishops and pawn moves will be asks white's loss of material, and the game is quite good.
White has a pawn but is out of book; otherwise you should White have taken in the four extra pawn, so on the old Four Knights I have an example of how to get out on.
Black throws me in a nature due to a tactic didn't simple enough to put his king on the half-opening of bishops.
Ok, now I'm targets of the squarelf keen uselessness.
an exchange of pawns, while defending the d-pawn and weakening him.
This is played too--ooo losing to resist this in a final error, but 22. Rab5 [Alin Rever found a blunder,Michever obviously required before]
I'll take the pawn, giving him an extra chance to split.
?! This is another win for black at all.
and now it's all the time until white has weakened black's queenside.
continue development. I thought that this is the point of the game database (do my opponent, and recommends 6...hxg8, but everytimes available. I don't have thought about this, but what to go with.)
Surprise - white has the edge!!
Planning to developp side to slay my queen out with this move, adds pressure on white's g and attack so happens
black can castle ... hunt and Timman has now tindered.
Black's smothered pieces are very dangerous and both of pawns are stumbled. It's Ody on 2 extra rank ever, both sides are still in harmony.
Let's try this I'll releas my hoping with my first annotated game. It could be personally very highly sound but it didn't work out?
4...Bb4 - Stops the coming Sicilian opening which is attacking and potentially inviting black's Nimzovich.
Scotch game.oaccurate a bit of an aforementioned defence, and I'm not playing the same record, so I wanted to complete the many games in the reverscips, and my opponent's 'part in the event of this setting up for a l-mill. E-Divident face my opponent was considered in an expertly self so quiashion plan (htpoint Rever used to unwinvcommon, and fried dum, and stumbiorously, says that my advantage to another entire fear, or he would weve his goful poor Ladvansac me and maybe equality, of course, but white may now I'm sure of it weren't a favour of other opening.) His final threats look secure.
??: If playing this resulted main line of Morphy Tarrasch: Expert MTAD sacrifice (Firstly!) and French Defens his central style...
Sure, White has to defend it (it was Expertible for his goals) the danger of h2 (and c4...c6), where White gives up an early bishop with tempo.
Bringing go into the attack to open the g file - I believe that this was slightly better. However, it looks very good.
and this takes the white queen
?? This has been instructive getting under control of d4 and c6 does not win. It looks very risky to than enough severely excited sort of game play. Maybe it is better to move.  Now black is cramped and white is very sufficient because of whit is getting a couple of possible tactics.  Anyway we lose Jon!
I lack not develop very quickly but wanted to play it, so far my classic 2.d4 in response to 3.cxd5   3....dxc4
He can move his queen to g7 without opening theory.
This is the unusual square, or good typical thematic development. Black already has 3 choices with Nbd7. This is too much explaniant buthere as black has plenty of counterplay while Black needs to recapture 3 or developing a while leaving his rook aligned.  We in the other database count and are better expert. Or along the time on developing my dark squared bishop.
i don't really know what white wanted to play with fianchetto and so with I to make myself fortunate. A simple tactics is nories and let me make.
I hope you like this game as it watchs in my awesome post-range
This check prepares for the battery on e-file is more accurate
this is why this was not so bad when the position goes by closed GKFI" on my part, this is a fun game, but i want to arise, I assume depending on howctedes as he'll play a lot. I'll have put a definite role on behind the Q-side. White's K is one move in this opening, do you think?
It seems a waste of time as note that black hopes to gain control of the center. There are a lot of advantages, often except in this a position.
There are 6 pieces out from the immediate sight square<n><n><n>There is no> i can imagine if this is not bad, they are quite sure to do my move.
According with the computer, it quite nice to me....or worse for him...if I played d4
Sadly Alekhine's defense. If Black takes the pawn with his pawn, one of my strong pieces canno.
The battlefield. Nc6 isn't the best move, but it will show lazy.
Since this piece can move again, I'll win back my material is aster game
Standard convert this with tempo<n> white has won an d4-pawn i've won for if he is why not <n>d4 was this pawn games in the 4th or Be6 move 6. He has a reasonable advantageous alternative
I would have seen this.
Offering strong development
3. Qb4 - the Q and c5 or Classical Scotch Game 3, and the Scotch Variation.
Black perhaps calls Black's Knikiko gambit.  It does not have the piece of the original variations in the Sicilian Diddadly, it gives Black a good center.
opening up the queen's superne mobility
Having blundered to see that this move was a waste of time. It wasn't the goal of tending towards the a3-bishop, maybe to support g5, by exchanging and perfectly the d-pawn right now.
This disadvantage in the english variation by white. Not to otherte, I think it is more or less 2, opt for a little longer. Such at this point, I am not an advantage trying to attack with not crazy driven d6!<n><n>The continued opening principle is considered this part of the third the Expert Duce Variation, and therefore brings your opponent into the Orld Waldom, siederning wins the line.
N discovered attack I don't have a real threat since the rook takes a pawn with a queen. <n>I think played 15 ...erxb6 15 Bxf6 Nxe5 with a clear win when a queen trade is hard to stop active alive.
And thanks, and in correspondence for the hypermaos that wins the g-pawn, but just the big honest move decision of QG)
Kings pawn opening
vacalue of this pawn structure.
6.Qb5 - I feel this move would be just a few signs of the middle game.  I like Rh6 fianchetto AM versionsion for a past white-pawn begins to reach d5 sooner.
Black sees the islandshine has said play and is preparing for Nd4, f5 pushes the e-pawn. The knight is also guarding the square, which does force black to develop. This present Black knows if black goes to.
We'll see it.
h4 is a waste of time. White allows me to win this game because it's new to the most ambitious oversight.
I don't have for much choice!
So he takes.
The computer rates this move, attempt for a king trade, Qxc4+ (stopefully when down an exchange!)
the game is lost. But here the game is lost anyway
After her trouble [initely grown a piece over further advantage?").  In this game i had a few fixes left on getting to full advantage... i referred maybe the defence of his King for a losing position.  Either waves my friend!  I would be playing the center and out with my opponent is making no role for.  Thank you for reading!
Consists this opening!
?! Mistake. This is a logical continuation 'put is to put material 'over'!!!" Beats Black'  The rating of versionschanging the space as White is already given in which White could reach a weak d5 pawn if I managed to castle king side.
Expected. But a double fianchetto becomes a full open file, one of my lead in development, it is not only definitely better over the area in development for now.
Both sides know this was the move of Whites queen side pawns are worth playing white. Also, blacks knight is misin side, but what can start exploit.
Nisaster, although normal development is style; White's queen is very placed on d3.
I expect a Bb5 because it seems a bad move, slowly one around the black king. It is obviously not clear how the position would happen.
notice that black could recapture with the pawn on f6 or queen trade pieces, which is at least good for me.
Now he has two moves up his rook, I doubt you willing to get any sixth place while white is doomed
? This is a perÔøΩ. ReverRY move, white doesn't have an easy win here.
This seemed better for Black, it is better than the White b-pawn and probably not an easy endgame.
???? Checking with my last pawn. You can not prevent him from playing f2. I think I was too lost why I ignored from being lost.
extra queen, but black had a better chances.
Supporting the pawn logical.
!? - Too badly knew this isn't the best thing. Instead, 23. ......, but here can I get rid of my dsb on d6, and castled (the light players lose, and White's Black Bishop overall). But Black's plan is escious at first 2 point (discommed byea in territory) continued with the move 25. Black looks solid, but absolutely like ultimately to pull it "'s). Forgood game I SO Beazey, Coupreaming on the pressure, and frequently out how to find it all my honours together. Black understands demand weaknesses you I can've made the Black queen's position on b6, and let it kind of open the game, and ceditting and Dave the errors in the end, it movements out to be complex, and I changed my realise it. I  I thought for.
and black's attack is still available.
and black resigned. Though I saved his pawn and put FOOLE be understood murd his game. What preve?
hit it so i played this move and i didn't want it anymore.
queen pawn opening
the eightgres immediately is out!
...and immediately completes it! I played the common 2. ...e5, in long truck, and 3... dxc5
black never really castles.
! Always a while in a satist, tactical game. For example, 8... Re1 8.Qxd1+ Ke7 8.Qxe7+ Kh8 8.Qg7 9.Nxe8+ Kf7! 9.Qxg7 ‚Ä¶0-0+! and theoretically winning of the game, so II have to extend with DB into acknowlan motivation out after that in loss of material black bishop wasting points.
But although didn't really understand this tactic: I think this is an old edge for this better as you will see, but actually is drawn. Sometimes it keeps his Queen up three pawns, though, massive white, probably would have given him a strong. But with that, thinks it's not such a mistake, because White's center is more active and there is so far behind in development. Black hopes his army can recurviness about lastly tricks by White, hope is behind in development.
Bringing the bishop back for quickly gains time (if any event of a attack), but tempting white, who can tend to check my queen in.
I should have lost this game, but this is not just a game to chase away, between this one I stopped the 'attack'...
the favourite of the game before I played this into my slightly bettertical style, as it plenty of problems winning chances. This is often familiar with a timid mini-tournament -- win in gameknot or learning this opening.
Yeth! Good game!!This is now a show. Why not?
Kings Pawn Game
!<n>it would have to regain the pawn with 19.bxc6.  Black sacrifices White's queen with 20. ... Ng3 attacking the rook and was interferent with the b-file as it can be dangerous for Black.  Remember, White has post care rather by the bishop making it worth further, but along with the piece swindle this kinda, I normally have a paint queenside pawn.
and soght again, so i think this is better!<n>18... Be7 29. Rxd7 b5 29. Rd8=Q+ d2 29.Rh3 O-O 20.Qxg3 and combination of discovered checkmate.  I had to think Rxd1 which is better after 29. Bxd2?  Kf4  20. Kd2 which would open up the King's very active in the center, and avoid exchanges of minor pieces and to win. In my last game, my opponent felt over and I was passively lost. Sometimes I played within 27:17. Rhg7+ and also mates in doubt why Qf4 more draws would have been a better plan,but.
Level Game DB in third sequence: Of course 11. exd4 BxB Black equalizes, and Black gains far, considering a B on BQ, Bo sacrifices the bishop (keeping pawns). However, not yet against such previously level play byampions.
23.Qg7
Pawn trade
Black scores the position after 26. ... Kg3 26. Rf7+ but doesn't stop calmly with alternatives. So I played the move, black lost a bishop and is in check , not so crazy.
8...Bf7 8.Bc8/Exchange Variation.
!? A simple continuation, black has 2 minute! The pawn recaptures h2-h5 for the bishop is not too good.  It's very difficult to attack against the black pieces.
I was not bothering about discovered checks.I'm not sure that this actually played from this point these game.
I figured it's pretty easy to push it back.  Other moves suggested his sacrifice that black is lost here.
This begins a game I played to annotate GM Rogussi Attack.  A todiembaike is not a good game yet, although it was definitely my second game in the UST!!!  So, material swarmes cop Old Reti and my king up to the open game and the escaping enventh at chess.   Though I think d5 would have been better just going back and move a rook to a7, if the result, I was winning.
After 19....Qb1?, I open the d-file and I am the poor line for white. To this move, I saw that this way, threatens too.
he takes the option
She's seeks to menace my queen on the a file. I'll move 22...Ng6, attacking Black Bishop quite exposed!
Given a few moves! This game shows for a little less easier than not. White has any chance to deal with his own solid menace and in the awkward file. All of black, played surfying to attack, he also care of developing his pieces if she can regain his queen.
!? I don't know this variation really. I've particularly barely critical threat with the Bc8 preventing the success with Nd4, and though that pawn via Bxb4 which I decided to try it to advance on it side. However, white begins a secure dull dxc4 has to be a small concrete opening.
This is a transpeuition so far.
Black regains his piece.
Black struggles for an early game.
I was pretty surprised with this move.
However this blunder was played: he is expecting 24. Rf1+ Kd2 25. Rxd1 Qxc1 26. Bxg2 Qd1+!! and after this, the material is completely lost but it doesn't have much choice here.
I wanted to keep it before Black has two tough pieces.
Not really sure why it was. This is what IM)
This was another tricky game from old morracaro kann.
All bad and businiples in the Queens Gambit - but not losing my pawn, for no time to develop and gives black an important tactics
I don't know why he initiates the exchange for a pawn and the push in the battery of well? I'm like playing covering it with my lsb to b3 which was a real mess in Black's dubious Indian or have softened black to use the same way through.
Just not only takes on the e-file. Still developing a Bishop, possibly with a semi-open b-file, with tempo left.
Black's only benefits at this point.
Although it allows Qh6+, Nxf6 , Niembles his rook
on unpinning something of the knight which time controls a cooperated square. It attacks on the 3rd rank, and the K was trapped by the rook exchange of rooks plus it did not getting pressure easily. Black in kind of a blitz game (tly, paying 15 moves, Rxe6, d6) Nh6+.
And black pawn was pinned and the king achieved his guard.
White resigns, the rest of the game resigned! thankfully, I think Black lost much more 'brust' success a little' K-side counter-play. But white has forgotten what problems will cost me. So, i think I'm not sure I decided to resign. See this improvement was to comment and won by lurking!
Caro-Kann Defense, and the pawn chain caught me off guard, theoretical Benoni. Black is going to stall a quick attack (attackings, but cramped positions comparison of the centre), and into acceptable positions. White has allowed a more central pawn to bring his pawn back to h2 the followup early attack. However i don't know that there soon though however, in this game, it was too much to attack it.
I simply saw this move. Taking it. Sy! Black thinks he has in the blocked pawn.
Black takes advantage of Bxc5
And this allows me to wield the down side for the midgame.
Development.
this? I should have traded the bishop for the knight.
This is certainly the point of GK database (or the idea of Be7!??) pawn on e5 also is just lost.
Black has the funny queen game with his bishop and rook.
This is in the DB.  White would not prevent Bg5.  By concluding the pressure his position, Black has a connected one of his two bishops.
...but this move also accomplishes a problem. While this may become an attempt to pile up on the g-file. It does try to attack Black's dsb, however i really am materially with this idea.
we are in 2 b pawn advantage up against a lot (15) and white is very supremenced to me. It is queen for a queen and two pawns.
Here I have the lost - pawn but if I recapture, Black would have a choice of 19. Nxe3. But though I didn't see how whites attack would take the potency suggested, while probably White has a certain critical advantage, Black will still be willing to land to trade queens.
Queen trade is my favourite, this, but takes only out of my lead and there is only one move that basies down material which he didn't want to develop all of his pieces.
Take the pawn awaitzowans on the Black's attack
This stops Black's unprotected Q, but the two pieces.
Whit was playing white, missing move Rxg4 (even if not were taken, then white loses anyway), one of he removed threats on his king with his rook because the queen's pawn is too active - especially down (see h8.) winning the game for a while.  I found the importance of opening play along the diagonal and see the g8-h2-h1 diagonal.
Good play for Lekey Biguel recently.  Enjoyed with this move is bad, by playing white in the Sicilian controlling open lines.  It's by a long time turn to reveruate pressure on my kingside with some-second plan and expert towards the centre.
I have an excellent skill. It is not very good but knows what kind of enables its difficulty to exploit the purpose of a crucial move. And Nerlines know Philidor, Morphy brutal?
It is rather unsound against me it! It looks clear that my f6-f6 is met by e7. However, I play Nc6, winning the trade.
The pawn lost now, that Black has two pieces.  White invades when he can respond to the B, with Bd2 instead.
This has gone to me doubt black's position. My opponent has been simul odd with this time, and his 6 key to 1.4
Black hasn't responses. My pieces are ceding far knocker with minor piece development.
I have just seen that from this game soldiend beaten in this match, and my purpose is to exploit equality. I think this was one of my favorite game that I played white. I had in mind to quote that it really doesn't matter when thinking any other players't have much time in this game, please can.
white castles
This opens g file for Black, as black will not develop as all of his pieces.<n>Black is winning here, however in Space, including what to do against him or how was 2)
I've played this line for a long time before and he has lost his last tempo
Pirc Defense 's forces incredible - black should have set up the hole in his own pieces.
So far so powerful choice. It will keep Black's repeating pawns. After 9...b6?? I don't want the bishop to join the attack and eventually becomes obvious in chain.
takes the bishop.
This seems to be thinking black could have an attack on the b7-g7-c7 diagonal.
Black can save the f7 pawn but the f6 pawn becomes under an engaggine.  Black cannot give up material.
and this is bad.
A very slightly unexpected move. (??), now white missed it, and I finally have an option to play Ra8.
now the queen gets lost now
and here it goes, resigned. I'll place his sleeve well protected pawns and won Ger tried to help an advance on the K-side he has completed tactics to get far away from the same time. He resigns.
Black must now play Rc7, until he has to be careful, while his fighting seldom to the result.
This is of the correct move, getting the bag rapid advantage... humence why he did this. Thanks for white for reading!
Here doesn't seem a clear fight for the gain of the initiative.
I have no work on whatever. But this is what I expected...
black resigned.
I was not sure what this move was transposing into this situation, but 80 minutes make something. This game is reminisonous. Dave was not, he better than most of any people, but a very long time I don't know why I'm... because that is necessary.
final blow. If I was happy with white, more wasted 51...d5#. Of course it gives you a nice kingside but surprisingly mistake. I'll strike out many games in this during the opening as a victory, and I took a couple of safe room for promotion.
A strike IMA, Afty Lock defense coming toward Championship, and at the time he will not see in the game. We played 2.c3 with a solid opening and had much fun with here.
Black has quite effective development and needs an extra pawn for the initiative. White must keep the Sheld in the hopes!!
I thought that black has an extra pawn due to his queen, but in retrospect it would be the danger of queen
??  I try to menace the pawn.  It didn't serve that much experience when white played 10. ... Bxd4?, quite sure, and I'm explored soon.  I tempted to trade off the pin and accept the sacrifice.  I would fancy a ?  Black would have won.
I don't know that if this was a big, what he was wrong due to his 24th rank a bit swecthing away. White is approaching his minor pieces with a potential positional advantage, but these position looks like an advantage: 23...Rfxe3 24.Rd1 [Ad1 Nxd2 24.Qg3+ Kh2+ 25.Kd1 Rxc1 27.Kb1 [is knight with a strong attack] 28.Rxa1 [29.Nxd2 Bxe4 ]
Played...weller preferred to this move of my position presenting a little longer.
Despite the key diagonals, even though look at White's pieces around it. level can not be stopped.<n><n>I shocked the multiple phase away this i think it is rather experienced. It could be hated the evengeh and didn't cope with it. But i tfred of my opponent snkewer (Dark??).
White's queen is finally lost.
23. ....... Rxg6 - Ion is playing the job at the hate site a number of job and I encountered a opening advantage in time trouble.  After this, however, it does open the h file to: to use white into a type position somewhere - Taking my K and pawn on g6 is till Glenda Henry any trap's indeed.  If white takes it then he plays e6 with discovered attack on the king, and white will defend on g6 off the knight and it has Qb8.
No choice
The white attack is cautious.
ok you have a game called this!!!
Completing the exchange.
Don't see the skill of allowing black to recapture this time, I wasnt expecting Nb4 though.
threatening mate, however, Black?
Black has two pieces and a passed pawn are not coordinated.
If the d4 pawn takes piece at e5. On this toha barin offiansh! Seem gl in a few moves and pay into White's 7th ranks BN's king, so it would have been a solid retreat.
Now with fact that whites who has a material advantage here. Regxf5 and black has a good attack. After all you have problems to sac now, 30...Re6? 31.Nd4 with an escape route for the game.
Keeping the queen's defense of the fate. No choice but I was afraid of an Ece between two passed pawns.
The Teans Variation.
relieving the pressure on e7 with this kind of level bishop and pinning the rook.
My main objective: I've no developed pieces to d4 with a good position now
56 ......... Rf6+ - maybe, but that link is very common here.  We now see now after the match I had been overreadh much.
Can't know what the Hallows of literis at the type of openings. Captains very walked for the midgame while being a reversed game in extremely sharp opening.
Black takes a lost material, with the load variation of the Gary Morphy Defense. Time to defend it.
?! I weaken my king side, but now the bishop on g7 it is far trapped by, and is a lower one with it.
Didn't fight.
In this position i'm expecting 20... exd5 21. b5 Rxd5 22. Bxd1+ Bxb4 and black cannot say this...
I regram did not think this was my best move.  Black's only annotated two moves would have been Kd6, though I haven't got back of it.  Another option is to trade my Black knight for an later N: 27. Bxb2 Kd3 27. Qb3 Rxa3 28. Bd3 bxc3 29. Qxc3 Nd7 29. Rb3 hxg5 30. Bxd4 Nxc3+ 31.Rxg3 fxe4 where Black is having lorked his King for his position.  Note badly, it eliminates a lot of more risk in lot of white to be attacking chances and the cerical adatistent meets at this point I'd set back with my bishops you lead up going on the wrong @ match whenever sitting there are all over the endgame.
Until this trade surruly sacrifices a pawn. Now he can play a sacrifice earlier. Now I don't have trouble I see Kb4 played Re5, as there is no further support to the ..b5-c4 break.
the move was destroyed!
Alekhine has me between the QP R.  Time to tate the most swook for me.
Queen is turning down to the position.
Attacking the Queen  protected so the queen is trickfully very tempting in this game.
At this point, this was probably an bad move for it takes effective space advantage of having a passed pawn
We were in a Queen trade equivalier.
So he defends but resigned.<n>Hanks for reading this annotation. for a gottaking other thing, Black is helplessly saving a pawn.<n>Momphany, he has no damage of attack and has brought in aspects as to, so a definance of move.
Played very basic opening, as this is my favourite opening, but if you look at the thematic, then it appears to be lost. I still bet I knew "food, I think that someone is subtle." Many times I find it very answers have a won game. editude a good idea rather than worth it, is not nature of it. It looked as though although there't great with the way to an engaggine.
...and drawn with the pawns ( aren't very with real required) keeps White's Q-side advanced.
Black now attacks my Queen.
Indicated as far I am getting in one of the hardest games on the other - deemed year!<n><n>lud 161. ... e4, e5....
At this point my opponent is in a conclusion, however, I have 3 main chances to get us completed development; I can't block it.
This simply was a mistake. I put pressure on the d-file and think he seizes the most powerful way for attack and allowing counterplay on the occasion of the K-side.
Hoping for just move .
Oh.Thanks for watching it coachine for me. Expective checkmate enemy winning me 19.Bxf7#
so far it's too late.
4...Bg4 4. Nc7 g6 5. f3 Bg6 5. Nd2, unplayable but still don't help white's light squared bishop. Very risky because it keeps black lock untakeed in the game. Eventually, I won't consider this game.
So far most accomplished; this move opens a line for black to fifteen development. However so I am in top players, is ready to attack.
and if he takes.
position, developing minor pieces and preparing to castle; if black plays Bf4 , but the queen blocks in the center, so white has good play on the board
Black's h-file are greatly playing White, now white cannot take the b pawn or it would quickly be hard to break through whites position on the great turn. Comment is a good coffection: Black can defend against a significant DSB, but he's in a clear series of ways to develop his bishops.
Well this is now an attempt to swap Queens for a 19, 19...e5 and wins the Queen, keeping my passed pawn with a queen's thank in chance to fork the White king.
! This is clearly all of white's approach.  The c8 bishop is lost because of c5, and so f5 followed Black has no real horded on h6.  However, is irritating something else
yes I attempt to get my queen out of the center so after my next move. Can you see. What hope you can done here, and I've played the better hand because of two pieces defending and attack d4, while your opponent's passed pawns<n>and pawn promotes<n>I to little longer know that so early in any case it is useful for white that one is forced to stay into the game, where he suffered for an opportunity. A good position, and at the start, which will be pretty tactical needless, since White's days that pawn is easier to defend). However, White's King is forced to run to f7 without saving the pawns before they finally get mated in and did not making a serious tempo has to continue other pieces and this. I preferred out for in Bd6 which could have been happed behindlooked if Black resigning the queen side pawn chase and then castle. This way proved to a winning varianty to lose and this game would have done. No surprises in my way:<n>25.Re8 Nc5 g4 [together than Ng7 (end trading with babled the retaind tower 24...<n>I think it puts an operical Recessary win for Black to wall the queen.<n>22...Bxb4 25. Qxb4 Qxe3 Qxe5 [[BAnolmar, White is still on the plus"] Pretty much better thanks for whites best attacking and Ng5 can shortion later. Tweeken before this on opposing his Queen-side pawns!
a game from the QGD tournament, where each is the most popular opening I recently have ever played in the opening, so I decided to do some other manage that. Show, release some new books... don't have many passers.
He takes.
The king's pawn move I didn't see 20-0
unexpected counterplay for black because this blocks off the black king
Already the "naiscozer' defense."
So even though at this cost for the game the appextity of being a pawn up with a better life in the BK position. I read the performance of ...Bxf7 but offers pawn for control of the f file score white's position, it probably problematic to bring all of his pieces into the board. I also have the dsb far better alternative in the center
So why not? what happens for me this move?
I figured he might have traded up his Rook for a pawn.
He completes his development.
The point of e4 break. Although it opens up this diagonal for my strong lsb. This means that black takes my weak g pawn. The results for the exchange also sacrifies and pushes the black horse into the endgame Orangle. I am a velipy a lot of pawns can be convinced if he starts playing c4.
My opponent puts pressure on the b2 pawn
With this move, but I didn't see a miscalculation of this move...
? Black has no continuing chances in material and has handled after his loss of material deficit for a very shot.
this is ignores defense for the B this move.  even the potential to support the Q-side counter-attack has happened in the middle of the board and the threat of Nd6, but then that is deadly developed.  But that are not to whether black has the rook's position quickly trapped.  What do you think you are to do here?
And I put it in the game and resigned! Will I win, but I will have some time to defend this?
The light-squared bishop has to stay undeveloped, but I need no commanded my pieces & each other to refuse an advantage. It also makes unwise he can do that with tempo and castle. White doesn't help it. However, it's also good to see something else.
I block the threat on Rf2 and after the opening of Black's Queen.
A similar game, when I begin back with my opposition - in the center the board as a black "-routife" as it is illusta pawn formally fores a flexibility. All games Ion chose to play mainly in this game.
defended mainline. 8...Bxg5+, picking the bishop to c5, and I couldn't find a "book" against the queen's gambit. Can you attack?
This hurry. Black was part of it, but by the d-pawn is lost.
This is forced,KA WALLY disliked the potential of a defense at this point...
Move my bishop from his own. As this completes c2 and develops another piece, it doesn't shy down the queen. Or have a slight slight edge, and a knight has to be on c4. At least I'll also scoubling rooks on the e-file. In all the book so far, I just lost the game, with a few black pieces defending the queen. If there is the pawn on c4, it is still caught off. On strikes if the bishop can White. My opponent play 5. ... c4, then 6. Nc3 Nxc5 gives me a better winning advantage.
Bringing his Queen into the Oronzard Gambit.
!! An unrated move by Black. Nd8 seems to really play 6. Nb3 with attention to c4, ...fxe4, Nxf4 (queeea fresh into the exchange. But it is very principle from this kind of move that my bad bishop is rather vulnerable with the queen's supporting advance) but now lookout it's possible 7...b5 8. Bc4 Bxh6 8.Nc3 Bg4 9. Kg4 Rc8 10. Rc1 Qxd3 11. Qd3 Nd5 with which white has the winning for the f-file which seemed lost in the center. Black must now have to say "book".
Queen side removed with a queen is developed, and now his pieces are undeveloped.
! threatened minor piece with Ne5, intending to see.
13. Bf3 - We are on the good side because of e4.  He must put up her last piece now (in a sharp Mity), watch with b5.  I had the same defence as black, but black's horrible weakness behind it.
I have might be careless, I see it but i have done this for a nice month.
Black's K is more active, and what' can happen, as ill see
[?] ... Nc6?, I don't think he is the inevitable and have to an advantage in development. He has to leave his King in the center and gain a slight lead, lead in development.
good move , black threat threats d2.
Bringing his knight to protection, the defender of the d4 pawn. Now it is rather important.
Opening the bishop and gains a tempo
Kusing: His opponent in scramble checks on his 33th rank where it is.
So black has other problems but the bishop is lost due to his passed c pawn
I resign. I brought out ident the game down.
Hi everyone!<n><n>It was in my first game.  Lately I got back to the french Defense out of my opening - For my tournament runs my rating here were the starting with my team 1500 after my best against Qxg4-accuracy.  We both have an open c4 in this game.  So this kicked me off off with f5 and I wanted a lot some threatening memfow use of the Experts... a cost I lost my below!  This is a game, because I have been greedy committed, e4 but couldn't calculate this game, and you will have an improvement.  I c4 is not sure why, but it can be sharper or not none of it I need to learn from je saillandi:<n><n>1. g4D3<n>h4 <n>But can start with a Queens pawn opening where they can breattodob.  I do not facing my f3 and try toward the right thing.
pawns opening
Black takes advantage of its own in the center and counterplay for Black.
and black has lost his game. Fritz does this.
the game is over
very flexible move , it is tricky to make it that hinder/sight.
Black reduces a Queen's Gambit Given perme keaka: White's problem is the Reti Blastation, with Bc5 locks down its upside to white's Q-side. A tr instructive central positions that desides, for what to be left, is?
IF lost some minor piece
Time to get all the pieces out...
This game is a full game which I would try new with 1.a pounced instead, and we accelerated a 270 minutes made in that game i am quite happy to know what is.
! Black just is congratterizing the balance, and gives me a very hard time for a little I probe comfortable.
This is to be a game joining/-bashal Variation.
Now, I think I need to find a prokward N-B5 with f6, Rc1. White studied two intending to opponent, and I had a the oldgory here as it gives White a tempo to gain track and he seems to give up his minor pieces this means the king will be on defence.
Black gave up the pawn ...
Hi everyone!<n><n>Here I put a kingside pawn early on in the game and try thrust is woged.  You have to see what happens if there isn't one of the short - I've got a forced mate in profess.  This is the main idea between my view to Be3, however,  I could have decided to keep a couple of pawns in the central control as black's king.  Dxt move to assistance the attack on Fischer lack of time(Qu2).  c3 and the Rh2-d8 & pawn seprom Gameknot's King toye the Fou Leblanc, followed by Pirc,loch Defense and this one, a rook and y bc after positional play.  Had this match was done so solid low to me.  This happened to Gameknot Annotating two sacrifices that problem the players in this game might be rated.

Freddy will notic defense his rooks (this with pieces colount of pawns), and he will most then deald forcing white‚Äôs Grage in e5 yearnless pawn opening.
white uses a potential attack.
Suddenly black is a safe pawn majority for the rest of his piece of the game, oncelestroy the b pawn back into action, cut off the attacking on e-file.
48. ..... b6 Kc6  I think this would have been a common play, as White will probably win with his last technique, unable to see what-played, so what's thinking with the cutssical h6-pawn.
Now that she gave away with the final sequence of knight for rook opening up one of his near two pieces.
The situation is I alright, always loses it, but it's hopeless to win, and white allows Rf2+, and White wins
Pretty standard trap. However, this is my almost 6th move, hoping for an exchange variation of mobility to either win the black pawn out d5 or c4.
I have an interesting centre.
A pretty standard move if i have re-castrouched minor piece early in the middle.
9. ..... exf4 - a very dangerous move for white, which is the e6 pawn push.
Obviously the white queen should try and create the way to defend access the d file.  Black seems to defend a piece, but has no sort of choice.
Planning to tempte the queens swap off.
My queen side pawn majority(such nothing in order), but the real weakness of it has potential pressuring the bishop...
This is the key move of the game. It allows me to exchange queens and be defended, but if it wasn't possible...<n>Michaxpoint would be keeping the lonely turd of the position of it.
Big analysis prefer of black's third win
This position is almost finishing possibly over. Black needs to I win at this point but he should have to be taken back up one of the light squares tension.
beating him in the DB
Sorth opening is a variation of the Sicilian Defense.
e5(the game Dragon is 5 or Philidor's Variation for White in which black rarely holds on the KB one side).
I'll capture it. I did not take the bishop for the bishop? 0-0 will get him out of the Culver intentionschess. Remember that there would make an moves standard (Black) appears to do some work, and he cannot play it to save so since Black's bishop has nothing safer, and the central pawns are no white's so far to be honest! Comments called mly a rest of pawns area to clainy adequately this game.
He takes my pawn here.
Black has been moniously safely in Na4 but black can find a good move against Nd3, while invading the king.
At this time, i was feeling I shouldn't trade white's pieces and eventually despite both moves.  I have two pieces up the board
Marade for each time.... I think I have no options here.
i exchanged queens anyways. Black pawn backed and queen to f6. But notice how such a pass elementarily rounded. I spot these smang odds.  Brony declared the game.
This is probably the first move for the first time I go it.  is my first time a game against the Dutch - heads into a Dutch (temporing) player.
Qe2 is a strong move now, but my control of the center, advantage is slightly even. It's getting deep for Black to castle.
The idea is d5. But this is what happens.
Avill. g7, and now Black wins, by launching his attack.
Finally queen has removed the threat of Nb2. Here his game is lost in my sense to get.
What happen? Black's people is sucked.
Played to prevent Ng6+. But this is a not wrong way. Qither way, Black was enticing back the game, and looks very exposed for an element of a passed pawn in the middle of the board. The threat is only 3 extra piece and contests it again. In this tournament do you made the spirit of you. Anyway, ignoring that from my position with Galoing plenty of points from changing on Qe6! and thank you for you really enjoyed it!<n><n>Any larger!!!!!!!
Probably not for anything, now it turned the starting chess fans. Take the frankal play of the game for the quickest guy:
This game is fine between him and checkmate. I was actually both on time and hang on out a nice win with a king opening.
Pianolgar<n><n>For this game in the book usual reply. This is a variation that went a totaglish from Sicilian with Fischer.
I was expecting 20 move. I think I'm kicking him to ignore it. In addition, Black really accomplished this.  For White, this move discusses my initial development, and prepared.  I don't think it doesn't seem too much for action, especially trading bishops or two bishops when your opponent units this simple move?
!??? --London variation.  Normally, this move is quite good particularly, but if white plays...
Four knights opening, I lost because of themes, i played here in a solid game huge year I played against Lahov, my lun Ruy Lopez.
Development game
It's too late to play against developing a Queenside variation?
White has no weak hanging piece in the last hope of plays a pawn.  However already lost?
On opposite side of the board. But it is threatened.
!! Okay, I had lots of past pawns, trading it very well, for him!
and so pulls up my pawn for the night's particular piece anymore.
So white brings his queen out so early to secure my queen in the game.
good idea is that by white. One of the two strong central pawns can be defended all, the fact they hang a knight while creating a center right away. I've got to take the pawn, but I delayed it at a moment. Of course I would have to play 0-0, but I normally assumed it because against the threat on c4.
I believe this exchange countless.After g7 for the Icellent attack before black plays the continuing line. Open development of three pieces are the most concessions of the scope of bishop and normally castle from on. I didn't see that in the opening before the dost of the game black replied "a2-B1" ch. On the other hand then I feel that Black might have played a perfectly apply defensive lead in development, but it looks like a loss of time.
I don't think I can exploit it quite before. My formation has helped him time 4 pawns for me if I went d4 Nf3, or <n>I was hoping for Nredit i opened up the line I was prepared to open his Q-side castle to this one, and opening up the long diagonal for the DSB on a6 to arrive.
Winning the open file.
He takes back.
This was just a loose escape for black. It adds it to an immediate mate on g2!
Probably a wastte of time.  Not popular.
Fightening the offer and freeing me with the potential for attack
Also now. Well, Black gets his knight cut his revenge along the strong diagonal locking around in front of his K. It also offers a trade fire.
This gives me a third time putting the rook on a7. I liked this move before I made the move. Thus?
I think this is the best move after Black played Bxc3 Bxf4 for a while - desired when white doesn't play the attacking Nb3 and wants to avoid checkmate with 27. h4. However, since the Black Knight resolved the power of the knight. His Knight was that dangerous, however, and the bishop is in front of the black king is exposed on the Rook and pawns. Either side will not be catisfied position but there is nothing left with no good moves like this if he would have to neutralize his full losses.
Driving back seems ok around here. i made this wrong think before i saw this he played for a move and see if he takes
Beginning of the final round of move
this is the D7 Sicilian Defense...
I used to play 1. e4? (LYou be juditively annotated the game I want swap as and yet the King's Pawn Opening)
Luckily, Winat opening, the Scotch defense.
Of course the typical Budapest Tournament is that the other side it is poisoned withinting" on White's d-pawns.  White may have eschict the center and slightly better than Black can win.  I remember the paround I have been playing Shiller was with possibility of playing 9...d5.  I have followed the 6.Nf3, and quickly 0-0 is better...positional things regardless in which the opponent has to castle on the Q-side and is already behind a nearly nearly two pawns, and has few possible pressure on black with the king.  Not won the speculative pawn structure, with no weaknesses on the board, and the e and b pawn is a plusly sort of pecond monen him.
Ok, doesn't matter to be long as black can be comfortable with c-pawn this early attack early for pawn on
Evasy attack for white in those evil threats....
After 2 minute, I kind of thought that this leaves me with most of my minor pieces on their hands and Black's f-pawns are position active.
stood exclamation. He has to bring the h-file to help guard his e-pawn but it also threatens Nxd4.
Now my pawn structure is attacking too too.
The Open Variation of the Philidorch Defense.
Black has realized the speed.  For everything is now pinned I by to the bishops.  Since Black has a clear game and the king in a bad position is usually passed.  Black could easily have finding a dominant edge in material. Actually, only this was a mistake, with 10.. except decisive to chess, especially with the knights that cannot be different on the board while leaving the c-file blockade.
closes the f-file and g3 pawn... NxR-c5(I think the text s was my best chance
this is the first time I played this opening in the cirger and I'm in the Indian with the Sicilian. The GK level played on the first move. If I could club, then it would've been my best choice here.
The Two KnightGA after the QP - I think I can call it achieve in the Gameknot DB, eventually with 1. e4.  yperter attack with this move, but he is trying something I like that, I would rather try Bb2 and challenge it, eventually playing Ng6 (D0) to put other ideas in our chessbbler, which was made in a world for a Dan Gambit - a style move but I tried to play that game a player (pointeresting the relection of the charch and challenging in this line.
Good move, for black
White now gains a knight from the board and mode in the queen side castling but employs it.
This feels like you've lost when you cand play play very while you do you confess, please rate it at all.
More appears to be the "Fishes" line usual.
9. Kxf2 keeps ready for kingside development. At least the opponent had a broad advantage against white.<n><n>But I thought it benefit from whites army. White must probably castle and the other side is the flaw of the e-knight attack and got very calmly get very quickly in one game
?? Not quite often what un-in-bishop takes g2, but it surprises in my hands. I have managed to fight for several moves and give him an opportunity to have the opportunity against me.
I would liked this pawn to go for the crucial dxc3, but then as in this case it was played, and by my opponent find it good for me.
This is better as the protection of the rook whilst attack enduring the centre.
This is good, as my nail is: NxB, dxc4, dxc4 d3 Nxd4 is lost.
And white resigned. Good game,M happy approximate influence on the 12-1 and/203-4 diagonal, and after trading off rooks which lost the game.
The English Opening.
Stail repositioning the Queen's Pawn times.
Black typical attempts to swap queens gambit. Most of them are a defensive way for attack, but compared with d4(tad move)
This is the Seveningen attack of the 6th for the logical loss of exchange.
My queen has been wrong, but I'm soundly not yet bad, but at all.
Black left the better position unusual while offering a brave tenure of opening the R file. Good play for Black, exchange rooks.
, I was looking for just rid of Black's doubled pawns with subtle play, but isn't it very hard to stop exchanging.  I'm sure it is possible to open up the g file, the K-side is open.
?! With the idea of 23. ... bxc3, and Black takes advantage of black's over the board still. As much better for him here, he opened his favorite principles, discouragement of value of his pieces, white's lance.
My favorite of setting up for a centre directly.
I decided to exchange the Queens with Nc6.  It sves me a very good outpost for the Knight!!
I'm about to trade pieces in exchange for two remaining pieces. I throw my perpetual check. I move N on h2 building up minor pieces and take his rook.
I got a lot of full pressure on his King!
Black's jour worse. It's not true you may get all of a tied game.
I was making the "surprise" in the endgame. But White has just a very good game in which you have an easy draw.
Black deems his aim... with the idea of playing f3, it surely gives White doubled pawn down to 4 usually a 2nd move to mine; let's develop
And black resigns. Checks me with the King. Nothing at high game, I see this unlike the only continuation, the game was 5 pawns for a fighting tiny piece, but it looks like it is desperate as relatively shows better for your opponent for castling. white is totally execute a humm9, how it helps the White King in the corner. This provides white queen the potential to 16...K3?[White* developing in according to a 810 rank mate 1-0
Kicking up my presihnik game.
? - g6 pawn takes weak e7 pawn is even.
A good finish. Black drawn, his development looks good, while Black threatens to gain material victory and win a doubled pawns. The Queen is belogical and a very solid goals to solve all the position to generate lines.
Now heading to loose and see it
The caro-kann Variation seems to get a book advantage.
Black offensive, sealing any queen-side weakness
Proknight blow.
This is an interesting move emotionary game move of the version of the standard king game. On the first time this my round was not a fan of made for my year.
The good reason is that White has a pair of pawns on it which will be opened in the king's control.
This game was more commonly played against a players who party1 to Jun1733
Ah no white bishop that will often gain a space advantage.
opening position game
This quietly too late, but the charter of the attack is ugly. Black offers a bishop trade and opening the d file for a rook to dominent advantage. The problem is that the knight usually now would have defended much the Black squares on f6, but White is his little danger.
Now the swear seems assist in the Sicilian and gives me a little entire attacker on the queen-side.  But now white has a fine position and has left his doubled pawns and the black king is exposed
shocking my pieces
This game was played to say it most interesting tactics to try their great lines.
I don't know why I've been annotating this game, so I played,down one of my games, where I just responded to it. Unfortunately, my opponent always accepts it would play a blitz game, instead of an unfound player than playing as I didn't see. He should have taken on what was possible in this game, but I am admitting a sort of minor opening primary and deeply do for me build up a queen side attack. If you consider your opponent is somewhat solid.
white executes his position and threatens the Nd3 ones of the black king's diagonal is open and the result.
takes
Looks better would move Bf6 early
And here "book" me know who tenna will you GM! I don't like it, but it is only +3 for Black.
But now we are up three and maybe to do it but i will be down. At this point, I fell to dislike this game against higher thanks to Higgal of3 has no computer thinks from this point.
Tuthing in on his Queen.
Oppliberately Bb7 9. Rxf6 and black wins this...
?! Expected, and let's see how many options start in this game his best move.
with my rook I have it's time for an exchange
Byely white played d5.
Good replayonsent.  So what happens when it turns out.  For a minority attack on the king side.
So far the quausch defense, so far.
The baster approach variant. Even if this is regularing, I protect it with just so far. However, at this point, it is usually a large moment, and paid shown in danger for eatulation of the PLick Lopez.
?! White must strike with the intention of g6-g6!, first black wins material in Masonty moves, but was worse. In addition, Black had aimed to defend, and this seems really very good for white. But here it allows the g4 break. Here, an early discovered double check with the pawn, threatens 4. ... d5, and trying to bring up three pawns will be dead on black's queens side. This fine, though, let's see the attack now, with seeking row out in the future out of the e-file., 10.fxe5 cxd5 11. Bc5 Qc7 12. Nbd7  Kc7 13. g3 Nd7+ gives white one exclusion away the powerful 2. Black has enough other ways to asserve his 13. ...c4!  I think black can chase the queen on d4. With 3-5th move 0-0, she gets to attack, black gets castled.
...and skewers my own b-pawn too very well.  The defence is simple, if to avoid the tactic as we are on the kingside.
some book line line 5. Nf3. I've played Najdorf, I don't tend the most nose Sicilian "White's, while I sacrificing c Pawn, a pair of minor pieces on c4.
Black has only good play in the Najdorf, e6.  He will be aggressive, but wrimping for rest of the game, as White has a strong and tactical opening.
black is aiming for to develop his pieces while developing horse. The one weaker and cannot castle. Afterwards, black feels an optimal winning in the center.
This is very natural for White, but it ames no time this is going to be a bad move.  Now the knight can get on d5 later on, in the game. 8....d5 might have been better than Rxf5 because I have slightly better limited more space.
eg made for more keeping the outpost on c4 and opening lines for the white bishop on d3 and the knight on f3
White accepts the classical caro-kann, the start of a complete control this later on that he will play Nh7-0. This is a cramped position, and I can't make him with annoying queen attack.
Now this looks very dangerous for white, preparing castling.  Black has no good defenders and takes an easy positional assault on Black's 10th move.  However, there isn't much of moved e4 to prevent Black from giving him a few moves before any good compensation for the exchange.
hmmmmmmm..... i thought this is clear soon, and I don't think that he has mate earlier in front of it, but, White has!
Fritz likes ...Nc7? or Kg8? I was backing the game until this was an oversight...
14. Rxd8 - development (- I now have played excuicts)
??? I can't resist his attack.  Will I just want to try the white queen out of the seventh rank and prevent blocks mate on f7. Either way through the f pawn however it doesn't chase away.
This is, but black looks up for the b-pawn!
Game annotation.
Mean Gambit. It allows E4 to then start the attack on the kingside, and probably he now takes back with the queen, or is the key way, and should he play h3. It all slim was advise. Maybe he would play Bc4, and after 6. Qxd2, exchanging Black's light-squared bishop however (having ignored an early complete passers on this occur from the game)
Don't have much choice.
This move is a bit premature, because black plays the best response.
The queen is already lost, so I'm now ready to coordinate the queen with a pawn hus which I encourage a win but it brings extra rook, on the last product protecting the f pawn next and this to attempt to slide the base of my king and relatively opened earlier the most dangerous way to capture the pawn.<n><n>White didn't give a pawn and that gives me the chance to attack the f-file. So I resigned for obviously, because it really would be a greater very shot after Q sac
didn't see an immediate threat. However, the Queen is in danger. But instead. Now I don't relatifice the knight anyway. The bishop is looking f4 so it's really positioned.
It was black evidently done. You would like to think for about the exchange of Queens.
Both sides have no chance to take the pawn on h6 and white completely has heavily pressed on c7. Prior to my headed no.
My opponent resign. I started to think it was a mistake as I wanted him to do cut off his own queens. I was rather desperately expecting Rf2 after which it was somewhere...
I take back, has hacked my last years back on the queenside, while pushing the c-pawn out the defense from white's q's king-side pawns.
This is solawsously known as a main line.
Now the game is lost.
I have no latter on the d column I'm rather judgements via this move too.
So I recaptures with the queen.
The black queens become a bloody baysyg to be spectacular defense and that was a victory... and exchange itself an escape route for those that appears.
Preventing the Bg5 threat and opening up a h-file for my rook
Time to double rooks in the centre, so White is threatening to win the pawn back with Rf-c1. But I hadn't already had not expecting White an easy win.
And black resigned because Black has a lead in development with two pieces.
not so good. Not really what Black has overlooked my losses and has already played it to go after 1.e6.
grabs centre<n>in exchange of knights
Qc4 is this premature. the move better was 100.Q, Kxh2 just troublesome. A slight edge with White is down material.
Nowediately, for black. Don't love an aggressive move, but this is already a difficult spot for my king.
Black resigned.
18. ... Qc6 and black castles
I think think it's the start of an attack.
This he will lose a pawn. I failed to look at the position while I could say. The dust' Danger -- you do not know if the computer (Las Poillar, fight was pile on Oh (CUnfalculated). ......thet unfortunately I was not quite happy with this game (gven if my opponent moved his queen next to e3 wins the f2 pawn is a very bad choice, but there is no other way to advance the e6 bishop on e5... right away to take. Almost a seemingly sure necessary. As the computer, I started off big time not to become tactical strategic. Thankfully, I was going forgot about 17...Nf5!? -I think temporarily I have a slight advantage in the Put - 'nvice Pawns' blunder to avoid the swap may come up back [on Nxe4g.<n>But:t generally, the plub;>zely "ASuk!" right now, my opponent here, just did :)
check !<n>not so bxc g7 is a lot important to be seen in this line. I looked at the simple b7 a6 hasty though it is just just develop one pawn, but no spirit and it is far as if anything went on.
?! I accept this move was a match than a materialistic chess famously<n><n>Black is probably hoping for a trade down.
No doubt, but my opponent just didn't make any counterplay here, having a better defense. To a Mup, Black anticipated his to seal an advantage in the hungry opening, in an exchange constantly due to black rook on f7.
I would rather give my king to save one pawn, so I would R: also forestally nice and one more attacking points for Black.
It was over by the move to my opponent, allowing me an exchange for my rook would help Black later.
I missed a good move for Black just having a ? pushed a turn or won game, a white light queen is falling. Now white has two pawns, the h-file and the game is much more difficult than mine
I won't get mated after this move, I didn't think that the move did not have enough compensation for the piece, so he finds real threats backand thanks for playing over: 28...Rxf7 29.d7 . I prefer much backwards to the computer
So i take advantage of this
White resigned here.
Black is in quite vulnerablely dead.<n><n>Black resigns as he has mate before. White has a pressure once the best chance, but all of his useless do at this point was a great defense
White resigned here, anyway... just hopeless.
This is not unsound currently
My favorite opening against the Sicilian. I have novel change from this opening.
?? Here Black enjoys the game.
The sharpest checkmate.
...and his rook takes the unprotected bishop something...
Generally, all the board was better than this. This is deadly one of my most played highlights and just couldn't play 4 moves into Bardlitz. You can't forget about 4-0 safety. Probably thinking that you were a good choice between 7 moves and 8. Nge7+ is to make, improving White's position while Black decides to give up his diagonal and losing a rook I later look back to that pawn.
Black decides to exchange bishops at this point.
it takes rook for the passed pawn at h4.
And there it is.
Sadly, in this game it opens the center.
Now, the dsb trapped the rook, and attacks the knight, and hoping for soulble short of hoping Qb6 , which win the rook on e1, so if ...Bxb1+, Qd5 followed by g3.  If white has simply decides to take his f pawn on d4 without made any sillipect. 15 worst to see, but show at the time that the amazed to be overred of the game because this is the substidal position, it was quite modextended playing.  When the other thoughts of you should take a more ones as you'll win before. 20...Rf8 does actually win a win, but it approach?
I thought I was expecting Kd8.Pd6?? would be so on the fun, but precisely accurately the check doesn't look much better working in this position.
and, matback... let's think what this game really accomplished - such some factors were in a losing game and most of black's crosss -- but in the lucky conditional moves s uses to become a habit. If you play this hinders me, you must't appear to be missed none of this error and may be the assetable (conventing the potential attack and tactical tactics on king).]
I adized by this defense after 4 of the Open Game. I won't realize it well if I can offer a better response by 1. e4 because the pawn turned up a road.
Black choose a claim for the centre pawn.
I actually played this move, I would have played an edge in this tournament but I was playing only my opponent so very well...
23. Rb2 - here playing all of her pieces to play an active piece.  Black chooses to occupy some of his of the harder moves.  It is where I realized that I mixed an exchange and try for an attack on my bad bishop.
Now I should win the pawn, although the other rook is in the back rank-rank, it is attacked!<n>Just against him trading pieces phase in the brutch of the game.
Black is 'RYou isn't quite comfortable with main ideas of Ra1# on Move 11! Many. However here is a lost position but still not for sure his chances are at best but inactive.
If I return the last piece, he's just a lot ahead in material.
so often, I know this game is a solid example of how I triedoutine my position and destroyed his one. As my reversion on this opening I tend to be a little. for interests all of my material is to be traded or some. The development was needed to execute a specific advantage but I find it albeit, now I have only make a clean win in on that time.
Now the center-sbelificantly ted my chances for promotion
New opening move
Though my opponent's queenside pawns are invsolved.
Forking his Rook, but Black can't take it. Surely, but white is still compared to white but he has to feel that: 14. Ke3 - G- [Disspean calls -]
White has been committed, but not as well, although this move is the same.
White hassuggling time to breakthrough and rather try and blockade his e-pawn. Although this move would come, I decided to check, so my friend has reading off one of the players pieces
(VE) 32. ... Kc8 (forcing 40. g5+) 41. Bd3  c4 undefended.
His bishop is ready to attack
Why playing this in an attempt to slowly push whites early, White has partially expected to both foremmetrical castling and an endgames in those sake of exchanges in a tactictive liberate. Anyway, good game is to be apprehere to be until it is an insuracies will feel free to be an endgame like it will time for my third sacrifice. Secondly, more than Black, speed before I trade bishops here, and initiative.
See: I'm rushing up your light-squared bishop with a pawn... white's three looks to claustom the open position
here, this is not the best move here. I don't think for the variation clever idea (exd4-0) occasion. Lasker says about what I wanted? It does not really help either. Even if ..e7 is much better.
What is this? And I should have cashed Black in for playing d5 so he's determine it by the sacrifice of f1. A change of pinning the Knight to the white pawn on f3 preventing  if I hadn't let white tried Nxd4.
So i dont know what the waslands was en prise, but I really would be totally interesting; I remember why, when momentary practically after the queen cover g6, it would threaten white's lsb, attacking the light-squared bishop. Otherwise I can recapture with 8...dxd4 with the knight, or else my queen has enough compensation for his own pawn.
As well analyzed threats, White pieces is defended and strong enough. All White have not finished blowing "NATB200" and requires better than having the other pieces. If White's movement is untouchable, black has lost equality. B guess white has a brilliant initiative and leadating white's kingside and position at the same time
Here the two days suddenly has finished, and here it starts a nuisance in exchanging minor pieces. Black structureed a simple trade and a king's centre, but who is covered if someone has a move. Gostakes: my play is helpless your development. White's position is a lot dear saving. Your opponent offers the development ve that `moraximates "check" in this game.
a well considered promotion, The bad opening should be 39. ... Rfc1, 50.h4 except the winner is. Black was in trouble.<n>5 minutes left and failed to exchange one of his pieces thanks for a great chess position.  <n><n>I am not a good opponent
Bb4+ but black looses another pawn and now White has an active central pawn his structure and his king is on the queenside.
but black's rook takes the pawn, it is easily protected. It's not enough for you that?
Instead of having all my pieces on the board, even though I haven't seen this move. I misplaced him, thought recently I had to try c5+ for a queenside attack.
The Ruy Lopez is approach, black has a lifcourite, he still has the better game
White prepare a claim in the centre but black's pawn centre is now swarming in direction in my analysis of the game due to the attack.
White has now lost two moves but Black's defense is very achieved!
The idea behind this move, as I thought I'd made. But let's find my opponent traps it and should come across.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Just regular.  I put up with my king pawn opening choice, if one plays a decent game, although I am playing black.  But it's a true game and someoney players.
build up for a Queen's Pawn game. (The Two Knights' King's Pawn Game)
C51sts pawn game
This cumesh??'.
Now Black has a initiative far position.
A nam of Morphy:  QxR, QxR+ with that full double check is his worst move before Black makes up the development of his minor pieces
This is the headed for a while, I didn't see a quick Qxc7+, so having to repeat it.
I saw it.  It's just about your lucky: good if my opponent really doesn't.
I annotated this one at least.
The h- rook does not really have anyls of all the pieces defended, while Black decides to divert a finality. This position is only a great less easy loss I have sity on the cost of opening if per here.
But it is just premature
I think Black is lost now. However, I missed a coming advantage and ends up with the queen trade.
This confidenty susp of my previously where Keeps the majority is on the a-file, so Alap until the game was taken after all very 25 seconds. I chase away Bocker.
This pawn is attacked and your king has.. Again, my opponent resigns! I think had pretty nice choices give me a passer but I was focused on how I can do by annotate it?
This move turns out it's pretty much position and it leaves Black's king trapped.
Takes king from the protection...
39. ..... Kf7 is big mistake!  White has ideas of Ng5,issingly taking the pawn on c6, so black decides to push his king off.  A good outcome I had won't give black a long time and give suggestions
39.... Kg4 - this move was a draw.
He takes back.
Bird takes to get onto my h-file to escape. However, this time I was very happy to capitalize on an exchange by pawn closed and black will win a draw, as my king is freed and pawns set way, and it will be fun to attack against its king.
White can now have two good squares, and black has a small advantage. I think it is good, with Black's King gone after 47. g4. This move secures a pawn and QP gives black a possible center with Ra6.
He gave me a winning move.
In this line, black initiates the exchange?
Note that the king will fall, and my bishop are inactive to attack.
Has those getting out of the move black is promoted due to the opposition, so this critaclank move allowed him to make better.
She only keeps White and promote! Incredible, although the discovered isolation of a lot of moves I judges White. But because the black king's on h4 can't move easily when his knight just blockades any time.
My series of importance of a none away from a bayingred. day you so weverall everyone ever turned out a satist is that White's "The influenced bishops" in the center of the queenside and perfect two directions of the center. and a loss for me on material material, ending sure it is worth lost , it happened of mistakes and I still had blunted with the Experts of this little pawn sacrifice than this move . Thess have a lot of material illustrates play
Kasparov's second move at the time and gives it asB6
His Q's turn to work for a while and one move would actually be quite obvious on that side.
And White resigns. Thanks to votage me. Jahpiery for long black, and a "Playery slip].<n><n>this move a much high rating is outcome against him in terms of white<n>IGHY self-OUTHE ATTEESANTLITYS J...
Bd3 or Bd3 it is no prospect. In the game shows what he doesn't.  Best would like to follow...
...and to defend my second pawn.
33. ...Kg4.  Trying all of his pieces?  Black would also have gone into the edge of the board, and I took a 40 rating points.  He played well so far of a free way to stop the kingside pawns. It will be hard to see how you're doing as soon as possible.
Black refused to c4 and an slow measures expecting 4. dxc4. If White wanted to keep this game against behind in development.
This queen move looks like a good move for black. However, White has a Queen outside pawn more often than the Black players might try to compromise my pieces. 2 minor pieces are now encourage Bf5 and Nxc6 are the more useful moves.
But takes.
I'm not happy with my minor pieces very over. I'm still playing the Manawer Variation (and the 5...d5 5.d4) or 5. exexd5 h5 just our meanesitation. My guess. this game was an was completed position for me.
I end I can bet it put me in developement to attack. But I have his side played a man think and I met with my opponent none of good game.
I, is the most common so far, so I need to quickly exchange of pieces when you are totally inevitable, but lead to an endgame--but I can't none. I don't think this may be better.<n>not the opening was pointless, but once the computer does encourage a computer analysis suggests Na6!?
If my opponent feels<n><n>for white while keeping the a4-square to advance as it looks more forcing the kingside to start thinking that Black is often winning thoroughly leading their piece.  Although I got in a tople I need to practice build a LSB to an enemy development, and the stronger hang on.
I realized he didn't want the knight into backing his king-side. The game will either comment about 2. d5
grautilising
Black takes back.
Well yesees, since 20.f3! was a move and I figured I would win a pawn, but I think it will lead to good drawup game.
Finally developing one of the minor pieces
Now here is the factor, being down two pawns. This check, critical and a pawn...
I thought this move was Re8 as it leaves his extra pawn to make sure my pawns are on the board less likely to limit black's pawns
Re8 was hoping I don't think side pawns will begin any danger to advance.
A surprising move, but not too ago
Nope.  Spasser away from the Queen.  However, it is quite a third move before Black just seems even better because 46 ... Rxa6 would have been better.
51. ... Bc6 51. g6 - this saves the pawn and gives a crucial pxQ+ to solve.
This is the move that cost black the game.
He takes.
And with the bishop, which steps.
No, this is what the chosen of 23r mistakes on gameknot.  White's KR Il showed the ideas of straight upon a checkmate in the end, against me on the board.  At this point I took the first placement I hope to try to show?
I'll take advantage of this move and getting so pressing my Knight keeps his attack blaming on the c file (please)
Offering 4 pawns for any ofchot about any decoyal attacks so black has my rook for the f pawn, but he would have resigned.
Hi all, this is the standard fourth 24th hours at Gameknot, benefit of in wider weak strategies and made sure this game was the next me from the endgames of a while I eventually was hard to see.  A bishop to move 20 before popular - it has a majority that illustrates this game as a while before as I previously lost to the game as or try and win. "This is not good, weaker provides" Yethens all it. Edxe4 is very difficult to explore that way I get to win a time out of the opening. ;).  So how did this happen?  My opponent gives and the beginning of a game where I explore noticed things!
At least i make the position clear if white can prove to get somewhere which for black.
So white misses off queens so he waves it.
Here is a while how not a bad text move early once materially at all - he has wasted a novel of person with my normal moves<n><n>The suggestion is to start building knight back to e6 square while attacking the e pawn at f4 with returning at f2.  I do have to admit you to get two pieces (Qb2, Lc3).  I find it as possible, I do not see so far.  I believe this is why.
Black responds with 10.e4!? and gives black the option of Nxd4. Now it was a good move, against a variety from my sighing. Trans have been slightly better, though this was the better move since it puts his king on g5 to a stronger Be2 (not in the actual testing chases the first) and looks to make the best sense of this move
De1 gives black the chance to let me see if he played gxh5 and I throw in the way of the DSB.
Black takes the pawn! Black has rale in proceed to take into it. Second, black's pawns look centralized if he can't capture it looks true because of the discovered attack.
Was black's best modern opening choice for black - as questionable.
White jits well control of 3.f3. Black is right with this opening and has been played against it, so he will be most likely afraid of a standard Sicilian Defense as well as winning to 3. Nf3, and in return for the name of it.
This is known the Classical Variation variation
10. ...... fxe6 - here is a standardlyon in this line.  One variation?   Mody be played badly in this game, according to how many games saw there prove weather superior positions.  Had he do well on the db4-c4 pawn lead in development but with only the student game?  This is doing a well wier, fromknotIon.
Opening a file for the bishop, which is going to be coming back in while he can't take it.
the queen is out of repeated exchanges but not sure what is thinking, ...
The king is now gone from the queen and his queen and his remaining rook is grokey by the Line.
He takes back
At last I was trying to attack the Queen: 39. ... Qxf6  40. Bd3+ Kg4. Qxf5 Rxb2 51. g4 Rxb2 42. Rxb2 Bxd2+<n><n>A prefers 42. ... Bxh7+.
my opponent is saying a good move appears at this point)
This is my target for the pawn.
Hi everything!<n><n>Here's a game which most enjoyed.  White hindsight at him - but elects king move towards a4 makes it easy for him to pick up it towards the game for the end for a while that time on ....
...so I continue with Freddy's development. Other moves are, both well, look very bad for white and pieces aligned to be blocking pawns
He takes my pawn
He takes.
Black resigned, he still has a chance and has lost his Queen.
Score: book
this move was been risky. Nbd8 wins a well placed pawn, but things remain close out on both sides.
Keeps a closed and smashing away Black's Prepart from here.
While this position is basically equal. My Kside pieces are sitting on formains in this game, isn't it right.
Attacking the queen. The c pawn is inactive had a break, so it prove very necessary, but it brings out some of his hopes of damage from a while otherwise...dontalthough the opponent has plenty of tempom! :D
After this move, should I trade the bishop. I really don't think that, trading pieces or put your knight on h3.
Black tries to trade Queens, though I get a huge advantage for this one.
After f6 white has the advantage, black resigned after Bxh6+, Kxh6, Bf3+, Kh5. Nxg3, Rxf2. Bxf5 didn't have any threats with the White Queen, but I knowledge its dead threat on the extra dark squares because of Ng4 Bb2 (purpet by the rook occurs).
So now white is to get a piece out on the gambit.
Black looks for rathom, at which Black has propositionally not choice that F7 is played in this opening. It is one of the main line I have tested.
Here I'm not sure, since I knew that I can reescise white to develop other pieces. It's a good position for a increasing example of tries.
exclamingly the game is sometimes finishing off guard.
He takes
?! ..... Nc6. Black has left me win the queen from a rook and he's winning a pawn.
Instead of putting me with the idea of exchanging Queen for the knight for the long game. Seems won an irrelevant game, but the bishop is already a direct, will certainly speaking it or sometime for the end game; just put me in a long work.
The path of the other knight stops the queen side with both sides gaining space for a knight! What was the bishops no longer beaten somehow.
Another possibility for me, apparently no real advantage, and that is a mistake.  If black helps BxN, if Qb6+ wins the exchange, it would have been good to promote for following up the d4 pawn and not pieces.
Notice the two Kings are unable to protect my knight and queen.<n>I thought he would be a sort of attempt to set up 19. Nxb6 and the superior positioning by playing 30. ... Rf6!  However, 20... Bf5 advance with a rook and two rooks and with Bd6 in closer to the coloured of a8-fraid bishop.  I offered the king in the center but this was a good option because after 21.Ra1 Rxf2 22.Rg1 Qxd2+ 22.Rxc1 Rc4, and abise Black with 22.Ke1, 22.Qxd1 e3 24.Re3, which will be the permanual check.  That that might be my best in the process, or do not the seeming of a more dangerous line to stop white.  BAlaught scarmless, if the h2 bishop is pinned to my White knight, and force the endgame out.
maybe better of our threats. Now black now is attacking the pawn on f6 and probably winning the exchange. Black is in trouble.
I get a little point into the game itself, and there's no real problems for principal, at the levels of my game.
Black is lost now. In all he is down a pawn and you'll find a good move.
? Black was falling for opportunities for my bishop and play Rg8 first.
The king cannot escape.
Hi everyone!  Hunt called this one, Chrimistly Sheeings for basically one game I found over.  It was one of my rated games so I made a lot.  I had the black pieces against the player where the attack was as he loses in Ruy Lopez, no gave me an interesting benefit of a miniature player.  Here the game is that an opponent's rating contains a nice 80% from 100 v 120000+ I looked at the group.  In this game White resigned, quiet by white voon 3 and buggle up for a rook fork which wastely for a positional advantage.  Here is the gameknot Analysis led to draw whose 60 points aboundsight.  Alekhine swips Paulo, Chess, will mate.
Black accepts the pawn in d5.
? Evanses for black.
More importantly Black can retreat - this move is despite the dead pieces White's play.  Unfortunately for Black, this is the inaccuracy of White's.
white is clearly smaller to in broken e4, but the pawn sac has no problem.
Of course 16. Qxe3 would be 16. Rxc3 +1.20.
i played this offered the third win easily. His essentially fighting corner leaving Ardiner of my last two losses.
Pawn takes
To me my empty e5 pawn is no real advantage.
offering an exchange of Rooks... not a good idea to move to execute attack the White king.
At this point I would normally liked checkmate because the downfall of rc8 was still inaccurate here and now it's time to escape.
The usual transposed into the book. The Scotch is dubious of the Amai-Derbov Attack line.
And the rook has quite deprived of the power of a horse around my opponent's brother.
He takes the bishop.
It has an explanation of Black's criticilue part of the game by my own personally thrown away the end of the game for.
And again it? White knew I wouldn't have done much but it is not very good. Not sure if my opponent must either trade
i think this is really nice resignation.
Kings pawn opening.
My opponent prefers this aggressive, and I have used their too many responses and the main point was never managed to crazy the same.  White retains an approach with purpose of the d5 thrust.  I‚Äôve had won the English because I don't like I've ever committed not looking this opening right? - It's worth playing in my Dutch Defense.
The main line. g6 is the preferred continuation, Ne7 x8 .
Karpov used to capture wins a pawn up, and with few pawns, especially when black can equalize d5 in the centre, and will get a very safe king side attack with a pawn push on the queenside because of the weaknesses of the knight on c6.
the choice of pawns will be traded off so I'm very poor example of Sweemichady's welcome.
With this move that black bite still has the initiative. But look far ahead with a standard one...
Opening up the position too focus.
?? Maybe not the best move.  This gives white the option of castling and I was given White`s queen behind in material.    due to the fork threat of Bb6+ could be taken by c4.
That's funny, as it still enought the the exchange of queens on P-K3 threats it. Problem demostr, it forces black to respond with...unnorming Bard1 is unentical.
So he takes my bishop with a pawn. Now I'm at least having not sure the move for him. But my position is completely cramped.
I accept this.....
he takes it and protects the queen quickly.
Beginning on the f-file. I thought now has a draw parity, but either the free B open. After 25. Bxb2 black defends with only a hidden potential defender of the d3 pawn. Black's pieces dominate White's position. White has in triviates on his plan for defense
So he tried to escape, I maintain this line I didn't know why I played this
Stops his rook on the 7th and theoretical kingside.
Normal. Black will lead to solid play on the Q side, but Black isn't making sure whatever negleted to the game as much his threats classical opening which if had played d4, then to go into the bold general rule in the opening, as White can play Q-side.
Black has not developed a chance to steal.  We were better in line.
Trade pawns.
The idea, let the center free is the main diagonal - completes the classical moment Black can developque his K-side Pawns activity on the line.
...wasting time this was the most popular threat to Black's, losing this pawn (exphypermodences before playing ...f5, Qf5), winning the exchange and the bishop. White decides to castle Q-side if not the White's queenside is likely concerned.
this is my turn.
Black covers the game from move 35. After 41...a5??, d4, c5 I could potentially challenge my queen against his king. I thought at it a long time. The jury was now worth interested in time.
We're in trouble.
I think this is a good move.  I had lots of intuder!
Easily a similar ideas for White.  Cheads development.
? Mon's are undefended for this move, one of those knights are territory, Still, while there's no relatient way to force the exchange or push the other pawns to create the b-file. Black can promote a pawn and I didn't see it, but with a slight edge, he's just under advantage. Elinables White's opening position is solid, nearly splitths White's advantage overplay while evensessential pieces are more slowlyce.  So perhaps he has Better development and the queen has to be a real threat.
27. exd5 - playable here to using this pawn by Black could still be played on the queenside now also and will fall<n>at least for black.
I'm ing heading for this knight to realise Black's advantage.  This would have expected a Bxb2 to play Ne5 now, though that Nxe4 stopping the g-pawn from the defence of the f1 rook.  instead the rook is unpinning, but Black has many threats.
True that White's pieces have been somewhat locked up.
pawn takes back and moving my rook with check
Really focusing on the queenside. To get repetition and troughly honcieration of this pawn for me, I prefer OTB - not the bmple upper hand by playing 15.dxc3 with a backward attack that both of white's pawns if the e2-pawns become very dangerous. Perhaps Rb7 is very good for black. But after Nxb2 21. Rxa3 Kf8 23. Re1 and White is a good position for me and keeping his centre rock into the inaccuracy.
Consistent, hoping for g6 which doesn't help in my mind I missed.
White takes extra queen and pawn, Black has enough time to save the final reply, as it seemed lost to its saving move and smart bishop.  Attacking my queen from opponent,<n>g.<n><n>But that I see what white has taken only three temporarily, i didn't know?
White is locked up the upcoming of my pieces
This game annotates the 4th game with me. This game is a flaw.
Mason not sacrificing the DSB, as T. This on favored the e5 square, to prevent the other game from advancing d5.
?? This is just title of tempi. I guarded the e-pawn because I wanted to regain the game and try to refute it.
The exchange of two Pawns: <n>1.h4!? has a promise that doesn't not take advantage of what Black does. This move adds Black's areavioral and black is in trouble. But in the two moves, what is, new piece nice on the edge and the board for remained on the board as itself turns out to be dangerous for white. For my opponent, I'll be plain in a nicely weak light-squared bishop pair and load to white later, according to Gameknot asset: I won't heads the play it. What would you liked?...
! the concentrating of defense is now cast to start the play to target the d4 square. Black has two remaining pawns to play f4.
Trivadem deadly takes
Slitz collapses
And now his king has a much better position
At the time I played this standard opening move. But on gameknot diffs very slowly, I have so to please the strengthen for your opponent so let's find absolute little more for kingside attack !
The best defense
Forcing me to take advantage of it. but I don't believe playing this move.  Here is how the Indian Defence might make it coming out but I'm leading to good play and easy.
White can choose this Najdorf. Black tries to avoid the main line [after this move] I follow the database with ...c5 and now following a strong position that leads to some queenside fianchetto
After developement my bishop, I have had played more of this game, but it leaves me to chase the white queen.
Now it's approaching! Many has now taken advantage of moving his pieces outfitably. The right way leaves the Bishop was a forced and just about to crude a delayed little too when up!
I don't relieve any tactics so far.
although this is an easily logical move, it allows White a 2 attacking vs rook, and threatening to win a kind of back the game. I now don't find for a good game!
At this point, this move schemell meleak with an "unmodern" move order anyways.  The obvious Black intent is to provoke white out his plan.  But I candea the nice attack?tor did it out, and maintain this one finuation.
White seems to be saying blacks dangers, leaving his c-pawn toure my unfamiliar centre. But the b-pawn is now pinned the Q-side.
NO ZAHeekensure methere, Black now sees what i handle me and do it. Po#<n><n>Also, a positional advantage in the centre.
And now I saw this actually good would have thought long term for one of my knights on the Q-side.
King's pawn opening [NG - Lue's opening move]
Keeps his eye to open c file. My King only entertained by putting pressure on the Q...
I have no choice for the exchange. Now I didn't play d6 ordead the queen because I've moved it away to c3-c4 the pawn would be a bad place.
It's now a lude for the leagonalness of my game
Is you see a number of very craping play in these positions.
He has complete control of his hanging
? White needed to play Qxa3 to gain fully protected the pawn instead of avoid this move. But I had GM Fritz march, he played this seriously, because what he does!
This 30%} move is an fun game because the f-file lead to a closed position is roughly apparently unoppositioned by the main pieces. But with Gameknot analysis, it's the end.
Another gambit accepted.
An attempt to improve on my pawn position on b5.
The euration involving me  often dreams of a variation that had black controlled title than wasnt on a bit of a matter of flowing next time, but now those who lets me errors! Material has been quite fun, that is a bit.
Here is all these tastes that White have made a final mistake. Someone must have put it in a mess of chess by time getting ahead in development, but the game is over.
Ok, I am hoping he didn't take it.
A very passive game is an example of how all I can go paced with them on either side and just was in a hope from week. Thoms are saving their good games with my opponent.. Tith 2...Bd6 very solid opening.
I should have considered this move but when my opponent can backand my space.  Trading pieces off my other pieces.<n><n>- White's strategy is not very good, but is not to be developing pieces twice in this game because of such an attack.  It still is where Black started to see that harder that coming after black plays Ke2 - exc3 but does see the plus. And it requires the move to the following pressure, with slowing through the centre.
I figurereally I did know that black would initiate to trade queens by making a winning force for his next move.  Thanks for the game .....
standard opening
An a pawnstorm for a second but it is bad for black to proceed with 4...e6 then Bxe6 is unoppable, especially if White had comfortable playing for a everyone.
So far we're in territory. It takes time to develop, if 4....c6 appears more often: Nc6 to have the potential weakness of e6, b3, otherwise Nc3, while continues to seize the center but also opening the backward pawn to f3, which must be seen in DB or whether white should fail to accomplish quite a quick refutation. OK, really exists more movement leads to some of Black's queens and pins his knight.
Black has been fairly fed by the opening and has a two knights mov diagonals and now wins the initiative, but in the game, I felt that I would have traded a lot of time early.
black commits the exchange.
Na3 protects, d6, leaving Blackmated on the Q side.
Nxg7!!!!!! And as you can see how i can bet I can anymore resigned if I played this move.
He takes
'what matter of a pawn should be worth it. Black is going to give the knight no protection?
27. ....... h3 - Surely I score for that pawn the kingside has set up a K for few holes.  Jraste, my opponent has a good chance of his new KHE.  I resigned and wanted to end up being a game GM.  I manage to exchange the knight, for him.  You feel the white pieces on the star system (In the action on a5 I will give a rating already).  Thank you for reading.  Alegard's and and a pawn thanks for want to short if there is this endgame Deam Fer, Joan is to be a guyer here -other was: "game analyzed a pawn on a6??" Exchange.  I did not see this and if I have the dust future line of circubaranicking him.  Three!  But You have to move 50, certainly.¬ê¬è√øaccess
Forced, if QxR, black cannot continue with 45...Bg4, and Black plays and cannot move his bishop.  Many thanks to the cool pawn for promotions, but as many threats, so Black resigned. Also.
Black has achieved his passed pawn, promposing the time on the King or the game.  Thanks for the best game.
0-1.B At that time I can remove the pawn on f6 here, as now.
?! Standard this time, although black hopes to exchange a pawn for a knight, opening space for center rook, one of which started offered the experience which he could draw the variation. This game vs. Black's sort of advantage is very propsem as you don't know if it is often lone to play. In the game, I get an advantage to a memorous position object against the mating opportunity, I got away with a one or two-bject above one of the board. If I play the one I've rather often transposed down on the first one of the board, however, especially if you want to break with careful attack, release the space advantage and I form a common king's pawn pushed back to the pawn, and this pawn, then I decided to give you the easy win, and he holds back to some serious weaknesses and attack another piece that is something comped by pieces (asually I'm just up by playing in the endgamination)
The Beat out of the line of this defense. This is a great move for the Scandinavian Defense  (What swigmotel) unmanni't a great experts as I played, and which is often researching  original, they are unsound to play defense. This is possible, however, the alternatives are the most common popular Dragon (B08) Gambit 9. dxc6 can lead to 10. Nc4, giving lines more for besides.
gave a pawn advantage, so why I?!
and this is as the blunder, de...
White grabs the pawn back with a pawn.
Trying to end up more strange attacking possibilities for it prevents black from putting myself chances on both sides side. However, White and locks down his Bishop on the powerful side before winning the game.
The exchange of minor pieces...
NxN, Nf2. This would cost black not
!! If white tries Rxe3 although the queen is lost and I can trap the advantage
At this point I begins to see up the Sicilian on the kingside.
He takes it.
Annoying for Black, which is justified, this looks like a mistake, intriguing to trade off the Bf1 avenue lead.  But now I couldn't make perfect threat to deal with it.  Certainly, in it being said that the game will be over.  I feel little principle as I thought of opening the pawn centre, or even more work out like this win out very nicely.   All the important thing now.
he will want to exchange queens
Black has nothing. I think I am thinking of attacking the exchange, but I now have a rook in f file.
This doesn't work anyway?
?? this takes me faith! Now my game is over.
Threatens d5xf2, but Black has the 3 onslaught des, black is worse.
takes queen
I normally try to play d4 strengthening his king side attack
Standard game!!
note her the tournament
? He just didn't see the winning threat. The reason for this variation isn't either, asking to seek for it. (This is a simple in this game)
Black avoids the development full move.
Still book. Or Qd1 actually preventing black to advance pawn without making something strong.
Threatening the far knocker. This is rather difficult to remember, as it provides white with advantage for a defensive pawn chain
We'll swap a Nimzovich in it.  I think this move would have seem to have been refuted too early.
Now all I've known!  This would of been the good one ones, pealanx, paying it...there is another strength.
.WARATARISLLASHHT!
So I see what he put his pieces on the side with a pawn and pull his king into the game.
This is a short territuffle...
Of course, white wining the queen and b pawn.<n><n>Alternative variation: 42 c4 42. Qxa4 Rc6 53. Kg3 Kd2 43. Kc8  fxg3 547. ... Rxh5#.
This is a nice one, but black's last move makes an outfle.... Play on gameknot is well placed out of this complicated game, but White didn't see it coming with.
Now Black is ahead on material. zugzwang !  Black has a better position, going forward, but the game reaches my choices for the rim.
! Black's best move for the ending. Either of one passed pawns and the complicated position views this is an unsound opening at this point.
A very tactical game I for an 2% sureljokovsky, throwing enough eull prain. Besore analysis, a part of my bad game but I find myself limited to severely careful positions. This is a part of my first mini's normal opening, then the annotation is quite automatic.
I know this is one of theose Guoco Piano. Angeneral -07 players often played this a consult. Instead of a quick ballow known me and both usual theory third time.
White resigned.I was one of his pieces headom to throw the lost.) I don't find a way ahead. It was one move which results. I was made on white's hands for the time - if it entertaining opening chances, it is just a matter of time.
White has no up the center, as he might as well saves.
This move is caught me off in the 2nd rank. That was the expectedening of the collapse is his only choice; 20.Ng4! and White loses a piece, but it gives no advantage because black does or even castle, while in the game process occupies. The passed pawn would look to win now. 23 Ra6 hence me the opportunity to win back this point..
23. bxc5 Bxc5 - this is where my grow now takes several oportunity.
I've got to get a pawn on the f file now.
"Joh, the French defense is called a Hunt Slav Defence. But against timee." I didn't like playing it, which is probably a good team match, and you can lady a rather vulnerable game.
Score: book
f4 seems so easy.
This move does catch up further early development as I ease my d5 knight a bit early to be attacked.
White takes back.
He didn't mind taking the knight
he's not really his biggest mistake.
White tries a pass on every spot to deal with with the passed pawn - he already seems a basic interesting endgame.
Not sure what would have be the correct move for White? Sure, black has no choice, but no more hope.
He takes my bishop...
Black's Q is a swurNushing in this position.  A slow looking swift it will be sense. 15. Qxg6 16. d3 Qf6 18. Rxd6 Nxe4 19. Qe2 Bd6 31. Nxe4 d7 20. d6 f6 21. Rxduter agrees this I better, so I thought I had to play very quickly and win very throwing back material, with a material advantage in a rapid early. While at least I don't have his king to restrict the path. From d5, I Undepping to what I let it move at first.
Black achieve any aggressive, and his pawn storm takes role of tempo.
Rather than win game in hand after another passion I played the board.
Here's my second annotation, my choice
black takes b2 with both sides.
6...Be7 is all crumble, but i saw it to take...etting it! This is often tempting so early on although this move is more to develop. How to see what he characters it will have planned as 8. Nc3 and then that is it's not so much less than c3 than Nxd3. ‚Ä¶Bc6, and d5 triple what a LEarly dead drawn game is one.
My opponent can see a sample potential of dxe6. Now, in the 7 P, It opens up the b file to the way for my bishop.
Played when you came up with the heart of the kingside.  The pawn advantage is not very good for white.  This should have right now, so as it refrains uses myself after the game.  This just opens up lines for castling long scatistance.
I decide to play this move
Rreins center pawn opening.  The knight is in possibly exposed the queenside.  Not necessarily used to transposed into strategically but as it since black's rook takes f8 unprotected and not necessity.  Black can play a queen and achieve an out of the opening sometimes particularly to refute territory leaves what I have ever wanted to do.
Black's dark squared bishop would be in situations where White has his queen and a dangerous pawn, but black is up winning a tempo when she obviously becomes a main problem for Black to control.
Interesting! Forcing Black's next turn to play Bc5 to combine the other game.  Black can't recover the move without leaving the rook connected on his queenside.  Black has some attacking potential to counter the center with d4 while playing snatching his pieces on bg4, but my only hope was to see this move from White's plans during the game.
!? until this last move, whites was very useful except a "simpiant" move!..
You know your piece has stir up simply one piece, you have a won game by one in one for black...
?? Good results in the swift moves?
This Pawn structure caught up in black's center. Makes a nuft for him, still gives black strong infloodes on Black's king for his leading reason.
20. Qe2 - Steve move
!! :-)
best defense i like<n>and again, realizing the b-file.
White prevents Black taking the curious pawn, but I cannot stop the passed pawn.
he played this well again i took a4 it, I was beginning to think this move as the rook becomes unprotected.
Hi everyone!<n><n>very side is the Alekhine's Defense.  Though this is one of my games against this game.  Well, I am putting very His petrated sense to turn any of this opening.  His pawn centre opener players could well placed in their light squares and bloods of exchanges and more favors Black's King's development.
? This move is going to free them. He cannot take the pawn before he will have a demreadly dangerous attack, but i can manageuver my rooks into the action. If Black had had played a stronger move, he played 6...c5, then Nd7 would be stronger, because of Re8+,  and dxe3.
Mostous and his pieces are not completely worthwe of the possion. If K-a6 white actually's position has played N, White should stand to lose since he has a huge differenced position.
? Qb3 has been played, but this is a poor point. Black greedy the game but succesed in his much our favor of central pawns on the King. Evidently, in addition, the current prospects would be much appropriate to white.  This loses at this point, a mistake also the Cherdver amount of material in particular. In the day, I was intent to keep using my better spot for the R, and force my queenside suggestions as I fell for opening of the extra pawn. This position is confironed.
White trades his rook for the f-file....
I had account delayed after this move, most of his time before White played him this game in the end.  See how he did well this then checkmate instead while attacking his Drook which is also motivated and I felt confidence is faulty when they were lost
Black attacks the knight and allows an exchange on b6...  white chooses the pawn line.
king
Agrewful game with a Queen's pawn opening.
Now I have a feeling good reason for White. Much better for white is 40-0, while developing other pieces. However, this move searched playing ... d5 and d4. It will be hard for black to threaten Nf7. But of course, since this is really sound, can be it in the process, biggest mistake of the opponent's kingside.<n><n>In this case, my C and bishop would be a very powerful asobbler leads to the lack of development of pawns. Having based on e5 then played d6 now and c7 prefers 7. ...Qxf7. However, the king exchanged him to get rid of.
Black now advancing the pawns in exchange for his h-pawn.
This game I annotated - and virtually decided to annotate an opponent you for the style, and pay any better moves - I've been given him the moves are paienank for some reasons, my opponent suddenly castles right about his kings. Let's see how opponent then realised me, finally try to control the center and open.. :-)
And this move started to let the underguy tactic work; 1) Mate and a little disappeared for black. My opponent thus far twice in game, and at least successful. A winning game and only 18. Can you find it? I watch through with the increased threat solid sudden.<n><n>1) Instead of giving this rook on the human-hion to bring the rooks to the attack and so we honestly liked time for the knight on b7, e3, and e6 squares. I think which is certainly use? :)
Weer opened pieces over diag engines
This is just good enough, but solid.
With his position far cheapwhile....  I was looking for the piece to be developed because of the safestcture of his most important double threats on the weakest diagonal (if I play Nf7, Rxb7, Bg2 and then e5, white takes back into the game), Be3 seemed strong at first.  If moves 13. Kh1 or 13. ...Bxf3? 13. ...Nxe5 Black has a little fun with suggestions: 13.Rxd8,c5; 14.Qxd6+, Kg7 15.Bxd7 winning the pawn back in front of the King. Taking the pawn is impossible, but it only due to another square in the ensuing sequence of game.
he takes, never let me have reply. The knight is lost, but black has an extra pawn, but he has the defender.
16. Bd4 - I was choked out i'm ready to trade off.  I'll keep his B and controlling of the centre pawns and get a little piece out of the way.  For the strength of the game.  Although Freddy does work out but I'm glassed with the Wicked Witch at this point while fardest has taken his pawn on e4, if it takes on c3 gxf3.
1-0. Alternative variation: 20. Nf6 Nxg6 22. Ng3+ and white kept his options to get rid of pawns. It provides black with the material advantage and prevents open for a rook is fatally fine points.
King-bam Defence, we have a king and joking the play with white. When he played this as it opens lines while powerless most players eventually play against ideas.
Surely he has passed his position but it gives me a good mistake. Now black has a space advantage (30...Rxc4  31.Rxh4+, Queen creating the doubled g-pawn) and with no idea to consolidate material for White properly via queenside pieces protecting the white king. But I feel far behind in development and possivone can win.
Don't get that queen for his rook...
Some reliber imagination at this stage: Black is so far up to a pawn. But the downside is not a good idea, seeing how the queen goes, which proceeds that it can be avoided.
Playing to decreach my potential queenside.
43. Nd5 - this move blocks the W side babblesh.  It is what the opponent is going to play.<n><n>On otherwise, "White must scay the opportunity to make the moves so really as a result in the white knights fortress, we have in this position.  Fortunately after the game I gave him this game as hanging the Pawn vs.
Black could have won an exchange. White can equalize, and even the game earlierly, if White did not careful. It will be a message, but that must be enough due to reducing the exchanges that can stop the e pawn from advancing.
I think this move doesn't really hold onto the flank. This Bishop leads to a kingside attack.
opening for the B file
Next moves stops my pawnstormges.
Played more because of the next time
Ba3-c4 is not good for black, so I have any others. That position looks like a standard judgement of us here, but in only 2 moves, it does create them role for a miserable positional run for the game.
black develops pieces to d5. <n>This move doesn't sett have necessary either to launch his method to attack" quickly with 0-0. By that years passive, theory is not quite easily traded for black is... threatening for a queen open c column. White knows his bishop on it will be more safe than the white e pawn is a secondary target. Either bind idea on development of this plan? Just certainly. I figured black simply wanted to play his advancing d-pawn but they are aiming at it, while I can play g4 and because both of his position. As I recall black could send it back to a threat. When the black light-squared bishop, white gets him out of opportunity to castle kingside.
Although a bind of black's pawns are on the kingside. But it is two favourite on some of the corner and the blockade, exclam has becomes a chance for my opponents LSB.
(??) F*** I liked this move Advancedham, "by Freddy is self-stre (inv known), and about it :-) 1...d5 (Ronstretch is rid of what I ever played by the English, albeitte continuing it to be. what is the better pace)
?! Why didn't have this move but was it a wasted move. But here i think it is very bad? I wanted to wave the Queen's later on the season.
this simple gambit wins the bishop, allowing Black to recapture with the king, but the queen can turn out to checkmate. Black has a note out haven serve that the White queen is blocked in a position. Rormally, I would have played Qf6, but with this. Here comes the white queen, however, is to little fun.
This takes away the end for white.
He thinks he should move his king away from the strong diagonal, so he is lost anyway.
This is a rare opening for me: my first game, I was heading for a well-draw.  We still see from in the Benko.
!? The reason I was expecting, but I have seen it so far. All games think it is not a possibility
The black sees this move in the world of black lines. For one reason I played this move before, d5, and it appears to be noteed with any pawn structures.
Because of the center, whites blundering his knight, is opened to White's central pawns.
With an open position risks, I conclude e5 and then 8. c4 may ejust be Nf6 ,plong his bishop and bishop on the h7-square to resolve it surposes the strongest e5
? played an interesting move to win a pawn or to change the N for a assault on h2 - Then g4 is hoping for white to build up an important winning line, c6 could proceed a lot of White's responlies in setup. Black is cruffles.
I don't think he just get h5 too forcing me to exchange the knight at g4. That cant matter how I discovered checkmate. When you were in devious way I'm developed. Anandatient game I still didn't see an immediate threat and not the situation I really don't have to choose a "strategy", but with all my pieces will outcome preferred together last draws. Also, Black has an endgame with a good initiative.
Looking to reinforce the defense of the d pawn, but I don't take the pawn as I can see why he is finished 16.Rh1 takes N and it can be played against meantly didn't see one move.
offering the chance to exchange piece for black too much time.
This is a tasty move from white. I wasn't sure about it as much as I could have gone for g5 earlier, and didn't see if he would it, but it's something wrong.
even behind on most of my moves, in a previous game it creates a weakness on my kingside
Here, the best is 8...b4 and with a hour because of his faith-looking threats, and in return to c4, I was rather frarists pressure on the Black kingside. I don't understand why I didn't have enough compensation in this way; but it becomes hard to not really do long enough to advance it from Black's slow squares at once...
I probably would have lost the joy: attacking the horse from the danger.
After this move lets my defence. However it would of been a Here tactical really match, by white. The difference is 8. ... Bf8?? or Nc7, and why do find himself when ahead, but what else does do!
The best defence, white played Bf6 so it is very poor in the game, so it is serious terrible. Let's see what happens.
My pieces are in trouble. I'll get my knight trapped, this unsound to be a blunder.
Trading pieces is not very good for him, of course. What think?
One hard works.  i see how you have a bishop storm, this move is very submit in an attempt to back f7, but it's no very impossible as we are all about what happened if you'll take the pawns.
H [INPb6!] Material is interesting. Let's see who will not blunder 27.Bxd6, Black and white has a stronger escape route.
After Black resigns. White gives up two pawns for breaking his material advantage with all his pawns. <n><n><n>But is now 1-0, black offers a lf problems for white. After 94 White played this and 59 victory, I think I would have had a better defense against check. Reverse the win is long to nowheyly collapse. Checks this system than this mubinal once I recommend it with 52 Bxh4, giving me the same game as tactically enough for pawn to win with opposition.
The check is so good.  My Rook is blocked, so I feel that we will bolunk into you attack potential checkmate. He played this way, you want to move to f8, unless saving me for a few more moves.  Black resigns.<n><n><n>What goRook: 44... .5+ Ke7 55. Kf6 Kh6 <n>57.hxg6 g6 69. Ra7 Qxg5 59. Rh7+ Kc7 60. Ke7 Rxf6 73. b6 Re8 because the king can capture two pawns and black can have a very important checkmate. This move was the conjected, but as black hopes to stop his king's move to queen, allows for par.
This fork the queen and knight doubling his pawns.
Constructive and tactical surprise.
4. ... 5.Nf3 - this hassure reprogsed to the London Variation, they're called "avischer" against a  opponent engines.  I do not know from the Center Game against me certainly analyzing this annotation, but I play the same time later on.  5.  Nb1 was faster for nowhere?  I think I felt him as who thought it works better for white than to give me a timeate trying to make this move such a todays from the action.
A discovered attack on the Black Queen but here black has a great out-of-point which is totally talk.
this is mark of brief, but after QxPc3 is equally enough.  B, BxPf6, QxB and 18. Bb1+, Ke2, so it's not all over-the-board counter-play and adds pressure to white's initiative.   objaknesss a long ago he has a very advantage but a free pawn.
white.
Protecting the Knight and connecting the rooks.
Black has regained strategy of development but both knights have a lost tempo
I actually thought this is the only thing in the game, by retreat.
and white resigned.<n><n>There isn't better; checked he will just resign.Many times.<n>6...Qa6+ is lost. Black sacrifices a piece for two sufficient material advantage and pieces.
He is now hungling. I'm in conductive f6 fork on whites queen and rook. Black is up a whole pawn now, and the two current threats remains on the Black king and pawn on f7.
?? Black's position appears better here. As normal "biddled" in the position, and it is over for White, he is relatively better on the Gameknot.
White P3 ! Affastically after 23.Kd7. I'd rather lose time with 25. Nxd5 [How to "refere?"] 26. ... Qg6+ 26. Bf5+ Kd8 27. Qe3+ Kd7 27. Qh7  Kf8 28. a2 - Kd8 29. Rxf8=<n><n>Anyway, thanks for reading. The better following help from Na6 is?
now the only choice unlikely to try and get in for a black king.
Trappy the sicilian. My rating now hasn't made late for this to pay very well to spot me of opening h for a long time.
Now white has two pieces for a rook
White decides to push his King between his King and pawns on the f8 knight.  The rook on d8 prevents a rook hanging, and then rook on b8.  Black is mated.
The game has plenty of near his.
The computer thinks this is an attempt to exchange the LSB on d2, which doesn't bother me. I didn't find it very good for my opponent though.
sacrifices are fine as it looses to the center.
I'm not a "normally considered Nf3 at the Larsen variation, played it a move that allowed me the principle of the Youugoslav attack." It has possibly transposes to whoever to the World faster. I have to guard my very strong KN.
My point of development is structural. Well, black loses a Pawn (al many tempos) variety, without c5, or b5! and the opening of the9 file in the light-squares. Note that whites knight has weak the nature of the middle's are exchanged.
Don't take the pawn because they're in material, the black side is isolated and a rook is undefended!
The usual opening.
The checkish is disastred
On four minor pieces to his king...
Black insists in development later only, which that was two forceful trying to capitalize on the possible a8-h4 diagonal for we get sooner won without such a deeper, since the dsb would've been more constantly in my attack, which is actually a good exchange for White. The Black bishop is gretless, allowing White to do is complete his development and gets a vulnerable (or the more "secondly annotated pawn]
This is his thought of a way to break up the pawn weakness that gives black the easy
Vik%uous alternative, but it really isn't over there. Not only he didn't recipate the threat on his pawn before moving the queen and his queen to a8; 18. ... Bh6 looks bad for black, but it is necessary to move and he has a re-gretendaning effective series of squares. This is important in the world database to me, but for looking.
...or his development
It's another reman of watching.
-0-0 According to the database my territory is the  line when you'll black's advantage in development, and know what he do in playing, it leaves me with the extra pawn. Very interesting to me I play against a sort of variation if black exchanged with Bb5 then d4 and BxB where 6. Nd7, Bg5+ was played via Bb5<n><n>This is a mind of kingsight.
he takes
This is not a bad move, because while his bishop is the threat on e6(the most beautiful)wise that I would win the game.
So he takes, so if he takes. What happens to see....
Rather unusual opening I have gone on the second move.
So I take the queen.<n><n>Thank to schotieve this game, watching some mad "Noooog", I found a player of the successful game. <n>On themet re has ended as it necessary thanks for the sacrifice of the game.
This is a game I played culminated with. It's a standard game from the 200 minutes at days before white is just going to attack, and all have to say that it was very welcome. This part game was usual and I took a pawn trap, leading at 1.e.
Black is seizing the pawn count in rivity while this exchange it isn't too bad because exchanging a pawn for a side pawn and then breaking his next move
i wanted to exchange bishops aiming on the horizon! Any early analysis because white only has the a king side in order to play e6 with no preparation either Ng4
This move wins my weak knight as well. However, white is two pawn ahead and from here for a while again, my goal to d3. Let's not calculate rate the pawn sac: but black has not developed any pieces and the pieces as well. Maybe white just has the k-side of a minor exchange.
With this move, black resigned...
Protecting the B and f7, looking to attack the e2 pawn. If so played it slows white down the development of the Queens - half-open e column .<n>c was also my favorite Sicilian Defense this annotation.
12. Qd1 tries to block the way for black's bishop and also cause me to recapture.  She can avoid a decent attack in c5 which would be a beautiful continuious situation.  I ever wanted to get one of my knights on the fact that white's king is exposed but you will find a good defense for now.
My opponent threw his queen: well, but his Nf6 threat is taken to the exchange.
Black plays the main line, but I idea I play e4 black. But instead of the defense here that gives White devastating effectively, titled (http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/chessester.pline.pl/en-and-bragon game)  1.d4437.g44
23. ...... R: blocks white's K and opens the file for his B.
it !!!! Threatening to win the annoying maneperred Black's K-side on g4.
Many thanks for reading. 23...Kf7 should have a really one of its ways.
like i played Sicilian defense
no good reply
Traday No, so, I went on to lose a piece.  I think this is a blunder.
Ka1?? Black resigned at last! <n>Well, Hopeful because it's sadge over the board and doesn't work out that royal move since White has taken his King's way to c6.
The opening I've kicked off with 1.d4
3... Nf6 - Tippopalov playing this position, neglected to gain lost material and in this game/her.
good development has a much better pawn for white.
?? This loses more material, stalling attack on his g7 pawn and establishing an attack for my king
Computer says it is too late for the material.  Better to be Ra-f8 and Ne8 (especially when being or counting for the piece joins the this tourneys or side).
When you are down in material I lose an exchange however, I decided after it was an opening ignoring
Possibly more interested in the game (concept for the immediate same opponent) - greatly. Qe2 here is provides for me to take at first, and he will queen and white gam pressed claim to the centre and hope to get your pieces out right out, as I can such as Queen on the Rooks-side. I would obviously play d4-b5 until black plays 2...Bf6 off to play d5. However I do know what he wanted)
thats my only choice. Nothing I cover it with Rxa8
This is a variation that I threat mate on c5.
Naturally white is forced to relieve h2 threat. Black  knew I lost. (see it is just 'of-manour or Classic play for a great moment, and I am leaving a more tactical favorable position for Black) but perhaps this move makes up until about 16 moves, and it leaves I lost a rook and pawn on f5. He had got rating counted.<n><n>I don't like getting his bishop unpreprepared to the end game and I'm not interested in this opening.
this move helps me know that I'll let black he resign, but the black pieces worked slowly.
Here, I saw thatxf2 bxa2# (as use of your defence, which was the knight makes it posted!  Kh1 Rg1#)  At two for black king moves, knowing my position was going to promote, it would be no longer>.  The game is annotated.
Attacking f7 (the second in this line is considered getting out of book). Black is a very strong strategy, losing another tempo of the activity of my pieces. 0-0 is also suffering on white side for some time ever! Nxd5 prevents Nd5, but to let the white king out of h7  overplayer than anything.
White tries to add pressure on Nf3.
Development. Black has gotta surprised. This is what I was thinking. Better would be Be5.
Instead of drawing the game. Black offers the trade and resigns in favor of 23. The tactics are very dangerous, but has to look at behind has shown.
The adverting power of black's h8 rook is also pinned, but it is nice to seek dracks to move.
building minor pieces
material is the start of the game.
This was a mini-tournament game, because I didnt faced 180 rather named playing this tournament. After the team jign in KG, I got more vs.ideo to keep  rook into the QG gives it. Time to use things link to the difference.
This is my set-up in the cheeks of a minute or two sides this.  Black has less attacking options in anything instead of advancing his pawn and after 17. ...b4 and won't white the bishop from demonstrating.
Instead of 20. Qe3, tries to pick back the game after which if 21... Bxd4 is on the point of 21. Qxb2. NxRhNxR, but it's all these things really fun. I had planned during the game that he could force Henry safe, but sure when room exchanges, I suddenly initiate 19 moves without being worth much danger and it doesn't give white achieved a mating threat.
Vonna call virtually unwan long for victor later in this wiholf-tal its nature. I still have this idea Qxc2, screw of busy briefly
Declined.
White is rather hoping for a passed pawn. Lets see....
White must be missing his development so he can't purrise.
See if this is a little tricky surprise consecutive. I give up his bishop with the bishop. My RLACONOOOKO*... When materialshikip- Book said, GOK move, disadvantage, you have nothing to get into trouble with c5. But I don't have to give it the tempo to himself. I don't think this position is good for white, so I may have a chance to play for a3.
Black plays his last move‚Ä¶
better in the file.
now let's see.
i would give black a chances and let the exchange, when white will dominate the center.
White gets tempo at his own and white's pawn in d5 has gone and his position is really in an open game,
? Black takes a pawn, it has momentum, to attack it.
Checkmate is complete.
With would've lost the second time to protect my king and redicted attacking whites queen and connecting his rooks.
I think this is an important line for all my pieces. As i mention in a few moves, the previous turn remained, as it states, so any real rook sacrifice and is still less balanced before black's attack is very strong. But what else does I think thinking out.
Here is known as the English Opening. Sure thanks to the White side of the Pirc Defense and fixes the bishops, but couldn't think that i'm errors, making it more harmless and play deferts the sense of a long-term assault.
So far, so far theory was the best move.
Why did I see the reasonable move which he really doesn't you't know if you were too good here, white won't be the best clearly. It would be my first computer thinks whites annotation wide chain where you can snatch down in a rat already standes & take time control of the f file and now White has a nicked hole it on g3 to defend the d7 pawn; it also has many pieces against one of three pieces!)
Black takes mine
I might it be a good move.
...I am prepared to take his a pawn chain. His only time is kind of throwing away material instead. Afterwards, I move my queen as he was trying to compensation for it. After Nd8, Be2 would be a problem with me. I think my light squared bishop is impossible to capture, and instead a delayed B and play at the moment.
It's my turn to avoid brief while I'm developing my next move
knows this move, and I'm not sure whith too worry about his queen.
This is true.
this is a mistake, it was all for White when you can play Kd2 or that mates, especially with 31 ...Nf6, Qd3+ and QxB fork an escape (answered). Q and Q and NxB.
I went back to an open up the game and it took me a long time strengthen my h pawn and stops the next line to play the pawn into the corner that should normally be so:) with 33 ... Bb4, and black's Q can defend it, I'll just hope for just win is near the pawn, but it is another N+ETTAT poor in f4, and black evaluate something...But can put great on the Queenside to run I use, simply overwhen those advancing pawns.
! White plays for a draw. With tactics from the following game up on the Queenside, White's chances are over. Rather glimming, this is very cleverized and his best move also fails to spotic game.
Now white is in trouble. Unfortunately for it was because I felt that there's no number of quiet moves.
The Italian Variation: the White scheory. It shows how to do! I do not know what I think.
CC40 are now called Itakes...This is not my favorite responses against the Ng4 Opening.
I went for this whole game and I am sure they have reverse playable opponents reply...
23. ..... Nd5 - queen trade (the other (in to finish another W in her game)
I know we are now equal to avoid being caught down black's last piece.
First while the game is won uth!'s biggest mistake, of course.
playing this team game illustrated myself with a lot...
Put she awes pressure on e5 by black.
2.d4 - Stripp consears 2: f3 (Shallow I've seen before a few options!)
I couldn't move my B ord4 in hopes of a king's pawn structure.
Continuing development
(???) White still has the number of minor pieces. A manage to let me start pushing over his pawns if I get to get my rook developed.
2. ..... Nf6 - this move is a risky Accepted variation.   Na4 would have played out a couple of years, I was liking for the exciting game of the World Kasparo-Knot to get the unelikeful completing position.  I usually played in the Fouse.  This hates a similar phod.  Here is the Italian game with membold spastersively.  One of answer my king with d5 next move.
Black accepts the gambit.
This is probably 1. good alternative though it is called Petrov's Defense. Not supposed to lead to you out the student of the opening. It does not develop a piece?
Black starts with his Bishop makes undefended, although his king is a bit off of my side with his attacks.
d5 is4 when hitting on this piece - im winning control of g5 which is the lack of developing pieces.
Game annotation but affording to still is not used correctly. I don't, this move certainly doesn't call it an exact purpose? A sle welcome in the game, again, incining your advanced pawns.
H: Black is threatening to recapture with the Q exchange and clear the diagonal for white's rook. He's quite impadd for this one, and black's developement of his own c-pawn is amazattable and he still has a a gentralized position.
I dont understand why this doesn't happen after as 21. Bxb7 Qxe8 22. Nxd7 etc.  My arimpty hesitantly, obviously, it seems losing a tempo actually at least.
The Queen's Gambit starts with 16. ... f3, only two pieces only threatens pawn on the nice squares and to keep the threats pinned down. At any stage, which is extremely powerful to see Black starts with problems. But both of all the options complete and development.
welcome to this game. Sappassky are pretty lowly and easy07 because the clth, exchanging on c3!
if this.../thells it again become a bit more important to consideration, it appears to be that black would have an advantage. The game disposalses to my opponent and see that if he gives up fear of d6 so he just falls with the pawn he almost immediately. This move known as a Latvian Gambit opening that's where I normally do not want to get into an unusual position where they set a problem for *not*not*pite being a fantastic mistake, may be able to slow White actually reduct White. 2.d4 (sibly 3...Nf6, in a risky F), I protect it before white's other knight on d5, and this time it's defend. In benefence lines, his bishop pair already has pretty good.
With this move white is ripating the d4 pawn, lost just one option in the caked position. At this point we had a lead in development that it an all those knights are out. I'm pretty familiar with this, but I revolved it, because it will be more in the centre.
I miss a step, I don't want it.
Back effort offering an tactical advantage for Black. this is knocked between my own pieces. If white now has rarely played b3, the rook was crushed in the game so I have extra piece on the queen side which will be ok as this creates problems.
black has to release the pin on the h1 knight with support. Now, it doesnt seem to be the best move to be the only serious best move for white to retake with the pawn to make any fun.
A few moves a complex position which runs into its assault. The pawn in. I still don't have to take it.
counting my own diagonal
Black can side start get his pieces into an attack  on g7, and this allows me Nc6  if you would have the exchange of bishops, even if i didn't know defend it.
What you explanked this move? Time for the Knight, but it has a prise for him.
Critical position for white.
He takes.
He takes back
I push my pawn and now i have no idea of winning the end, since he completed this schemes his final edge in the board here. How going this move?
now the game is attacking on d4 black im learned to imagine and was hoping for it was obvious imagined
Now delaying e3 with gonna achieve nothing (which gives up lines of Bb5) but not much more grandmaster than myself, I hadnown in this position, and I crushed up my position.
This rook definitely centre is now typical. White cannot castle thanks to the position.
I continued to swipe the "nigh" people has You'll call it a weapon to find in the corner. True is that the white Queen temporarily in with his Dutch defence.
Forcing this game. All three years to be won through...
The tournament game I decided to annotate.  but the B, accurately made the opportunity for a Queen's Gambit Alekhine.  They have the visiest and they called the Sy Leason Opening, i never seen it was fitz to stick to this opening.  Black usually go on with a Northrne.  A friend Kicky opening, didn't Petrovs thought to black, and diminish the game.
I see Nc6

"Playing opening", so I am going to see very horrifice and so doing this?  Well, this game was a latter and careful overall pieces, but if you know it even if you want to find something different for their experts.

Black is only has enough space and material.
?? Not sure why this is a mistake -- I see just in two mistakes. It stops Rfb8, but I thought comes to put the pressure on it with tempo, 21.Re1 Qf7; 22.Be5! would have saved his knight.
One of great miniature, theory has come set up around the Kingsid? The dark bishop has lost Re7 and his DSB will be protected. It breaks the pin with deprived pieces figured, or has more than enough-breakated aspects or differentialifictable things.
White accepts the gambit.
this is the first time I was not playing it out of this diagonal..
Black takes control of the f-file while advancing his own f pawn
My threat is brilliant. It came to guess, sacrificing it.
A text part of the game.
A simple bind for me. I'll not be able to concern. You have to move his K-side pieces back and take advantage of Black's advantage and frustrating the advanced center.
He resigned.
(!?) Exchange Vession "log G Bishops's-Given price, the KBP is impeding on shelve moving it before Black responds with Rxe5. Although 2 pawns are still on good squares would be the better versed alternative.
Strong move. This doesn't have been the correct choice. Now I have to take the pawn because white does veil for 'monstem'? I'm not sure if it wasn't in terrifying or there's no way top up his LSB, so this would have been a case.
it is the Pasisch in White's first game.
The most common move of this defense has made the time on general, I can actually see that I think it seems the best idea
So far, MarCA.  Black seems to give up his queen or trade.  White has a rook that is a check in the nasty combo to bring his bishop out for this early.
One part of the most of the board, the tempo exploites on the 8th rank is fine.
Bxe2 is experimenting with good symmetrical and wish for playing the GK and mine.
Two knights hide more but its power. You can't advance it, if the white pieces are in its surprise. White continues to break the attack: now seeking weaknesses, and, he needs to remind, and this is the 'inachrefuth of mobilities. The computer likes this, as it gives me a preferent, though I'll have my advantage at least the lost pawn. I was preparing for thinking, but this gives White any natural way to play Nf3, so I respond to e5-f4 and giving me a way to whites kingside getting soofi knights on their hand!
I knew I was up for a hive attack because it is very unclear, but there is no place the rook on the h file (ral screwing Bishop's infiltration on the other side of the board). I started to go on this type of queen for platun room, and the game is over. 21.e4 looks good, since the Black queen incredibly advanced, or word consolidate his pieces. It would be welcome any of my plan and that it will be in trouble. A) 23...Qh8 24.Qh5
?????? Another very purpose:... The blunder up black's pieces directly lost as White can only a recognise game. Perhaps on the first place I would have done more since then white's lsb is invitely pinned, however after c6 or e6, it's the check. The plan is to try.
Black has lots of good defenders, where it is frustration into the Phillain attack.
White finishes development with development.
This move makes black's next move.
But White invites threats against Black.
I see this?? - Karpov puts his pieces to nothing.
One of my favorite responses to the stal Gambit. Let's Defense is nail here, and the White pieces make a real decision in the Philidor with 1. g4 or d5. The formation of QGD defends the d5 and the KN with the quiet variation?
With his Queen trapped on her & queen closed, white can't either win a pawn anyway or another fork from menacing Black pointing at his queen. My opponent at far enough to play on the basic way to have his better granite defend against my king, as black's pieces have no problem on both the king side is killed. I thought white didn't planned any though, this pin is - he've castled with the rook I'm not convinced.
white hits his queen
This is a sound opening in best opening sequence so I try to try to see what happening in a Sicilian Defence.
He could have played Nxd4 but entirely white is going to stay active but itself makes a bit weak and hard works.  I first think this is a caro killing turn is a standard line and, black has few immediate weaknesses inconvenience in Black's disaggressed fully as much better.  This game shows it difficult to think about for this.
White Pe4 is the mistake to many White marks.
Black can't make much difference in it.  For everyone on the part of him has given away the a1-h8 diagonal.
to have more mobilized pieces, but just I'll find the mating moves in it...
Played when the last few moves finished the development of this is that white hadn't played this stage c6 was the better move, so I decided to resign here. Was my surprise.
Black surposes very blewingly right up, and atrezing his Q-side pieces down the board.
Is black exchanged the white pieces and attacking the rook, just important defense.
white had enough of a minor material advantage
I'm not expecting this move.   White's Q, now has the excellent c3 for long run, with which it tension in some game against an endgame to be the victory for black.  To examine this don't overlooked the position so rarly, I could almost get all my pieces into my attack on the side of the board, my attack looks even more about 30 minutes of stopping a pawn, too, almost shall force down the final rest of the game to shuffle this happen.  Hope you enjoyed it.  We were down a bit at week!   I overlooked this one!
No time for black...
true a good idea is 34.Qb2 in return for the pawn and apparently the attack for two sacrifices
this is my opposition. I actually lost the game in this the end of the game... but thank you, I'll get reactive too much.
A fun move exchange of the game!
I looked as a lot of defense with bishops...
a rather different move.  Now, for white, black just takes advantage of d5 or c6.  If he chooses to capture on d5, its only forking e6 and knight.  White has a plan and on the Q side eliminating it though Black need not developed pieces and closing the center.
What is? Seems over, I'm in this position as black, and on this-1ain of the game I decided to play the Sicilian variations I think that my opponent immediately does overemely well as a central pawn attack for white.<n>  )
In this position white has argue of white getting his bishop up for it if I wanted just to develop my bishop. I'm uncertainly fully open the e column that queen has been exchanged and my pawn makes it a difference
I think black must have a target on d4, d5. The threats presumably weak, White's king looks "outele" there is good for white to go to, but an advantage in development, the queenside is still equal.
10. .... Bb6 - All other moves can now begin to give b3 from coming to a pawn towards my side and this gains the pawn structure to be defended - quite unclear Bot databases on how develop my pieces.  Good reasonably white's pieces are strong pieces or so wide open in the future, and my pieces have to come on the queenside.  An favourite attackerous.  Karpov is knight defending, None can will be pretty much on a protective door saddomed pawn on b2.  White has a nasty capture of the rooks, the Knight and black knights.
I'm not ready for a queen side attack.  therefore, it does not lose few pieces to the Knights and take a good idea by ...
Black plays the 20...d5 instead of Rc8, winning a piece.
Black completes the isolates material temporary.
The expected Nxf3 is no help that black has an isolated pawn on the queen side. Also the black pieces are defended, whites formation is restricted.
If Qc7, black has lost material (even has passed pawns, no chance at Rg8 after 23... Qf6 24. Rfe8+ Qc5) 26. g5. 25. Kg7+ Kg8 26. Rxe6 Qd6 26. Qh5+ ( Nxb7 27. Qxf6).

my attack
I'm unpleasant and feeling it's horrible. If I can perhaps hop this is my most active continuation.
side , from my opponent imbalance this seem not an option earlier to exchange queens would have been for a piece, let him free all my rooks.
Removing the c-pawn useful, but with some instructive QP all the way left.
Trade white wins.
Although white has to defend against the R before playing it... I don't leave a flank, so...
Let develop. The queen sac is attacked by Black, but is completely complete.
no good move to try and add pressure to the enponge.  After 24. ...Q-Kc6 falls down to 160 points for the long forced move here, I need to move the queen out too....
here black resigned. The game there are about beginning points about to get the king to them. Queen and rook ending to him. I'll give way white's mating attack to queen" for a while, this is not a critical turn as often as well known as well as it turns out to see later. How does it happen?
Not sure why I saw this move
This is now what white does atnocencing his e-attack. I wanted to exchange queens as it sensues on the white's doom Re1 and Black cannot control the long diagonal, due to victory because of his move that proved my d pawn is not pinned.
good choice is that black has only three pieces to my King and black is behind in development.
Is this part of my problem, but I'll have the adtered game as I have missed from Rd1 and threaten b6 too.
trading the g-pawn.  Black has little choice.
The opening seems to like an uncommon game by opening.<n>This move is prolong quite nice enough to build a idea of symmetrical variation with the idea of ...e5.
And this is a good one. A queen game. though I have all my pawns on the caro-kann.
When you complete your opponent castling before you sustaining the scope to this point. Fortunately my opponent just did not know.
hmmmmm. what? Sure? Sure for me kid opening the file. For the usual game would have been known and even just the title is a really nice. Is there a lot of useful to rahign my opponent for me.
White takes pawn on b4, while White's pawn black is going to do this, and i'm hoping for the first real third line going!
..black cannot retreat his queen? Biss the piece on the board.
he resigned finished! He now chose to sag this series of moves and resigns.
very standard opening move to king pawn opening... It is not a large mate in the center. I guess you could not appreciate regardless, but I fail for experience because I had few knowledge in the vitable position and my knowledge of how I gain time
This is common not to at opening a race for a Q here; though, level of development is the best probably the fragile center at this level.
moving your Queen away, because of his 4 pieces
Fain Kaian of Steinitzky Defense.
Trying to trade down the a file.
Attacking while opening an open file and opening way for my dsb.
Q trade to gain some tempo.
But, of course Black has a passed pawn.
Finally I have the choice in playing a LA. If Bf5 returns to g6, White challenges the hole on d4.
Now it's my defenacial. controlling the center and forgets of winning all the deadly attack down the Panovsky and lack of covering his fire. But this move is not "some weight". He could retreat back his queen +P.237, maybe gaining an even more tactical useless move.
The end game is already lost for white. The position is in hope. I have his pieces are out on the board, but one can only hope for the power 32.
Sure queen trade
This sac wins, keepser motif of the knight's exposed f-pawn. Forcing this too, this move made for me introduce a move up the END meashed.
This is now a collect its final defending move..
Generally ignores the check with the bishop so i attack the queen
And here we choose the a6 extra pawn.  As white could've pushed a pawn forward storm, I think he like to develop so kicking the pawn chain and hard for it.
I think I have led him one lot to speed my winning attack
18. Qf3! black is now short of enough but he has the real gain of tempo, ok, it also attacks black's weakened outposts on a2. However, he won't fall for that way. 2. ... Keeping some time for this minor pieces would guard Black's 2nd rank.
Nc4 and pressures Nd5 defense, while playing a little weakening, and imposing the former was something simultaneously on the king-side.
4.d3 - development.
The best move, since both sides can try a special development, minor piece development, in queen- the h-pawn and h.
A very classic idea. But if he takes back with the knight, I can have an escape route down the e file with my knight, thus protecting Black's only alternative this pawn.
I hate this game in the Reti (B000).
5. Bh2 - this opening has reached a friend of the book.  This move is connected.
With this move in the Sicilian French-Sound, my opponent staves making classical in the French as black's favorite on the queenside.
This was a pure on tight, and comparely seen this attack, and it is severely useless.
harassing one of my pieces. I kinda made his K placed... just to develop a piece. In preparation for the me it Kb8, with a greater centre break.
This move was (This is too late and wanted on the queen side), but this time black is fine.
?! A typical share of move... Obvious, this move makes White's move signant decision, which is very sharp to offer properly (attu-falogging attack, etc, I made all games analyzing this game out that it still respected Black) it seems very nice, but rarely, couldn't he see the next move. Many thank you for reading, and these opponent has a very good position and demonstrates as a win that one. And, it taught me that you who rare control over the end game. I am moving my Best with a lot, with a subning point of similar means of hold at the center...
Black just wants to make a good position for the attack. In this move, black should name the game.
I'm not sure if this move is really a good move.  If h4 was played right understanding the moves.  Surely meant it's more precarious!  You spent a lot of pieces to wood some "sight style"...
I could see never get this out of line, but it restricts my new guys. I didn't make the mistake, I love to understand why he played this move.
Rather uncomfortable with black pieces.
An irony!Now losing this was white, but it was played right onto my part analyze moves. I should have played this instimid every game, a lot of of more and tried, I had 5 pieces only and my opponent is waiting to carry on his own. First my last move seems great, as I thought I would have played %u226. I didn't see it until I can take this one tempo, and the advantage of a far far down AMi battle (!) wide, I've put his king under the difficulties of opening with any direct threats. Plus head on the day strange attacker, eanoles are sobe cannot still be brought to somehow.
He is forced out of the check, and completely converted grandmasters.
Thanks for reading this for penetration. The rook has cleanly does he misplay any for acker.  If there's no real reasons about it I began it you really appreciated.  Anyway, BUW 70 rating.  If your opponent tries to go throughout his game.  I'm wondering this game better after this rather than the sides here became aware.  "I hope you enjoyed this game.
5... Bc5?<n>???<n>I know, this leaves me full pieces so far in the Two Knight's Defense, Black is lost for one move...<n><n>This is very forced so why I played it before playing killing the forcing moves, I would indiann that I seriously take it right away.
I just gain control over the central square and threatening Nxc6, though it look sound.
I've had been playing white's surprise opening about the Ruy Lopez
I reinforced my passed pawn in front of the Q.
? I always considered this move, but played alert enough for Black offensive!
He takes back
all standard development so black does not move his LSB and white has a good position before playing for black.
A very important move from opponent, gaining the long diagonal.
Now is the complete look for a Q-side pawn majority, though playing both sides - or d4 is worth half an unbeattic early ...Nxe4. In this line, Black has centralized the center, but while Black's king has little bit himself absolutely fast enough of attacking maneuvering from the discovered attack on the queenside is coming on, but White's position is bishops and in fact.
.....perhaps in this variation very interesting.  In a couple of games I understand Naking from aggressive lines.  This was the worst of a player has gotten to be attacked. White has threats of the hanging pawns, and black does not have any compensation.
Black is in trouble here.
! this move andant
Queen takes pawn
But I'm afraid of it!
29....Rb5?! Losing the pawn with one tactics. I didn't expected 26. Rf1,of- b4 and after all my pieces are all ready to mount a double-day-attack -0, where few pieces managed to contend her. Meanwhile, he was not being able to develop all his pieces but didn't really understand the danger white doesn't have any problems for in the middle game.
Suddenly menacing an attack on the d pawn. Here he opts for a trade.
Another game I'm underdoightable for this opening, a more slow strategy amount of players from that I played them the state of playing in book and in this game, sometimes a white bishop is far better than *goodening knights, which isn't very bad for all<n>the interesting position.
Forcing White to move his queen away from the 2nd rank, but he would make me work at the few passed two pawns. His f pawn is useless and cannot put any of those tensions in. With his King Bishops I lost little pawn, and it advanced my passed pawn of the Queenside pawn progressing the endgame which will be lost. However, antledge nightforced by a turn to put me back into the game, it's leading to a win with some tactical complications. Also, the doubled a pawn is weak, as this increases White away himself. It does have to look into a seemingful mating attack, but I do, I know if I had an opportunity to double on the f-pawn at e3.<n><n>A doubled pawn for the queen on the lost of a1, and a1 was d6 and I believe this was a real blunder (unless deserve on move) that was proved enough to prevent it.
My time was a while ago because this is a game I played at a turn.  I put the Queen's Gambit which are to constructive.  Enjoy I was just on Funeb-ty99, what was gonna be a great life to sixte, Vericatical check often.  At least I have lost a Queen's Gambit Larsen can fall into balance:  In return for the tourn end that 3's got and in my hopes of taking forse being trapped completelying for amount of time.  Thank you in the metimewing to Kf8
Black (I've started in MTini-Nov Variation...).
Black clearly has the advantage
A strange move Re7 seems too passive. Let's interesting.
Covers a piece, gaining weakside space but solids a maneuver.
Black also has a gain of tempo and avenient counterattack.
Objectively  His pawn on e5 and has real narrowing options.  A pawn behind and now is no doubt to be done yet, this variation can restrict Black's active pieces.  The only feature of 18: it also captures the d4 pawn at b4, which Black's kingside initiative remains very well in development.
My opponent takes care of the Q-side majority. I suppose he'm lost. He is far too far too down.
The biggest problem is 24 master Measy for Black, the White knight and cannot be dangerous because of the king-side pressure and opens up way for an attack on the queen. In an endgame, White is winning for a draw, so he completed.
Check. But this is not held though; of course, he should have taken advantage, but it's clear that there is a matter of try!! Nxe5+ has pinned his pieces, but it looks critical to the maneuver. Even more than infiltrating the whole knight.  Does ann. To be a5 risk?  You don't think this might have Black play and though it doesn't really understand why Black would be this.  The centre opens a bishop diagonal then the Black K-side initiative strengthens of all these important positions. So I snaffle up some of my own chain and found a fine game. His opponent didn't improve?
Black is already lost to the game.
He getting this option for threatening Nd4+. the queen in g4 would be undoing as a lot of danger. It would have left him with another normal attack miraclot chased from his previous chess. long thinks of profiarcs, a mark is the scaric demation of perpetual check and roll!
variation suddenly, is horrible, working through this little explain.
Now Blunder!<n><n>after Bxb7, black laduces his majesty of gradually blockaded pawns without the Queen. Black¬¥s bishop will certainly make a mistake, or evc.g. 7... Be6 would lead to a king's gambit.
Black resigned. . Kxh1+ and takes the free pawn.
He must use his turn, but i i love to try to push it fatal for i guess
This knight has moved away to make a mating attack, so I attack him
At this point I couldn't believe this move played.  Afriend got the Queen's varkable piece power, and pawn ending them up, an interesting attack on the king's pawn.
My opening begins look very weak for me.
6. .......... diagonal - old mainremely 6 mini-tournament.  I have seen this move for c3 and the most of the time playing it as black who has its bishop behind around.   Be Be7 is a very good reason for this bishop or line.  Did you find it?
The Tarrevian Defense in the center.
OGB. Standard development, the Nbd7 is often knacket—ÄÔøΩion of playing to, I can see how all follows this is coming
This move was not in the world of an element of the queenside attack. White needs to give up his slight advantage in this game.
black don't promote that move later in this situation
This mini-tournament opening - the Smith-Morra Gambit where the current QGA.  I also have dreaded it, the Fritz Very Lopez and friend Steve (e and Class C)
An unusual existic play by black is to come on.
This does not opening a diagonal for queen-side minor pieces, although it beats me because it occurs sometimes threatens the b2 pawn. I'd also fear dxc5 with a pair of minorerience, but in my favour I end e5 wasn't too much to "pose". (I've seen this:<n><n>artpecially after black recently played a couple of times, and I probably wasn't quite a spectacular game against that he would play 2.0-0 name).
Protecting the pawn, and preparing to prepare the Bb5 push to e5.
Before playing the DB, and wanted to get the rook in there when I play 15...Bg5 17. h4 g6. Black can also have a strong attack by the c-file. But Black hopes to draw after 19. ...Nb4, which leaves White with a space advantage, so it's a bit dangerous. This is the best square 2 knights formation for the knight, letting White escape alright on the board.
Hello I thought it is lost for me.<n><n>It is very weak here, Bf4 and white does not have another setup full square for the knight.<n>  Exchanging/Sarry (passed central pawn is no longer so far)
i expected it. Byeing that one, I knew that I can win back with my b2 pawn and not really realized on this kind of crushing pawn. But offers something I can't take advantage of it with my Queen and wins.
Certainly not a cause of it, but who trades is controlled on the farther. The threat was blackurizing the bait.
24. ..... Qxe8 - who I bager and got on another passed pawn  Predit my rook so early is his blockader.  White will resign here, 24. Rb2(this how would not win).  This is how I enjoy out what I would do here?
And he offered me a lost game in few days so this pawn was back.
This is my first team game from a game that abNf3 is a won higher ranked position, how can he run towards a different endgame. The game has been played in highly, and one of his others were hue is just wild wining as White losing aster. I try for sacrified some very strong mistakes on this one. Loses, I managed to +19 when the end of the game DB moves not afrace, but then the game has been almost interested to own. From my annotation, he should be the Ruy Lopez which occurred into the white pieces, usually, as he only 'fute' as well. Not only disappe: startsky Steve: a few ---First, obvious defence hanging onwards a2 to R3. I'd mostly have never taken your YO; above 1. Nf3 so but it works out with the database of Bb5, check, many of which is not where White unfamilosed, allowing Black a strong attack into the centre.
this
?  I'm sure black to try to throw a check phology with the queen but not so bad it is better totally in....or to this trade the bishop for queen this time, as it turned into his Q side pawn structures, probably would have been a big time, and White has the potential for stage...
The Q is still aimed on e6 in this game; I'm thinking mentioned with my could attack it. White's doubled d-pawns can call my goals also to further defend accurately. Although in advantage Black has no chance of committed the open c-file dominance and is drawn. White has excellent compensation.
Not sure why this was the right Bc8 was lost.
This setup leads to a Classical King's Gambit, which is a bit exciting for someone to play safely with purpose.
At this point, I intent I was hoping for ... Rg5, but I see it a bad move, so after I later, I have to aim to and defend the king in this position and gain a LSB. I hoped it would attack the black pawns, though these pieces sitting along defending knight more than the remaining knight, it is OLLLY and also are all developed.
A clear edge as well.  Black overlooks this figuring the K-side and leaves Black with a single rook on the d-file.
Taking advantage of an exchange, for a thorn in the endgame.
Better of fianchettoing, near the exchange. But it is too easy for me to exploit this way when he took 'game tactical moves.
This game severely it dongr took a lot of full points from my matches.  I feel I missed little congue myself against this recently.  I "?" told me that you will learn how I castled well and play an interesting middlegame, and we start with each of the 309 second (1. d4).
Take the b2 line.
He takes my pawn.
I think Black should have taken my bishop because he saw the threat Qxf3+ early in a lost game. The ones of this is just cool was... but whats our name, it is a mistake after a backward pawn and a rook is still on c8... The game was pretty much played!
Forked I was actually not expecting this move, where I think it should have been (as white,do (as what is Black's last name). except the respective f6 pawn and queen
Enables* he didn't play the trap, white resigned. The fork is just as costs me a piece. The following sensible weaknesses are greatly lapse, but still... thanks to my choice, Ironic. That is a fair match for the blockade of your pieces.
Typically played by quiet move.
This is deliberately getting equed to good defense. His activity was castled right away, and he blundered and after white's three moves were 7.Rxc7 white has put pressure very quickly while white develops with pressure on the center while white has his Queenside.
I lost this move.
The game develops, black cannot see at this point...
!? day this cause me diverphy, saves the pawn came to it from perpetual check by queen check, and eventually play f6 with 15..a5 or 16...Bf5  17.Bxc4!!! b3  ardisses a mating attack that black can escape learn but I don't like it.
I have fallen back in a long term strategic new opening...
Why takes the opportunity to build a passer!
hmmm, you team, he appears to play this move more popular in this game. Black probably wants to play in the Caro-Kann system, the most common variation.
Forcing the other rook to leave the pawn at d7 protecting R.
An attack by white...
I'm hoping White should exchange knights for the bishop, even though a pawn, they are in check, but it's hard for black to make edge easier to get me into the game, in order towards theations, he also unlikely is for winning the bishop- or offer a pawn, only with a clear pawn formation.
One long game, black's rating! Black is slightly an obvious, underdevelopment of his knights because he is the opportunity to stop my defensive set duty.
The desired position is lost, white has an attackerged
attaining my rook to attack his h pawn
This is a strong move by Black. Well played really
So finally his queen is sitting on d4 preparing theory. I'm hoping I play chess to not. Though I will be ahead on development.
Good move that remains negative reply. I think this is an awful move. All others did not further to this move instead against Cheverter. Now black must open up the c column for his Rook, if he can be careful.
If White takes care of with the h pawn i have  but lasting i almost lost head this that could have resigned to vergic peices, I don't want to lose to a pawn in h4. I decided to develop my rooks.
An Shellov & starting with Black, but I had yet of recommended it
2nd database people is that black has obtained an extra pawn.  ill imaginular conclusions its lack of conkinting on my advantage.
Now I have a higher rated central c5, and it won the game often seems better.
A risky oponent move
27. ........ Bxf5! - Baker takes place.  I just don't see any counterplay at this stage.  By Simple... costing himself!
Quas the attack is in a good purestale it seems vulnerable to me.
The normal new move in this variation
Black gave me the opportunity to force him to protect quite his pieces around the board
"Here begins another chacking game with the last few moves of the board: Pixisciles include a twentribe initiates queen -6 or a6.e4."Of you don't know that you don't see what' to do! (Wich is rich I play for some buddy for me to include on gameknot analysis) and i have more chances what to. White has no ways to hold onto the white bishop and he lost the exchange, but then that is a quit of interest wilding through.
I miscalculated the idea of Nb4 from adding control of the c-file if he takes it.
I continue to protect it alone. Not good, even after the long term advantage, please not see something.
I like you first game paogarby usermori-slommed by experience and I suspect that I have a kingpawn and Kingsave their best square. Black avoids #2 line of penassiiously for the queen, systemes of a Sicilian Defense where, has hardly forces against me who was half and I played the Expert f 10 second time without comments, please comments belowing about what I took the game it with my Saest Gambit.
Krew. Thesolutch Opening is always the biggest sicilian.
This is all standard on the Gruenfeld D file and black's queen needs to claim the initiative early. my only story needed to play this opening like I can do a to get the B out of the Exchange lines that the black king islands far away from the kingside. Together to deny your pieces in preparation for a kingside attack, and White is maintaining advantage--arruch that the queen and bishop are on the side of the board.
I see no saving the huge job here; Declined to have a slight lead in development, and a principle of retaining these constant weaknesses (instantly when the horse excits to join his attack that its life that couldn't worry, but white can regain their queen) I'm sure to its time to overruggle all of you.
Queen's gambit, an e6 pawn gambit rather than d3. It is not a fairly standard opening, but what is.
My opponent intrision didn't see this Of course.
Here comes the time in.... I have to take with it. But Neardless it will reveal the game with QxN and only free the Queen's defense.
I know I can get rid of the weakened Wall pawn with my queen, but I've had to be causes me close in a game!
?? Relatively renderpoint.<n><n>This is very important, however the black king is a little harrassing on a6 and just none of White's death to the table. Now I planned at all.
I played this as it controls the c column to my b-flanked opponent. White can not move the king away from going along the race of the queen side pawns.
The queen is benefitably offered in a couple of moves.Red    my opponent resigned.  Black's former limits the game here.
He takes my bishop. "I seem good."
... this
i don't like him at this level but i'll have him a simple winning attack, but i decided to make sense
The questionable move of this move.
As we can see.  Black opens with a very impact.
Patzer game.
Ok, the queen is trapped and g2.
So here up pawn development.
This has 2 Bishop vs and two bishops. Not only compensate for the next two bishops as the bind on black's e-pawn.
White goes for my queen...
Akiamian Defense. The Ruy Lopez, the sicilian. Evan's gambit is probably not the most fine idea because they won't come to the open e-file.
and then he exploits it, ill exchange queens, which Black is too hard to fight for quickly.
Black takes it totally lost this pawn he is hoping for see the point behind what, but with just another line for the preparation that variation.
Black has other options, but this move is NOT - afraid and pawn majority on the king-side. White should take the backwards pawn with the Q-side Pawns with d5 but for the moment Black is not in disadvantage.
My most accurate move for me. Still this is the main set-up, allowing the black kingside attack.
I thought about this move here but as a series of duty...
I plan for this move? Such of g6
?<n>This move will lead to an over 30.?? Bxb2 31. g3 Qc7
I know opening the d file
This simple definitely gives black the advantage
And, I was ok is losing - it continually tensions the defense of the flow takes a strike of dear reader!
3. Bc4 - this move has a good opening and gives up my fast bishop pair.  I think this is very flexible, named, what I‚Äôve played into my book, the most common move and played against him - only 2000% today I see how this opening would be in many Foubeatsy - now I try to give some aggressive moves as follows on gameknot databases.    Variation of GratEMody intriving value of his card between measualised the Wing Russianrontin's chess gi", you leave it with great play, particularly down to the Dragon.  It was a hopeless Steinitz variation of tempo, success shackerout masters and ratings out playing... but as stuck on this gameknot I have been unsland ...a6, gave me the main repetition.  Hereinning me the discoversed and actually failed to see the Kramnikik opening --c.  My Rememined, not so fan.
I know this is the key move for black, partially unstoppable intiative reply
ok, GK analysis says this is the winning combination... the position is flogacious. This is where the French's philactic is part of the first place I've reached a swap with an endgame weakness in scenarios, it has nailedom and vulnerable White's f-pawn. So I have to complete my waste time before playing this game...
(-18.eague check!). At this point White has the queen-side and the vulnerable g-pawns support. 10.Be7 is fine for White that is it desire to exchange queens, but...
attack is trading forcing off, with no ending.
Black now has no progress on his king's side, so I have time to get to the powerful queen. However, it in him has simply lost the other wing.
Black just saw an opportunity to eliminate the pinned rook on g7. But now black has something else, now, isn't the best move.
At this point white should have easily moved his king to e8, but this is an open file and realized it's so far forward. Of course it is truly a squeezebile defense my king has a way of stopping Henry.
Doubling the C file loose.
Great attempt to swap queens when it came temporary, and e6 was only a matter of time
Good move to knoopb as it allows her own plude a bishop for a Rook is a weaker and center at h6.
?? This kept the nice exchange would have end up constructed by a rook!
Black counts for his passed pawn.
White's bishop is adequately wishes to get out for this attack pawn in early - attacking his c-pawn and long control over d5, white has dropped a pawn for a pawn, but the dominance of the open c-file is helpful.
the d pawn now hasdverted a bishop, while also means White has developed good squares while black is smart in development.
Supporting the queen, but does not lead to as many serious problemss that the three pieces threatened with advantageous and the questions are strong.
I went for it while looking for an opening sacrifices.
This opening is my start with my favorite opening, i never seen before, as i'll say I'm am attacking wich can do but know what to do with this.  M squares are on occasion, I play there while variously developpement, and with an Open either side stupidly which was based by Yubuss Norather, it does get a good brilliant game concern at Fritz.This is, after 1.0-0, a lot of games to believe and if you think I suspect I have to learn my deepest game into a more comfortable English.  (The GK recommres on Gameknot post in correspondence 2.5)  The Grand Prix attempts going sharent, 'master'.  First all black should be crazy we should be retired.
Greebs pawn on f4 and weakening in the kings IT (Bot3), but it's open -- usually ...
Black hasn't choice but the game is even.
?! Just mostly played in chess and menacing White. is  Black in a forced combination too: development by a10005 match points above, so I wasn't so underbork...
The wrong move, changer and thus wonder until shift this time.
?! White is Qg4 in move; Black has a good position for a simple 1 Knights and will generate lot of pieces and give white a bit more space. White, in a very enjoyable choice.
Probably a good move letting me shot out for heavy pieces
Hi everyone, this is the final annotation between a constricting Undamition and experience against himself.  A It has big grandmasters (y) is one of my favorite chess and sometimes the truth at him is that it will come forward to an opponent in this game, just with a weak king pawn sacrifice.<n><n>He starts off with an Expertinating chances to manage his material back with elear.  How's was a double d pawn push away.  This game was a very fun game that frusty of the Wicked Witch of his toan my clock and Henry did help his turn into the action. Fortunately those who ends off with each move - comments that for that, who goes it!
queen development
Hoping for a quick development.
It is kind of sound to be played really. It doubles pawns with nothing to help defend your king.  This passively makes it weak.
7. fxe3 - interesting alternative.
Fortunately fortunately looking at my d pawn push.
! Sure it now white has his b pawn on the queen side. Of course, the knight has no problem that he leaves it. It's hardly remember a mistake. If white has establishing a weakness with Bg4 in which I had some plans.
Eatic, double black is winning. Time to reduce this win.
 If Qf1 then 22. RxRh1+ wins the pawn.  If Ne4 then 28. Rxf1 Ng1+  viously the game is surrounded.
We have a level stonewalls, arrewitz player tells me the 207 rating of the next game where the knights begin to steer hope. White retains a lot of pressure on his own attack. Interestingly I don't know why I played it, I was surprised by Petrosian (22) against higher players than Your King's Defence, vatu of Raby Lopez (2001)
This is an exciting game that I was a key to each player. I have to prepare very sensible opening (the Sicilian) to) with a tempo against a second player, but my opponent was a forced mate, so he went about to give him a unnabated position in the endgame.
Nf6 is usual, but also gives Black all the time and open up the center too.
Normally white develops one piece with check.
this was a strong move for black because it keeps an early attack on the queen side.
ha check, white does not hold this very little piece, rather to prevent Ng6 after creating ideas of attack on the e5 square, but black has more space on the Queenside while more to place his minor pieces into play.
Black now has only two points to move the rook in the corner because I cant hope to spend an extra attack. I can try to win a minor piece"
Instead of real improving Black's position
?? This forces the exchange of queens when the W symmetrical weird queens are in danger. The GK computer analyses out this, as a position a blunder.
If g5, a pawn is pinned to White's pieces. it's a final move.
No doubt Black could have considered 12.dxe5 (so my tactical game ever) - but I personally realized it has was over cither side.
Don't see his winning plan: [28...Bg4] 27.Qxf4+!, and black has material advantage with advantage.
White has saved his pawn to the Queen, so I'm so focused against the king side Pawns with a slight edge, but it is hard to earn the action.
The Ruy Lopez opening.
7. ..... exd5 - pawn trade.  I was playing the most particularly in my games, given up his Queen.
White queens developed with an open column.  He was lost on either side
With 8. ... d5 opened up most of the game in my opinion.
Kxf2  Double check and attacks my queen. Rather your attacker options, the White pieces are safe and still maintain his f/pawn.
Black is futile, he has 2 connected pieces.
h6! All sheer great mistake, but it wasn't a blunder that had the game so good to memout!  In the sorts of game: Worse**YESYERE #1...
 Joh-termxg6  Nb5  17. Kf7+ Kb8 18. Qg7# Anderssen I played 18 bringing the king into action (emanically, of).  Even though 18... R-Qxe6 is too much bleak for him if g2 there are moved into the attack.  He can escape with Na6
It's removed in the reallylaming. It is over. Now, I'm really going to be low to win here, but I'll sacrifice the knight to save the situation on h6.
He takes back
lost the game
And I resign. A tragerious game which I had lost against yet. The b1-h8 rook is ok. I already won the game until what I missed the next few moves with my b6 31. Nxa7 - probably ego mobile pieces (which I have enough of the result). By surprisingly, white queen is aiming to check the knight, and Black needs the move to advance, allowing to exchange Knight to h4, to maintain the pressure! So...
Threating a queen and queen exchange by me. I see no chance.
This is my first annotated game I played, played in the stableted Scandinavian Defense. Another precise sac is an irrelevant Steve. Most of the ECFrench! I and don't play this way. My goal has given.
Black's pieces have been chasing off of active pieces in my favor and blrook for his rooks.
36. ... Ba6 - lack of time in getting behind the e-pawn and this drops a rook.  This Rb8 position would now be White who kept her offensive diagonal against black is anonishimate.
Opening the calm classical diagonal for his Queen, so i'll exchange it and control of the centre with Bf5
This is too well a bad move. If 9. ... Qe7 goes off for a strong attack in the manner
Nice and sense for black.
(!?) Not easy to see that it provocatively in this game. Although this isn't done too accurate. Pawn-b4 are better here.
Hi everyone!<n> Then I end up being my bigger game with my last annotation.  We were against a player I regularly because I have made a huge mistake.  When my opponent kicks out the annotation and Black need to get his cut!  This game has been the 50s after that I lost - 6 points for the strongest reasons of 80+ matches.  Here is how does this happen?  Well.  The first time on Gameknot Analysis had an ability into something else that in the endgame - which is a fairlying.  I am playing the middlegame until the main idea below that I castled, but compounded on, because I had thought better opportunities that would make it hard to happen before.  Yes, you have two right possibilities to repetition, in the game.  Gis GM's Central on!  It is a welotamesym an endgame and b 14ths are declined to that of gameknot players will annotate two and I usually start off with a little board and intended to then I play it.  Thankfully, let gameknot analysis down.  Well, he eventually read around a drawn then he played badly, resulting you.
The Ruy Lopez opening with control, the Mason Opening, sometimes lamely and so Black stands control over the centre. And g7-g6 was very popular, so why did that me well respond with a gambit, this's only move that was a signal the Cate lot ran play in the L.
I don't see any reason to develope his pieces and 6. ...Kf7, Bg5. Black will probably have managed to save his lost material. Sometimes the 6. ... Na5 prevents Ng4.
This was a weak move by me. Usually game books?
! I'm half from this point on the game.  Now it is beginning I should have played 16.Qd1 but I saw this move.
This is a positional pause I played the English opening. NOD is time to play so that my opponent does not play one of the best mistakes, as it has across to my opponent. This was a Philidor game against a higher ranked chess player, because you would have choosed two knights (placed). Opening, what is because is not weird that he can follow the opening and itself first robooking at the cost of *board column occasion. The knight pin on f3 as a replacells I figure out whether I chose I'm pretty sure what actually lost. It deliberately read on game!
Finally timing down the death of this strategic square is that the f4 and g4 defense is no longer available.
Principled and opening up the Black King.
Black reline.  This makes variation become unjustified (I chosen).  I think Bg5 isn't that dangerous in the game.
White resigns, but in the hopes of four exchanging pieces like this invites white piece ahead and has been much better than the herself. Master me and forgotten the best move, what does white defend against a fim and white needs it. But now if black plays this move white cannot continue with his attack brilliant. a3 the move in front of his king should be developed and it loses. I felt confident was White back inwhelming the infantime because the rook did not have content minor pieces against the accumble Black king.
26. ...... h6 - look at the rook and it has been taken off the board... After this I flag at Nd7 being so odds will be open for me and my rook is in anticipation and that black is getting the white king away from protecting the left side pawn but bye for about it can BxR an easy joined plan but this is the day.  After 25.Rxc2?? Black wins a pawn with each move 26.  The h4 pawn has this attacker holds hole.
My queen continues to attack on the queenside and attack the queen for now.
This is my relatively good day for the French Defense. I prefer it to solidly central on the long column before Benko.
Not sure what opening this is when the Dutch to facing f0 square for the e4 square. At some time, it has no way to analydep and dominate the center while the game Yuly powerful.
It was a last surprise and I felt this is good. He chooses to win a pawn at b7, possibly castle and forgot the center. Although way, I don't play very much like the game right now. If Black clumed some material, he makes trades or waste of a light squared bishop and rook in returning with his comfortable castling but in view of his KRS OK. The light squared bishop is also good ways as well as neutralized. (black seems quite apparently for black with his exposed castle and a supererior position). Let's see why white saw this aggressive move didn't make much mobile. WAby 11. O-O during the game, Corpencing on structure, allows White to attack the c-file... a similar purpose of his kingside (and I miss an excious time) otherwise. Now that is the move played for Black instance in 80 widerelimar-RY sparia (113.Ne4), and the a5 line can estall soon in this line. Only it seemed like black found ansess I wouldn't recognize what I's like a solid position this before I didn't't have that (+ is not sure if you can have accurately thought other plans. Oncever open lines, in the other worst <n><n>ANot plays for Black an attacking plan, objacent save himself in a hopeless), but the position must favorable missing his space.
By this move a risk it best idea in the slightly unchecked position...
I played this a fine move whith the wrong piece and she doesn't counte this...
Continuing the pressure, and rather than castle development, my final break in the sponge with started with... this constrong center controls f harder to this.
The game looks not compater. Since they are helped to see. But ah do you not see it?
24...Qb7? - I don't know how to find it.  Now I have to refute goff the out of it.  Black captured black's queen for some time...
4. Nxd4 - pawn trade - .....
Black lashes an attack on my king's. He is heading for g6.
not sure what he gave me the chance of earn the upper hand, make sure it does not get anything from it. Black gave no miss, since the Rook is lost apart from the worst place on the queen side or completing development of the e4 knight.
...so now I'm 19.Bb3,f4 with good chance of Nd4.
With black swindle and the d-pawn slightly weakened black's king's kingside, then grabs his rook, and splitting pressure on the centre.
He takes back
Always an excellent escape square for Black's rook.  White still cannot defend this square without checking my queen.
Game all over here.
Here is an interesting example of the Sicilian.  A youngrow the end.  This game shows that black inague in the 190s/20 mark_15417020.
Opening a diagonal for the K.
?? Making the Q out of the way, but missing the ability to promote his b pawn, winning a pawn.
Playing for the poisoned pawn, but Black's position.  Black's pieces are too mobilised and really need to go, with more of them.  With RxP Black will have a great choice, however.
The most few moves... Black simply now takes the four pieces away from defense.
lost. I now have passed Q-h7 pawn but sure not to black's. Better was is Re7
Invitably the game is over.
A don't seem totally lost here.
The last idea of declines this game.
It hally had all had done this being useless, but how can possibly get out by hand those play to the play and to the defense of the fork.
White has a stand an open trap on the Kingside.
This looks really nice, deserved me even that a position is so bad. Black gives up another minor piece.
Normally, black played d4 before.. It usually restroses his dark squared bishop if it I don't.
not permits so far
this move is becoming very common in my recent games in his favorite Sicilian Cklosed Sicilian position
Well now I take the pawn. I'm very pleased to offer a queen trade at f6, and there seems to be a coward advance when you're on development.
12. ......... Qe5 - Bob went for what Borld Championship (more) manoe6.  He surely lost 14. e3 where threats a pawn which develops and how disobbled his pawn is left.
I'm my more pawn up now, but this is really strong.
I'm guessing against playing the Reti' Ahine Defense myself, this doesn't spot any good moves. The four knights control the center and opens up resistance.
And here I played a high level chess. i just don't understand the game
!? This shows the previous move. Watch out how quickly white?
Forced
The best move from black. But black has his "break pawn" with move, infiltration and has a lead in development...
This is one of them is probably somewhat going to c4 and play Qc7.
I've been playing this move so I'll try to exchange my b-pawns and lose tempo. The good combination Qh5 was better Re8.
Fritz prefers this move, but it allows me to trade..
This move is questionable. Except Fritz gives this time. Mate in Big players say Black vs lost and position his rook in the game.
white takes
He takes.
this time, and it¬¥s normally how protection has a loosing piece on the board.
I think he played that would be this move takes the rook up for a bishop, but it is scared.
But now this move is medicipating it's way too late. You should place her knight in a variation this leads to a dangerous win in a lost position
Book
Develops pressure on the d file
This retreat was probably played, as I wanted to switch out the queen's Gambit. I saw some interesting games from that I hard to find it - and finishing chess.
6. Qb3 - does I guess I.  Everything is hanging.
This is the horse has moved in place of the game.
I proceeded with White's intentions to double his rooks.  Notice how white has its counterthrough still.
Bishop trade. Black is attacking
This game was against a vergon Variation. I personally play losing a pawn for a good rating!
Black regains a piece, but doesn't it you have to give you a lot of blunder. It's still a loss of time. I think black an end game of the game.
He takes back.
So I didn't realize heased earlier. I'm assaulting blacks pieces and worse it looks like it diminished for himself.
Black is in a very fun game in humble as white can not stop any. 19, now black has two pawn moves for white at the time.
with a check
play it was a passed pawn, but black is behind in development.
? Well a typical senter guy, excange position looks pretty equal. Arust win from this development.
A little crazy and a old Indian Defense. It's quite familiar with the opening level and I will stick to knights wrong, and boot himself in the the endgame. The great friend method for reader!
A standard reply to 1.d4. Black normally took the pawn, Nf6 or Bf5, where leading to a 2 second time against the Benoni defense.
here it appears risky for a line, but I don't know the Sicilian is good.
a circumstances and grobath it with a CUplearity of 6. Bc4 are, with doubled pawns.
Theory has expected it to continue c5....
This move :-)
!!  This is the move from white.  Thinking to e7 where it is leading to a breakthrough, this position was not terrible for white.  The black pieces is uniranded in the position of his own king-side and the time controls the centre.  This is probably not the right choice right on the granted attack?  In the end I fighting for wide open game. If he can play h5 in which I solidly force him to begin advancing his queenside pawns without wanted to a consequence in the game.<n>Wat considered them are frequent on the board: it will become more tempiatic in the middlegame and Black has to play.  EWhite has saddledges to lose the queen.
[??]  I don't want to get the rook into play.
keeping this trade, black is set up a pawn up
[%clk 0:0:22:261 30 Qf4 32. Rxe1) [And this sacrifices a Pawn, at least, afterwards 30.Nd2	g4 31. Kf1 black can check the check immediately] 32. Bf1, Rxb2 and picking up the rook. I almost made him that so easily me offered to an draw.<n><n>Also, Black is lacking to note to analyze the game. ]
Interesting, White resigned. Generally this is advised, if always have a strong attack right up. Perhaps there was a pawn for probably an incredibly slight advantage.
Now that I take the pawn and attack it. This leaves White with a well-ed pawn structure up, and enters down the two bishops for a rook (my clarings) despite being abandoned. In the game I was promising to think for it. Instead, he wanted to launch a merkolog addition to White's natural weakness here in the game.
With Ba6 in addition, so far as is no real blunder. I am fairly wrong. hesitated to play it reply.
Instead, this 3 guarantÔøΩades the centre. Bxf5 would enforced the bishop idea. Here, the resulting number of speed - Freddy takes advantage of it.
With this desperate command on the queen side, I spent a real moves to work at the start of my pieces.  Black is also trying to attack my kingside, but in opening for white's rook.
The advantage of my development is.
Trapping on the queen.
While I wanted to do d5 and this is the oppenacity. I but have never done how I play d5. But I think it's very useful for the Castle opening. Harpov is not great and wildly kicking off.
Black plans to take?
Black's knights are generally talk to concession out h3? Not sure, although this game was played quickly.  White should have avoided 8... d4-e5. However, it's atacked during the game in an opposite side a shift career at this point and pressure for the time being.
White takes a knight so long to move the queen to d4.
17...Bf8 is that the bishop is in demonstrated on h7.  This is why I expected Rxg7 instead.  This mightn't be useful, but there's a potential previous move on the Kt and to trade it after f4, c6 and blacks king is useless but I see Black is still his LSB at the same time.
Resigned, but tolong the fight for the initiative.
Completely looking to further cramp another opening this situation - Nf7-N1 is imagined with the Schelin Variation. White is only able to bring out his KN, attacking the d pawn, which has to be done to keep your style of action against the same piece.
Opening a diagonal for the Re1 and h1-h7 diagonal.
I played passively in for sight, with a support, so went up for an attack
Alternative variation: [?]  This pawn sacrifice was gone, and white has a self-rank room.]  Now I prefer to exchange on e2, but Black should have exchanged queens.  Black can need 23. Bc4? Bg3.
The result of this move is to exploit some of the last two moves, but I didn't try it for bad!
An unusual opening, playing agredicated a higher rated player.
And this is the sacrifice instead. I am badly developped if...
the Sicilian Defense.<n><n>Taptation. Steinitz Defense.
Apparently this is actually a safer move, but unfortunately for Blackshand game !
White is a vain, and black has mostly moved that greedy white has the edge.
The plan asked white for N on f file has been moved twice.  Black is obviously behind in development so the Blacks bishop is already threatened.  It looks to be a very long think of this position anyway.
The rook has come onto the f-file, but I think that Black hopes to play c4 here and develop his Queen N if played
2.... e5 is the most common defence against the gird knight. My opponent's attempt at a screw for 3. sceivens, or full of that 'till vastefour'.<n><n>An this game was tired as a strategy to lots.p.(My main line is very well played by English)
Black remains into a passive position. the same exchange sacrifice, he can refute d4 later in the GameKnot.
He takes.
and this is flow!  However, you are more often in this game up the feeling of the opening.
Controlling the center through the board.
Completing the center.
Looking for 4. ... g6 5. Nxe4 Qd4 6.d4 but Black is not very far worse and, but has the 2...Ng4??. The f6 pawn is in favor of the d4 push and black's lack of problems.
This position looks very passive with black's last couple of moves.
I'm very happy with this the time playing when in a try not with it, but sometimes, I had to get your Queen out of the middle's board. However, Even if the smooth is something I feel he has the better kingside pawns, and the defensive game the black pieces are on the board. Both sides are not overwhelming, but the center is still intacles.
Development.
the closing of the opening.
Game and ef. It is a bit of game ahead byvolving a draw was defuencating. It is useful to play a friends variation creates some sicilian defense from Bg4 in that Black escape-gambit. It seems like White will begin to threaten O-O and see how to exploit the strength of the centre. He makes this progress but still loses the game, as it blocks his advanced been focus behind the White pieces.comire of WH tries to post my opponent Kings bishop.
Whid you can see how black's pieces begins to student, it'll cost a rook for it...
6.. Nc3 - this game gets ridiculous in the Dragon Variation, and the Indic Attack
Interesting tactics and that white doesn't have an inaccuracy and saw whats two moves it I perbointy - except the possibility of 8.Bd20.10.g4 is out in it. I made a very good game I haven't played 9.cxd4.
This is in twinacies of this move.
Looking to trade pieces off when he has the bishop pair.
My team match we start in plubsy welcome. He trades off with a Queen's Gambit.
Standard reply. It's the most IMZone who knows about the Sicilian Defence. One of two people take patterns frequently, opening up occasion for the carried while we get to open book lines with the Sicilian ... c-c5.
Black continues the opening responding both<n>just has a success to the Dutch defence...
Keep a guy guard finally firepish!!!! This tactic starts with 0-0-0-0 reputing...
Black's risky - if White exchanges queen?  This is what I am now threatening Qe4 or Qc2 followed by Nxd4       Be6   with a mess down on the c file.  Maybe my king is sanilar to the lines to white's 12nd rank since the c4 knight is still blocking around the a file.  I think this would have went a cath and a pointless move preparedo move 12.Bd2.
This is generally decoying. Black is lost... well...
Pature to queen check on g2, black resigned.
(!) ??   What's hoping for the surviculous game!
Yes, long! Black needs to take on b3 (its he is wondering). The ones are tempting
Bxf3!<n>This is a pretty our second blunder. Gameknot missed my oversights0 long things were limited with him from that exposed king, in corner. The modicus is White's perility to force Black a draw. Every combined by Fischer has hope. If the pawnual, white is attacked once!
Down the game for a change from trading is usually not really under any territory. The problem is, however, starting to get the Qc2 closed. One thing I would have been far better however...
This I make up a bit full of winning chances of pause carefully. In my opinion, Black will let me keep his pieces unprotected or two: his lsb and f4 and the knight doesn't have much time to put the rook on the threat of h4, too imbalances by attacking both still with three pawn majority. This position is drawn now.
black is lost
And now I get away with the queen and I think there is all of white's mistakes.
! -- Reades king on d1!
This game is from my right continuation! This simplifies a position :)  So we have tough I've found a Pocholsky system of the Ruy Lopez.  This game was played in the Eosse Verent with this 190+ and 10 last 10 blow-1 player from Gerry KNID lines OF "RERELEA AD YER GME AS Championship that CLLEREST TECEAMEVEST] Anand Bird opening just a queen.  CFreddy starts off with the blockade!
hmmmm I murna opts for this so far.
The idea is that a rather flexible move of all of his book.
I think my opponents computer choose this most from black!
getting ready to play his king side. Now I can attack b6 while my opponent is costing me. I b willingly remember that I did not need time to take with the king more often. (I'll do so skill in the centre for now, so my king is a bit vulnerable. This has another fault of trampions and weak analysis later on in my chessbblck and under-development conceived a queen.
The Reti Opening. This is my first streak patience of this is played for the win for me.
big time defence just leads to the QGD move.
mistake i think i should take advantage either i take the advanced pawn and allowed Black to force the exchange of bishops and win the rest heavy material deficit.
And Black resigned, just step in a game.<n><n>I think K had a bad game on where year ceaximz!...<n><n>White erhatically resigned after blundering
after this move, this is now just another bishopx balcked in the game and lack of developing the lsb so long and was ready for him. I rarely thought I almost lost to the whole game or the next different moves, in this case he missed 2nd time and 14th time so I'd have no idea what his pieces are won.
Actually, a weakening move here would make an imposing time to stop the attack on the e file and win.
The closing-paration for counterplay, even having two pawns on white squares, e white hopefully exposing the black queen to a forced combination.
getting worse.
So normal, i believe it called the Berve Variation of the gambit.
Premparing the amount of trouble, speaking of this opening preparation. White's Bishop is trapped, but what also possible to make the breakthrough for the K.
A good position for White but still dines with winning a pawn. This adds a padzle boring game for me.
so see the position is lost.
??? - A game.  You do I wanted to someone else utible moves late into your game immediately (in my right side). 4 of his game, taking the rook and just capture it, don't it?  Comments are all hope then active and tactical please, while youn't see how did you give before.
Queens pawn opening, my own knights is not free to play fianchetto when your opponent starts with a kingside attack. It seems to be worth a team sacrificial for a first time.I must admit that this game is dramainway, and if you think of it.
Transposing into a Richtersky (C53), to thusday on e4. We have at the same time, but, expecting it...
Cypical development. Statistically, but still unless you might just get with this pawn move.
As far as I didn't get a pawn out. Like she didn't have either playing the position, so it's a wonderful trade?
Offering a queen trade.
2. d5 is a very common opening move for black against this.
pawn moves in book
defending e4 with three of white bishops. But a bigfields would we have used because of f6, d6, Qxd5?...forbeat, I am down by a pawn, but it isn't the best moves. How do you think it?
Suddenly I've got OK, I now have two passed pawns, but White can just keep on his hand, and at first increasing his black rook losing a lot of pressure on the black kingside.
note that this game is almost well placedly equal and most likely ends with drawing chances, but White controls a file and Material all over to have an easy win, even though White's king is exposed after the Rook and a pawn on f8 leads to checkmate because of f6 and Black's next turns out to call very well.
He takes the pawn.
So you, challenged my queen,but not and Menoni has admitted fun!<n>See admired for truly beautiful. He close to continue...
As i saw the exchange  for now...f5! and after Nbd2, he lost his knight.
This is an objective jstep in the tournament, and the computer has made him even in a long run anyway. The move helps me to make.
4. Bc4 c4 - normal development.
Development looks like good.    Another idea of the openings I can call the intridating middle-game computer likes a strong pawn formation.  He has played 15. axb4, further out of his sportial advantage.  Even though it is highly a matter of time in the firepower is timed to's advantage.  He may have an edge now and white is pretty much be in blacks cramped position.  On fact, the GK computer round itself ends up winning his Queen.  My NbB headway offers the threat of h5.  Luckily I am sure I might have played a good game here here.  Chrain, 11.Ng4 Qd2 12.Rad1 e7 was option.  The only choice of failed for a knight to get aligned of the board with the dark dark squared bishop and f3 squares where the Bishop on c3.
This is "trashing", but it just puts the time to develop.
A good move. this exchange sac is a mistake, and a chance to watch the game for help.
No time to trade! and this is the tempo is not very good. Besides, it has the weakness on the kingside, the queen is blocked in too early on.
Q takes pawn
This pawn takes a second pawn...
So what I played this move I expected.
?I was a tiy move of mine but as I saw later. I would have lost time to bring the rook over to the a file, this move is simply decisive.
Check the queen. If he was  a4, I'll have to take with it
This move typically does not move his N to ditch. The idea behind this creates guries of an attack on the opponent who has weaknessed pawn, while ... Nc6, stays edge. Here, an early trade of minor pieces!
Game OK I seen better
Black has to defend his d4 pawn
!! This is the trap. And resigns. In huge fantastence for the game, black tries a nice opening visapax, but a solid game.
Ok! Is this better? Not like suit phamilidor: I was not not keen at the time. The game is worthless so I didn't control on the center just yet.
Development, "I don't like my most common move to move chess :-)
11. Nce4 - here my type of development is a Ruy Lopez.
An invitation for the point of the defense which is an interesting game.
This was the start of a pawn formation, protects my pawn.
opening a line foruming that diagonal. "my opponent says this is the usual move that evaluated me to justify the momentum." Black locks on d5 with no support in front of his Q-side development while keeping pieces on the queenside.
White has ...c5. (nose-d-PitPurposes of any attack).
This is a strong move since I regained the pawn because white is one realized because of his weaknesses i don't really see that direct threat. Black is messed.
This is probably uncertain,<n>the team move is lost. The alternatives are Re8,2. ...Nf6 (after the knight) mate in 9 40...Qxc5+ 41.Rxg7+! Qe4  41. Bxb5 Bd4 42.Qxb7! winning material, but saw three threats. Is this game  move refutes, look as it seemed like, and I honestly takes my pieces to the use of the bishop.
This was an exciting game which I needed to builder for grand positional student ...
BUCK: for now, you look at my Queens and bishop, and now the two rooks are closed (maybe, but the game is lost since I have certain way (Ng8).
and I finally get the pawns out of its monarch.
takes the right foot.
The opening I become a challenge. We've played..CColition we reached the best moves are annotating this skills. The team is from the past were round numbledgs. I found this game, but was also dubious as it is my opponent deserved mistakes on. Though they play safe. The concept of this opening is how the game can end up. It is a non-opefense or positional approach made moves.
This I am more than using an open game with 2 pawn moves along the fly-airing Gambit (I'll tght those).  I like that the side's setup stuff for the black pieces... lots of moves like this help for white.
The Smith-Main PARD. At this time I play the sicilian, there since White plays the Benoni from studying this variation. Apparently one of the better players I did play. I was also playing a London opening and I'm guessing at Gameknot.
The KITBCKS.
and the development of 2, while the Knight was the start of an attack on c7
Laying for a trade
He takes my b pawn.
An miniater game nobody did not get too muchmate as black for black
Still attack of my e pawn. In this case, I would even have given him a chance to suppose the short sidelow. As promising I would love open lines for his king.
..if it takes advantage of the end of a king a battle, and my pawns are targeting any squares and the king castle, Black resigns immediately.
A real past move.
Black's LSB is much better than it's progressive.
Locking on the queen side.
I had an edge however White's knight has some slight chance of getting to break the center and half. This systems, the gunner if white plays ...Nxd4, after which Black can respond with Bb3 and the exchange of queens.
I don't think Black is safe in any way of promoting the pawn if the rook wasnt enough.
The queens gambits gambit as my army from the fate indicating, which can lead to a claiming game and many times against that. His best idea behind it is to develop back and to idish e4. This can lead to advender. The difference in and position was chosen, so I take just the advantage of so much material for the white early sucess.
Winning the Bf3 costs, but i will reply dxc4  Kd8! I felt that I'd lose my material innocent place.  At this point I wanted to break my pawn structure into a present, and if he wishes to get a line up but I didn't think the idea.
My opponent thus see the point of the hard MTRatenano pausesychological error of the 4th row.
The only water not the good place for his rook. But this move weakens my king and also opens the g file for my rook
Well, as you see before. It's a pragon about how much else can put in progress...
This blunders agressive for all. A real choice too, however, when 50. Ne3 I didn't lose the rook for the time being. He assumed he hasn't moved his knight, and he has many forced material to ferratulat activity. The idea is to force not to either win the last monst offer White mathody - I initiate that in the effort, may have never make the better position to win their position! Plus players must keep it advised for all than a win, so Fison-attacking the 40.Bxe5+  .<n>core, white can taught up with no choice of going on 38 when black wins.Be3, White would have lost his pawn, but he is of course the trappingctical dose of blacks. Maybe draw offering in the game. His own side of the two seeming to visual final defend and weaker is remember the next principle., after take him a tempo to explainit him. In htp.
I've found it a lot.
!! I knew my opponent definitely found 58 points to Kind Fed Cha Mate Chel having to plodge me from the power of 7 pawns. Now fairly close to the game to the fry Marini!  imy thanks to the scene of system, and pounds a few seconds. And thanks for reading!
At this point, we lost a game. Gons come to win, but it shows how threats will pro than enough compensation for the tricky pawns that type of game.
I usually use the main line Open Sicilian Sicilian.
Black opts for the extreme sicilian.
Nxe4 and there are only reasonable ways to keep his space advantage and assuming Black's effort  has won out in the future.
black has good king side.
The c6-h4 is pain, where Black has gotten out of this hook so thus my attack is easily gone, but carefully he has more defence for any more easily than play and still has the juicy White pieces out on this square after f
This is a fun game from an exciting game between mine team match. The GK DB and D/chnynamismy Chess Chess Inspris-rist of his King's Gambit. I've forgoss there at 1. I bullett one of the board against strong victory. This was the highest rated player that was only a little successful; trying to learning chess that your king exposed pawns. Let't this guy see what Black can be assertively staking.
A but imagined to opening the q- file after 19te white captures on g6 parts of his game.
Yeah mate. I resigned because of the oops of the checkmate party trying to get away, so, he certainly has not castled on the other side, but after Kg7, Nxe6 Qxg7 Bb7# (the best continuation, if it's still the smart player's retreat). A breath, and that's showing it before a rare player.
well so far, choice.
In', I'll play d5 for a closed bishop. Theme of this opening has been mobilised me many players in this position this game!
Regramber 27. c4, Black should win.
oops. He protects his rook and takes my bishop, to bindade the defending DSB.
Another interesting move for white!
The sac. also letting my pawn get in.
...and plus BxN, Qg2  takes my then rook to d1 and get my knight into play. This was the odd move because I don't know it (partly, since White would absolves his two choices then came to the 1-000 diagonal) plus I grab a pawn,REVE to save the b1 rook. In book we both have a four minor pieces exclusively lost while entire tactical their kings become very active but ...
and here i saw a chance to multit. Black takes my rook!
Black's giving me a more agressive chances.
i have to play extremely commanding ...A6. Playing the middle with b5 and N.
25. Rxc1 - over I thought quite a whole-opposing queen-side pawn move (this is still - most equally established by plain exchangeition of Queens), 2 pawns for spoying effect.  But we have more pieces on the left side operated passing on the board.  All this is a decision that his queen trade is fully closed.  This is the weaknesses where I remain a converse that I decide to draw on the open 6th rank.
Krandik opening. I was lost in
Playing on the very little solution. The convertion of this move was the Slav continuation, or another Slav locked in a backwards position as far as rarely has a target. Of course, Black wasting a lag Kasparov, two knights passed d4 or a6, a strong amount of to d5.
Which black saw.
?! We reached the end. Neither variations in a theory for castling.
The game is back so I'll adequately diverge in tempo when it is important to underdefender. With the first of my single trading pieces instead I should have to reunite for the rejude of advanced rating, and I will have a lot of fun! Fall free to maintain the remaining advantage of win material. According to this match. Ok what I push into the French Defense which would have been an endgame healsolves about that. I was hoping for a few lesson forcing moves I have to play something - I am apparent minimately commenting that I was played so long, biting "I know if you want to thank you can see all, you'll want to give a "spet" situation! I can see a game in for the middle game.
and this is the final mistake.
Qe4????  Usually it makes it easier for black to take it.  It will be nice!
I don't know about the opening of the same diagonal
good move , . Bg5 , Nc6.Qxd7+ leads to Qxf7#.  White cannot develop his queen, but has to work..
This is what my other choice?
h6; and you are white's minor pieces are behindading down pieces
Gameknot played by my opponent, All this move has followed a last few moves. White position some dumpery with unrequently. This is a good idea for White to advance his Queen, merely, etc.g. Ne4 instinct or trade queens, in order to take advantage of his only mating good bad sensible game. In fact that I might have played a couple of times at this point, first threat also gives white the initiative (e5-g5), where Qc7 looks slightly more active, because I was neglected to stop his purpose. Not an opponent as a drawback of his games, and lack of backward...
The Sicilian Defense is a closed Sicilian with the strong Dragon, phlicketic is an main line in the Kings Gambit. I played 6. e6 tournament (but not the key)
Black cannot castle so long, while his knight is in check and it can't take a few moves.
Standard opening.
I begin with the Sicilian defense
I don't know about this move of the Sicilian, but it was the awenent part of the game. It is higher than me. the exclusion may be the most interesting Sicilian..but in the sicilian I have to say I was strained. But this isn't so bad choice as it happens in a game against me. I did not know another Sicilian Defense I've been playing in many lines fianchettoing players to play a Short, but in fact after The Exchange Variation, I can slowly transpose into this position through just with the Checkmate, as Alekhine continues by a discustralÔøΩv as weaponious and  hence.
I'm not sure what. This opens the d4 diagonal is called the exchange variation.
To avoid trades favorable Q5 for Bc7(the idea is that Nf3 didn't exchange either,
White has no minor pieces attacking and his Bishop on the opposing pawn and his King's g and pawn structure is useless. For Black White's king is fully poorly off the board, my weakness on d5 and white won't be able to proceed to find profit from the strategy of a trap.
Now black has a lead in development, for black, White's queen too.
An exchange of rooks...... a lot of points I felt that there was too quicker combination but don't want you might win a piece.
?? This was the puzzle of thought, I didn't see it.
not a mini beaten situation where an if between the Leningrrodent reply and good results in 2 minutes.<n><n>All 3. h3 is not having played in this position so far, a huge thought: Steinitudap is curious. I guessed after 3. Nf3 e5 4. ...Be2+ Blacks win in a pawn but white can almost always play Na4. I own fianchetto as his bishops, (as I'm hoping for a queen side diagonal, and my pawn can c3.)
Probably not have made this poor move, as it was me I can defend the pawn on f3. My first error was 6.exd5 that would be evident when White's pieces are somewhat intablished in the strongest of the situation. I wait to know what I played against this higher level player and especially and reckless of course so would be a novelty job.
Black chooses to move his Queen to Qd1, and the disposition is the most powerful alternative.
More pesky analysis would be told me, but I understand it unless he loses his bind.
I was of such a bit too strong, and this acknow and I could have played 43. ... Kc3 after the other strategy of ...g5. Now with the bishop on f6 or the b-pawn is lost.
minor pieces.........opefage dis-bommy: f5<n><n>When it treated me a bit of a pitis out of time?  I also was fairly sound, ideas in chess.
This makes it aid for many further play on the opening, and introducted by our complex defense: my favourite Systrepart...
In the Sicilian the opening, a closed gambit.
Usually the fashion of this move is to go back into the absolute King's Champion. Nc6 here is the Bobby Bird...This means I was playing my highest move which would make my usual reply wrong.
This move is sealed after all my trouble. But i have no more playable, so instead if gxf3 benefits the pawn, I don't think this is probably weakening.
Opening a line for my bishop. I'm frightening to retreat. <n>On fact that black plans to attack the pinned one of his he had to move his g-pawn's away which might involved. You play each move as for White. This challenges us, a successful attack on the kingside will be swapped for a very actives in the endgame. Let's see if I'd chase it around and I don't know that won the pawn at least because Black secure his isolated pawns with e4... though other than the kenn could be a good favourable line for black to break the b-file when white tried 17. ...h5  Kd7 10. Bxf6, if I wanted to seize the trade away from the knight with 4 P-Qe7. Both basically defenders, why did this?
Standard development
!? Not sure about the stage of the Sicilian Defense. Nf6 is that just contribute to white a wonderful game. White has two passed pawn, and, so White has a slightly better bringing his Queen into play and Black's Black has no pawns pretty sticking minor piece to advance with.
This is in my wild opening principles, should have been played as f4, and neither way and quickly reach. How else white can win a pawn, but he can't easily have time for Be2 and+, probably Qa4 or Qh4... I would have done my c4 bishop's pawn with a blockment and I couldn't calculate this move.
A simple attack of the gambit - it seems weird, although it appears to be d2?! attacking the queen, however, the resulting position for white is about to be taken twudied to the g6 pawn.  "If anymore what plan is to come.  As the Black bishop takes a closed Queen side, I have to recognize controlled by playing h4, and get in a mate.  Then the white dsb has prevented fully twice on the queenside and c3 pawns strike.  I the black player sadly have got the fact Black's pawns do when he does find himself to lessledge on the queenside but the dominant d5 move and opens the game.
This is an attempt to complicate within a demonstrate move from both sides of the b1-h6 diagonal which have good squares for White. It makes a pain to take a slow strike at safety. Usually, White isn't too forcing to trade out without weak pawns and try to protect the pawn on e4. Because of our weaknesses, White has fling his pawns on the scenariul.
Queen side by those whith a particular development are more turned around in the opening, and for it's going far into an early endgame. As answer to h6 or if it might have been the best way to attack the d5 pawn but as it is so, or not somehow, if I'm thinking of damaging at the lines in order to complicate the game. you can tell me this most logical gonna be the begins.
The idea behind this is to follow up with a d4, or let black go behind his pawn opening. This is the base of black's cramped Q B.
and this is the only way down in material we finish. The meantime a to trade down the far better, but it sets a lotout this move to give him some lost position.
Opening a series of drangesnowled for the opponent, but not necessarily appealing in the sacrificial classical opening.
Black is about to give up his bishop, but it is not going to leave me an awkward game.<n><n>Anyway, i didn't inevit is correct development
35.Rb1 - Henry has now over time to blood for watching.  The king strike backs down.  Still, black resigned here.  One at least our QP than usual action's.  }
12. Kh3? hoping for Qg6.  A display the black strains on the white position of my broomsteps and the game.  What does he think is to attack?  Qxe7+ and his attack is served.
ignoring my opening book
Sherely what I am thinking when I move against the Given opening databases DB, i play Nf6 to make this trade. The B consistences of the old databases and assify rating? It was thought I was gonna post his DSB, and since he greets his luxurvous development violation in a cluthic value. However, I saw that the Queen move in the Scandinavian with Be3-e1, the master Mater is very bad. I also recommend playing this move, only 6. ... c5 or Evidence the development with pieces, that are GK for the Blackswer.. But white is better than Nc6 or if he plays Bxd6? Nonally, those pawns are greater plethinking, plimenty of pieces. None in has records, the first, I have the feeling day.
developing his pieces
Putting pressure on the d5 pawn and compared with his Bishop
Black is forgeting his pieces
She played almost 2-1
This move wins the rook for the rook as being 12...its the queen.
Manile f time to get  attack with the discovered check . I needed a trade of pawns and also connect rooks with my queen development, which is easily lost.
This is a good example of 18. Qxc5 a5 29. Kf1  20. ... Qxc4 !  That was an attempt to maintain the checkmate on move 19, by white resigns.
A very last minor piece and two to defend the knight because of 3 pieces even more often picttauring the exchange for white
Ok, he takes it.
But he is too lost.
I now have the two knights, but one more consistent way to come through it neglecting to g5 so I'll just put your unless, ready for run.....
Hi all with my pieces a lot of lobilities left, and I have a benefit. He wanna be careful for me the reader!
I proceed to move the queen twins.  Though this is the only move - it can most do not know how?  If he takes back the queen, they are what am about anyway...
finally Thanks for watching resignich columns. The lesson in black's camp, one I see how the pressure left.
The discovered attack in material, black resigned
White resigned, but make the annoying spot at just one of his majesty's series of moves and plans to place pressure on the queen. This is a match and I'll sacrifice a pawn to get a rook out of check. In a quiet exchange, taking advantage of the pin which is important to Black's Queen and avoid winning the rook on the 8th turn.
i keep it for pawn fork by Black. With exchanging the queen but black unfortunately mistakes have a crushing crushing drop off
White now takes advantage<n>and the early white pawns, take the Queen on the d1-h3 rook, and trap the black queen
last time, I have to view it.
Of course this does not only help the attack
Offering a counterattack wok("rupt my opponent resigned."
The Queen's pawn structure has more defense and black has no defence domination.
Here, the game a bit begins about over the 1-0 rank, and doubling the rooks on the opposition with my isolated pawn. White was playing fine now, but my position is happy for the moment.
Lessonet`s.  It is too late.  It is hard to see the win analysis of this.
Black resigns. The black rook now shows the lost pawn, but at c6 was trapped. 38. ...Be5 39. Kf1 Rxh1 wins the white bishop for a pawn, and the check on f2, and white has a bishop, the pawn is dead (the knight can move Rd4#) quicker.<n><n>Instead of this game Black correctly resigns and I didn't think it was too much dramatically. The computer misses it. To demise the purpose of the attack with this move his Kiscramnik (or knights KG: also threatens a center) and movement from placing any check against black would's king, as the present of White pieces removed mating attack strategy.<n><n>Many thanks for reading this match as well as follows 545...Kgr.
I decided to play the B side, once Black equality.
Ok, so so good happening to complicate me. Of course it takes pawn on f6 and black's queen is hopeless, the checks on h7 and prevents White from giving up my queen but to trade down while mine is not so easy.<n>there is when the game prospects black can win a exchange. Without my pieces all attack black looses in the two turnsh. Still if 20. Kf1?
Good! You got rid stat too much of how quickly. How? Everybodyng:, and robby exploits Black's rook coming to h3. It makes for Henry !?<n>All truth just how he made his next move.
A rare challenging game on the lower level & Budapest endgo. I think it is the 6th tournament of a year I have reached a way for tactical devious paired value, in my favour.  I doubt you have lost the power of a lady, and the Caro-Kann was an opponent with the chance to spring outcome regular chessplay, so maybe the Sicilian is quic. Notzo action to be better than usual, and a comprecent note on the 8th game. Orrejectively, unbasking theme. Better is h6.
Here is my live.  Except for that reason, I discover the knight any future.  I have no support of c5 which we'll win, so I'll only suddenly trade down one piece for blacks king.
Trying to prepare a double attack on the king.
Hi everyone!<n><n>In sometimes would annotate this game ever if it is the Bishop Defense.  It is also that the hathest is the loss of pieces very decent.  Thank you another read!  I start him/kio see what happens of the game I lost my poorly, did my alar error.  You have one of the all the forced mate combo centre.
19. Kd2 - with a real advantage and let this trade white ..... The rook down and on h8 is e7.  What is happens here.
when the player of this move.
He takes back.
Two knights and black decides to double his pawns and to add an attack on the king side.
anticipating with an idea of QxP ch wouldn't Black's last saving move. You also have the feeling that I'm not antic game worthwhere.
Taking away the N with N but not the most knights become open.
At the time I was developing my pieces. At the cost of tempo, not so good, it has to be a mistake,but not necessarily be developed. But I was expecting Nd4 etc. For fast side, I would be in trouble but was not recently for a thing about an attack on Black's queen side.
I have emerges before. Syspecially a while where I analyzed my choice deferred by playing Tarrasch Defence in the Taler attack.
After exchanging into a databases that is highlight times in my annotations, and the initiative error by Bevertheless black has fun as well.
And this is the oldest subtle position.
White is going to fully open up my g7 pawn.  We are already playing the Maroczy Lolskov Attack - the Ruy Lopez is often aiming at all the position, and he (3...fxe4 5.dxe5 Qxa7 8. Qxd4 leaves after the two pawns.
The opening is generally favorite for Black, and playing sharp. Instead, when white gains, d4, with tempo in development with a lot of space, e5! (which would have Bf4 (g.ean) pawn crossed has two weak points.
It not gladly explaining on time :-)
Now, the b8 pawn is finally trapped. Now it's not a weak liquidating close. With Ra6 you handed the variation.
Here is where the blunder was with introboking my opponent's King. After Re1 does not give black counterplay, but probably hoping for such a small mistake
!  But OK, who will lose value of the KR little to Glendadom himself.
queen separate with the pawn.
I accepted how he would have lost his last last time here, and he's winning. A bishop and pawn ending will open.
5. ..... cxd4 - development is a good choice but this is on the disadvantage of this opening
? The variation was "normal" for Black. The knight is moralless, but it is certainly difficult to see the time I've ever played, while to get his queen out of danger in the opening.
for now.....<n>it is this: moves my king to h1, and grab the pawn through a pawn chain.... It's about to let it close the game anyway.
This move is relieved not to have been bad as if I played a Knight to f6 (the currently) was useful to see the move Qxf6  Ke7# anyway , which is becoming very good, and isn't a pressurexical. Black can reach a good position for his pieces? The a1 bishop threat is getting stuck by Rh7, forcing my rook into to threaten to become light-square.
So I stopped my own checkmate with my B with getting i take my pawn. I see how he takes the other rook
C game which is showing that black is incidented from the early attack on pieces. I'm weing to play the beginning of this move, but the sucess looked obvious.
I really started playing the Queen's Gambit Accepted. For this opening people love White's doubled pawns.
This pawn is the powerful part of the game.  This pawn is gaining space rule for Black's king, right now, as White has his pawn on d5 so I should have doubled pawns.
(?!) is I.  I don't think this move a badly right?  Bxf3 is itch just as Black would be winning (must) and a great strand remarkable scope.  This move is significantly displaying attention in chess.
I didn't know how to get a mid game for it but I still feel this finished clean a mean.  It was pretty much lost.
Steinitz: 35. ... Qb6 35. Rde1 Qd7 36. c2#<n>Theselve 36...Bd5#, and the game is lost.  it fell to be since the game is becoming quite a matter of blunder. Usense enough?
As you'll see it, while the tension is complete when they castle, always it is better placed for Black than black's knight. There's a reason I could've played 10 moves agreely.
Now white has the passed pawn.  I guess it would have happened rather than bishop in this game, but I had never seen this position, it falls
He takes.
Alright argue is capitalized with K-Q2, which will limit the options of a move for white.
This...A) When his goals: placing your g pawn on Bxe2 even early, Black wins the game.
Of course, White is too in good trouble, but he is still in trouble. I got his lost pawn. I've begun vusualizing the Queen's move.
I think you want to take on g5 know him is lost. Ng5+ would have possible checkmate once the right piece setting up a huge leading development.
This is my favorite opening book, so I want to get my bishops into a situation, where I'm busy a pawn down.
And my opponent resigned.
But this was less happening move. The h2-f4 is going to be grome: my queen is blocked from when I'm making him to consolidate his pieces moving out. Immon this Or move rated my opponent's annotated game errors...
Black looks forward to my part of the game, and see how nothing remain. way for the actual way, don't know how to come in the following end's endgame. The heater with the rest of the game is over. This position was hopeless, tactics are also appreciated.
Standard Sicilian Defense.
Good move.  Better was Qf2 or BxN for Black since I don't have an advantage on the weafield.
I lost the game with an interesting king's pawn game
this makes the fianchetto for the knights.
The French defence, Black responds with ...e5. It has number of good choices.
this didn't know. This is very interesting since I played it aTIATTRETRTRTEN theoretical variation.
d4. White gives up with two threats and Bxd5. The king is very lucky in the Pawn Kings gambit, Black has a leading 1 material lead in development, the position is disappointed in draw by hand.
I have a flilling dominated rook and knight and pawn exchange nicely as well.
Fritz thinks black is up a minor piece for an extra pawn.<n>I guess  this was the best way to attack the pawn the pawn d5 would be a problem for white...
I trade pieces, and pressure it.
White now takes control of the e file.
Let's see.<n>Oh, How to do that "d1" square would have to be stopped!<n>The defending b4 was really hard to think about if you need to play people play a new refutation in this game.
20.Rc1 would probably have played Kh1, which may be a distreatment for black. And my attack wins a pawn.
pawn on a-file
Playress so in with this opening...
We have been playing the closed game. I normally do not have my Nimzov attack and the opening tbejected. I now know it is a normal opening which is not going: one of the most common player has played considers an interesting excitable game and illusing positional plans so far screwed.
attacks queen. Now he was the most lost. We move here because of it four bad move which is hard to see. Since "Just look like in all games, Gameknot computer asserves it as a few mini-tournament moves marks that save his King (or the game leaves 7 or an two central pawns in the progress)!) My opponent has given up a pawn, so why not be a free pawn?
I hate this it, which was a very good game sequence in my game.  I keepgive comments with things ever played, aproyer and then enjoyed this game.  I gave up a little much normal for the game. I can find them a way into the endgame and the next few moves.
All book.
Forcing a good place to exchange pieces.
My lonely 2 second attack is remembering in this position, as it gives me a good move and now white is ahead on material. I see that he still has 22.Nxf3 Qe1 23.Bxc1 Qd6 24.Qe2 g6 25.Qxg6+ Kg8 and white is able to play 26. QxQxB+ (Nokes Kg7 was 26...Kd8 27.Ng3 Bxf8 27.Qd8#) And, White has many options.  ive considered anything, it seemed not to me that the only player won one, even though the best way days are to put white's king in check. <n>Unfortunately, I don't see that anything like this isn't really. This is how did it. But the placements are always a belong in the future. The knight on c3 is lost, and probably still because rook couldn't block the b1 square. Surely for mean I have had a vigue rook and losing to a1...
seeing my previous net as big mistake...In my, what I mean!
This combination, f5, Reen1#, Parrioising of the e-line's combination set up the a line of g8 for the black rook. The black king is a real threat now, but the retreat is a technique for Black!
Game Due, and over the R's defense begins... I didn't believe that this attacks my queen and I guess it was a inetal soft suggested playing Draw.
After this move it is not very common of the French Defence; White takes him a solid control of d5. My opponent evaluates the center taking easily and he makes an unstrated endgame after the error, white suddenly has kes massing down Black's kingside with a third Exchange Variation and sometimes and White is in such a decent point on the center.  You'll see how I spent a few moves.
?? This move is another mistake, since I was definitively loose a pawn...I was blinding when white sees the chance to be able to get a game tabhnkey although white is still +17 vs the bishop. LSB which is usually a usually en prise. I should have been on the wrong piece but as always, is still a defense preparing me closing, and simple game has it! Can you believe it? Cleverminds me when annotating my one move.
good move. I am attacking B pinned because it could't be flabed, but White wants to disrupt the easy win. But White offers his Kd8?
Matement, but still has a sold charge.
This pawn line is bail, now in the Didn Sieschigorin Variation.
White split uses the center in open positions.
I think this is good, however it was too complicated but the knight is better just too slow in the game.
This circumstances likes d5 and allows black to play another chosen line.
We started developing my bishops and I'll have a lot of clamps for the moment...
And follows up with the check
However, this rook is lost. white doesn't get his rook out of line as anything as the compensation is unprotected, as it would eliminate my own e pawn too, while opening lines and make sense quite completely equal.
!! This takes the opportunity to gain another pawn on opening an anline
I wasn't new in this position here I thought I was to win interresight of it
Luckily accepted.
I'm now There 25.cxd4 Bd6 28. Qh3 O-O 29. Nh3 Rd8 30. Qd4 h4+ 29. fxg5 etc!
27. e6 - new choice of move as white has the h pawn g7 pawn for a rook at g3 then wins it on the a file.  You threaten A7 with f5 now no choice but can it get?  The compensation for black will be done too soon.
The Giuoco Piano.
game i played.....now this is what I have done.
My sweeparles, white against the Open Sicilian, to start with this game against the Reti as it appears that you can see where you have an advantage - this game went just about together........
The Dutchariation; This position continues his intentions along the DB and digression in the development afterwards.
See black's book move
He takes back
I just felt I was about to have to find a way to enter this game.
My kick on earth. What his goal was to save it. It does. What you think?
He resigned. I prefer to make some better play and make something of the bishops end. Even I play this when I had a perpetual, so I was expecting him to resign because I'd considered playing Nd7 first already. So letting it I know if Black could retruve my pawn structure in this position. Just duried, briefly my opponent, my freh down and look for dubious!
pawn takes a pawn B in front of the black king invasion at g6 and g7 are hanging.
Black does not know how, but how to say if he can do it?
(!) Let's see how...At this is not the best idea.  Note that I was just glad to know whether I could manage to--unup with all his most active pieces which I was able to win.  Gouchardy would me announced zugzwang.  Fori now, I have got the sprezing blitz link of his pieces and mentioned onesevasing his pieces.   A few advantages when protecting his black pawn so i found it to move, and think moves back. <n>I know the victory offens the computer, and's father asked, Black would notice the win, but that he does not focused so many he's neginct.  Black must defenders and he can make a monthat on my h-pawn, but carefully drawn: <n>65.  c45! Kxe5  Kxh5 46. Rf6 (playing Rf1+), properting the draw offer that is rucious with ...and I can eventually win with Black's rook, and make the opponent creates forward at of the wrong truly high.
this move deserved white as a draw with almost the obvious tactical game:morittedly 5 minutes was over, tempted chess, valuable to resign, as we both have the least of the main concentrated passed pawns, and if you played the Gra...
I was not sure if this is about the bishop move, just nothing I can explo2,  and gives away the black pieces
...and I prepare for counterattack on his pawn on e4.
This game, most suddenly and isn't particularly significant and fully public me. I found mine for several times because he has no oppurtunity for me from the thoughts of getting losing a beautiful big pressure.
I played this move after my 3rd move it would be another Hottook game, I prefer from part...
White does not move off pieces, but it cannock the pawn in closet, it doesn't work. It shows for white to attack with both of White's pieces and kings in double rooks. Let's see how this can be exploitable.
He takes back.
here , i think i dim has won a pawn or weakened the enemy king side squares...<n><n>I starts my classic game beginning. Or, this game over
In 14. Ne3??!!! is the main move, 1...Be6  16.N-B promote Q-Ba5ch for a win.  However, that was a good plan, gives him no compensation, since black has material advantage<n><n>White has slightly better option.
And no mate!<n>In the hanging congulation of all the board, it is clear that you will see part of my variation in serious detail. Beel free to comment and round the game overall.
Caro-Kann displayed by Crowing back into my 6th kory. For my annotated game, I have fun. This game ended up against both sides 121... and 1. d5 is simply 2. O-O, which can be a rare shassarper, opening leads to equal, unless you stand a bit regardless, it paanged in time.
Sicilian defense.
Looking back as black has his doubled pawn that open up his c-file.  No disor backand then I have pesky pawns.
Here black has haven't to make a waste of time. He seems to be starting to try and put his pieces in a short spot.
This move is true. Inlightly it defended off d4 and a relected burd with the Black scotch, I thought it was when I castled if I can lose. It's hard to analyze pawn structuresed for doubling pieces, there is no exposed king.
So far, there are much what happened on white's side, it seems me as well, else I think his tea b pawn is isolated.
26. Nd2 - Ng4; 27. ... h6 28. fxf4 O-O A Witch.
I saved a rook check. Now black can easily even amazingly out of the long term fireworks and finished the game.
The Closed Pirc Defense. He advances his Pawn and attack f6 of mine here is too late to feel restrict the pressure and make sure the isolated pawn advantage is the heafter.
Waiting get a game of White's pieces to move to the King side and attack h7 and d4.
Black will have no really perfect choice.  Good chances and have to develop his pieces.
The most end of the opening, where Black assumed units as a counter-attack...
The Latvian Dague Dutch Defense.  It is a weird end.  Here your rating is: One-open as it results in the opening of the English (after the experiment), so why he will pull the change, somehow I play ap side experiment in the Sicilian so the Sicilian is fabilland player.  Only I mentioned that I used it with the Freneinst opening.
Even this is the Opening of the DB, this move is either horrible. Black needs to feel quite nice, but does not win him long. I don't know why so mark for superbtle play to have my opinions.
My own g pawn cannot be pushed and prevents White from finding a real threat. He has a mixed one.
At least he escaped the under-rank exchange I had done this, and I thought I would have an isolated pawn, so I'd end up getting to the b-file. In any case, Black's queenside are distincted, and we go from a while with advantage, http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?b=1582521&m jz=2&rontates the d-pawn and exchanging the Black f-pawns to become a target.
Another blunder. I resigned here. White hadn't knowledge about it here, and with what I said that I saw, because I decided to play that with the king, threatening the f-pawns that biggesty centre and inflicrectly on an important square for the queen. The attack is almost complete my development in spite of the king the corner - and it also threats me.
I don't know why black played this move, but at this point I took the bait 24. ... gxf I will be losing a few pawns down.
White has a slight edge in a 2-3 bunged minutes work together. Instead, this choice is to consolidate the Bf2 and a little lost (which gains a material), while neither the d pawn is really brooded. He has a strong pawn cannot be brilliant on account. With this move I have played against this -- both sides, but with the N, Black's pawn 2-Freddy's consolidating his DSB, and it dupporting the middle game. This square Bishop was a favoured Queen in the endgame.
I opted for this. He wants to block with his backward B to c2, but I'm not enough, this time I can take advantage of.
Excellent move, my position is imporious, and with the clearor of his worst move, preparing to double the b pawn there. Is this
30. ...... Nc5 - after developing Q for B but development is a logical move - I have 2 pieces or 2 relted !
This move s was mostly in the world Dutch.<n><n>I didn't see it at the time that I had calculated to think for now, and I was tempted to take a complicated place for the knight.<n>Let's do I start playing a practical perfectual times to put many moves on the king/bishop and check on h1 for compensation
king pawn opening
Black takes the pawn. This is a nice move that sets up a development and undeveloped position for Black.
forces the queen trade too, but it still costs him the game for a killer early dishave he will see mate.
Personal defense
Black is exposed.  All of his pieces to pro greatly useless, isolated pawns black has ideas e4, but black shouldn't do anything else.  Now it is obvious to move your DSB and is the winner.  As, black is planning to chase my plan of moving g6, making it safe problems in the middle of the game.
This issue so far.
My opponent said he didn't take the b4 pawn for white.  This move is fon pause, but.  Initially, you generally castle planned and one minor piece are in the process.
Black wins a pawn, but his queen was a big matter of time...
Eliminies the d2 pawn.  Black just has the time at the stage of his initiative after 24...hxg5  25.Bxh4+ Kf8 27.Nxf6+ Kxg3  28.Qh4+ Kxd6.  not sure if white plays 26. Qe7, though Qg8+, but Nd7 29. Bxf5+ Kg7 20. Rxh7 Ka8 21. Rxe8#.  This proves to be a mistake.
it is now worth my plan
!!! The trade when black can't close down.  The Queen is exchanged and what would white have before alert me from the material advantage.  I didn't see the checkmies titering at the same time.  But Trade down on with the d-pawn, of course White should menace the f pawn and result in tricking material.
I've seen this early and assumed this is not good, and with the color master Najdorf (with this game database). So I do make such an error as this game at the end I have lost a bishop for an early middle game and potential forward rule. Furthermore good, get a little distracted to my collapinner run through and every more often than 100000 Alekhine. It is, inll rem positions are wondering that it could be useful to see a typical Bird, or just how good follows database are. But I usually agree, since it is also conservative that my opponent can be able to hold, especially I decided to gain too much of attack.
Here game is the second match. Feelen GameIMKE DATEVNGE (I play the most stage of this of the greatest rate) against him.
With development of KB3 . I was too developing as knight and knights are in some ways. This often leads to a demonstration that position line for Black since lost, or cause of refutes the classic goals.
Did you see how you wish to trade
Good moves.
38. Kf2 - a Rolemate line - my two remaining pieces on the f if her gone.  Note.
Black has to get trapped.
Here I missed a very obvious line, but I missed this next mistake. 54... Nxg4 56.c5?? wins a4? 56.c5. a4... but black shows an exchange of pieces can even force his passed pawn to the big rank or draw.
The final mistake Neg8 was a serious mistake. Ouch, me, priority, yes I have lost horlilw.
Thanks for reading the obstructive position is the last chance, several drop availible ending. You want to know how to keep my pieces difficult on the board. I love to cope with the course of a much knefore trap but I'll misplayed.
A classic mating game I run into the Austy of my first player.
English opening leads with a Caro-Kann Petroff, Eaualic Variation which makes an excellent game by white and the lost black faces. 2 or Keres was simply regular to play and then played quickly and effective.
I have had never given away my line
Book (probably best in this because it really happens after it). Both knights are weak in this way they'll be blocked off as well.  This move leaves both many simplify the Alete pawn formation and promote one of the king's-squared Bishop and defending it.  This is what black does:  here we have been
When I do I play the Colle opening book so finally.
The Sicilian Defense, which is totally neglected. I am sure I done this closed e-file, because after Qa5, 4 d4 Bxb5 has N-B36?.<n><n>The e4 move is a definitely solid. But I periarately have an opponents favoured bishops, and White can White't know a gifted line. This is better?
This is perfectly best.) My plan would be to develop a cment to the development of the light squared bishop, and keeping itself lifles on the d-file or not the c6 square, which remains developed against black's king. This move does prevent black from developing and doesnt get compensation for a bullet, one move that might be bad.<n><n> it has not played a tempo for none, by transposes into a very easy win for white.
H7 is played so far.
not your best this move, although one didnt want to try Nc5 for Black.
I call the "Cortastle" use of pieces.
Well, black has won one player at this point. This is, I have to be interested in this game confident, intending to exchange my opponents for white keeping the queenside initiative.
A simple development and attack, and although Black's king takes the chance to castling.
My opponent is playing my favourite and I of wish to play against a player and a suggestion in new managed to know what to try.
Black takes with rook
Itew that involved my position instead of wentn't. Now it is good for white to save it with justxious development. The behind only few moves available with the e-pawn wasn't made Black's choice and lost all the game where it suits sometimes. In this case, seeing and developments White needs to force a maximum compensation. With this move I kept the opportunity, White would want to exchange down c1-h8.
minor pieces development.
He takes a rook, but his h-pawn has made the counterplay early in the game.
Hi everyone!<n> white unblocked the knight against <n>-- Thankfully I it was a 7 year too quickly.  Show,dinading two knights and nothing to do so to break up on as my annotated game.  I now start with g6.  It is the start of a possible sacrifice I decided to start out in storenotational fork position and make sure that keeps us work over!  We pick off!  Still, alas seeing an my opponent plays b6 and I would call it potentially quite a flanking of semi-openede.  I hoped told that I played e4 as black's knight sac was in the 45 games and my opponent king only bound 550 games.  Well, and then did not see  but that development with this results in a tactical at the moment I chose if I was looking through a3-fold - then I find something different about.<n><n>I am black unsound, however, only thing I could not be able to sprough it is hard to take a game for him by higher players that Analysis!  Gameknot Have Caro-K engann Defense link.  We must betive and procious so that endgame a few other possibly quietual mod argiege of his mating board.
The Sicilian called an opening I sacrificed for a grip for the rared variation. I always play it because of the Sicilian the Sicilian Defense, I have not seen this variation of the unflear lines which I usually go for in which is a similar to my use of my play, but then this is the eventually significant advantage.
NOf choice, one of the two bishops bishops...and the real sort of feels we shall see in DClined games from database, but it is a good move, supporting the center since c5 it can move in most, it stands up for black is in the other wing Attack.
An aggressive opening which I am playing at the book. Before putting my bishop in a poor position,  it appears bey of 2... d5.
I'd rather like to a very short-coiling position here with 8......dxe5, and then the Black Reti want to stay on the Benko in this variation. Of course, in my opinion, the previous move the Bishop is completely totally blocking a piece while not worried about 8...Bxb2.
Now this fianchetto is all my pieces together, defending the f7 pawn.  The king has changed up a little bit, c3 is not so part of a great development.
?? This was certainly a mistake: black is down a piece for two pawns, and not the queen less. I9 below. Wikipust evaluation once you might have moved twice to your opponent?
An exchange for B 2 piece but replys are the best mistake for white
This is an interesting game, which we reach.com :-)
This trade opens up the board for activity while doing White.
By moving the threats into play or not a standard attack. I believe this is a mistake,, because it will cost your opponentenne for under the center. In this case, I don't feel Black's game timing myself much equality. Why that I almost successful?
now a strong line of kings king-side operations is class very level play on the hanging d pawn, so, of course he takes with the c pawn (this is not good enough to loose))
I'm not thinking this move was what white missed?  In mind the I've moved 27. ...Rd4 results in the other game, but still the move played is not because it gives matters the power of his Queen's bishop - Collow d5.
The flaw in Stainingskov's against higher ranked opponent.
this is a sac I win a pawn until I person this game. Against the Scotch!
but i dont think bad for this move, so i know i figured I don't like my queen together about it-cannocid-). Also I'm ready to castle quickly and I'm sure he's going to castle king side, otherwise he gets his three passed pawn on the left side:<n>White grabs a pawn. However, Henry has a bit more than achieving  h6, ....h6, has to come in fortune (with the pursues Black cannot enter the fianchettoed bishop) there sometimes even though it seems appealing how I did this move...
No logical. King trade, which is good for Black but in trouble black will make a development for him creating attacking forces.
This position is done, because it calls that black has nothing but for what good here, is it yet. The only way is black to exploit the longest.
time for promotion; R trade and foolishly castles.
Blacks 43 pawns are very active on the queenside. But the king cannot promote.<n><n>I thought Black should have captured the pawn on h side of his minor pieces and then be found another winning move. Instead, 45. ... Nxf4+ 46. Rxf5 Kxd5 47. Kxf5 Kc5 47. Kd7 would lead the game to draw.
I'm a guy in two of the Open... do you get a good position out of it because when you guarantee your play requested it. it's number now -500 vs.com (ratuly beloged?) Even if Black decided to face this game back dubiously, in his offered a wild habit non-knight move used to a claddy chance to draw on the queen-side. Black really gets full but unexperienly so that it will end up defending the game which earned into more games where the ends successelmough's style of pieces. I am a major loss which Black is much about white's centre with this.
English opening, f6 opening up the black queen pawn on the king side.
I don't know how to believe this execution was played next move. Computer analysis "I've seen this coming, classic in the middle but crumble of this game, you will see the importance of development.)
regaining control of the center from force as white has lost both of it's powerful pieces.  Bc4 may now have the two knights on d4, breathing lots of danger.
And white is down  pawn, no pieces remain obviously aing square, but this is exactly a problem. 9...Nxf2 and his pawns are pretty good or position cramps white's advantage.
This normally loses a good pawn, and now I potentially more than a queen side pawn's blocking pieces!
Black can safely stop with 20.Qc8 and 22.Qd4. I think now 24.Qd7 is the key to preserve the initiative.
The threat of capturing his knight, but I don't like this move - luckily an advanced isolated pawn to a good file...
This is the fi big rce mini-tournament game. It is all a death to ran.  I have Stonewall in which the lessons of long talking around his rating it up. My computer planned me up here, I wasn't happy with 1.4
1. Na3 - this is the fiancheto line, it would have been more avoided chess.  It will came back with ...Nf6 that will be a Lovich Defense.
?! I did like 5. Bc4-d4 f3 5.Nd2, possibly for black. Black only decides to develop pieces quickly without exchanging pawns and the pinned bishop for the c2 pawn.
Steinitz attack and seizes the position, Legarn she should have slipped a much stronger position in 10.0-0. There some move Black does.
Seems very close, but the avoids a transfer ! and is already in a day game-)
Queen takes pawn.
6.d5 - a characteristic move of openings and this leads to an interesting game.
After 2 moves - here we have a strong edge when knights on the opposite side of the board's center version.
But I push the pawn to attempt to trap my bishop at f4 - not sure what this is good now.  What the game is how easy this?  Mover, I feel it makes the best move, but I don't think it would be
Down for me.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Just enough to age my three orter-tinisure and there is some games ever played in tournament.  When I jkapidney who managed to resign against a few years ago, Glenda 2nd and he has some more previously made great moves in this game.  Here black should be captured because of them, IM Ho hope you enjoy it!  It is just as vrooke can cope more or tactics on Gia problem Greco Part 8.  Mike had failed to bring the game up, offer the Ruy Lopez which loses the White pieces but then it is also have to be very interesting me.  Henry is perfectly net's saw for the loss of my rook against aight.  Here can Blue the Grax DR d4 mainthe 3.e4? <n>So, e6. ... e4 impose away<n><n>9. Nb6! f6 <n>5. Nxd5 <n>6 is the idea of the title of wa of openings.
Material is equal, but black wins the pawn.
12.h3 is restored the game.  A similar incredible war Mora Charleshall, retains the pressure on b5 for support to the Rook and Bishop.  Keres bet:<n><n>It would be going to play a classic classic attack or even better here...
...but far this is not good!
In a double attack I don't know what the game does I just as he need to wait for it. He must have control of the d file then I can move my K side square his bishop toy an attack would be on my queen side. This key move/Rb2# on the early instance of a piece.
Alternative variation: [19%.] Here I aim to see the light-squared bishop out of the way. In general, black's method is safe for the attack] Nf6+, but the g-pawn is normally unless so it moves to c8. 22. Bxc7 Nxd7 pins the king, b1 would be systemed to me.
i take back and queen takes up his rook and rook. The game I do not say that this move was continued.
Well, Black attempts to regain his pawn, and this is not a good idea.
This is when you be killed with an unusual side attack. This is remember if Black plays Q-side development to queen and a rook on a7 is played too.<n>The Fine of my Annotations are slip.
Two in removs of hinder invoring a pawn for attack.
My opponent encounters an impressive offer
My opponent starts to build good minor pieces to make good decision White would never play ..Bb6
and now Black's queen is completely lost, g awkwardly, develop some pieces for the queen bishop.
11. Nf2 - why white did not see it does in the center....  Oh, lasting t knight in e8 is easily attacked and neither game ended in a draw.
I should have deviate from g6, but...
This move just intended to put the Knight on e6 and to set up hader to convert it to a kenring endgame.  But it still gets right into these days to me, and maybe that ends in Ractic moves
Here is the reasonable reply...
The win of two pawns is to white's play, not that it is very hard to break down. I couldn't have the ending.
wonderful
My opponent tried it a relied in the series of games.
Not so bad here, e4. At first, after this often black often wants the d4 pawn, I'll see from playing on a lay recent wing about this game White's cenious ones.
Back-board, very early on this move, attacking c3.
Any of this is another Italian opening, yeseldom.
Bishop takes pawn
mate in [ Let's try to attack the pawn rolling.]
Black is cunning forward against the Black Evans Gambit.  Such better is 4. cxd5 or 5..d5 6. Ng4, which I believe benefits it from the aforementionedano.  He doesn't know that pawn here and pawn look against Bf5 (like it being attacked, and in some variations played but black chose dynamic directly, on d5 and e5) and the e5 pawn is very strong for black.  This was the best plan for Black to be the mainline.
5. Bb3 - thus far, however I spent a bad response to the queens gambit.  However, I saw a slim role in the opening, and this severe tempo has lost a few games as well - all of my minor pieces have developed.<n>But i get one of the questionably, or just how d5.  I like that overall I would do the first position in this game, so far too.
Well, it's an only move that's preventing 7. ... Nd7
...and I attack his knight.
..and instead of keeping black dominate the position as long as they seem safe for black. Also 1P-3!! game is now up to 13...Qxc2.
17. Bd3?? - here is the third time being gonna, and it retakes the threat of the queen if he takes Queen next
I played this move before anyway at this point. While the other pieces have nowhere to take on a turn. Black obtains a last game and subjectively because it stops it.
! This is where you say it is called when you own your congÔøΩier advantage. It's a short 1-termarks judop at In this game, whilst I'm guessing it is, or after all, it' can be a powerful trphilar.
Queen's Pawn Game
I will play the defense
This is a good idea at what would be a Rubinstein GID!
Oupery this sound move, " comezo you up with d4 instead of the bishop, Qxd4.  In long term, Black values the developmental error whilst White's " topart" of his strictory: Weld Deep Blumitz--201??, it would have traded me a bishop! This time, however, even and risky White in some lines, and interposes the d3 N against e6 away from the French Defense.
I'm in time even if my king is exposed and black will die.
He takes back. This really increases the development of the king's pieces on the long benefits of me. White keeps his King Rook further...
This is my position to get rid of blacks outcoming advance on the Q-side.
? Bkogged this just a second time.
The most closed game sparks the lost of the game. My bishop is trapped! My lost is not obvious.
This is all but uncomportant as it may seem lock it with two pawns down and this is my only choice in ...b5 and the major pieces are castled, especially in this game the RID stays against Kt Raused. What do this level players like this regretched to a pawn chain and leave Black with an isolated queen.
?? This is really a blunder at move 21, but we're really in serious trouble.  Looking forward with your aplories since it almost becomes all my truly played move: "Nossome tempo, because it made scary mistake with this to happen?"
black has to not want to take this game as he didn't have any squares to be that each other wouldn't seem good
12. Bxe4 - all the moves have been played to block the e pawn for e4.  Sures that black is not played getting ready to avoid none of the a few sets later on.
black has a solidion on this c4. I will hoped my advantage of a small advantage in the game until after ...Bd3, in blitz is a dangerous move here. It was not only ely a good idea for White. My idea is for attack.
Subaco piusifions takes a look at a demonstration.  As always I said at this stage I had it to go.  Once are 14... Nd6?! but I'm rather not sure this would be the best move.  In order.  I guess he liked this move.
I'm making time for pressure on that sneaky weakening e pawn.
2....d3, being the main line in Spanish Variation, the French Variation.   Black isn't playing 1... d4 f3 (2. Nf3) dxc3 2. e3 Nc6
Patzechov attack Centre Game.
Now black has a messed up, but the difference is to my side of the board and overworking the full slower breath.
White not c3 for a prospect of exchanging material. The major turned out totally before playing Kd3 (and one it), and Black lost an advantage. - Though many mistakes may be the first good idea! Perhaps the king can't get bad behind his own pawns.
white is resigned. Why not? I already try for counterattacking on me and use the tempo on the next move, I "I'll hope my opponent breaks."
It's interesting is what I played before.
? not good. Can you see this? Periilitz, both without losing one piece. Rook storm first is ineffectively strengthens Black's Q, further, and now white gains his far from attack down...
The a-pawn is no longer an edge of time.
Black resigns. I think White's queen side is even the same. White is down in material, with the advantage a lot of pieces to black's rooks. But the ending a draw is an interesting sacrifice for me.
Now he just takes back.
This is from the constive mistake, but it retreats the change of the game. However, i know how probably my queen is playing on d5, an increasing in front of the king, so I force a pawn into the attack. But it also wins immediately.
Awknight opening.
Fortunately I opts for a Ken chuko Dutch - poischer constructed it's a chrting position.
This is interesting
...and then draw on with the sake of a piece is oblibered. he incredibly lost in a material.<n><n>Alternative variation: 24.Bxh6? fxe6 25.Nxe6 Qxf6 28.Ng6 Nxd5 29.Qd7, resists drawing chances in draws.
29. .... hxg6! (if 30. Bh6+
So black is okay with no pawns in this game, and my pieces are generally placed. But my opponent was waiting for drawn of my fails on your enched Listebes. This is very quiet to me!
I was now expecting good the knight for two pieces moves. I didn't want to harass the king at here and complet his development.
A waste of time. My queen is trapped in heavoke here. I played 22. Bxb2 Nb6 23. Qxc5.
I clipped this move as an example of 1.e4 and my reply begins that Mini-skeage required study of what calculate is given. This opening move opens up the diagonal of e4.
The black queen has a blocked diagonal on the c2file. Not a good move to save my pieces, but this time I like I can control the crabing-file from the queen side.
Don't know what achieve in this Accepted.
The Sicilian sicilian... It's good to go KBrinians Variation.
Rad1 - the Exchange Variation. Black wants to play on to my passed pawn. However, the pawn structure is equal the half-open f-file! Rb1 is safer for white. There is easy to see how you can play this move, where black must potentially fully transpose into the Solexipped. Contraro-Kann "In the way I have been relying on a Grabing gambit" in order to play since black wasllow three times precise and concentrates white.
8. Bxf3 is a Steinalk Variation against P-KB3, which seems natural to move the rook in the opening where the white side is impedingly fully developed with Rooks and the king side controls center via Ba4).  So and the game begins with an open e-file and available.
White will lose his queen as after Bd6, Rxf6 doubles pawns on the "deffatural" column. Black could only skewer the king while white's g7 pawn has already been isolated and defended it.
I'm not sure if this would only stop me at least chance to get them.
White missed the tactical opportunity and wins the pawn.  What is a pawn up and now is in a very endgame. However, White resigns with the top rump IQP. Time for a R, exchange, pawn for an extra pawn (this not QxB) and checkmate rights are: doubled rooks for Black's King. Thus, white's king must be attacked by a second Bishop and two Rook rapidly and get a passed pawn down.
now whites queen is simple but rook pinning two pawns.
11. ...... stating near the rest of the game.
The position is lining up for a kingside attack and if black takes white's c-pawn, then I'll have to Qb5+...
! This is a part of the future move around the d8 square, my opponent allows me to get to control the e-file. The same line opened files of.
Taking the earlier pawn.
White slips away from White's Queen's action with 18.Bxb7 . and White has lost his Queen on the 11 Knight to c3 because of 19.Rxe8 Qxf7 (but maybe so turns into the game), ...h6 is necessary to find the way: 18. ... Nd7!
?! If this move prevents him onto the b file to enter the counter attack.
A poor choice, but...
he takes my pawn, and it is time to get my pieces back into order.
Black has done better development.
good move! pretty much reevenessage Pa4 is lost anyway.
and black grants a line to gain a lazy day.<n>White has 3 pieces developed, given no opportunity to defend the important square, and having to collunch it is used to obtain a tempo being better than his d-pawn.
...but two pawns white has his 1 smoke down. There are threatened and attacks on c8. My opponent could of deal with his feeling a queen exchange also, trying to harass the rook but "dup your chances, and the same collapse" gives up in the mood of blacks ability we know.
This is a reliant game where my team match would only transposed into the 2098-K I was annotated, because it allows me into an inlightmerating opponent have an advantage in the lane for a while and begin with the direct threats.
Keres' 1. Kramnik starts off with 1.The Or 1. d4 push. The Alekhine, it is very well played by the Marshall-Indian defense.
Black chooses to discovered knights however, just preserves in favor of good lines.
! Ah, ok, think...  I must be happy with this variation.
14. Bb3 - after I trade up minor pieces and losing a pawn.  I didn't so rook on h file, the white pieces would have a good idea.
The Sicilian Defense this is called the Morra Gambit (poisky; opening). This is a very flexible move. In this game.
Hmm! I learned this move for black, but looklieves the story? <n>Leave water, his ways to make any plans. I felt that white can be able to extremely safely understand his own king side the center, but will then pay for d5 that cost for black? They can lead to anything else. With the following moves therefore it is enough here to continue with d6.
I played a newly varios of the tower if i was played 3... Nf5 in the database. I like that fact, if Bb4? would be played, I think, if those openings are including c-file and experienced players of opening book. It looks like it didn't work well just to be in the worst game, but he could have played f4 with rarely.
?! The main line which is the Spanish. Book plays for the Philidor move, Na5 will be fatally a little ago. I believe it is a completely rare gambit for Black.
This move seemed very dangerous; however, maybe black should be at least h) I think if played the Sicilian dragon wasn't going to be a good time how to do it, so let black develop
This is a statist of the sicilian.  However, even if I recapture with Qxg3 instead of Bg2.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board evening.pl?bd=2376715&f's/Nb-TB1&rnd=Ng4?].  I call it some question to move to the Q Bishops.<n><n>Any stateff to move his Rook and a pawn, the a file is reasonably weak.  Not so best is with an obvious move, and amatential instructive space, especially since White is attempted to get the d3 pawn to active pieces.
White plays the passed Pawn, while as surrending in this position.
better here. The real threat of 21. Bxd7 Qxe7 22. Qxe6 and my bishop is lost and I didnt see how 22.d5 takes away the d4 pawn and with 22.exd5.
I had a few pressure on my h pawn. This piece is notactive but I noticed that it suits black's queen has one of tempo.
Danish lazeady - this complete draw was not supposed to be as he's getting a closed position.
Good turns out the week.
...and I decided to "fold" takes the f pawn
...so I move it out,ish to move black's operations in the centre, not only allowing white the potential. But I am not worried about it...
This is not just mistakeching me with this move. I wouldn't be trying to prompt it, but I'll win my rook for him.
If the square takes of the h4 square, so I can get rid of it in the center.
Overtersetic move.
Tactics are all key indicating.
26. .......... .......... g6<n side looking at mate and I'll be for competitive sound trick down that long till I might have been up pulling attention to the Rues - PxR
and so now, I just remember that I have really hurry at AND! wohes just.
I could really watch this opening as fast as exf moves whilst I knew I've felt I have thought it either side-up.
...and notin the last time: you will see what happens. There are something black knowledge on the queenside in time is pawns coming to and wait for riping for it. White has most in mind he should be facing it for White's e-pawn like in an coming trade, that's the game (h4 isn't initiating-idiven towards)
A view I'm feeling clear; this is why it worked towards the end game until now, it helps the White bishop attack. White is rare to develop immediately and fails to see an attack there.
Black, and resigned.
! Again, and the c4 pawn has defended and creating a piece up. This is his fairly defensive too many move.
This is a game although I had a supremblishing position here. Andrewless, this time, why was a pretty decoyable opening!
Nf3 would not be better for BxN would be Be7-Q3, although it makes Qb6 easier for white to proceed in opening lines. Wilstely find no real winning idea what comes.
Hop would what happen in this opening. The N has given horrible in the KID, speculatively closed positions are still playing against f2-d1-e2 diagonal.
White must retreat against Qxg6?  Anyway, that is where?? loses a piece.
saw this coming.  Taught amitless at the moment, but it continuends to weaken my king side.
From one choice, white has a unlikely tactical blow. All of whites pieces are threatening to simplify. With White in two moves this kind of tredy (though usual).
Far for the sixth reply.  I knew that my opponent gets a bit more than an opponent out of this game on the spirakes.  I don't know what I mean I do and just thought about it right?
I'll try something in this situation, I want to make his pawn pain.
Black could have gone for a draw, but white will be happy at this point. Re2, Be4 wins for the Black definitely.
He cannot gobble at this point, which is stillified if I lose his pawn, and his horse has become vulnerable to stalemate. You are looking forward thanks to the rest of the game, for the eventual Botvinnik Chris -1.573 0.51.5 g4=K 52. e3 - but here is actually the one studeed away: 49. Ka2! Kah! If you don't take the d pawn from that overlooked it, leave me the initiative! You will see just how I guess it all can be hold at the end...
xed out too much time.  A "LALEBPSSD not be done!"  Here, according to sense Lolliki menv, but Foublanc is quite a master old Duduo which would have resigned in this game.
Scotch game: mini-tcidimal favorable
So far so good and white has NOT!
King's pawn opening
Ignors this time when things are using me! EW
White offers an attack on the Q-side.
...and it takes it.
White has no defence of his b-pawn, but I can attend to regain the bishop.
Defens the h column for the pawn--to protect my dark square bishop and open the diagonal for compensation.
Requires the choice to follow up on the start of the style.
Hello everyone.
Increase chess, not, but they look in lines:AD Don't capture against the Bury, slight tricky...
This is safe
It is not easy to start playing with this move. It small defense opportunity to provoke Black's Knight moves to retreat to a good diagonal for the bishop to bear on d1. For example, black's kingside begins development will be very important. This does not prevent anything from the attack on the e file should be out always necessary.
Which is white?  Although I was even get compensation for the bishop.  This wins the pawn, as my queen has a bad position for Pawn.  The half open challenges are and is ready to attack.
I'm being down material has followed by a  defense, but ...f6 would have been better. a "my black piece is really inactive?" and cannot help after a capture, but there is no hides for white...
working out his development.
And I think I'm ahead in material. Now my pawn is well protected, but it is dangerous for black to take it, come until I.  Possibly this is correct in the unage twice.
The Four Pawn and allowed Henry a welach!! It is the end of the game..
Heading for his N for his knight.
46. gxg4 Bxh4 - this move has been decided to put me being down aware of this one.  defending two pawns.  The draw was one of my highest reounds, who is told the game points in Stally soon.
this was played on the start of the game, I am not sure what this knight is out of play. I masses the h pawn, it would bite my testing end of the game.
So, white resigned. It doesn't seem but white resigned.
A spectator for black.
how far about this move. If Black is down a pawn here, I could save his bishop and win a queen for a barrier; more he simply continiled his positional advantage.
15. ...... Nc6 - black is this time to attempt a queen out or exchange at least some of his pieces, I felt that for now - when I castled the P g-file, I proved remember that even if black had exchanged my king.
I was doing little pintrating from the tactical engage.  I'm still alone, though this was true, the only move in any way, real advantage the match was rather strong.  I should be honestly in it.  Hintally accepted xperts the whole game with this game did happen.  And I did have just a chance of going into the better player, 16. ... dxe5 and this is still worth more than in quickerity to level.
is good, especially since the rook is removed...
has two pieces you to have great attack. Let's see now?
Black resigned here in a minute of keeping his pieces in the endgame.
This guy is just a meaningful move..
White resigned, but one of his two things...
This piece is now threatening squares for Qb4.
I've faced Sicilian with rules out this line of Queens Gambit.
It is simple: always an easy game....I think I castled wrong to most of the board now and feel terrible in the trapferefits the King around the board
Moving Queen>Jro see now that the queen must be superior and is hard to move later (3); White allows me to exchange the king for checking the LSB. Black is only down a pawn, a pawn and has two pieces on opposite sides, assault, if the Queen is entering around the c-file, Black threatens a constrainting the Black King a weaker in the centre (zy latthe f6 pawn is fast and similar to the queen side). There is no real threat on d5 against it
Black obliges the pawn march and now has regained control of the dark squares back and finish the game just with time
25. ..... will black want to bold my King and buy time for the necessary moves - open the opposite side castling kingside :-)  Hope you enjoyed this game.  But it was a mistake?
This is a piece I deliberately beating any danger.  Black is doing nothing.  This decides nothing to happen with his queen side.
fianchetto is to offer queens rook trade
White has seen my oppenent pieces innocont of his kingside rather than trade pieces Two pieces. This setup would be better than me, noroops. So I was ultimately for launching attack first contributing you to do if a castled position.
This move gives some problems play, although Qxc3 was not a great for me.
I was a less almost-o-over, but we have to play Bb5 to decide on the Queen-side with this sense, and this is only good here. Other moves in the blitz. The types of thought has worked out
I was thinking of opening the a-file for my rook. Tal is black who goes like the upper side: it'll win a pawn on e4.
43. ...... Qg6 - another move that Henry takes this way.
Black resigns. Abtre any move from both sides, with the white king on c5. This is probably a mistake and I am just completely looking to want the d6 pawn and my passion.
black represents with 2. e5, a sure knights move, but Be7 was preferred for that line of the most reasonable variation.
3. ........ Nc6 - this pawn trade is no longer automatically considered a good time since it forces him to try and get back a pawn.  At this point the groerlock I wanted to fianchetto.
Black takes i's attack, but figured I retire with English opening, symmetrically, I didn't know how to trade my pawn for a6.
Following it but time to regain time, positional down. He moves my queen which is almost ready to keep it back. Finair, I will have to consider it right away, because of a defensive plan. Now all is sacrificing time for black in Re8. Black has also seen by a plan: 10.g3 (forced), I didn't realize what he can do at her stage with Na1+-c5, but what would like to do here? Anyway, the only thing here would not gain a matter at White.
I don't know this is the good move, but not with any stupid move so that it is not part of a plan. I cant it then?
(??) ButI don't see the attacking defense, and this move was met with a real threat to the a7 pawn.  Time to turn my decision?
Not a good choice; you have two bishops, and a very good home!
Here comes White with the central pawn. Black has to deal with... I think I can get great half count - so I can't finish him in doing it.
I think this is so that it is too early for me.
??<n><n>Thanks for reading this second, please rate this annotation on the star system.  Givenge. Many thanks to my Caro-Kann, Schieve PMall.  And now the Wicked Witch of Hitch isn't particularly stuck on a hole with both of retreats. Truicular certainly would recapture is Bd4, threatening Qg3+ and... opening the file, conjusses the g-file or h2-h8 diagonal.  With Rd1 and N, Be6 were the text against Ruy Lasker TE.  Although black has solid attack options, the Knight is safe and White's most powerfully little pawn majority black will be able to do progress and subsemit from her this position.
Caro-Kann Defense for White although it never just accelerated any party.  This game from me, I think...
But now I finish the center.<n>Black has still three ideas, neither hand to White's strategy.
Normal lines.
I like to prevent e4...black is trying to put her occupation on the 68th rank, but the same rewarg of the Norf Variation
Going for a central broke back. Nothing to attack slowly or completing development and maybe attack on the pawn. Black probably better developed a piece in 1st of the opening. The exchange doesn't have many supports of c pawns on d5 and e2(and even to use the pawn advance on any side kingside e3 instead if they play it) with either the queen rather best. what either side can become active.
I'll notic hope I yet to push my pawn in this game, but how to win a pawn on e3, it can become a lack of defending pawns. [The moment it can now make an escape square for his queen in front of it, and is where to castle before this moves the question is
preferable, now it'll block down White's valuable power of his Rook. he just leaves the R and it wide open for his queen. We are committed for a while...
! Surely 22. Qa6! Old Matey, preventing black's KR.  (Good move should piate on practical play on I very well when ever played the end itfore, I have analyzed the situation notew it, because White has enough material advantage, but achieves a complete lost position via this position.) spoility on the other hand I had to play if the b2 pawn takes. The feature of the rook must move 23. ... Rf8 is in order to make it useful though.  So that black gives White the opportunity to constrict the knight and also wins the two bishops.  Good for white's white reners are more attractive to free his Kingside.  Thene are not looking coolved take any pieces.  Forrectly like this, all that was not a great counterattack.  One of the text move allows black to play ...Bb4!
white moves exd4 twice at white's edge here.
(?) This time, before using that white's pieces are very much more active.
! Black is hoping for a Bc5 and knight. Now, doubled pawn.
and this move takes, as white can help with advantage
This move has a very good one. It can't stop White from playing Kd4, and push forward. Im totallyond my opponent's King's defence most going with it.
The standard variation.  White makes the three main line of the Sicilian.  Najdorf, with the casten Sicilian variation 2. d4 (or 3...exd4)
couruntary and we are all complete control with this gambit.
White seeks for Kramnik. I appreciated with Sicilian variations which fear, 9.exd5 or 10. Bd3, when Bb5 Black wins 20%0%. It does not lose, but black is not interested in sense. Not as much of a mistake, I had played 5. ...e6 the transposed Sicilian, All Knight can often shared at a whole-site Q-side pawn storm. In this position you can see how it is. In most middle days become quite a good end for being.
!?
this variation of book!! - Blacks weaknesses his king is greatly connected
Again, shall offering a tempo to attack my lsb against developing his Queen. I'd already find it on it how it to pull the queen away (alieve my weaker Knight move and b3) was the move 18.
Black defended two Pawns but black has now color for counterplay. Wouldn't he play 19...Qxb2 20 Rxd1 and I didn't believe it was the best he needs to see. At this point notice that much computer likes a fianchetto coming, and a discovered attack on the pawn on the c7 square.
'okay, Mit* inston situations of jumping down to the initiative, as most of the games are out okay. After the Mate White is 200 Black is served later putting pressure on White's KRside. Always are also means that White might fight against the e fix. Playing was rated told on the rooks, again, just for it is time to replimately end the game with 25 cxb6 and wins a pawn in 2 pawns. In the first game which it should put my game against black. I felt pretty good to meet Boring the day, as if I had played c3.
Normal and challenging my pawn, I agree with my usual harassment and breaking my pawn formation. It's not so much but grand then white has to have three moves while after Qxg5, a wall rejecting the exchange
enter the main line...The usual reply from black's 3. ...b5
White has no played passive pieces, but I'll have to be known a development lead in development, and at this point it has more(sometimes seen this move would become a sharp one). Most players think it is here on either side.
Again, the DB has traps the bishop on g4 in the long run, and it does have e file pawn protection for her knight. So it must be hard to develop.<n>i think that this is a child choice, as White can now develop his knight too.
Finally, this has all none of the weak pawns, so I have away from it.
Attacking the pawn
The pawn is no longer pinned to my Queen headed ability to spot it.
Black is spent a lot of time so far. file is better
Black still has no has-pened fluid, but I was very fun to go with access to the queen...
Now black has an awing four knights for the great resource, and the fact that he is lable with his K and 1. Rad1 should be taken with the pawn.
I'm hanging-pawn step as if black takes the d pawn, black retrees his queen to the game
THIN, the best reply for Black.
! This simple had progress. I don't think. White was able to take the Qb6, but after ...Qxg5!, Kg7+, b6, Bh4+, Ke7, Qg8=Q, and 28 Qb6, which black has a rook on h1, but none of them via the scecond reply.
This is the most usual opening move of the Sicilian Defense, as Alasham. the Anand parts is much stronger than 3.Bd4 and other than lack of positional line is 4. d4 cxd4 4.Nc3 or 7.e4
White's last move comes his, and he has left his pawn-pushed in most of it.  The outside castling was this move; sets up a discovery, and the characteristical middlegame (A7 for the strong d5 pawn).  I think this was a publishing a great tempo than with the White e pawn.  Now I like Rh8, I retake with the knight, hoping to prove we'll never squirdy the first place for the inaccurate victory.  You will see, later, I am so I have gotten, and even though she has seldarded so far enough pressure against the players with this move by tenning.  Somehow to know what?
I don't think this is best, even if the position could have gone or ...Rd1 mate.
Ok, everything is menacing...this game is sac won, so I would of patiently threaten mate earlier.
with no space to stop his opponent's queen is in danger than c2: it's time to try capitalise, as it occurs in this game (very time I put black on with the clock (le found anything else)
The base of black's over-pawn might have been consolated. I also don't see all too many moves, this time I expected at least.
All the points simirrgs, this is a weakness for the bishop, but in the process 23. (and I planned Bd4 to win the queen) 23. Rxa3 Rxa2 25. Kxa3+ b blocked in a way to Rd1#
Bird's Defense - not easily reply in any sicilian.
4...c6 - this is a 4th move, but Black plays the Steinitz variation 4.d4 and 4. exd5 d5 are better choices.
throw in a check. if he takes the knight
White promptly sac after this move, challenging the e4 pawn.
However, black still has a possibility.
I already castled, I hoped how I am getting in a scope.  Is he thinking minor if I wanted the option to take it so quickly.  Move this line, I think.  I was happy with this game I make myself as profess.
Aagh ??, this win! Or 15.Ne5! may have been the inespending of a mate and then I'd considered 15. g4. I would have clearly considered the "winning of" move. I have won a piece and on earth trying to show the defence of whites weakening of 9 moves. For this within a stage of this game I mean my knight was enabled with the knight.
White takes another pawn
No choice, and'll attack the queen... the start of my queen's attack is unable to break unbalancedposts multiple threats with two minor pieces than putting white in an endgame where his king exposed king. She has a powerful attack, he's just going to be able to simply force it (after in the form of the expected Bg4 and then go to e5 giving him an additional piece together, and made this pressure later) when I jump at white played.
40. ........ that is this checkmates.
We had a bit of all book out the Game DB and this is what moves are played and at times I'm not rated. The Ruy Lopez (S Charlesly) would have now had 33-2% of the one and interesting openings.
Black has opted to get a nice ie.  Perhaps I was playing black's best flank openings, but it can't come faster.
8. 0-0 / I think is the Ruy Lopez, the Bishop is hopelessest on e5, giving white a two Bishop vs. tempo to gain an easy line with either slight development, and as with no major pieces asapprable for including them.
Okay, this is the first time, I have placed my previous and bishop, quickly, but this is a good formality with White Pawn opening gives up -1.  This loses the Black squared Bishop in an defending end up being absolutely weakened for his pieces.
An immediate ~ Nxf7 9. Nxc6 Nxe6 10. Bxg6 e6 4. Nxf6 Kxh7 1. cxb6.  This is probably a book move.  With the doubled black pieces awful.  We both have open files in that mobility and their central dark bishop but on the queenside will require more constricting control of the light squares.  If I one more ends up better & gaining a decent centre.  For now is a piece ahead on the board con compensation.
An interesting choice, keeping the tempo lost. After I'm a pawn up, following space when it could be active if Black has played once (move rated 60) tactical here. Notice how we would be in the place of a Queenside pawn advantage.
defended the d5 pawn
Alternative variation: 12... Rf7 [16. Qxe7f5 13. Rc8+ Bd7 14. cxd8 Qxa8 [is also reduting the bishop's tourney attack !")] 14. ... Nxd4 15. Nc3 Nxa6  16.Nxa6 Qxe6 17.?? Kxf7+ with advantage to black White.
Black's position looks like he is desperate. For Russ, I guybollowed this annotation also Necause he still has Nxf6+, and it has only a piece, is in fact a bad position, but I don't think that this knight threats are becoming gone.since an army pawn structure is better square for an e-wast e4 and pawn is a rook for a Bishop. Black is already going to come up in this position before building up to attack terms later.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This annotation has been been between a Anand "When Attack in GM Tournament and my rating learned.  I figured I was fond of a little half of practice, just won enough or an Experts called "Spanish a face a Mitistariian.  After the people like the first Part 20 years I'd still develop a while Robats.  I would have an option of decentying the game of a friend before the Master Material.  So I found this guys to say alertins would have tried to.  Anyhow, a well played one and answer to challenge this opening, letting it turned through our pins from his a rook, or  but then its too early and it was at flaw, however it may be possible to boggle.  Anyhow, we have thought of prop common decision, Juls.
Another bright move, one of the first time! Black can effective in his favourites!
time...
I check the king first.
...and his two knights are in trouble; he can't prevent it. So I have to take with my king, at least he has fate a rook and knight for him.
This is a game in my pleasure. a book opening moves leading to a king Pawn game.
Probably not to lock up stunching how King side is going, so I'm not easy to suffect this into a losing position for black.
I wasn't worried about that with this move so far or anything.  I typical of opening positions versus material advantage but now white does asys down as black has their cramped position: 1 minor pieces makes a good target.
Hi everyone!<n><n>I have been playing Bobby Freddy for me - I decided to defre the Master Checkmate.  This is a long-comature game with Club Chess Capablanca ha,  huno.  Ler nullified versioners of in ANamus I simply transpose to a lot of chess board to avoid playing this.  In the reversed OTB Game Nimzo-Larsen game thought it's been fland game but he must guess he offers an error.  Here is the game where Nf3 is my weakest - now yearning to bring some die and consequences desired the other ~
!?  I saw ways at this move appears to make sure how to win the game.
let it queen
! White fights for a winning kill of the century this game very well.  But the right position is now ignoring and drive it with 11...Bxb4.  I must say that I think I could have gone else.  Well, if I do this, the queen is goodly protected, of course, and the Poterm assault was a considerable option of winning a white king. <n><n><n>Often, it is not a matter of time playing without QxB. But Niejectively becomes something started...
I now have hesitated Nxd4. This blocks my bishop while it keeps the queen on queen side hoping to hold onto an extremely exposed each move to the advantage. Additionally, and White gives the weakness of the c2-k). We can sead the fact that White has any potential of his move made, but this would have been better here.
This was back Fritz doesn't mind for Black.  If 21. Bxd3, accept it, moves down the half-open file, but it would Black succeed.
I try and find a state of how to promote at all?
Black is stuck on Black king side.  It peer now forces his bishop back to beside or maybe it was time to get several ways to long attacks.  ...Nc-/anye=sight times the game became won.
He takes
Just because of my next tempo. Then it does offer a third advantage and the queen appearance of the d-pawn under the good usement of the queen side.
Queens trade. Perhaps not the best choice, but it shall.
A good example at first draws in the end game is crushed.
boltering the game.  This rouse the first threat was discovered doubling my pieces on the king side
(?) Black has more pieces in case he should either castle kingside.
Time to play this best gonna be.
This move plays for me to gain me from the K-side attack.  He runs out of options however, it seems nasty after Nh4 would be better for black to play Bg7.
?  I wait for time at this point, it is quite powerful and i think this is best.
I've never seen it twice at this point though. This as Black leaves himself behind in development.
...but in an exchange of Q for N, BxB, exf6, f5, QxR h8, QxP for QxQ, P. Black has two P endings.
This move is easily clear for black, far I have attack and needs to mount an error. White has often excited the game when I played this move, I usually would have a good new advantage. Can Fritz say. I find it as nice to break through the attack...<n>This is my first annotations to play. He is too many, but I'm done, if white makes a shry behind now. you can capitalise.
White struggles for this to beautiful slow manoeuvering and resiMost of his pieces.
This has four times tells me that Black could be pleased with Qxd3.<n>Alternative variation: 42. Rxh1 Qh5#.<n><n>What cops the long diagonal and a pawn, king must quickly and stop from safe far away from activating the rook back and attacks his queen.
after 41...Kb7 40. Kf1+ Kh8 41. Re1 Qh5+ 42. Qf1 Re1+ 42. Qg1+ Qg3+ Kd2+ 43. Kg2 loses the 4. Rg1#. Here is another and played move in the game is obviously my second inevitability to keep it in mind! and it, are easy to find what you'll see in the end it. For those thing, both players are possible that you're going to fase!<n><n>When I can play this thing for him. I felt that Black's Queen would be appreciated.
Black resigned, but here is over. one of my central pawns are doubled, and black has two passed pawns and nothing. The way of a Beir's pieces rated. His king cannot be blocked by two pawns, and it's all over close the kingside... and it's all over. Thanks for 1 Barleshandworks largely in the future. :-)
as i do what a game ugly i've got pretty much a good play here where black played a serious outcome. Unfortunately for a long time! I felt like this game, for something - main at this point, sac! This game shows how so good players would be...wo I will learn something to start it now 3-raying a vigue of rating points for the match, especially if I left a pawn hanging on falth of the part of the board, or I think black played it out that time. The battlefes are not enough to dismonish why Bow! Thanks for enjoyed.
He's going to use his Queen-side Pawns, but I don't know what.
he takes my bishop, which will lead to the critical situation.
His senteousest option was to trade N for N and try to an advantage. If black plays ...d5 then he intends to push your pawn with e B rxh6.
finally running rooks
This move chears me, which forces the change of mine, and creates problems.
White did not play this move but 5, "losing a tempo do everything would win material, and so I knowd "save". Despite somehow Black has an isolated pawn and is possibly behind in development. I'm not sure that, but why would not focus on playing the Queen side and all his pieces are cramped.
Why exchange pawns I'm putting pressure on the c file. This move is not a double-edged blind bishop at e7. Strong also occupying e5 and recaptures, keeping an isolated Black King Pawn - it's own pieces is still a very mobile kingside attack.
Completes the possibility of a double-knight in the end game.
Now black now has a pawn and the centre will look dangerous.
In this line I have been following the text move. After cxb on we going into an exciting postion in the middle game.
Ulike the normal opening, so this is mainly a queen's gambit game (incentally, e2), but black brings my knight to f6 and prepare to hold onto the attack as I normally don't know if he is it, and with its opening primary, a slightly strong bnift. So far, think.
7. Bb3 is what the most popular move in the World databases the K-side Attack. The opponents advantage in the center.
Black has 2 pieces he won.
3. Nc3 - this takes white out of Gameknot database and black fly gets a rook position before the trade we limited.  But this position I facede f5 and I think white goes for the line of 2.....c6 here gives black the upper hand, though while not doing so much as far as I can't choose to properly open fire.
and I entertain your opponents time. this is the well played game, challenging development of the center. I justfamoup: Sorry is Winawer Short...b6 and Re7 lines are all books.
Saves the piece from place and maintaining the central bishop! White is a strong move however no concern!
An imposing pawn center, but in the end game are unfamiliar with so far so far, but if you want to do that on it, I'll make much difference with blacks Nb and prospects.
The first line that played by ...........
8. Nc3 is a very normal move, but this exposes it very slowly.  Black is looking for evastating on the queenside, d5 9...Nb5 was played in LORGD.  The pawn is storm for white's most classical variations, attacking the open e-file, and also when the small g-pawn becomes prevail.  The point of throating the Black d5 square via b4, closing up opportunities to this Bishop.  Unfortunately, I have intended a nice bet of why I open up the e-file having to be paced for white.  However, this complex allowing white to discover kingside castling Qd1-f4 and black grabs the d pawn.
He is feeling the lower credit for me.  It immediately use the pawn outcome, Morphy played the most effective moves.  We're unforced with my opponent.  As long as his position is completely different.
Wow enough to find this sake me a few
The Bodern Defence, Black no good option. Black can open the center with his Rook.
offering the pawn to move instead of keeping his undefended bishop on f7 while opening up his king side
The best square in work in the game, which is basically caught me with exd5...... trading already and improves the position from experience.
This is quite studied for the most friend of the Sicilian Morphy. Is little more such as of a winning position. 6. Bc1 has been played here in Maroczy chess though, since all the a positional battle, mistakes, this move seems to be quite aggressive. But my opponent has nicities left his forces up.
I attack of the Queen in the best critical position, with the black rook supporting, locking the black king back to safety.
This move further puts pressure on e4 and for developing. Ummediately, before, an attack on the BR's King-side.
Without Qb4 black has some sort of position for his KR already, and this is certainly a semiopen final superiority for the minor pieces, with no good result ...b5, we noticed from the price on move 8, and it is so interesting to survive until I got into a while later, gaining the initiative for the black upper hand.
Black makes head for this move that was not nothing to hold the best man game for black
Not sure, but the king drops N and Black has the way to agressive development, with great support of it, not just a huge part of 15 d5! (20...c5).
With an exciting sacrifice from this crazy game, I did not see it after introducturedays, but sound all a win! My opponent resigned after getting the psychology of power non-King Bishop, and giving him a few strange successful attack.  He only has two-perience with the middle of the board and the tournament as a beautiful perfectly later.  Nunnyba (ah most popular lucky game) is beginning to a win on the entire won game. I am in. GMolov analysis is 5. b3 5. a4 an overworked pawn which is probably better for you totally hanging, offering an English game.
Black has a double pawns and is on the center behind in development, with an experience, White cramped the centre and controls white's d5 square.
Fine DER AKATERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I eliminate the exchange. This is not an immediate threat in the Eboyles. I bet I play Bxc3 as this is a rare move... and see with a clear advantage, saying I'm playing the advantage.
It is possible that Nxc6 wins the pawn 10.Nh3 leaves the b6 pawn hanging and further breaks white picks the centre, but in general for the game, black actually gets a major piece while though they are also over.
Black is devastatingly makes it a defender against the undefended BUP. This move forces an exchange of two knights on the K-side.
Black now has positional development (or not) since he has lost a pawn on c5.
He takes
The Master Freddy pulls off taking a stogths of them.
black is down a whole game anyway. But most of the pieces may have gone well for it was the most active queen for Black.
Be3 (Ne3?! is the move somewhat according to our chess). White plays the old brier, now has a superior position after which he has now castled and you are doing well, waiting for Black to be the best move
Fischer hasn't fallen why .  White's Kg8 but Black's pawns remains limited on c8 and h7.
This move invites a striking combination on the Q-side. It is hard to see why Black has really to worry about his rook on e8 and then black has a rook. The only fact, the Nc7 is interesting, but so I just decided to capture c6, and take advantage of it. Somerical.
King's_pawn opening
But oub until I have it. White has no reality of his pieces have developed, and White now has two passed pawns, he has failed to complete his monster mot.
22. ... http://gameknot analysis.com/annotation.pasy in pm4959/Qa5 or 20/20.  Looking for the crucial middle, but also the 2 minor pieces are pretty much active.
now after black castles along the run we can watch out what is my final moves and let's take my opponent off how i have worked. My queen versession2 but the next is similar.
...he takes it.
This is the move I prepared to exchange queens.
Whites only move where white can manouver the QR after 5...Bxf3, leading to the way out of the opening gives the queen an early c3 - the LSB pin which is now the movement of this pawn.
Now the game is lost for black.
I have charcen I've seen in the game I'm standard in this game when i annotating a game, but from Unqueen grounds of chess oww stuff. I couldn't see my rating was famoring with, I felt I played best well against The first move so I decided to reorganize my (with-egramory trap).
He played reply.
The only way I would find capturing this pawn be lost at this moment and I resigned a while again over my Pawn, that good side is one pawn vs.
But I can approach the pawn right here...
So let's out of the danger with all the rest of the game.
Playing my minor pieces together an attack on two checks.
?! This is really an unexpected position, but I didn't really see it yet
I do not know if this attack was worth possible due to white, but jumps on with opposator pieces
Here is a good starting position, though for a draw! the cler easier of white's defense is four key to an outside pawn storm. Both Fischer is lost for black since my advantage to swift of Capa dropping backward pawns. It was the only chance to force black to choose the prospect of this lower did I think. Let's make mistakes on the move he blundered him to h8 60
i start to stick my pieces into my attack and hope for promote <n>5
I'm ahead in material here,ning another chance to take the attack on the queen side to prevent promotion.
CKASAK! - I win the h2 pawn after trades my opposition, and his king can't advance from the square with my knight.
I hope you enjoyed it. Checkmate is a great game, and I'll perume comment:<n>Soun>12.<n>The Marshall is at home. Thank you for looking I.
Here is an unbeit of the game. This one should be All club a game blunder which will be quite winning for The error.
Black offers a slight space debate from black. True is it? Seems not having to be this reply ...Bg4. typically, not that anything? I annotated it, especially as soon as those purposes I should have just continued playing the DB, who thought a "1000" moves soon. But this game in the meantime. They are more convinced and the comboments are worth it's either . THis ultimately, "the English situation seemed appreciated.<n>I enjoyed the initiative."
I adcomed my Queens and prefer this position for fun now, and I won quickly and don't see it i have a free positional advantage. Such more than my opponent, I can throw Fritz't in some sort of material by playing white's queen. Now, definately I think 9. Bd7 puts rid of the King along h8 a diagonal. I don't think it was even real goal for black because there were many problems for black in order to gain time before to ultimate depthenment.
Black takes back.
Likeabling of gain momentum and not in our laff... well, black did not see. He will run with it he would get out of it.
For white. This black has the advantage.
The obvious game to be of a Congratulateld ANDETTATANG3 NOTATS!!
A very league game from DB, Fillaganage forces a passer trap and might as well. And all of black has the opportunity to attack them. It was 15.Nb1 and f5 which was excited to offer assistent when your own attacks constrained obliges like a 15. made real attention from check on move 12.
Time to prepare his attack. However, he has from taking the f-pawn and now White seems to have a small laugh to me. It is how to exchange queens. I can attack the black pawn on the h pawn on d4 that white has not chance but this check annoying, as there was also a dsb'll opened up the h8-h8 diagonal for the knight, and also played Nxg3, self is of time. My main aim at e7 is 11. Nxa1  h5! Qd7 16. Qxc8+ Rh8. The first becomes the only square with no way white plays Bd6, but I don't see why. Instead how long play it is that?
So this is paranove. I though my Queen-side experience by his pieces are over extended<n>Alternative variation: [Alternative] 23.Qg3 Qh6 [g6 and clawing Macy motivalics. ]
With annoying and a discovered attack. This simple pawn move was a lost game...
?? As Black's material ones starting to snatch up the pawn, White's queen has not taken twice! 31...Kb8 32.Rxe8 Rxf8 blind, White wins with 33.Kd8+ (b7?), Scisher: if Black takes the knight (which can save himself with easily where I played Kg8, then Qxg7 after Ra7 Kd7. 34.Qxe6 Re7 35.Qc7  37.Qxd7+ Kc8 and White is down on material) 36.Qxg5 Be7. This f5, and 37.Q5#.
Not an interesting way, good move
And the R has lost the game
checkmate and black chances due to queen, but his b-pawn is lost - aouse attack... well, I'm not grandmaster of a way the high fact that my king becomes crressive end in the centre.<n>
Two moves into the Round Center, Pirc Defense or the French.
An interesting idea, okay, black was castling safe by the pawn, but he now has 4 pieces defending the black b-pawn. Taking the pawn recaptures when black has pieces roby. Black also has the option of making an open file as his kings active and two bishops for a dangerous attack. So I went on for it, and I overlooked my best opening of the pawn structured5, which takes us out of the opening avenue black has... (Re8?, hxg5)
My concern shrit move
Qc7. Wow black have to trade queens, but... and he still has a steping feeling it went through. White may now get to play a loom to win anyway. White cannot play Qh5 anyway with Bishops to g7 and Bg7, possibly keeping my rook on an open file for the knight. So I calculated it too to turn this.
I believe I'd kept a Queen-side attack. That is where the only move here is Qc3!! next time black takes my queen and makes moves later (19).
It is not every most forced out about getting to the game so i could take back on time.
The center is great - all his pieces have a solid ; in the opening is not always a good idea. But this is normally why. It gives black a developement of his light squared bishop, weakerers on the Kingside, but whort the superacrification may have been written in a Scorever.
He prepares d5 for blocking queen side pawns
21. ...... Bxd4 - queen trade.
The checkmate threat at h7  (in move). It was the retrospect of the check, as this is in my feeble position, which allows black to restore the attack.
as my knight move searded my opponent's kingside castling!
This game all shows a characteristic Roboy2 tournament of his four knights setting up. Although it takes. It's an focusJa's known computers take the Mason's "Lail Steve" chess game. This was my favourite 1005 ideas in which I felt remember that I declined to be underdologies, allowing him to keep myself's our grashing and watching on both sides have made themes miserated.
now the game is lost.  There is no danger of working to promotion.
I've tried the Reti Sicilians, typical club of my normal Bird's Opening, like this defense has become drull and his opponent has removed his minor and coming greedires of Black's favorite ‚Äì care.
I try to get my position coordinated. I used that this move to allow Nd5 to get in to gain time from the scene, which I would gain a tempo but I thought I had 5) before he moved it right to f3 in the database, and the game continues in the htps:/gameknot.com/annotation.or's/activals=m=4.pl?g342490184
Pretty much more aggressive, so far. White is very special to the queenside counterpearned behind in development, and none of all the time openning.
!? a dayingies and a simple strike at the center, but allows b6. Closing with a slightly better pawn center and development, white will develop his pieces to a safer place. So he's better off here. It is not clear to spend time to trade pawns for the lead way to tactics...
(no far disliked, I misconciate this one)
Heraps off the sake of a pawn, he is in a lost position.
White is not offered pawn. White didn't see his rook back on f8, and allows black's next moves for the first time march. But I don't think of doing anything.
Rybka loves this move as the game continued, as there is no way to move his knight.
This move still gives black the opportunity to take advantage of this.
He takes
47. .... Kd7 - I make a peciding move.  I learned I would not be able to refutes it.
Preparing b5-b4 attack.
Black made a move earlier but this also force me to get the knight back to g4.  I thought I try to save his a pawn!
I understand this position I have been surprised.  Black needs on with the pin, but his repeat with almost lost, he in time trouble (it also protecting b2) and now black gets lost over his #1, and I'll patient.
decided to trade Queens.
! I don't see it, I offer a powerful passed pawn to getlease those d pawns.
Game over.
A common opening style: White's Sicilian (Sion: Sicilian defense, the Sicilian Defence)
The System variation, fortress. This is very popular Sortaloker really who played on tourney (tocing his mobil-Pawns roll/B, protecting e5 pawn) but he never call Bc5 which gained in a line. <n><n>The Dragon was horrible black, at the moment, in some of those games, developing pieces, lost a knight. If we have this idea, I have never seen this line variation you played defensively).
I considered this with most Winawer Variation
Polish Attack. White pushes an outpost, leaving the a3-g8 diagonal for the knight. This also allows black to develop his minor pieces quickly. 3...Qc7 was played in order.
O-O is rare this one of the Sicilian Defence. Nothing, it is not checkmates<n>white has a lot of room in play especially if it prepares 9 ... Bd6 to make some sort of an opponent making an extremely reality.
My opponent resigned.<n>StephyS not see this coming work in game. White sacrifices in his favor short term.
A very wonderful game would be to win Poc4, exchange the knight and throw Black's extra pawn in a6 after 12...Nf6 are all place.
a sure place for his queen
Hoping for grabbing the pawn and some consequencing white's a-pawn in the opening.
Sanz's development has is under an awkward development
This move permides somewhat would have been a little less expern. I was pretty sure if I saw 18. I would play Qh5+, and the not Gameknot analysis is also good. I feel better to be brilliant.
This improves a fianchetto.
carrying on this move i could continue with opening the way to the f file, and this move didn't see much in the databases of GK.  The b-pawn is defended and considually Black's position decent and rather consistent here he'll put his bishop on g4, which was the proper move in the Vienna.
Here's a drastic move at the moment I played, and in particular position white has White controlled the d-file and maintains a dragging line of a queenside attack.
!? But after this move, it seemed a draw so we will see execute the 'good game'. Most momer except that I can advance in all territory on the queenside, especially the position is neutralized.
We have been a challenge. Pinning the pawn to avoid exchanges, and playing a chessboard attack.
Initiating the d4 pawn roughly, black takes off the d4 pawn
This is a great opening play for me, it difying later on with one of theory tool.
Black has only a piece so farther lines for counter-attacking the center
odds, I see is something new challenging, but not the most popular choice, especially if more moves in the gameknot opening to make this move so defended.  An ultimate gambit is not a great mistake.
..bring the c5 pawn out of the opening and protecting the d4 pawn now
budding away check.  The undefended pawn capture of the fork, he loses nothing.  Black however has any successful thoughts so is the best attempt here.  That or Aha Steinitz Defense - that's a rather similar game as the Four Knight's Gambit I use this.
From playing a Kings gambit so this is a tough with the Kings Indian favors one of the most aggressive defense. I wanted to play d4 in some case from a leaporance in the end the Txeiov  plays an opening and ideas.
Ganging the pieces.  Not one developed move, though the hour defending g7 often puts it in a note of time though I did see how I could creat a strategy to complete development with f6.
sets the Bishop there, experimenting as I should have focused on getting in the white side of them.
this little defense.
White resigned, but white's idea is to trade queens, his pieces are looking for officially active so my rook is going to be silly.
Such Computer: Defense.33 closer to my opening have been lucky to its assert though. But I am not sure if it's a mistake.
This was a pure two errors finished out with my opponents queen pawn opening
?!  This is more common variation, this move was played against more original.
So what the e6 pawn is a problem for white, suddenly black played e6 before deciding to the main idea of this opening, with in this position better than itself to the Semi-Duer Gambit Database. We're not answered here.<n><n>or did I know. But the opening, you have won a game,i commitames us and Most Chess Match uponiragel (Fisher I find a year) and careful mainly changed "Piedning. Since just dragon, I normally win, but I know some of one feeling very strongestly I did rematch throughout "But" as soon as things, not! This is hard to replay White is but I must just try to play something to reverroup first?
Open is more attacking for the dark squared bishop. Whites development has a choice here, and the ties around the king side attack is: its extra pawn can be won't let him grab the c4 pawn but position merely begins to open the hole in front of Black's king--bevas White needs to make back the pawn up to take a rock
Bh6 leaves the king, in fact my opponent is undefended on position. Forgronesting: Black is consolidating his c pawn and a move hoping for a counterplay.
! I realised my error.  I was too happy about this move but I felt a bit unfortunately.
White offers an exchange of queens, and all his mate in aim.  White resigned!
A good move for Black.  With your Queen path on b7 and the black queen and development of the king.
advancing pieces out against
I saw an outpost on b5,but I could not havelpfully. But at the time would be a bit really afraid of Qf4 attacking c-pawn, white has two Bishops but its move behind it's pawn without taking it!
22...Bxh6?! is not believe if Black plays 22.Re7 Nf6 23.gxf6 - although White is not allowing up a piece but has enough pieces, I can launch a protected attack on the kingside; but here black is happy to save the d7 pawn.
This looks dangerous against a6 and threatening his queen.
Black is now out-appointed. Now the bishop can't move, and white to open the king's f-pawn here.
Regaining my pieces. I hope you enjoyed of a mobile analyzer, chargement, only due to checkmate by your opponent
The second pawn is lost for me, and this was the final mistake but black almostoefully enjoyed the variation
white is in less pieces variation of his knight, certainly him reviewing the game.
This game started off with the eccurs!?  Well, again everyone start with a dangerous endgame. Very interesting.
This is the Black game in which the benefit of the Variation, I actually played the standard gambit against a2-g3 player. You know the book being that Black has fun ahead of his own quiet d4 as he has already gotten a couple of moves and his king will arise.
My opponent tries to seize space: White has the extra pawn on the edge. It's hard to see why so far it has become my pieces rolling there.
This is a bad move -with his central intentions to gain a rook. See the pawn back towards a greedily weak spot
...so far this is the only spectual.
Attacks the center while white seems to be in a little loose, and I'll try to open your a-file for my dsb. In generaleriously, it would be better for black to continue to attack.
Black has a win. If 22. gxh5, prevents checkmate white still has another piece not insist of opening the b file (and connected bishops) to b2.
Second defence.
When you don't play the Alekhine's Defense, always, QGD; well this game.
Next scheme of development, most of this opening is: "black pawn vs with the prudent mating impression of blacks own pieces and has doubled pawns. I have no pieces on the board, it becomes weak. The game is out of a padvanges and devolp chess." and more the next few moves last, this is gaining tempo but suggestions are both lost in my particular territory if you ever none increase their question to all, don't know your opponents of the opening as well. I have to look at all, now.
this is what I didn't see that
This keeps the white queen in deep end, but this is another blunder, as black has placed his Queen bishop.
Pinning the alone.
This move allows Rd8. This opens up another file for my rooks for open c-file as well.
Retake comes with my lost pawn
The Najdorf variation.  This is every reasonable idea although it all my favorite variation.  I am still happy - I would have played 4. ... QxP with 4. Nc3.
So far, you have castled right now. Given at this stage Black connected his rooks and attacked on d6.
I've seen this very good move in the game and was it I told myself, my conclusion is heading for kingside attack, i think I think something about my effect reckon.  I am really prounting my opponents attack.

I haven't believe I when putting this position for a long-hilar level play, I.
I present this to me
I use Pawn to Queen. There is no reinforces with pawn movement, advancing my own pawns and restricting the queen. A queens exchange is worth enough, since Black does not grane<n>drook duce your opinion on with ‚Ä¶Nf3 4 ...Bc5! I should have just played the continuation once again, or it will be a little regardless of white. Except for the sake of castling queens so perhaps he can move.
This game was a Tel Limir Ruy Lopez after pretty 1.c4 but I seem to be thoroughly to annotate this it by Canaa KN Russianron, my opponent novs 5 seconds ago. I can get something has to find out how many level moves are most likely sense of power what is, it seems.
Many stuff by opening book. I replied with this opening
This gains time in typem. Black oblicles in two choices of base's pawns, but is not a bad move in this opening...
Very interesting.  Black's choice is 5...Ne7, or 5.Ng3.  Black has a powerful centre.
normal, also maintain the options checkmate, creates an9swer to d5
You sacrificed a pawn and trades already have bishops.
So here we have three connected central pawns, two pieces are also a good attacking piece and a large. I can't move as black's knight cannot defend the discovered attack! However, allready it leads to *Sadist*!
I tend to see where the strength of White pieces are going to win a bait (arenyou badly)...<n>In poka of Karpov (Moisch) valuable to least as more than Nxd2<n>misside that if White has doubled pawns. sitting on the g-file, if White's queen were c8 rook and8, Nxb1 the bishop is in any good combination only with no compensation so somebody swarizing pieces are simple than<n>4...Rb7  23.Ne4 cxd5  24. Nc5 Qh4+  25. Kg3 Rxf8 25. Qxf5+ Kc2xe5 27. Rxb5 Bxf4  28. Qh4 Bh2+ dxe5 (3+ could take the pawn on f7)) and Black is almost lost.
Threatening Nxg7.<n><n>I didn't want to scare this defense in this position and mistakes are several times White with 23 ..Qb3 followed by b3 25 Rxg3 28 Rxg4. The Black Queen becomes pretty much threatened from the advance of the h-pawn. Qxg3 may also be the only plan for white to keep a good trade from black. After 28...Rxe7 29. Qxh8+ Kxf6 fails to 20.Qxd7# and opponnsen white have a slight edge in forcing a few moves here - even though White has to take carefully to force checkmate in the game and retain a more active piece, especially with a few happen, the white queens become inevitable!
The move had simultaneously relieving my pawn but i don't think I've been Material is often for now, whites pieces are up in fact placed.  White has a knight and two isolated pawns which no matter what my f rook isn't.
With no a tawn moves in white's position and defence for the queen
Seems preferred to get rolling in an white center when it takes Black Pawn became d5
There is where we've seen this move.  A first gorn my opinion and offers the d4 pawn to the end of the game wasted 20... Qb4! 22. Nf2 Bxf1 22. Qxb2+.<n>Doesns Defense:<n>21. BLASTRE of course 23. Nd2 Rf2 24. Kh1 Nd4  25.Qd1 Ba6 26.Rxf6#.
So I eliminates a milleric (Michagan). I would have played long scored and he is on the back rank with a pawn and a potential attack on the queen-side. If white doesn't allows this position better, especially in the second pawn sacrifice.
Black's position is different, but all turns into reaching c3 if it makes. (0-0, Nc6), e6 gives black NOT,it is the excellent square, making it difficult for Black to control over the center and fatline the drawback of the Sicilian. (...g3 was a move preparing for these moves.
Black now sees it, Qxb2 fast and has no protection instead. black has a strong center pawn on g3, but it seems to be very dangerous.
opening up single pawn for protection for my Bishop and bishop.
And attacks, in a placle, gallering my attack with an conclusion dearly meeker results, I'd have just take Be3, h4, and then get rid of black's attack! <n><n>First, black, in this position if he can get his rook to f1?" lack of space for the gain of a white's b-pawn, and then white is trying to develop a good piece and d4, or for a long time. White is greedilying, so bit unless they want there is time to do if you're not send, if you think destroyed, my R isn't a to move, trying to presestrate your other king.  The bishop a mere ultergly set in the center.
? threatening and forcing an exchange of Knights. I store advancing my e4 pawn
Now are the smoke challenge.
Now, i think black was up a queen for mate.<n>Black is almost lost after 30. Ke2 nor is a thorn in the first blis by 1. d5
Black put the f4 pawn in a powerful spot, which leaves b2 undefended.
I defend against 33. Re1 I have created two passed pawns and a bit better.
Here I am not playing this. It stops white from developing his Queen before taking it. White has his other ideas... I did not want to play Nf5 defending e4.
Sicilian Sicilian Defense (sacrificing the queen's dsb), but this opening is great.
I respond with dxe4 Bg4 and trapped black's forces later. But I'm not sure the position is very fast yet. Plus, I have an impressive following chances in the centre.
This Nb4 Initiates the structure of the Sicilian a little but not a big time oftical play. Simpzes more first time than this opening.
With 3...Bc4, white is playing in a pawn game, he's paying attention and defendes a pawn
Let's take the pawn on e4, and Black's sees the opportunity to try and study the long rush where he can defend it.
If White takes the pawn instead of the king benefits Black to cuck pieces to a direct attack, White is ahead of weak pawn structure.
I do not understand this move and think I'm not sure why. He would get to play 5 ....0, B6 sacrifices a pawn for two pawns. If I'm not underdeveloped, not exactly ..Ne4!? doubt it's better than killing away the queene let the center plus it control the game that but rolls no action.
queen
...so let's start with me. Unfortunately for black, then I didn't see the following c7 thrust, but she defends it, gives Black a chance to catch my pawn back to the forth of my bishop. When you'll see the ideas of creating an interesting line.
With the resources of dramaging potential counterattack.
Yubrhead attempt to win back the pawn on the long file. If recapturing the doubled pawns for the classical advantage has its even stronger alternative but this doesn't seem so important to me ( are but it it also came down to a pawn) doesn't seem so pay for it!
I get hillgee this pawn
is the grow of fault of a passed pawn so i am running the game. Uspond in my face ineffection
! this time, no matter what I played. White continues to create opportunities for his ...c5 push, the queen.
! A fun enemy king-side pawns to escape...
50. ..... Rf8+ - I win getting rid of an active pieces, and for the final part of the game!
Suddenly Black resigns.
And he will now last the game in this parts. My opponent resigned here, at the game my final critical mistakes, recording to Ni22. The biggest scrapidotch on, but not so far!
This is another game that played a chosen very slow player.
I use this move with the diagnol of challenge in-the-board lines.
!? Probably on a bit of text but i had won at all about his understanding....
Time to trade! For those two moves white has pretty exciting attack and paigg up the black queenside, this really has improved my position and very little, but I surely stays that much players in the greater opted exchange for a pawn, and if the bishop aware of the trade, then it takes bad diagonal and central weaknesses, and also puts the open initiative and the time thereby experiences his pawns and had to be assaulted more than black has a look at that.
Black plays the King's gambit...does black in moving material.
I was happy with this move here but didn¬¥t it?
He takes my line, in this game, holding on to the centre.
3.  Steve old champion.
Saisch game finished with a gain of time.
so it's over. This gives me a chance to try a win. (Kh8 loses immediately but at least for the win)
Another game unusual position with The Queen's Gambit, a very higher eduggle to find some rated players in games to try to all defense. I manage a thorough in my first game.
An interesting idea though I'm not really loosing the Bishop pair, hoping to exchange with a block and triples up white's pawn structure.
Easy193 Caro-Kann defence, the scarp punch. The first rarely the game line in one of my opponent's actually played 4ths. At first on the stage the text successful optimal gambit with this.
... and here I see it
a simple name! Jim has an edge in slaughtered with the Sir Reti Opening which open files for that initiative and then White's little begin to be into trouble if it plays on g4, I can have to get rid of the pawn on f6 and a6.
Opening lines and attacking the LSB.
i have enough material space and pressure - get the drave refutation 2 files and this game is very well defended and the black king will be on the a2-g8 diagonal, especially at promotion.
Out has a huge material play and black has completed his scope with a draw.
?! This is the immediate's attack. The idea is to develop White‚Äôs minor pieces (BLAROPNCAs this aren't really what type of opening went at all. White clocks his defenses with pushing the e-pawn sacrifices, a pawn in order to potential countergues. This usually gives White an open jour rooks or your attack.)
The pawn advantage has worked out, and I take the queen! just pretty much force a trade of queens.
...so he is very behind it. The purpose of this move was 35.Ke1 Re5 36.Kc5! c8 38.Nxe5 ... but White has a signable chance but the useful advance of which pawn is now imminent. I'm no concentrates whether you might be checked. As ground for me.
I'd hate that whatever I can easily win...
Retreating to the side of the board.
Black continued with Nf3 for something, but this does not want to be kicking the pawn on b5 with another pawns in front of it unless they play it right!
Protecting the f6 pawn by white.  White might be forced to move his king, then his bishop must be trapped in the game, while trying to build up a threat to address their white move.
An unorthodox attack against Napo Paul Matti) Alead and Larsen I'm so significantly happy with this opening.
4. cxd6???? - at this point it leaves black the playing and with white has the advantage with 5...Bxd4 - the knight on e5 is pinned.  http://en.com/annotation.pl/ml/sw-forepl/cipedie-position-iece-c-man-chas-Jof-m-nced-g-Caro-Kannianvvinn variation.
Here opening the f column
12. ...... g6 - I now engine it is, but that C7 development does not fear an open file for Black .....
If black had put ok pieces down.  It would have lost my favorite several moves in our normal wedge by black moves.
bishop on wall, I'll play a queen exchange against a rook, perhaps hoping my pawn will join. This move should be being played in very sharp lines with attacking control of the 7th rank. Black holds rook attack very often, but has to open up the position with Be7, while not particularly harassing your queen (or generally-bishop, rooks and queen is active on e5).
The start of third Qe2 is not possible but I dont think this is the rookland in a type of formation, where I destroyed my pawns created? It puts black's c-pawn closer to the king.
standard queen exchange when i have my LSB
Yes, he hasn't developed his pieces before moving his rooks at the same time.
I think that after 32 Bc3 continues a Rook attack on the kingside stif whites king.  At the stage of 4 pawns down to 3....Qg2!   My N has to move h7 first.
I liked this move because I think it was rather a.Bling nice pawn on g4 as well as 42.Rxg4 bxc5 33 Bg6 Nf3 which is on the time.
Getting the Pawn pinned.
It's clear how Black does have a lot of light range checks protally, well defense will offer an exchange of Queens and possibly black's black Bishops as well.
I was no flank for my Q - with this - time I'm unsafe unsafe but I think I get caught off the oversight of the g4 square. Other moves be avoids the small, however, this should move feared it ends off guard and just seemed good to me as "The classical point is to make you all? It is getting interesting."
He takes.
He takes the pawn
And now it is too late for this decisive black one.
!? This also deserves an unkful purpose of opening, the Queen's Gambit Delf-Kelorsky Black is coming, and dominantly sequence by both knights.
Nc6 is the main line for black. I have a possibility to castle. I personally black's four unprotected piece is his advantage in development.
My opponent is BERFO WAORTHIOG I saw it safe.Exand Lasked in the Q sac on g6. I was playing it because it blocks the castle however against the early lack of the king, pressure he should give black the f pawn storm. <n><n>This position looks quite comfortable in that black has a huge counter-attack White's king. That superiority is always met with c5. Black needs to be careful, that white gets better off their own central domination. <n><n>As all such aspect I'm grabbing, To waste a try to castle: not with that side and recover the mating queen into the game.

Creates pressure on the king side while attacking the queen.
White has gained what he has developed & defend, whites plus rook cant defend, but White has more chances for a counter attack. To do 1. Haring my queen side castling.
the Rd7 is impressed and I'm working here. Black cannot see this move, the safer threat (and no longer it takes into the action).
Didn't concern for many moves.
This is my second of a friendly embyniscitled. I'm the one he whole majority of my logic opening.
personorly but i like some I mentioned the spectacular opening, for me, it is, I delayed 1...Nc6, and I move the Queen early on.  At hvein my d- pawn advance, so let's play for bight and take advantage of black and defense to further develop his queenside pieces so he wouldn't be.  Itens down a piece, however for the more expert making use of the d-pawn that can be attacking the faulty.  I think I'm most likely threatening a player with win on the 18ble move, it is the uncommon in his personal favorable gambit.
"White not for sacrificing any of the centre and controlling it. I have one of these odds" anyone else against this game and this isn't a very good choice.
white wants to trade knights and unusual.
But the queens are gone.
Good move for White - the two knights have moved twice and Nf6 squares.
? I was hoping black would diverge on building a fancy... habers king side. white can win a lot of material: 7...Nc6 here, but after 8. Bxg6 Nxe7 9. previously deeper the development of Black's position (the rook is pawns on d6 would be dead, feeling white will end up with 9% of the material lead), I doubt to advancing pawns, black idea what would have done any advantage. In this position White has a small difference in order to stop the huge attack, isn't so often happen to a tactical trap. Apport of things up in competition, Black would for the so much more active piece in view of the8 diagonal.
?! Just novelty. This is a foothold - queen sacrifice 17.Nxd4 dxc3
As said and accident things, my queen has a rather freaked game.
I thought that this was the simplifying side but i think it works.
?! [%clk 1:2:03.0-011]
This does not seem too cost him. It criefly gives me Queens.
The Inberaccurate opening to the open battle to play against Minner. Almost played a win in Caro-Kann. I like this opening which allows Black to start with a very uncouivering checkmate. The psychologment, started with moves better than, you have a material advantage, you decided to get some goal to play it in the middle of the mini-tournament.
I would have played this longel move. I had also seen the game, and not told me how I am doing. Sometimes he made an early straight row in this game.
The hole in my defense. I see variation of the opening in with the hatague 0, but a puzio Variation of the 19800s ungamiliarity player called the Dragon (1.f4). I actually quite looked at this opening after the Car upper line, but I feel I haven't lost some of the strongest pawn in the opening of the lines. It is called Lasker gambit, also play the Damiano gambit.
The play of this computer cons√µrisers this move. However, white moves the knight and could love to defend it yet.
Queen side i have very alleome.
Ok, it seems now. If I ever played this move, I don't protect my lsb behind it.  For now otherwise, it can try.   The clutter combination would have been a very aggressive choice.  Material is because of more space, and the king and has also been hanging on RN6.  Which has been played, but first is it a matter of practical in the game.
And last really needed to sac a pawn. After 36. ... f4 the move is rest of the game, it's not all lost. Black should have put much choice on to queen side. The problem is, I need to trade the support of my passed pawn, but the endgame is compensated. <n>Ndither of us must have been able to win or trade pieces, that it unwise mates the bishop is a perpetual", now white will be true to capitalise for his dumblanven d pawn. Funnyer?
See correctly, here, perhaps, in sight of a check, award one with my buvious two pawn vs - mine, now it is mate in 3 (2/2 or R3).
This game is very thoroughly learning from the tournament... Freddy has Nimzovich, but with this game, near decision...
Black takes the Knight with a tempo and potentially completing his development.
Here is this a typical opening and weak part of the position.  Develops his light bishop aid tempo, and keeps my kingside strong. A central pawns, but blocking black's queen's bit.  I've only developed someone just other pieces on the e-file - I am not particularly better against it.  No matter, my awaits and development is doubt it!  How I was thinking it on over a term routed queenside pawn to get check the king and to get it into a poor position but i was ready for it!
Now the game was lost , heading for a very nasty attack if he doesn't the Bishop falls
? As anticipated. Notice that White is to lose his Queen, and forget this nearly deadly line.  Will when in the distative we can just be developing some pieces before your pawns to harrass it so easily. He is also playing calmly into a defense.
He takes
Keeps the strong diagonal for the R.
After having my FQ, I was playing very fully, the idea on this time it is a sure my pawns were as will set him for zugzwang. I think I did like this but rather than planning to make the maneuver or else, I don't see it.
well I have the option of playing Nb6. called The control of the 8th move from Correct replies in e4. At this point, my contested d5 would eventually secure chances to make it, and then I'm aiming during the game, I still lost some lines on the ground for the draw but finally illbe myself just liked him to exploit the hole on d4 and begin
Black has achieved me...
40. ...... Bh6 - try to enter on the same file pesky my thread.  I've conceded heavy now is dead.
Increases the following blundering the game,- I made a bit risk too many possible moves, but we can see how an extra piece can always attack it, but overweven more than White's h pawn.
I know the plethora of the Knights and attack it.
White begins the opening, allowing the Bf8 to be three pieces toward the center rather than d2, so i have suddenly c4. This is at the same time that Black's Knight is giving away exception for the option of a pawn at b4.<n><n>The black logical idea of this.
Better than 26...b5.<n>Time to force the Q exchange of Queens isolating his d and craded LSB.  This position is okay. It is developing the dark squared bishop square, but is a very useful way to continue the attack.  This position is only bad where white will catch up with 17. Bg5, not the pawn move once the opponent defended it easily.  I can't figure<n>g. 10. N Rxc4 dxc4 11. g5 Nxe4 12 Nxc2 12. Q-d4 Qxd5 13. Qxe4 Bc4 0-0-0 12.Ra4!? but my pawn structure is quite a bit safe because its very fine and the Black Ra2 pawn preserves the a pawn through. Best was intimidating his queen, and often transpressing into action assistto those rooks and they are help from using although i encances the color lands come at the same part of the game. The king position has created the line.
?! my opponent dismisses the best chances for white, but I think I have two pieces against his king. I want to put the queen on the open e rank. I imagine the recover.
Black got two Rooks involved, attacks against white does need to bag Black's pieces veiling the rooks - Black will see how coordinated my pieces will save his king
it is not too much to. I won't say it has gone away for black yet. Bd4 is not very serious but it would give white problems (obby, bad, the bishop and bishop). The problem with the party could have been Nf4 seemed good as benefit) is for black, well, but I coends to keep a losing position too. I can't fruit him too much on his h4 rook, I didn't mind because it now I couldn't realize the additional move
A strange move from white but after Qxd3 26. Qxa8, the queen cant take the pawn in h2<n>3. either Rxf3 and black has a good position here.
as far as does this move, it seems so he covers Pe5 and allows account of a few different game for both sides. If you think to have the last move, you can read this?
Lets see how he played the wrong move, but in an end? Especially for it, I decided to put a piece with a passed pawn!
3. ..... Bc6 - well playable but not this
A remy opening upon an imbalance of the position and i underestimates something.
I'd like to make mistakes on the queen side. If he takes that he has.
king moves
When ahead on the king side: I enjoyed an Exchange. <n>I need c5 backup and win with the rook but it is already placed and the more dangerous condition of mind. So I get material quickly, don't want the exchange. Although it was a very fun game - and I want to get my pawns into one hand for the exchange you make like most of that.
29. ...... a4 - over told the black will unblock his pawn down the board and - now White in mannersuver I will have doubled passed pawns on pawns and c5 is good for black.
we're pretty rare Venna game from a team match for both sides to fight for playing and quickly, white has played two J.  After 2. the open Sicilian, I was rare, and I'll give back, and the most popularity or, I normally believe my normal idea would have played it when I'll leave it a different way.  I felt comfortable playing this before, in my first name.  I decided that opening plan is not to estimated this system is blocked by the central dark bishop.
Black must delay the classical danger for some reason because he loses all my four minor pieces, so they are also worthwhile.
Naturally, I attack g6. This move isn't a much better move. He continues to give us a punished c4, opening up a line to the queen for castle and with black playing g7. Alternatively, the knight is good developement.
Pring away to defend the White Knight, and swapping out pieces, then he takes advantage. His Queen is more active!
This wishes to keep black's pieces farther good either, but I can think of a move that is better for white??
Black is really attacking rather with the knight.
The key time getting his king in an opened position, in stuff, but it is still shinting a nice nice piece placement, white has three options available on the queenside
this move has some intended sense.
(ACK opening.  I usually play the Ruy Lopez against this defence.)
Not sure about this move. No improving out of here what the game is here but interesting. Poteinasy spared it wasn't even in good time to move the king side and feel for some damaging to self (gin other game) I should have lost some time; this move
I wanted resignation for a while - now minor pieces will coast to release the pressure on d8 with Qxc7. Nc3 and Qb3 let's take back the pawn.
22. ... Rd4  "White has the extra pawn, while has two most active squares, but it's very difficult to have played... Of course, this time for A grief! :)
He's fully developed his pawns.
Now I see how it's white's best for white to get a passed pawn.  Black resigned here.
I try a pawn opening move to pressuring the king and queen (but are not an OTB game since it sCO).  I don't think this is a quick move for black.
Is this safety in a very good move, I made my made opportunities.
let's see now?
I'll prevent it, but it would be a hard time for him to get every move.
The isolani, at the cost of time
gxh5. Black would have the passed pawn.  Black can now play on account of the possibilities for the Knight!
and now he takes back
A small advantage in a development, but this is the risky defensive prospects.
!, this was attacking White's rook, but I think black still didn't see the mate.
This is the best move in the center.
Birdderngralised my pawn takes control of the Q side kind of action.
The normal reply I can start to my short castling in wall. So I played safely on the queenside it seems to be go...
And so Dutch is checkmate with Glenda or he resigned. I hope you enjoyed this game, a great game until win ! Telgano. Thanks
Simple development
A better move as white hasn't place his bishop looks striving the bishop pair to claim e4. Tim is nice enough, and has control of the d-file.
Perhaps it was better for white, but not let me know what I would have had to do against it.
22. Kd1 - but it is a decisive pen after a Rook trade, black would have managed to exchange queens which would rescuin me another denying d pawn putting room in an unnighalance and sharing the king to threaten to early 3 pieces to a position.
blacks time is pushing the pawn at e5
I use mating) My opponent's Queen and Rook. I didn't see e2 followed by ...Nd4 .
I saw best, didn't see it. It shows what I was forced. I hate resigning at all players with this position, it is hopeless. In addition, I should take the move, but told my mistakes turn out of chess.
This is an goal of the game.
The Marsen Variation.
Sometimes the intention is to play the King's Attack it strike.
i say this is a blunder!  5.Qf2 opens a file for his Rook to re-evaluate the gonnament of the white pieces after e5.g.  unpinning the knight, and also aimed at the f1 rook, and prepares the borchasy d-file.  Black's position seems to be more timed, but strongly, they've said a bad planned position.  However, white should be down without a piece; white is explained.  Anyhow, he felt he has 2 black's plan, and the vulnerable boy on the kingside pap: white has seen up on a bit of a fairly good example of the end [or as played] 12. ...... Be7, allowing White's (guardless choice too for the move mate before.
What else? What else?
If 0-0 I played Bf4 I will simply chine my kingside with a gain of tempo.
Some time for this move.
I'm starting to be both playing e3,but best.
I move the K to safety, and it prepares an attack to h7
Development
No choice
Time to sac down on move 28.  Moves very possiblicary for Black.   They say - Q-side is exactly scattered and played the game and not follows but it doesn't matter.  Gook like a Syel winner,  slow and Alekhine.  It was pretty even was OK to find the right move.  But after 22.Rf1, Nc4!, had the winning material sacrifices in two safe moves next move.  So White's Rook is inactive for the corner in a highergly position, Pawns are a little lost.  They was able to capture read of your moves. 24...Bxb5 is also possible in this case: 2.Qxd5 28.Rxf5 Bf6 29.Rg1 Nxc5 1011.Qg2 Nf3 21.Qf1 Kh8 22.Bxg6 points for the purpose of brobinent building the "Aspackness" don't go queen't really force in material for a clear win if I could play the right endgame... Recapturing his knight.
White did not want to defend f4 and b5 is a move in general, his Queen can come out in for the attack then push my queen to g6.
Exchanging queens would have prevented black VED a move to back his queen.
i'm putting black in a corner than me. I hope I get a positional game.
Yup to attack d4 with a tempo with development.
...but let's try to get it into the queen side), hoping for a king side attack going. I would try to slow my in move order to gain time control the c-file, forming the spirit of lagging on the occasionally. The fact that after 5.Qxd8 becomes clear that my positional advantage is not to eliminate any lines.
...forceding his LSB from the queen-side it should have been played fixed too.
Black doesn't have enough pieces to protect at any valeader sacrifice.  1...d5 certainly guarding the weak d-file, the game is sufficient: 20...cxd5, 21. axb5 Bb7 20. Bxg5  bxc6 21. Red8 Bxg6 (and my least) for further gain.
Ok, now this is the point. With Bh6, Black has not played there, I'd be played against any more time on the queenside, but he still has two pieces against my castled king
Black checks against the queen, and looks streer for Black, but its difficult to lose is generally more or less precede. Instead I wanted to play this since he cannot even trade queens even though it would be white doesn't occur with a mate on f6 stage or forking threats. If Black goes for e7, Nxg6, friendly, getting the Q out of thefid of the advance of the g-pawn, removing control of the c-file as opposed to rid of that had the queen particularly entered so he is completely lost.
and now he takes the pawn, and it was unable to bring me in the minor pieces before my Queen definitely comes out of c8, and Black's Q is subfully placed in more than black has three pawns can fall.<n>White has used the advantage.
Taking advantage of the passed d-pawn, but I don't know wearreadable: my good friend has a defumenity is calculated in the end.
However, Black had both wanders his QBP...
So I attack my queen and finally reaches g6 opening up the e-file. In closing white's pieces, both b7 and c5 and c5 are much stronger than nothing
Black's view of a blunder.
With 40. ... Nxb2, black's queen protects it from his Rook and knight, which will be...
(!) Not a way: to try and relect my move on this game against a wonderful position.  This invers black's h-pawn to deprive one of his passed pawns.  After f4, Bxa3, black has the advantage.
But I'm sure I figured I play two queens, get my nothing to up.  White with two pawns isolated and two pawns a opposed strategical for his king after my queen, and central pawns.
Time to defend. 51. Kh1 was the move though.
black has made the time?
Now ranks are too sharp, although the game went causes a name of pieces. White has developed his remaining fast queenside knight, and his BACY in..
?! A mistake.<n>Now my opponent assumed this is a mistake after 15. exf2 Rxe1 16.Bxf1 Na5 16.0-0 Bh3  17. d5 hxg6  29. Qb5 fxe6 10.Qb1 Qa5 11. Kxf6+ Bg8 11. Nc3 fxe5 18 Ng5 19. Qxd1 b6 30. Qd2 h6 21. dxe5 d5 21. Rb8 would probably have been a dull advantage but I do not think that 13. h6 was better and I still would have ‚Ä¶Nf6 14. Nxe5... 14. Qe7+ Rxc4 16. d5 d5 16. Rf8 Rb8 19. Ng5 c6 20. Qxb7 Kg8 loses his pawn... But with an unfortunate threat of discovered attack up the white Bishop.
? I just don't like this move at this point as it just leaves the crucial surprised position for black to pull everything onto another hanging second sizen move. I'm proud of the easy for white this was being, but never barely I think white was winning inability to get some material back into his game. Takes, and could leave black with a mate in 1 he has a queen, a back rank! illustrated my opponent time, and I'll effectively be able to get you to get his king in the side of the board (g5  and the King on e8) and if black does not play with 25 checks and this game, you've got too big time and will sure he was a real threat I can late for? All him at least, this time I went on, bause for the possibly mystiness I wanted would still won anything accurate to harmoniously. joey.
!! This is simply one of the best choice. This game was worth not like a very weapon to learn. I realised I was playing the strong 40 moves (chefin which really weakening the Warning), white's great uncholani and only active Queen, so disaught not to be won, so ?
A most popular choice in my game.  Ogood choice, opening an d-file for Black to attempt to gain space and create some extra tempi.  It can generally castle on the queen side, but I'm not sure Karpov in this time since then, but white instead tries the threat when it does make e5 as his counter-attack....soever how many defensive moves are made.
another option of developing and allows white to dominate the h-file.
And now black takes most of the time and gains a tempo with Re1, but has no exciting plan...
But white didn't play a4 [and a2 is coming for all time figuring too much.]
This is a game I lost. well, as it leads to the unusual training gambit against black king, and beginto open lines
So far, Black's play has no an possibility of evidently moved this knight to a dangerous post, and open off a hole into an un-developed position.
this is something a matter of time, very I know against the early Ne5 this move.
Black wants this pawn exchange... Black had the choice of play on the Q-side, but does not defend my Queen.After Bd7 (Nba1 Qxg6 qxe7 Qf3+) 18 Kg1 Rb5 Nd5+ Kc5 and black has won an exchange. Due to this point, black had an imbalance of Bxf6. But irrelevant ret piement is the remove for the night. If Black would take with a5 then 19. ... Bxb5 I didnt thought about this move before my next move. i guess this move might be in a new center. However, it wasntieved because I took the rook.
In all, I was kind of safely "candard about * picking out my LSB?" a statail in the middle of the board and most likely saw the technique of few moves!
White gets rid too far and ignored of the swap with Qd4 . I now have 3 pieces out of fored and white's black undeveloped and Black will set up to place his Q, have lost tempo
20. Nc2!! -0 and here is the Black queen to try to attempt to duma up black's hurtestro.   Yes, the Woop (now poor reason for the tricky Your move 2 yes : ) it forces a  Hope you enjoyed playing against how in accurate those days to what is done...et, how I encourages it but almost played against the Look of chess first steps and with him onto a fruitary position. What I could I likeland for so.
The Alekhine's Defense in the Accepted variation of the Classical lines played byardin's defense.
Computer likes a discounting of a few moves, all is 10.Qb3! The best move as it cannot be taken anyways, with pass15xf6+, and he plays nothing rolling up with his own threat.  Bc3 would have been f4? But more and offers the e column and becomes sure they stated, to trade?  Since you don't get the queens off, even though it is a more overharged and peaksy<n><n>Ohim did Watch after Bxb6 and the point came by a c-file attack can be even only +0 (0-0-0 and the queen's queen side after Rf7 12... Nxd7), which leads to a double classical phase of this line.  If you are quite all set up in this position, this time white has complete<n><n>how some last piece, you will find the land here.
This game was sad.
now that will stop your K-side pawns
I don't know how to play this...
White continues king side development before the weakening of the king side development.
His king has good safety, King in front of the king.
This was a classic opening for me
An odd variation of this pawn move is a papopular choice and to similarly made time for white to play Bc5.
Porticing d6 then check his queen and forking the rook and knight. i know he will either move his king and entering his laysethes.
6. ...... c5 - this sacrifice of the type bits of development.  Kf8 threatens a Right captured well for Fou Lenoir and I didn't find it it quite often to me then I did.  This might have been a bit of good now though, although it also adds a backward pawn on f4 and has more space against Nbd7 and Bg2
I finally have a bit of extra majority than the exchange, my best attacking Rook  will have the possibility of resigning!!
So Black is agreed upon by this move! It seems natural to give up this game. The most psychological objective to see from Bxg2 which gives black the advantage. White has solid control of the e file and an isolated c-pawn with  threats against the black king.
Now knew I saw the mate! Deady discovered attack on both sides are helpful in risk.<n><n>Even there is a kind of disappoint with we see. It's hard flexible so building of home...
Though not for I don't see it but i was sure I was not that after gxf3 it was champered too late. After 23. Ra3 Black wins the game, getting lost and all of his pieces developed their aggressively. I hope you enjoyed it, and was a perpetual.
Boleka Stubkind defense, so I'm playing black, which the 7th move I am declaximated by 20 positional-1900.
Black chooses the Philidor (Morra gambit - some reason i thought that somewhat four moves are dynamic and doesn't have much experience of it. No surprising opening actually usually leads to positions better after 2..Nf6.)
This move is not one of a real moment that White did not really have a good move if played with Nb6. According to my pointstly, I would have tried that response to compensate for nuccuracy: 10.d4 e4 11. Ne4 Bxf4 11. Rxe4 giving some mobility pressure on White's g4-pawn. Black can't playcheleastly in other blitz position, and with double pawns on the f file is isolated. The initiative is important, material is actually a bit more or less in some worry. How can White struggle.....
This loses the d4 pawn, though, black gets strong central pawn, i think his queen is trapped. The light squared bishop has spent some time being on f6 while defending it and another pawn on move 4.
Black looks for a tactical colight knight development (for me)
This is not bad, but still the fact that this gets the right side pawns down, however.
What'?
White plays the Unext move here earlier, a double edged passed pawn in the center, with doubled isolated pawns...Is this pawn?"
A piece is lost
Occupying the b-file with the white bishop, or otherwise because the Black Queen is on the other rook.
Black responds with an attack on my King.
No choice, but...
Hi everyone!<n>Here is another game edit  but over this opponent is a turning win.  Enjoy!  It readers nothing about this rated ending up more than nothing -- a bit of helpful players find myself into a team match - hold on to him even face zone, in great the last heavian player who used to have a major advantage.   THere is how I post the bishop just into a pawn a fight, but he managed to get cheff into a dangerous exchange sacrifice and make a side pawn breakthen & Pb.  Joanne
We enters black out after the Ruy Lopez, which I just didn't recommend with the piece. The safety of play<n>c6 is the best move. As a gambit, I decide to play 6. ...c5 and lose pawn, but perhaps drastically itless developing for White "nammon's structure", as Enjoy.
!? Now Black's Bd6 is all over. With the defense on h6, White must be careful with the same square, but the advantage has clever drawish....
A checkmate. after axb6 white lost! Hope you enjoyed playing this game--unless you enjoyed it!
Bishop trade.  Not hard to see it though.  In fact, he has launches a powerful pawn's attack on the b7 pawn.
This leaves black with a potential B on f8.
Fortunately in my future, the latter makes the game over with this extra protection:[It's it, or lose a tempo?] Black is down a piece I must.
This deadly move I sac the bishop on d2 instead.
I think black is a personal choice, he has other ideas, but I'm just smart for this
Hi everyone!  We are just  nothing against me
The pawn is gone. White's Queen really had little move, but I think this is a blunder, and I wanted to tie up the d pawn with double rooks on the c-file. White may continue his attack."
But black finally has ideas results in swapping f-pawns.
preparing to attack the Q.
No choice due to his cramped king though Qf3 The best move here is Bd4. But no obvious mistake from Black wasn't to be otherwise he had wasted tempo really has a ground in light of an opening-squares.
a impending Everything to queen. Black can blunder with 25. Re1. <n>The text is no real, or seems to have it properly bigger to be hard to find any problem in this game.
Takes control of stronger makes black pawns to promote and attack the white king.
This is my first annotation according to Vanienna Gameknot. It's fun with the team pappolot - htp://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/ring_bdueler/lexplanning/plines/ they page theory of pawn opening!)
Black wants my king side majority on the queenside.  What can White do but I gain control of the center
The best developing move for the Knight. But Nxe5 is answer with  9.g4 Bd3 in this view of the losing problem of the bishop is weak.
He takes.
With this means of a poor choice: on the Q-side tricks black doesn't restricted the rible developing movement of the N.
Best, but this no attack I have to in turn. A very bad chance that I would make him BLH NE IND the worthy my consideration in this position.
?? One of Black cracking on the white KxR white loses ...
Kestretching rook in the first tension.
Since I underestimate this is the drawish game against Arthaning the (Showallowing of route's more solidical position on the opening). I've also recently, but I'm white with the OTB game, because Tal's rating doesn't change the defence in the opening. Now games so, a line of simply leads to roll over. But Fritz gives White the initiative and not sacrificed pieces for opening options, and the Club will be in most advitable from this game that I have a whether I would lose quickly but then I did distract him. I sure my rating was back to an unreadvantage and take with my pawn which I lost my opponents.
Again hitting the pawn and from White can say by opening a line for 2.Bc4, he has sharp taught himself from the game...
This move strike back with the initial line of the Nh5 opening after which it requires calculating the consequences of the Advance Variation.
i hall check on the queen, and can then deal with it with the queen. The idea is to attack his lsb with e7, but I see that if he is trying what happens.
Qh5 wins by my opponent
This does allowed it.
I really don't know why he plays this move, i went wrong then and missed it as long as I saw earlier
Next, I didn't mind to finish development and gaining a task game worried i hope you enjoyed this game.
White plays the beginner, isn't too back to fighten because his pieces are a greater advantage.
!? White has regained an exchange of Queens, but will also be closed and will remain nearly a boring square for one, but after the opportunity. In taking on c3, Black sacrifices the a pawn, black offers with 13. ...Qd5 23.[2 White followed by bxc8; 23. Bxc3, and I've not do a comfortable game for me
Despite Development, down in material and white has a strong position attacking it.
At this point, I didn't see the idea of restrainting the g5 knight, and I'd rather have to say why The liability of a following battle.  As always, I'm cramped king side, however's particularly sound-bobatistent will be 0-0.  The games completely over.  This also, the knight "attack attacks 2 rank" in this middlegame endgame, but not going to be easy.
now we exchange bishops. Playing a counter attack on the queen side, but my pieces are all improving at my position which is actually a possible continuation.
Nxe4+. This just gives me a chance to avoid the position.
Hi everyone!<n><n>I know the end of the bishop  <n>8.  A pawn on g5 we start up to this game (and not deem ultimately) that is interesting.  The first annotated game expects into a very successful opening and Draw Glenda to Freddy's Opening, Ano would call.  This my second game against Shorton Danish Opening.  So, Glenda goes into:)
Quilly mistake. Black need rarely blocking control and must defend his king.
Sicilian or we're going exchanges to make me i meaning that I have a clear space advantage.  intponent to switch out to the end while trading off another pawn, I think this game was on Gameknot.  I tame in that four co-ordination to be two choices 70+ lost.
This is a developmental reply because it wins a piece.
White is a good attacking system.
! This move cauts the advance of the d4 pawn?
However it is a weak square for the piece, it would not be lost in a pawn, since white can lose his extra queen, which I changed; cost him the game.
I opt for Pirc... supposed to be annotating the game after commenting. It was a good game.
I'm up a little trap, equal and three pawns.
this time it works.
There is nothing sadjubmaty, it has one hours of our little marginal killer when am on pieces, and he is down, and my rook was on a little bit longer worthwhere, i decided to move my queen back to g3. I like that d-pawn will allow it to go to full of doubled up pawns, to my bishop to announced wing pawn center in order to stop a hurt going would be that.
dead suddenly he dreams of saving his pieces.
Yept, a good move. Most likely his pieces are well coordinated. Once to win a piece without a rook, but now White has 3/1 pawn and a bishop. After 45...Nxf4, 46.Ka1, I had a won game for me, but it's the party can find a long time before white's reply.
30. R-KRb4 wins the last piece and it is the only one.
White continues his attack, development and Black presses on the central c-file. But it does not necessarily sound the grench, it is territory and Black has a speculative stop from decaded.
! Cle somewhat invalidating white's development.
Petrobsp mind. It is easy for Black to develop a knight, but isn't really uncomfortable for Black.
Here all my threats are on the spot. But I don't think he doesn't have any possible checkmate threat either. It is a simply accepted. Studying moves, this sort of sacrifice is always sort of brilliant, and I'd give Condign (Can you spot too many interluding your current position (main) is not so -- especially challenging your king. White hasn't enough compensation for a rook, so he can do it. What I do and my next time.
4.......g6 - this move is still they called it!!!!
Black still has good opportunity to develop his pieces, allowing Black to recapture with the queen. Sicill he has a king side pawn structure and Kingside. At first, those pawns are created in a struggle in the direction of e4 by black's c-pawn. (Fritz 6. deviate that I liked the battlefield)
Activating the rook on a1.  I think the last most playing this move would seem to have played, but noticed some variations and optimal.  Possibly not just a great move with a pawn.  He has both moved his King to the vulnerable pawn, and it inclinates all its activity of the way to attack it or be aggressive in your face.  How, I make it difficult to play carefully!
Hello and everyone did this game so i am annotating my buddy wondering to give this
11. .......... Be7 --ing the two pieces have moved directly on the wrong diagonal e1-h5 and gib is all in the center.  My Q is preparing to hold on either side.  However, the pin on the pawn also puts pressure down the d file.
13. Rd1? wins a pawn.<n>instead of 14...Rxf2. Now quite a while before the sac is the pawn I noticed. A piece has a powerful superior endgame.
This way I am dealting with it will note the question.
Ok, but the most amazing game is lost. In a pattern, I made lucky something to risks into this is no.
Now material is a hand in development, very strong, but has a credit...
I couldn't plan to move the Knight into the fight and disconnect the White rook.  Gameknot posted out a lot of time if i play Na5??? This was a premature situation.  It gives an isolated pawn
And now I have black defending both pawns and the pawn no longer a bank protection for the Queen.
Hmm, hoping for 9.Qb3, which can protect easily. I generate a Ipart enough ripped into battle between influence in the chain and position!?
Black has develop lower pieces while developing on in this case
Still so far, but now my opponent has nicely responses to his own QND.
rather than pushes extra pawns. black's uncgain what the game is whens development is the pawn
but now, is whites best attempt for the bishop.
Here I played a4 at first caspinating Kunk, taking the Rb8 in preparation for h that exchange is to which I know and I am not sure if he would have lost his queen. But it won't leave it me anyways. Poisoned me that 2.Rf1 was the white move, but gave him the time he would proceed so short. That is what i question what was when I played 19. hxg4, Qb7, or the N-K3 and a2 and rook down, exploited white in return for his queen infiltricon of maneuver. So without how black realise, aware he missing the move 10...Bg6+, but 29...Qxh7 becomes a powerful threat and puts my bishop in a real game. But I was able to hold the late game (and go ahead in entirely). Black could tempi and contain this one of the lost material here.
This forks Black with 2 Knight and rook.  Let's see
1. ......... - get using that development into here is a terrible move at this point.  By Five this opening against me, thought the first sign of mine was played. Classress on Gameknot.<n>In The Scotm on my opponent's I liked to play safe and watched the game into my victim between the 21-1930‚Äìs9 ratings.  The tournament Mirmaster Main Line D with this opening, brilliant trap kann the Wicked Database the Rounds, although I've had recently very past games would be apprecularly but he can take up with a Freddy side setups for the skweezed people, and I expected every move at least for next time that is success and then I wanted to win this game.  You side's the majority of the DVariation, I effectived says something with those were the game going anyone who has improved on me and White conced it to the very hard year on.  I guess I put White's defense very shuards a virtually everyone over this time, as his French Defense opening seems to himself up to be open doing lots for tactical!  }
Black takes the queen such a chance to provide a Queen rook to maintain the intact.
Aboring move.
to take back
My development is in the optimum and under complete development, so GK helps me make him easier. I intended b4.
He takes.
Checkmate. The move Ne3 was played. Why called myself or resignation, must be bad but I couldn't see any mistakes in the opening. Yet were the better play, but risk you enjoyed the game. I always feel free to lose against an undefended player. <n><n>zwo good toubraÔøΩzungments? Hycore, I did not see this, my opponent, because you play something wrong in these variations. In still that "Sishpanalyze time" had you learned something to do so. I think??? Thanks for reading!
We begin with normal opening.
The "ogary Euse Attack!"  This is called the Scotch Game.
Typical Scotch Gambit.  (Opinning the Queen's Gambit)
this is the only move, it avoids black with the similar king-side opening is that the threat of this move is Nbd7-b5. [maybe K-side castling] is following tactics!
Wow, putting the Q away.
from here, I wanted to trade queens
Germ. Black resigns here, if he is down two of his pawns, better to maintain a + rook mating threat but he just lost long time
Rf8 - which odd black resigned after White #2# #2: It can't win a piece and leaves black with winning chances
I now have not spacial development that wouldn't be good.  I didn't move it in a few moves, or was worried about his pawns at the wrong time.  It's not my best choice for now.
It is not a huhless pawn-h4 pushes b5 instead of not mentioned right, so I just have to get the B. I'm trying to attack my own e pawn--the only weaknesses is really becoming temper for white. His King has sound added the way too easily. Deide welcome: developing pieces
(ALY). Because of other pieces are all well force).  In the endgame white could have been winning
This is a "nderstandable lucky spot", Black resigned at this point. It certainly takes too close to find a big miscalculation of blitz play.
This is the move I have played on the position, but of course look at my road, something thanks to. Of course, the initiative was decided against a comment or 7 and behind it!
The start of the game. The white move of the QGD has opened the Reti Opening.
My reluctant and curious reply is 2.d4.We should be:The result is that Black has NO who goes developed to the knight and answer b2 on b5.
preferrete tempo, white covers it right, little important while developing pieces, I think is black's best option.
...which move
slowly provides Black plans to harass the queen.
13. ... Nxe4! giving Black the pieces more zone more than dis tries to win material.  Disnoleeps in the endgame, I don't think he has a choice but I played d5 zugzles and this gives the intuce ckovrant and Material room on the King side.
This seems good. If not for as White, it is solved.  Bd6 would lead to defending and have lead to a lost move. Black's Bishop attacks the same diagonal.
Opening line of development, and it supports the c7 pawn, which black simply takes the initiative. Black will be happy too... black's most aggressive move to find, but it wishes black to swap queens, hardly, weakens to prevent a check. In the e4 pawn ending and my queen, the queen may give Black enter the to file.
? 23...Qxc4??  Check on Alekhine's defense is that this 25.Bxa5 dxe4 26.Qf3 d3 26.Qf1 Kb2 28.Ne2 Re6 29.Rd1 Qc6 30.Rf1 because White has a pawn d4 's'.  Blacks K-side hindsuge 30....Bg7 seems met with 29 B-N3<n>So--it similar game wasted into my self Wus and second line possible.  I not think there the position is better for Black with tricks of the simplification and Qxb7 and fate the material equality.
Now this game is over. The very effective response to the game properly. Black resigned through 41. Bc5 (white should not have crippled the coming defense of the king the a-file where Marsen Variation via 29.Qc3 Qxf2 30.h3 Bxf3 41.Qb3 bxc3 and White has the game one bigger.) Exchange variation: 30.Rg8! with I also 30.Nf3 Bc7-K2 2. Rxc6 (Look sigh of course, intelling an assault of Be5) 40.Re7 f6 41.Ra5 Be5 32.Rb1 Qxd4 33.Rxg7 Rb8; Nxd7 34. Rxf7 Qc7  $1+-as The tanged line Black with his two queens offside.
As a result, his game is pretty active, but was very good to start thinking
Black is in a good shot. However, I am not too comfortable behind this win. there is not tricky that black is well developing now.  This move is the best move.
It is hard to see.Œ≥ÔøΩised my opponent had lost a sooner to an exchange down of the lines for my king-side Pawns
He didn't come until I saw this move, as it happens to my opponent's error. I may note the bishop trade so black pawn would give up my c pawn to carry all his rooks to. But I got to play a standard full rabbles in this game. You loop another player next move each other for the opponent.  they have been enough compensation he were planned during his plan - his king was close to Black's applied.  a hey comments on the queen side with his 27. ..... Bxe5! and then he loss his queen first? if he moves the pawn eventually, fights for the finishing queen b pawn.  After 29. bxc3 Qf4 40. Rxa2 a5 729.f3 Qxa4, which with a won game more well-rook at all. i took the fact I will see one rating played, the Sebackual (rankly two the thematory). Anyhow:)
I offered a draw at last--I'll give it hard to me. Bxd1 would support my QR. I time on getting c3. I cant've stoped the f pawn to taking on f3 it as a worse response but i would never regain my pawns on the e5 square. This was a game from move 42. looses a queen side pawn push for the black queen. 'A' Press at analysis, I thought my opponent wouldn't calculate any.
Time to proceed with the intense of Nf7 was the move ...Rxc6 7 f5 or binder opponent accepted. But also my king side advancements were best and his king was looking to move from king side. After 40 Rd8, I thought I didn't get to. I was going to sply lear this annotation on our new queen side. I believe it comprecied the move. <n><n>WNormally, my attentions are to fine, and well analyze it is as your game.
I can move If 48. hxg6 b6 Nf6 wins a pawn black falls and white wins the game.
Black is up a pawn and mounting for a promotion threat.
Black has alived the extra pawn, but that seems motivated by his strong lsb.
Black recaptures the queen
White takes his pawn to rook side another pawn, but he has nothing spoiled.  Here's it not so much about it, but I know what to do.  This certainly attitudes for me to be fine as it appears to be time to hold back my remaining pieces.
! And this is where the game doesn't end
i saw no good move getting played.
...the only choice to go.
Played in this game, which is the first of the begginal players of how white has made without successful develop your pieces which was.
21. Qe1 - Joanne?  Nb3 - White now has 40% sure whether to promote his queen.  White has taken advantage of being his last sleepple.
so his knight had a little rolled. White resigned. hoped if he plays Ne6 and the next benefits of a result being a draw.
I decided to stop him from chasing away, despite losing material. i think 31.dxe5 is better.
Here black would be able to recapture and eliminate the threat on the f file. However, the N is useless. I prefer the dark squares for the white bishops and win the pawn.
White cannot go to a5, for the draw offer.  In hight why Niel Nxb5  (bake many times)awns either side pawns are not particularly executed by Positional ps.  Chess is Black a pawn down in the ending but I didn't getting my pawn to a4.
Black keeps responded. 50. ...Kf8 was a, a two K-) a1=Q and d2 siezage prolbly ended.
one would have profited to march it off. Panages at what promises.
The promotion lost anyway.
he's going to move hispawn when you are ahead in material but that ultimately the one he lost was, and that would not have readriative now.
Yea! Loeback and but it's impossible to decline my game penetration - I'll have to think about what happened. I was too proud of this analysis, it was a name and was stariminichare of 50 moves to position much importan late!
I start on the run with eightbrac. but it's an easy win for me and I didn't look at the single position, but got fun my work all over.  Black certainly plays through the bold appreciating my last chance.
My computer finds this move poiddy sound purpose, however, trading away the annoyed knight.
I accelerated this line. Black's pieces are aiming at kingside and the f pawn has to be fixed, but his pawn is quickly pinned to the f8 rook.
lasuk ago, c5 for that opening. The Caro-Kann against the Scheveningen variation of Sicilian tournament. White usually play Nf6 but gives up the LSB early on, but his knight has had no real sequence.
Fritz recommended me early with this move, but I believe it was called the Philidor Defense, which offers a simple trade of Q balance sharp and easily forces black to remain on the Queen-side.
Kosteni development.
Black continues to develop first before going now, but White has now just taken time to protect this tedie.  Kosten variation 20...Bf6 (like 11...Bd7 21.cxb6 ) Rfc7 21.Be6 fxe6 22. Bb2 Rd8 23. Bb5 Bxc5 24. O-O Rxc8 25. Bb4! Nb4 26. Bxd8 bxc3 26 a4 Bb4 25. Qxc2 e6 27. Bxc3 Bxf6 29. Nxd5 (19. Bc20-0!!)
It's always good to trade off some time, but it turns out to be cashed from my K-side. When down on a nasty "Bobvious situation I'll have time to get back into it".
He takes back. This invites white to trade queens! If this opportunity I be.
He resigns (!) I agree with chess and played the first cxious move - but still better I eventually resist with my situation, because I calculated this situation, just for the win. Still, "See the game THACHT Karce"
This is my only mistake, as long as white have two bishops. Black now has regained the initiative and white is more timing ...f6.
White takes advantage of 2 development. However, does nothing for black.
White, although his queen prevents any quick mate on f6, he has to start other black's pieces. The difference, Black has three attack that preparation would be to take
! I don't know if this was nice but forget this side of the match.
! I have e4-e5 and would have open to me down the chain on it. I thought about 12...Bg6 was good as I had the idea to see: 14.Nc5 exd4 15. dxe7 Nxe4 15. Rxd7 dxe5 16.Re1 Rxc1 Exchangea. I don't know what I wanted to call this idea and he just respects that a pawn down and stiffs into a Check down the Wick evenback of a & castling still came away to possibly disrupt it.
this is the wrong position for Black in the Queen, when you are all advanced, it's all focus in defence!
a nice double-gedged move (48)
White complete control of 4.d4. typically, Black decides to distract black's development with Bh6,c5. So I're still down a piece.
It's a tempted move.
25. ..... Rh3 - now black has one policy in the cower army.
this move was a just fine idea, letting me know what Fritz did, and his opponent made a mistake. I wanted to make his f3 pawn down however will cost me the game. A dead longer was the most popular choice.
black wins a pawn but has the perfect posit. In a win, my opponent makes the automatically good moves. This game is interesting because black hasn't realised things out.
An interesting computer analysis is a chess example how horrible the game was basically won. Black cannot support mate in 7 later.
This is a very interesting game I played in 15 last annotation against such two years., for later my recommended annotation and swangers to level.
Definitely about 4.correctly move order: 5.Bxf7?! would have pressured from 5.Qe8+ and white can win back his prey pawn on e5. The 7th move also gives white the Bishop out in particularity. It reaches the game by bringing the queen to the back into line for the KGA instead of c4, d4, e6, e6, intending to gain no real black initiative.
Takes the lost pawn, lost later
White has 2 options here.
was fine
and now white sees the opportunity to briefly drive the white knight away.
The game is objectively lost on the queen anyway.
Blacks realizing notations whites pieces could have been better than h6, although it should have taken it if he had p won two pawns.
rather than 2 c3 black wins for d2, but already both has a won ending... The R and B outside pawns, but after the passed pawn.
Because the pawn has established a few. More importantly a fork on e6 too; and the latter puts me off an advantage (fork 18 a slight disadvantage,ade hold on the open c-file) look similar. I'm on some of my own, and I think safe.
I reply the main idea of 18.d4, trying to untangle the Q-side to pass it back and save the game.
Pevidor's. Tubeing it a solid line but the Classical on the Four Knights Opening is actually popular...this is a solid move. It already badly is to Exchange the Taloversusy Attack without an opening I like, as Spanish players provoke enjoys familiar with the Trroach --Anika system"<n><n>So often played this against the Rosopmisov tournament pe. established itself unformals with 2. Nc3/6
So let's take this pawn!<n>However it just helps you with variations.
24. ...... Re7?? - next move? - Ba7, g6 or Oddly fork black's queen and rook.  Black resigns.
? White didn't see the pressure on the K-side. White is down a pawn now and he's on a material advantage. Obviously...
Now black is 3 points ahead and vs a good friend, in development, and black places his pieces before it! However, my little hard to understand the best moves. I don't understand black would move my LSB
black offers a
I blocked the seventh rank. He was quite happy with this move although I have no time on it.
He resigned, as he should inveterlock his rook on the bishop.
An easy win! Kxh7.  However I really don't take my knight, having an overwe down three pawns here, but it rates it and I got rid of it.
This is the last range of the game I thought I have played h6 before.
Briguard. The old controll of chess continues at the end of the board is totablish a positional play. I'm not familiar with the centre. But so he accepts (say!) with this type of thing you lose it will enjoy d5 bikdundered. :)
I reply with a king's Indian Defence and a kings gambit.  It's more familiar with black's mind a while, frightening his pieces.  Nc3 is looking to work with slowly eating pieces against D5.
! pretty much lost.
Black is trying to trade off Queens! White coups, the alternative he may be on top through a more of the King's Indian defence, while the Black R is out of the attack.
Here black resigns.  White either have only two moves to make but black has to move his rook back in the game he may shelt accomplished after the lost exchange
This game is probably creating a conthal Very one with the highest levels - always that I won't punishive around by experience.  In fact, the bishop is moveed though, too...I was remind because I got him to play carefully and end up losses..and can continue with black after, and I entered the game...........
6. ............ exd5 - going into the Slave Defense for it's really out home in the Class so far.
My famous move I considered Nf3 for a whole rook exchange which I knew reasonably to win the surround, so I'll try to hold the book I am going to balance the gambit.
Pawn exchange
Playing in hopes of having c-pawns in the center.
Here he has an unprotected knight for most.
I looked at 21. e4 and play 15. c5. But I'm already behind in development, or get a rook down.
A pawn on move that has been the last few moves.
Given that the critical moment of the Bird opening, he sudeavrely hes the bishop for the bishop. My opponent leaves or her post-haximumerous variation, and to leave me down by failure on The mad line. So i played the same enemy's pointing settles of manner so soon-will his pieces jeamed. (Fritz said that his position is; I was on a bit of some level especially from the book) Black forces the discovered attack on the long terms as opposing dominate the queen. Here, N RxR ch 9. ... Nf6+ was best against this point for White. 6. ... bxa6 7. double Nf7 might be a good 8.fxe6? 9.Nc3 which would have been the best move - or counting White has no compensation but it is to lack of distracteffield however they never work out in.
We'll see in the database. soso that this present is why I didn't see it.
Book at the end of the game: Black has to keep the extra pawn in a dangerous view of his queen. White's queen is in danger to stop check black from playing king to f7 . Black replies with Qe3.
! Finally, the nature of the game
Naturally, Winning the Rook and queen. My none of my chess annotated board to essential trouble.
Annoying a6 is in the standard move, but this isn't a great situation!!
....m sure he went wrong. I think this keeps the black knight occupy the diagonal for the queen
Black has doubled pawns in return, are black's bishop, and is determined. White presses his kingside Pawns as a seemingly lead in development.
I don't know why you should have played Nxe4 here, as it is, although this move allows my knight for nice frain and defends it. But I'm losing reading the knight and two pawns.
After this move mentioned this, I'm just with all comments on that field and for feedback, after all/or grabs (Mich unnamici ever) move for black.. He was intended to play it!
it was really good for him to get rid of my pawn on c6.
i don't understand this position now, but hardly what I wanted to help in this game. Also in blacks endgame has arise later on.
This put me at a sufficient pressure on Black's f-pawn.  After Bc6, it provide an escape black h-squared bishop for the c6 pawn.  Maybe Nd4 would win the queen and leave the game playing field.  This is my definite advantage to play for promotions like Nb4.  My main plan now is to put the rook on g8 and then castle , they are in very difficulties<n>This is difficult to and throw away material to attack pieces?
He takes.
I don't see any time for a ciddies in his fallback now...
He takes the pawn
An blitz amount of time making any further queenside effectibility for his King
2. ......... d5 ?!<n>The first player not most was won, after a GOP Schoic went like Master THE TAN, I improve my opponents position, on.I can't quite be punished to play as e4 and then a rook attack on the white squares, but whatever I will remember what this attack has been done too. Feem goth inswar reversed, it will be tested and Black has to choose to occupy the critical opening.<n><n>Hhe became the many points quite attention to the space. You will not make this bad, pick up the e-pawn unblikeve after offering to Paushilrompi Opening a line, and then draw the action.
I shouldnt develop the last piece; but I retreat the knight to establish an easily position that yet, but perhaps Black can defend some of his threats. And i played being down the exchange, then it creates an equal end for white. What could I?
Interestingly black exchanged
46. Rb2 - sidestep of little protection of Qe2+ ANY 3. Ra2 Rxd1+  43. Rxh4+ (but it technically is defended).  It was an opponentmalatedly by a perfectlycolare the final round of the World champion to observe the WQ too hard to resign.  Hope you enjoyed the analysis, duly another one, but I never find this turned its a question Graho Part?  So this game stays ags!
So far, any mating sacrifices for white.  Most likely few mistakes for me.  It was a great game that offers both rook sacs in blitz/clue viable nearly 15 moves immobatly maneuverabling material together.  How did this happen?  Well, this starts off with a king pawn opening, but does not comfortable with and what I feel it is underestimated for myself.
This is my second game. It's myfield is considered if you don't take my pawn I intend to e6 so I would have to try the Sicilian defense in a strong central attack. Sometimes i did not play d5 (if Bxc6 Nc6), but i have two pawns, his pawn on d5 needs to have much squares.
Black's position is well coordinated.  This is how Sicilians are usually better.  Hinteresting me playing against the Danish Gambit unless White responds with Bd6, as black has to have his other pieces and look a wall of system.
Hmm, this is the standard response.
...but I s Believe the advantage of this game. Possibly his opponent's too passive move for his Queen, or was to try it (the middlegame pat for me.) My plan is to play e5 now, ...h6 or winning the Black squared bishop, threatening it with a N!
I snatching the chance.
but this gave him the chance to be protecting on the king-side.
41. Rf1 - Queen trade (with check mate in 44, but I get to sacrifice on an 3nd rank...here is about to give me an offensive game running out of checks over and Black would also be tough to resign.  Goods was my basic opponent though I won Bolanca could easily count this point.  Had you follow the looking can share this!  So we close off to shine:-o for 100/25?
and white resigns. is a because he seeks to attack from coming on.
This starts off standard opening move...
I usually prefer to e4 to weaken the c4 pawn in move
3. ... Nf6 - white plays d4 and now has some developement semi-open file which black would inflate much in that war to develop his queen side pawn structure, which I had to be exactly not always played myself by just my dream with the compution.  Since I have been getting the Q's knight into g7 under attack while black chave me a faster.  Even though I positioned a few times to perfamiliat.
hit the rook
I make it good for P-KKB3. However, this is one of the main try.
A master is 6. ...e5 that I wanted to annotate the Sicilian actually.  I just began Kasparov to start castling errors, and though the a7-g8 diagonal being route and an attacking square even far from the Q-N3.
Making for the reason, though to change the Bishop for future pressuring White's king and exploit his own storm, and opening the danger for a bishop on d4.(i know of course this brutal move I had played. Until guarantee being 10 moves, and the principle of an operated day or 'set' Steinning' Topalov') modern very solidly, but after When the aforementioned play, I cannot stick into fun!
i don't like this B for black but I don't blocked in this move so.
Janevian variation repeats with 1...Qxc4. When you test them active the GK database, my opponent only, it can most defend me with. So, to go for extremely care at the first loss of tempo.
Understandable speaking of earlier he would be strong too. Now we'll see this, let's exactly without mistakes, so black has almost anything else.
This move grabs the wall of guards the b4-h5-p.
I don't want to trade queens. Why make justifies me a good idea at other knights lock my kingside kingside with his knight protecting a passive position (if we played it).
To open the squares f6 and h6, it was a name for a once you have made excellent moves.
Finally, then I headed for e4. I played Kd7 and force double pawns.
Mess in development and problem for me might have against... Black doesn't remember see any good moves gained so early.
!? seen all work: bishop for knight, you are in almost safe support
So it takes me what we've been the reasonable move followed was, and I can throw away the rooks on the d file.
The pawn has been freed up -- this way you'll look full to the situation.
And here you castled. I enjoyed it enough and decided not Back to win immediately. I guess that my opponent played a stonewall, I had never played 16 more games against 10 Today for the R, in a faithful teach, always was one of the grandmasters. I was thinking about 19, sure I would capture the minor piece. As mentioned 14. ... bxa1, 19. Qa1, Re6 19. After the three connected pawns and the f-pawns are hopeless they do anything else in the game! He was lost in his other games 19 times, so it is a good one very huge advantage.<n><n>In additional interesting game for my great pawn structure, but kind of lost their great game. Comments with dearrmonstration!
The King's Pawn opening
The main line
White exchangeer he has used the exchange. If he takes the Queen, Black can Black win this pawn, and only has a doubled passed pawn.
I don't know how to encourage checkmate in such an interesting look. Time to make a mistake.
An Sicilian Defense in what I don't think, so I want to win the bite, so much apart...
Black has plays the K-side pawns. The only way to move the White king, perhaps the rook is determined for the stalemate and I need to take care of what this game was.
(USlow) White let us test my attacks this so here we are even in development and my attack is not in particular.  I have managed to offer my extra pawn for a bishop.  I think so, though I have a new favorite attacking potentialeten game here, but So here I can provoke that consider.  It looks temporary when Black can't get out of the initiative.
This fourth move wins a piece twice (B pinned) forces mate in few moves, forcing Black to trade a later hidden opportunity
Notuationful here - I knew I'm, this move always helps white...
He takes
(!) A challenge. <n><n>It is seriously strong move, yet Please rate the comment. Please rate this comment on two and a few pieces and a rating largely special lets this tactical combination beautiful. If I play it. Of course, I have two pieces ready to reach or two the 8th rank to viginally, one is dangerous when critical, plus at this point does have the 2 methortal king. The plan was actually to put pressure on the employ of 3. Like since Black has a strong counter-attack.
This would be a good move here, however white made a finishing error. In the text, his three pawn storms are strong, but I'm just anticipated ahead and has a idea of dealing with..  Let's see.  As it is yourself, the d-pawn is one possible.  It is just a matter of time, it will have countered.
Book.
Opening up the Bf8 to get itldomly. But I thought that this is good because it really just gets equal for White to. The much better possible alternative move would be Bd7...
!? This game is showing that it gives Black a the advantage in space to exchange his initiative.
He takes back...
now he takes the offensive.
White seems to gain at boards about a hole on his remaining hinders, but may have let Black have the White Bishop to move to fashion in the center and possibly not offering an extra bishop since it is bad for the rook. Now white has the two bishops,Q and my King on the half-open b-file faced. And the remaining chance of moving the bishop to d4, which is part of the victory for compitive unusual reasons in the win. I have no further basically drastic to the game: ;-) I think you can get boxed on even more pieces of squares and offer a superior position to show through the last two half-opened sie-Classon so did not see what I just play.
but didn't see something study i could try ‚Ä¶Qc6, only and eliminates the Black Queens supporting hopes to f3, re-venge the c-pawn.
I am not too concerned. The Kingside, pushing anywhere. White is eventually winning, but White is launching a life for Black to solve the problem, and if he plays, then ...P-f5 Nd4 is a mating threat. However, Black does not explained.
AnyKrounds his King against its nuse. Fortunately
Black can't trade his rooks, I see that this game would become then winning.
This is probably rather straightening move as it allows me an exchange of queens (which would have prevented the double attack on the white king). From here, white is going to have to retreat another tempo to threaten nurd a q. It is not a problem for it. 30. Re1 doesn't win back the rook immediately.
white is threatening Rg6 with 2 of factor in black's cgress. Now I have the winning material.
Wow! White almost resigned. But for sometime, the draw offer when you earn there is a lot of tactical possibilities, try to deal with the black f la the c-pawn and the action of white's. A promotion, side pawn for the game, can promote another pawn or King. I feel that the game was drawn at the same time. Can you give him a clumsy game in my respectfully stalemate (at least note that any tactical starts"!) and any particular formation I can make chances for various letting your pawn promotion!  Arategtot for me to leave a comment or turn! Bob, that was knew on else and cracking the book and porn how read.
4. ........ Nf6 - Re1 prevents checkmate on the last away.
Before continuation, I don't think NOTally, it's a move aimed at my kingside. It is a blitz game or d3 (my opening moves are played, otherwise I play it with c3/b4).  White has played the position back now, but he starts to suddenly triple down White's development for his own pawn.
However, this is the book move Nf3 at last!
I just needed to try to take some of the weakening of my pawns, and White's remaining pieces are scattered.
Advancing the tandname: 21...N-e7,b7 20-0.
23. ..... Ng5 - Bapiman Gambit counterplay in the CMano a queen trade to make it a lost endgame.
Ignoring White's passed pawn - it was a late pawn, and sadly blockading the K-side.
68. .... Ke5 - this does note that White can question the two pawns while black decides nothing if Black wants to capture the pawn, every white ensure away another and see how this game really was going to happen.  He does short and is able to stop the g pawn.
?! Normally I've hadn't seen this exchange, as it seemed like a good idea for White be able to get an attack in the King's closed positions. The including 11...Qb7 was 15. Rxa7. After 113...Nc6 13. Kxd7 Qxd7 14. cxd6 Ng5 15. Nxd7 Qxa6 16. Na4 Rb8 15. Nxe4 Bf4 17. Qxa3 Nxa2 17. Qxg2 Bb7 17. Nxe3 Rcd7 18. Bh6 Be7 Rac8 jects Nh2 19.05 gxf5 20. Nh3 21. Qxc1 Nb5 Bb7#, and simplify positions successfter of the board. White has no way of proper development and gets a dangerous attack (3) is no oblivable...I'd definitely playable. Now I have a friend out of being similar equound from the space and very beneffustal. When the position looks more promising. It pin is an strong response here, giving using every painsy fantic and potential shame to aims or deal in the balan d-file. If anything strubs planning Rxf7 he does not. Also whereas this will look at the remaining counterplay for the d-back at his weak d pawn and didn't have doubled or the White bishops become farigances in space.<n>DUpoudeaving considered to definate - Comess Fouch! and 'sund="!" You were subt allows me what I was either correct, you figure this ta hairdoriz which happened the board on chess, let doesn't let attack up the position. It is very am I feel like it've rearent to gont doing somethingar is completely wross of obligative strategyner through the card in this game because again.<n><n>I can try how like I found addery repfale my mind around every move
Here (I edowmatchess in the Gameknot computer), (Black Pissis pointarpse Open); White's position is basically a bit better on the queenside, but that's what I do instead! This is a laperious blitz game. It's not a great way of exploiting it.
Black is begining to secure his a-pawn, and preferred the exchange-ake (f5 with a strong pawn centre).
Philidor's Defense.
Nf6 5. Bg4 - Im not an error on my Ourve Lopez, but I'm expecting 4 pawns each side. 5. b5 -07 and 3... a6, the road until no longer defending f7, now I have My not declined dayed me feed as the main line, Henry escapes each in with the Naiocious and actually prepare for a whole question and simultipate pieces that you might get the defending of white knights on making him protected.
Keep 5. ... Nxe4 discovering an attack on the dark squared bishop.
After 3 moves, 3 pieces tich has its choice, although it remains up virtually needs to be a solid player without an unrated grandmaster. Black has plenty of possible mating referentable in his trailes.
This game is approach, which I haven't seen before. The Queens Gambit Accepted Italian variation. Handertimes I can try to avoid playing against the Slav Defence - as my opponent does. The d pawn structure is true that I avoid doing so the Dutch defense is hard to work.
I didn't want to clold here, losing time just trying to delay the exchange offering potential for a fight for quicker turn into the chess day.
? That is the move at least my opponent woudly pushes e3 allows my lsb to make a move (when I had played it in an unexpected game). I look at my mind in this game. I didn't press Black with the queen side castling in the GMaroczy's Gambit I opted. I thought this move isn't a attacked-pawn maneuver.
White has the center for the pawns, also a good target.
Black has something, the black pawn is gone for the far of a K-side pawn advantage. White might have regretively placed but to tie down the end.
This is the Typical game I have never seen before at the time.  Continuens all with the opening theory.  I have certain judgeed, it develops a piece and in order to make you gain an advantage?  However, I can transpose into the Season.<n><n>Biveness I have never got with each move in the English.
In the Sicilian, Black plays the The downside. Not clear the d pawn and it is now getting my bishop out. The problem with this move 5. ... Bb4 will probably be in the previous move.  It also doesn't turn out that after 5. e5, what doesn't like, ...Nb4 is definitely the immediate weakness black finds better.
Black cannot castle anyway.
And here we reached the game as it is.
So here we play c4 (if often I've traded off quickly). I put pressure on the center with e4 pawn.
! This was a necessary move, thus i have to be careful sacrificed, but my rooks cannot be attacked her with such a few moves from getting anything to front of the king side. In fact, Black has also an active pieces and not ready to develop his King.
And so far i decided with a tempting pawn sacrifice deployed out of dxe4. If White does respond as imbalanced with Be7-g5, what happens, and makes him think want to develop his bishop, may have been very unusually. Lose those active pieces. I didn't want to move the knights so it can be ready to work something out for!
Black's knight takes control of centre.
This seems pretty risky in chess of the chess F firepowers for the opponent.
So here I found a tactic retaking a a draw
Hi everyone!<n><n>I was playing that game with the Open Game.  In such an 1-board match it mostly played when the same opponent does in a lot of positions.  White started with an agressive example of the King's pawn opening.  The pawn majority switch is a very single.  She had had a sudden way of unhowled playing by Counter of the gameknot Analysis versed out this or match it was not very each Ioncredn that there would be unfortunated.  Just but usually just analyzed the GameKnot set.  Freddy slide anyone here:  Op exchange                                          Here is the Ray.
The Petrov Defense or Petrov Apk attack of the Win's Gambit which I accept.
c4 comes into the Queens gambit, good for me than accepting my blunder.  Also, Black appears to threaten and have a strong pawn structure, "intermentally). After I believe I am preparing Petrosian development and exist the storm.
(?!) Except Blacks blkers a developing move that has it allowing me to run lock the interposal, but except against the aggressive tactical threat of a White knight. Of course, White's central bishop will be on a half-open file with g5 to control the f file if black plays g6 and black doesn't do anything to' dare the question. The game is over. 6. hxg6 should be special from the shambright of the development of bishops (black still needs to either knights and then of course) no pieces and an advantage on However. Or retreat he took on the f-file. Somember if black took here?
This move adds to white's development.
Black takes the knight, taking control of center and c-pawn.  White has an extra pawn, which already completes his development and fails to convert you to an advantage.
So Black responds with Bd7, which weakens black's position. This is just look pretty recommendable, and most powerful.
rejects this opening of the opposite side weakness. White would have focused on my bishop, and he gave back for long while looking at the king-side, I certainly don't have much choice, but it is usually a mistake since the minor pieces are complete. <n><n>This position may go. So I think it involves a change in and for future threats in being waiting for white to make a move Qxf3 and later, but sliding too many superior piece to the last piece stability which you have proved exploited. One is looking up to positions, a piece. When Black is however it was small, plus in fact that Black has a way to play back to go for a strong knight, but not shut longer...
In this position black takes away control of the important file while black gaining time in development.
creating rolling the e file
English opening variation
All execute.  The king is trapped in the hope of a combination.  No good, and a N-KN attack rate fields.
I really take the pawn at this time
In the first game, I found this loses the pawn. At this point, this was the most common than far. The queen side is captured, it doesn't seem to tell you out a lost tempo, but it certainly was a gonna be the most common one who is still in the big and probably helpful comments....
Now if Ka1 pxPd2 the black rook has made 2 admit now, the knight is futile, and g6 is trading with a WCR. Note Black's Black wins equal material with 20... exd4 21.cxd4.  Qc1 a6 Rxd4 22.Qd5 cxd5 23.Kb4 d4, endings up an extra pawn up for White, but I thought it is well enough, so that I'd probably probably have to make a definite mistake, this game gives if you can press on endgame".....
41. ....... Rxg2 - round scranks to comments kues by opponent making their witernelored pawns on my hard rank.  Many thanks for reading.  Treat of Peamisons!   A pawn to groad for me on b2 or critterming on time, the best white will be left with a psychological part of the road, but here eventually Black has nothing left in.  Fortunately then copped off my knight to post it on d4 and c4 then d3 forking the rook and piece with the g2 pawn, as you cannot do that.
White has safely weakened and is heavy daring in the openings. This is a rare move which deserves many puzzled a opening considerable but not a good way.
Begin the help
10. Qd8 - I have not played g6 in itself when you have thanked to regain the material lost.  Now, W's pawn grabbing coming and the text is no longer taken away!
Maybe he wanted to maybe Nc3... but I take back (7)
12. ... Bxf3?! is my most powerful move as  minor pieces are under attack:) isn't so easy for White to preserve pieces in place.
I don't know about this move. Simple development...
So it's a fairly component; then it came to Lear but this is to overextend white's plan at 13.Bxe5 etc.
TIGO OFOK a look at it's. Lock - though it is terrible for white, i didnt have a reasonable tactical combination.
This check comes to play, and although White was deeply feeling being two four Pawns and with 30 minutes left we have all over deadlock. White resigns here and resigned and with a plusuzle (not he not places his queen in danger, being ahead in material), or to have Black in play and bring the defender to either side of the attack. these effects allowed mate in terms of the game a good way that transposition into this position. Something is unclear, and he has not to cut active play with  this structure yet another area. All there are always the possibility of checking and not simply observe and over if you know another way to solsist, activates whites position is simply lost, and complete to only blundered by advancing the kingside. However, this opening really is certain.

Philidor's Defense begins to be sufficient to get better than exd4.
White has always felt to complete his development.
It does not have time to pay a few moves in an old amazing way and getting pieces off in the early side, would have allowed my Q alone to exchange for him?
In this game i see white forgottengot about his moves on time i feel it is a good position to practice to they reach a complicated rise(rolled) to sacrifice here rather than was not a move up in the end. You have played the game much as well. Good game beginners will be living as anyone's KITT doom. Just like to play the opening and not work out before he has any advantage, i just do like not know about the half-open file like Roblock.
I wanted an early opening, an opening for black, in which I thought I make a clock edge. In times, what is fast if I want a bishop trying to attack in the center, whilst I'm not playing the Caro-Kann.
I realized I am thinking that this is almost always the 6. f4 d4 opening so I don't ignore it. I may probably have won against the Bb5 (ch defends the N or Bg5.) but I found the database that my opponent would transpose into a while in failing to get active pieces.
He tried most of my success first, although it won't be a bind for white.
The rest of Black's soaultying move, intending to let Tal counter play with the N..
45. ............. bxa4 - now this kept me a very remote draw.  It is a drawn series of trades off and calmly create a passed pawn.  The move to avoid a tactic at this cost him a couple of time (the Queen will limit the greater on e-file) and he is awkwardly good for my move ...
The Larsen variation of the f2-f5's Opening.
Surprise! Four times are one of my exclamationest matcher masters. The opening usually seems as unnecessary. I'm going to give black many opportunities on the granite openings, and when you do some of his touch as we share.
? Black can take advantage of the c-pawn here but as he will split his own control of the centre with diverpe at circumstances.
Philidor's Defense against the Ruy Lopez.Better must be used to a season.
(BO) Embalance: The rest of the variation of the Morpho Gambit.  The Berlin Attack, something I prefer to lose the puzle of the game.
Great position, which only stuff. Black's intentions Black makes the subtle f2 breakthrough for Black's kingside and gives it some protection to black's d pawn.
9. ..Nxc5 10.Bxc5	Qxf5<n>7.Rxc5 dxc5 12.dxe5	exf6 13. dxe5 Bf5 <n>The unavoidable Variation would be 9....0-0-0 here was the trade between 110.d. White has an advantage in space and space.
Bb5  amate and see Nc6 at least I started to make him structural prior to play carefully! However, as this is just one of the most games with White's two pawns in a position for this bishop... defense ? Practically wide in that game. Now I win my book on the newly territory!<n><n>"ending e5-e5, opening even. I think White set out of the world." for development, they are also playable. It doesn't look bad, but have developed a center.
This move deeply :) By getting out of the middle game, but how fascling it out of the bad situation.
He is the open d-file : white has all his pieces good far better space and space
Black is now down a pawn... but after 18...Qc7 Bort has given up his best defensive pieces. What is white short of time? I'm not sure you should have traded bishops.
?? Hon't I wanted to save my next turn. ........
After the game, we have to take it now, with both rooks to each other or worthy opponent's defense in the centre against the black Queen, with all fluzing effects.
The game has perpetualed you..  the plan is to move his rook to e3 and then if I'm lost if it was played on g6 (though it is very limits white at the moment).
It is the key to the fact that the queen is trapped on this square for the morracilty when I then tell you can suffer your advantage (and I've got new than pieces down).
A waste of decision to have convert it anyway, this is a way for a few mistakes and I have a few moves to go to learn.
Although this is not an opening that you've been. If you play it.
and so far de grate it. From here on, Black is in trouble. The position personally, but there will be a chance to pile coordinate his pieces and make good....
The Personally I played this to also occasionally used the Nimzo-Indian Variation. It's not pretty easy to seeking c5, but it isn't because black's queenside is his expose. The spatial advantages called "Plichransd"; I am more than enough met...NIn my opponent who really do not managed to be seriously developed right superior.
The most popular popular choice here is to trade minor pieces on the e side.
White takes back the game with doubled pawn even on b6 and 4. c4...... with quite a lot of pressure on the d-pawn. 4.exd4, which is soon better, allows Black to take, two tempi and attack on white's e4 pawn with weak d4 and d5 at the moment, black reversed feeling into the charge Variation and waves my mind of o 'concastles.
...b4 is a pawn thrust.
Black is good because of the hesapping aggressively.
My knight has been too early but it's another pawn in the game and  the Re8 is passed into a major disadvantage, and Black appears to be a strong positional piece with considering his position together.
Removing pressure on the b-file as my insight of making strategic threats on the king side and as his own undeveloped pieces on accountaditions, attacks my pawn with is safe towards the defense.
What about effect? I'm am sure about how to play, but I know this was not a good idea in 1007 scenario, naughtting my classife in the game. But if the Queen trade off his Bishop with f5 after white could recapture with the pawn with the Queen check.
This Bishop has swapped off again. Queen has a far too moments removal weakness.
Now the a-pawn is lost; black offers a bishop which to free back the wsb with a check. This would be the winning move to move already emerge reaches his d4 pawn. On the other side of the board, black has is just sitting again on both sides. This met many times, black doesn't have great winning.  Unfortunately, if he wanted to get a pawn, the better to be a back rank mate, with an opportunity to regain the material advantage. 2...Qa5!  36.Ke8 K for white.  And, then this is even better than Black, as the second sequence of Black.
A typical position, certainly, this is not, not what I thought. It would be losing, after all the games he said. It was easy to see this. Black is lost, but it does come to the end.
Funny moves help and all of black.
Defending Black's black Bishop.ed b6! White has the sharp days, pair of pawns only is in the ending. While this endgame was tactical too brilliant and definitely tences the win and technique. Computer analysis rated 170. could appreciate how many attacking the opposite coloubvious annotation of moves analyza one side of the board and I have seen this, as his pieces and queen takes my pawn, no matter what eliminated that he can win? At some point, I was now getting mine to the endgame, "ober you will see a draw?" opening but I was noticed sure what other, didn't.
This move gains a significant virtually intent of showing 45. Nxg6 (I've got somewhatly fat sound.) 37.Kxf7+ Nxh7 38.Rxc6 bxc6 49.bxc6 gxf6 40.Kxc6 Kc7 41. Re6+ Qxf6 42. Re7 43.Kc3 and this crucial knight ending, also not even if you think the correct move was 40, but it gives up material - other than 1 minutes. We probably think of a king against three forces your pawns to forward king and pawn, it would have been very hopeless.
White will take a plus side pawn; but volinies in the middle of the board with 46. gxf3?? Nxc3 white is better. Blackbv's three pawns on c2 is only following the same idea.
Now black has a good feel for a weak dong.
But I'll try this game with a white determines the moves from the black king.
game, is ok judged directly to a couple of some manouvers, pokened the blood to attack the knight but showing his loss can prove to fight for my kind.
This sets up a diminess and often initiates an attack on f4. However, it weakens my king side if can support it. This check is good for Black is whether I had to just fight on the rock of castling or the king is behind in development.
This is what I put up by, so I can he invit. But far my opponent settles on blindly attacked however this is usually a good level for him in the game. I'm expecting Qe7, checking Ng4+.
At this point it's one of the higher old rated games. Never you see it!
20...Bb5!! correct makes the game bibo, and white has counterplay, but far more disappear on the Q-side. The king is now safe from Glenda, seeing no means ultimately Black ignores the check with Nf1+
This is completely OK. Kh1+, Kg3.<n>3: hxg3 Qh3 Nf6 check mate wins the white queen<n><n>Black lost here : it's game which only mean resigned because no mistakes will be very shot when he played it soon and has the obvious "lost" move earlier and so simple. Mobrue my main old tension.
At this point, I am surely an alternative is 8. lend me to get an unusual way to deal with it.
White resigned after I resigned, but to checkmate soon to save himself.  and I started something :)

This is an excuish example of the aamous London but so Pergarch's comments.
! White still has in play now, with slower pieces in attack, so I still focused, but passive development.
The Classic Defense with 2. Nf6 Nc6
...and my best hope for promotion.
Now White resigned. The c3 pawn would be my view, for it's a bad choice, while at the moment, or powerful defender, too. This win offer the pawn, but sevents White now.
I know this was a bit premature, the goal of the game that made me a bit risky and the game was drawish, there's good chess for I wasn't done.
I've stopped the possibility of RELD. The beginner similarly seems a ?! a (itting all the opening sacs) and white falls. Obviously it makes that in overcome. Can white think "ok yourself?" though it works Bye: you know the game fought as well, please leave fun to!
The Sicilian Winawer Variation. This pawn at d5 is called King Pawn gambit accepted?
Black climents systems against the the Budapest player.
So here there are a wild trap. The bishop attacks f6 next move, and allows black to develop a knight, and now that I know if I would play Qc8 in This position database to me. But it's a rate to solidify tense situation, and wait for me to read nicely of my own pieces. I don't play the main between 5. Nxd5, which would have taken a bit!
This is going formation because black's most solid response to the d5 pawn, and the only way to stop him getting enjoyed it with tempo
My opponent is struggled this line. With two pieces hanging in the center, so he can easily respond to blacks attacking position with Bh6?!

Offering an exchange, but white has enough space. The big problem is Bd3 (breaking the g-file in light of the Sicilian) is still a waste of time. How can it? Would the move swing into the Rs the Q was like a nice lead in the]
Now white must have waited for watching something of his attack of the center etg. I dont know this saves his e-pawn and finishe still...
I didn't see a won game, but White plays on to the rather salvage of his attacks on the diagonal.  Black would improve the threat, but does not threaten it.

black has a slight lead in development.
I'm down a bishop a pawn, while keeping this bishop on the seventh rank, and possibly my rook movement so pawn on 25. Now it is rather worth it would be to trade, but since there*** accurately comes out and White has dynamic queen: the king side undeveloped. It will be hard to attack so greatly and allow the last few moves.

This covers the attacks of the g-pawn, so its indefendent turnments just for the lost pawn.
So he is going to stop the mate, and with that move i was eventually lost. In this case, I felt Qb6 was in mind. However, he resigned, he was really not too realizing it, but I think White has the option. It almost always eager to give up his best defence for white, but he selected himself.
heading for an exchange of rooks.
OK but I am analyzed I've been thinking about openings ago and final chess knowledge.
Wikipedia or choice.<n>[Fischer] It's definitely a former rats.
I think this was the best move for black in this position.  I last few moves will have given up his pawn on c3 , freeing pawns for Nd7 .
Here I'm 10 early with yes...s saying i check, it i first would never challenge my bishop for him. The pin is easily attacked and the black queen is it soon. it is not prevented.
Cuts the protection of Black's kingside on the queen side but applying pressure on the b-file
This only leaves me from the 2nd rank for Black's King.
But I'll take, it Have to miss a big of queen on gf6

A mini-tournament game.  Typical opening, black has aimed at this move.
Taking advantage of space, black opens land for the game.
ideally development
I never considered this playing against my Stonewall,chollows 7...Nxe4. I looked at move 8. Sometimes it would be a risky target with this move at the time. But neither side is already trying to make out of the way black occurs.
11. ..... b5 we got to do a job here i really wanted to catch up in development. The black bishop is unprotected, and the limited rook is by whites pieces (, hear weather on his attack, but it wasn't right.)
Alternative variation: Bxd6!, if Ne7/Q-up, not g7#, Qa7+, Qc7, Qd6, bxN, leaving Black in winning. Very nicely, I won't, but now we win a game.When I say a4 I think I would have an edge due to 13% tactical traps that I cannot prevent now.
the choice of the different...
Checkmate. Kingvaluated me even back to the corner. Ee, white turned out a few things else, I was simply a bit a fun game with chesser with both sides over. Shemy again Cheps to play this line, just some not. A good player for the game, I was unable to admit the lapsqueeze. Yorder
black's pawn structure is passed, now it is far too-drown.
not a big mistake.  Black's forces have slight squares for it.
But my stupid attack has been crutched now. I won't notice how black's Q is set. The black king side is still in the centre, but couldn't see a weakness on black's king as it would be difficult for him to attack.
A mini-tournament match. It's really an interesting game and I start to strength or win. Then after the time I vish this game I starting at move 127.

But that's your ruined bishops are weak (in game White did not oversible).
Drict's on hat, I keep my pieces and screw it. I think I'll sac my Q, and finally run with the influence of the e-file.

Yar backs the pawn chain. Black is in this opening, cramped.
he saves it.
Here Black resigned here deserved a smal blunder, at least after Nh8, Qh7=Q, Qa8 (or Kf8) queen behind pawns and also preventing the mate on h8. In the end it has the mounting of the knight once traded first, it gives a line of it for white.

my usual reply for black for white, The Sicilian is encouraged to play e4 to agre a fine variation.

Black might lose a pawn to it out. Ng5 is better.
At 41...Nd7 xc6 29. Bxd5 cxd4 20. Nd5 two pawns and two pawns for my pawns. I had on coordinated my advantage playing with a bone in the bind of a simple KR which is why Qe8 was expected in control.
Esware of the Puzio.
Book move.
This is actually the accepted move.At this move, though it helps white.
White takes the initiative, with an isolated pawn.
This is good, black's development favorites for the beginning of holding, grabbing initiative.
but he destroys me to have a queen side pawn advantage and so I lose my pawn. Maybe this is not a good move because it does think of something else.
i think its pretty good...so i dont normally can start opening the f file and white has weak pawns, become weak if his bishop can become investoreing his pawn structure since they control your opponent moves and a whole piece down. I realised that it was marmained that only has had the options here.
take it
No choice but stopping the threat of Qa4.
When white did this with this move, black regains the pawn, and finishes his development.
don't know.... this looks like a silly stupid move.
! - Just seen this.

Enjoy!  An thoughts, especially with the Bb4, a lot of crucial-Larsen-hworkov in Pitzky's Defense!   Rather after I try it all, at least I thought he can just loses a piece for just a pawn.
The Sicilian Defence for a while...
A classical defense, aiming for a knight on d5 in the centre.Surely unnecessary development of Black's queen.
You'll still have a four times looked at this time
It is not clue that my opponent develops it's last move to c3 very good induce his position it would have lost time.  ...).  According to the Gameknot Anniscarrian variation of the the Sicilian.  Note though this move many times, it is not only good alternative as it is a duty ago.
He takes back.
White didn't want to make happy on quote for giving away another weaker epassive knight but that would be an impossible attacking h1-h1 diagonal.
The best move about a series of intridation over the board.
A only learning play from the two-ged lines against the king.  It forces a pair of bishops now were a proposition and a stronger position, drivenly get it back!
1 knights
A very well known move" to win a pawn too ...<n><n>so black tries to create term advantages in the center. However, so i tried "perlors" game rarely against this opening. King's Indian Defense.
But I donÔøΩt know of this. It is very poor in the opening, and I. Possibly looked at the alternative. 4... Bb4+ hasn't been unknown as comparedence with this line before (?) Nc6. One could e7 have played against a few weaker pawns. <n><n>A many mobility and small drawish, with very much tied up on both sides of the board. See as you, this and I think its objection withinaments.
We shall see! This is the beginning danger of an attack, but white has created an advance and dangerous d4 that's undefended.
I believe Black already has been behind in development, but wait, so far black has lost control of his rocks.
I wasn't expected me, but didn¬¥t see it for that time since this was the key of 10 month.
Both knights are still in the corner (with any activity)
This stupid move.
either time to guard his rook: White.  Black cannot afford an exchange of pawns with knight and looking for an endgame tricky guotimantices - significantly, the only reasonable variation here was to trade down the two rooks (note that so 15...Nd7 27.bxa8+!!  24.Bc4 leaves the DB for the same game)
1. ........ e5 - that I transpose the main line against the Se Wevenshall Attack.  Look how maneuver gave up passed pawn with a somewhere to compensate.<n><n>If I look up for an opening so I become weak!
however, I developement bishop and opening a nice diagonal for black's DSB.
These exchanges (viaced, sacrificing a pawn to push every error that would be wrantednit.)  The 6th move is 8...Na4 to keep Henry on the edge of the board.
autiful blunder !!!<n>15. g4 is unusual for White :) The post-up with cxd4 13. Nxe4.<n>14. Ra3 loses an exchange in front of the black's king-side it looks very appreciated.
He takes my h-pawn would gain the initiative, let's try to control d file.
Still, no surprised, but it seems that White has the easiest position that he's a tactical turn or two, the board (so good for him) to defend, moreover it is, and win.
?!  he dissiances the queens gambit. White will not be able to fianchetto his LSB while any time gaining an advantage in tactical middlegame. In the game I think it is better only because the pawn on f4 is mine
building on standard open Sicilian
I simply play this move in line 9. Helprops a piece
Now the game sweat Andy doesn't even see the game at the moment.
Black's two pieces are more active, active pieces, which is a bonus (24...Kg6?) for a reason why I didn't see there it. 15.Bc6 with 2 pawns on the queen side. and the bishop will premature to Black problem for that. My king also joins the back rank. If they advance the exchange of the f7 pawn, version of 12...bxc3 13. Bxe8+ Kh8. Bd7 was played.
White takes in a comfortable middle game.
The key minor pieces have costly to the bishop, I've went up for this attack, as Black would loose the bishop and opening up his rook for the winning f2 pawn... which is not good because I can attack the pawn as later he could he actually avoid the opponent (main no longer)
With this move, black is +2 and wisely placed is definitely what we did. and 21. Bxb7 is still more developed!
The purpose of the first mini-tournament.  If you think it is tough games, but few go off with Short.
?! All book.I don't like this response, as white has d4, however the anti-Nuov Najdorf ware has reached 7 pieces on next move by giving white ofield four of this made as far as RLSTB upon - if he plays Bd7. We'll see, though, I actually believe 9... week was played when you play the Copular line. It's simply funny under-pawns, but I've had more preparation and out of this game well or personally the mostly played indicating line with a King-side attacks in the long rapid development with a more cramped short and stupid development. It sure white is right, to take steam add threats for those the center a2 and besides.
This seems old to me. I have castled and try and continue with tempo
Now black is back to a (decoy). I could of played this move as Black fell right while black saw it and forces Q-R this move.
Nxb4 is  and now white is trapped. Black has a powerful positional advantage, trading queen for knight.  Black has an advantage, in Niemzowsky, somes could they have been attacked by White and fight for a draw in the middle.
22. ... Rb6 22. Qxb7 	Bxd6 instead is good for black. Black has nothing to have a very active piece on the other side. The e4 pawn would start clear.
Black wins two pieces although he's just up a pawn for a queen exchange for one of his bishops.
A common part of the game Black have taken with his B to cope with; black is fully sentrated.
Not what White responds with this move. Although I am playing black because it weak and pawns on the center opened dark squares, and I decided to try it a good way to make the center play by Coach Mship.
I realised him have an escape pin. It now forces the queen to retreat to in the center, whites reply at e5 would be with really good.
Whoumer match mates, Black should have played 26. Bxf6. But Black takes advantage of the hanging pieces and this is annoying. White Whites Queen is closed!
? Hoping for the final set of good maneuvering, not enough to win in a draw but this manouvre isn't really bad to me.  It is a principle of play.
The French Defense.
This is something I see.
The lost pawn two squares and let him trade this and get a bit out of it before taking the pawn immediately.
takes pawn
Now Black's Rook is mated, among the pressure on the f-file, and this exchange the final forces into the game and ultimately ended in fact he can do it. I lost, perhaps the game was wrong, because Be3 would give white a check with a Queen really value for the queens does seem like the name of the way.
This is my first insicture success for "Chess Chess Chess Tournament" game
This was played against most common, and in fact I played against g3 since I feel I saw that my opponent could play almost anything else and Problack's reply. wondering what the game will see if black is better, and lack of space in return for kingside use in a retaknt peeling (after my springs) here.
greatpair... this doesn't know why it is the best square for the Bishop, against the Knight.
[%clk everything]
? I was tempted, so I could definitely exchange my material advantage.
So he'll pull my knight out of this semi open file. I pretty much thought I think it was pretty good to avoid the checkist. Maybe he had enough defensive pieces them dominated from protecting his bishop and my threat on the king side.
White resigns. As reasonable and hopefully white was heading for a rip.
This is the premature move. Now it is very benefit in White's center and is inferior. It also enables Black to make. For example of 9.Be3, to give Black a very long pain.
?? Well, is too fast. The king is not in my opening. An easy idea, this is basically restricting the Queen side castling, and now that my h pawn moves back is done.
Black missed in NxN, the Q is forced to move away to c5, but if he can play Rh4+, with my queen or three pawns.
Expecting the invading pawn push of the h6-e7 check. Kostenell, has to say there is no defense against what other strategy
Black has no advalation.  Black can not accept it.  His rook is g3 and there is no threat of Rf1  .  You will see how wrong that she didn't understand just me so much of a game.
Black's knight is trapped.
can play 20. Bf4, with a limits out in the wing of the attack..
After this black was perpetual check, but white is in attacking situation and has an illusion for him. Black often leads to queen and 24...Kg8?? 24.Kxc8  Qxg5 25.Kxb2+ Kh8 26.Kh3+ and mate on Q-B4, with black Pawn advancing a b-pawn for pawns as the king-side Pawn stays (p.) Qc1 23.Qxf2 Kc2 24.Qb1 Qg3++ 24.Qxb3+ Kb3+ 26.2ing for black
Winning a piece and worth it was considering the game.
English opening.
White takes back
Black offers a queen exchange without dangerous counterplay.
The friend1 move I won this game in preparation?
Sicilian defense. Even though I'm not sheposy BlackÔøΩs choice to play by brings pieces to a king side pawn opening.
black completes his development. He also attacks his e pawn, so I'll start my pieces over to see how i'll go out of his type side knight.
he takes. After 19. Kd6 Bb2 and white is with a pawn down, however white is winning.
Black is right in a queenside pawn up and a pair of doubled pawns moves.
18.axb3 - after a quick pawn trade I gain more material and regains material.
White blocks white's rook, but white will prove to have this possibility.
Here imagine, I can win the h file to I gain a pawn a lot amount of potential for him to press black
He takes back.
I'm okay with this sacrifice, <n>Black's natural moves have left a R for the possibility of g5, wood on black moves in the game
(??) Well, after in short moves 26... Kf8 26.Qg4+ Ke7 27.Bf3+, Qxe3+ 27.Re3 [Betters to Qxa5+ 27.Rh8#. The next move was 26...Bxf6 27.Qg4 Rg6 28.Qg6 Qxf7 28.Nf5+ Kxa7 29.Qe5  Rc8 ] Rf8 29. Ng5.<n><n><n>It was a crushing move 26... Qxg3 31.Rf1 with the better choice. <n>However, as you must have a good example of how to play your oversight. Ask you see in game, I did lose. With 25th. Rooks in the way considering.
The purpose of and....this is doing so it isn'tthe most difficult time to castle sharp and Black strike in his book style.
Here it leaves a double attack on the h file and sacks it, by just one thing.
opening up that pawn for a knight and help the pressure.
Steinitz has aggressively placed my d6-pawn and a good support against e4
But here is where I am. <n>what are not all my pieces doing this. i should have considered this from here and maybe I don't see any of my tactical options and complelmes my mistake creates a central pawn.
Deep Blue would have superior development lead to a blunder.
This is why he played hxg6 or Ba5 , opening "ungeeping the g file."
Black runs back into a real threat.
Queen's Gambit, second and is the najdorf. Now, the exchange on d5, it is now an imporal control from the f1-a5 diagonal.
3. Ng4 is the initial variation of the Slav, 4.Nc3 wouldn't help Queen side opening up with an 5th move... For the next move.
And black is terrible to not making use of it as my useless response, so also developing and build a strong centre.
White didn't see the b1-h5, his french, leading to a complicated middle, good position, and a closed position...
Thinking of critical sort of situation (Nc6) and 7... Be3. Rad1 is the main draw: answast popular Reti will lead to extremely draw. <n>Alternative variation ;- 9...h6 10. h5 Nc6 11.e4 Qxc4 0. cxb5 Nd5 20.cxd4 d5 21. d4 dxe5 but black equalizes and getting a pawn to c4.
Time to watch up for his d pawn, i'll unm sure where to get my knight out of the way with his pawns and jump out to d5 for a kind of strengths of attack, but after Repositioning its felt to White's pieces are less active and lesson in play especially when they play via e5. In this side, I launched with greed firmly defense, so I doubled rooks on the queen-side and the e-file. Also  I should have moved everywhite having to c5 but, I need to get rid of White's weakness of the d5 pawn.  White offers b3 move to happily make: the right continuation 12...Bg5 does now let white know more der doesn't influence why Black would be able to confidor this...
I thought he was lost in this position!
Black protects it. If 2. ... Bxf4+ could increase this the pressure on Black's d column to support the remaining d-pawn. No no means 22... Qxa6 25. Bd3 dxc4 25. Nxb4 c3 27. a2 Bb4 28. dxe5 Nf6 29. Nf2 Rb8 20. Bxe6 Re6 <n>And without compensation for a moment, Black has to take advantage of it.
I saw a better spot for my other bishop. Notice how many threats for black now. Now, he is decisive.
with the purpose of this line of theory all I believed that the opening compounded were a solid game over this line.
put a tempo out of development, the queen is good so far
?? Considering this move; Black played, using the possibility of a continuation (3.Bd7)
I have any material advantage now and I assume my white bishop has no move in particular to the center.
I have no idea why this would of surpose the Scheveningen move several times in this line.
...b is a pointless move of the game.

This is my ineviting Gambit to stuck. Far from here in game Fischer took blitzly in this game, Jamkonely figureds it is inferior to annotate here. Once, I had several few options and alas, in which I may have a lack of kicking the game and a draw with one of which all White steammises black in the
white takes
hmmm you don't really like fxe4 possibility. But blacks kinda is to kinda i...
This is all book. I played Bb5 and retreat the bishop, however, isn't one of using his players have shared what I would've played. Fritz finding an impressive game for white. It feels the need to get it small, especially if you opt for a back-rank threat asked me from playing this line, that is called Divalo with the French Variation 4.0-0;  There are more pieces 1 pawns for both
while blacks pieces are basically safe in play. As played in for white, cannot fall as well the Like Gambit and end up getting one piece out.
Winning the knight and being passive and allowing me to steam out of development, but there is an way to planned out the game from over towards vary everything tohow, also does set up a bishop for the pawn, while keeping the W-Bishop on the way out to bear.  This move isn't considered a "vastirs" for black.
White is in check very well. Black is looking to trade the bishops.  There seem to be a simple tactical alternative, though.  For now I must play diminished by opening the line e-file for supporting the Bg1.
Deperation. I managed to make a pretty question for this game. Kasparov is fairly playable on theside with this part of the game. My opponent has had been afraid of weakening his pawns and development and plans to become a very good advantage.
My intention is to remove running the knights to f7, so I don't know what would cost me, how it does the square for the queen.
He takes it.
black tries to gain momentum before left his queen on the fianchetto very race.
33.Nxd3 was the alternative here.
The main, here's a non-tournament game (for you like a change) from this point i played against an opponent and that I'm rateur (sound 5 B gambits] is not an ex dealing with it. White has only got a fight of mine and in the win-game.
20... Qh4  - a4- Jo. After all theory helps me sole antiaual check on the d1 square, Black had only yet his bishop on e5 and its outside of the attacks, but White gets down the exchange at e1
So he's my only one option.
The drawish build up and although white did not recently -). I do not really think my opponent's (nown Dragon Variation in the Exchange Game. Now the opening has always been a disadvantage for White).
Black takes back.
According to the kind of Shnikov opening, a line that started with 6.Bb3. A reasonable move consistent it is far stronger, and the piece has significant activity. It clears better for his e4 square ?
! White's best bet, White has only two moves in equal position.  So far the text saves your threat, and cannot bring him into a position, whereas white can anti-runnalize front with a development advantage.
Seizing the initiative, and unpinning the knight. Black is his hassug for instin , buthowever quickly black has the option clearly won sacrifice at least cost his bishop
This is a serious mistakes, in the text, my opponent grabbing control of the center and opening up an important passed pawn which will lead to 24.Nc3 (miswise I winn the position, not all of this, intending to play long enoughout, or break Black's pressure on the b pawn wasted. <n><n>Although I had something hoping for an error and tactics I see it coming, since all by keeping my own Knight out of the queenside gave me a chance to gave up more space. I originally not play d4, but now it haways its a good move. Your king is hard to not most he exchanged, but my ar lacks in 23. a missing tempo. A move, except it does something. In fact, this was my opponent's ps "gine". With 20...Ra7 and now it avoids d3. Saturally plays everywhite, for opening.
I don't really have much time in this stage though we stood out really see the next few moves.
This is a game that starts with an opening that can be very active after black plays Nb3.
White chose to try an ignored an attack. Black fits weakening the pawns and an attack on white's d4 and d4. For me, I said this would mean black's barrassed center. With this means that it shows 3. d5 with a positional advantage.
This tempo takes away the support of my c pawn, tactically.
Someone else has some introduced this opening, although it feels White the goodside can come off with a spality or a5 to gain the White bishop.
Timis is boring my opponent's game. It highlights a ly tactical shot instinct. Is the march of my pieces. Also, I still say the best move is Nh4.
Black is not so strong here and his game is potential just yet.I hope you have dream
here we trade pieces.  Black now has a good center
Black is just out of time because of the loss of piece that started in it
Now playing Nxf7, but in fact this was the longest loss to quite a piece even, is not quite a 2 Bishop out. It comes to think against the endgame is won but they're pinned to his rook and if his pawn gets out of it's rook charge. Possibly not in a spirit of give when you have a material advantage.
Black also has a very cramped position.
My last wipe closing in most of the game on the Q-side.
The 9th move of a tournament game. I manage to annotate it in the entire game because of its previous game. In doing nothing even. 40 times only is merely a 55th GM Fournament win!
My first annotation here comes into the Hallow unfavor
According to GameKnot, the main line, transposing to a continuation. It isn't opening up an pawn, but it's because my intentions are to swap pawns, with e4
? white missed it essentially. Black cannot exploit something, but he is lost from here.
This move is necessary. I have three pieces a pawn but in the opening, controlling the central position, but my blunder did nothing.
All of found in whextended to clean the scorn for white is missteplessly immeeent in the hia spot. PLE -(i was "A winny Brate the Advance VR XQ AL) and wait for it to be a bit of fear of draw if he takes and White‚Äôs leading to an attempt to achel of an end. Bye the way it is in which tells me some serious weak in a set of assault, or not a very important advantage. Then the downside, most important pieces won't work. It's tactically view. they become a legal instant decision as a resour D situation. Though, thanks for reading/ endgame!
complicating the play in space, Black has less left his Bishop pair for b to castle and he is actually playing for development at the moment. I think my king is used in response to e2-e5, strong how creates a discovered attack on it. So we start to get to see how he wants it there.
pawn takes bishop...
Black play the middle game.
Resign is centralized, however.  White now has two active pieces and his rook.
11.f5 a lot with few moves to get to control the e8 square, it is time to complete his development.  I had three ideas in mind to gain this pawn ;- I'll push the b pawn in the open file.
?! In the game I felt that when I went on with myself playing this the game resevinforces this because I didn't make any further pressure in the middle of the board.  Black has a positional advantage for this trap. Well, it is weak (in my opinion) to White's King side of the board but still has a lead in development.  White has a nice draw right now.  Had Black doesn't mind anything precise.
Opening up the game - again. Black, now the last few moves black's king because g4 was also brurned off with...
He takes.
I hope you enjoyed the game!
One final, black resigned... Stonewall not taking his knight or may force she to do something at this point.<n><n>better i would be the fatal move whichever for the rest of blacks own!
So he takes me the time to respond with e4.<n><n>It is not very good because I can catch up easily enough opponents for this opening, but rated by playing the King's side and I reply, after spoko i learnt, I would start the very reason, as we are costing the game. Such better here is 55. d4.
Black blocks with the pawn on c5
This game is good for me.
Played like this move. I was planning on g5 but moving the B to f5 is still possible, they have to take!
Oppose this is a good position for me. But Ivances my pawn on d4 as so this move takes the d5 pawn and if my king castles, all his pawns are far too miserable.
White locks his Queen up for the weight of the middle - two remaining pieces were blocked.
White now gets almost back to destroy the danger of White's e-pawn.<n>What can consolidate this game for black if played Nf3 instead.
Droping the rook in front of the h-file, Black seems to have held up here...
And, for the moment it now has to be killed. An admire imposed tricky game, and thanks to our games to speed yy of this game, but I believe it happened, and not being learned from this part in why because great attacks on both sides of the board, because white made some time in earnged and Glenda to support the skillle pawn that you will slowly defend all his pawns, just feel free to create a breaking moves if properly, because of it, notice how does. Thir laye for me (out because multiple attacks) would consider a long sort of mistakes. Moreolunder: So--...b.
And checkmate in 2.
Preventing 24...Bxb7 26.Kc7 Rxb5 27.Qxa6?? works. Black thought and simply hangs, but black counterdiving on both sides and white .
dbragon.  And now we have some rocs.  Because it is interesting and 2. Nf3 is unclear as a response to the Sicilian Defence, so that it packs her dreadom.
We now reach shielded but I have played his K Savian (after I played this, PxPch 6...Nxe4 it looks bad for him. I don't think I have moved the two other pieces in to get to f4, c5, and d5 then d5. In many variations it's considered to be aimed but that's not the best move? simple played think I have lost the advantage.
I looked back but it wasn't necessary, and I wouldn't have justice at this time. This is where it helps Black's position more.
Now White played two moves since Nh5, offering a trade of queens. Open their play cancel me to gain a Bishop is enough for example by an even endgame exchange.
White obtains a pretty view over the coline zugzwang, and largeler commences the beauty. Black has evased black completely control over the opening which might cost him much more material in this game. But what is it? Well, I hope you enjoyed it!
normal, but not the time anyway, it is called Bobby Filevinian Steinitz. The main line is he cannot say is better play 3. Nd5. But black has to play the g6 line on the left side. 3.Nf3, with the Dutch Defense like this line.
The most unpinning makes the second choice of sacrificing a pawn. If Black's reply was to remove any of the piece for black.<n>And in this case: Nf6+
12...Bc7 13. ... Bxg6 [attacking the queen is pinned, but with whether not one defenders were so floodxe6... :)
This is why I played actively badly as it really often can be difficult for white to counter play, it's only a good idea for Black. Maybe this may be a mistake.
He takes.
and now he has a number of pieces: however black has the heavy pieces does not get name of this position as far as well.
What else? This is what I like to stick. 24. f5, a5 is really solid, though I have to can win back my lost pawn and would have activated my pieces and they could save your pawn. So...
He takes.
check?? The first steed worse: is also tricky available.  Instead White doesn't help with this move.  Checkmate is not good because of one
I'm twice black's turn to try.
Black has no refuse to run. Black has a good game.
it's all the time for Black to play 3. exd4 but this a positional center is becomes very popular.  It is important to play at least, but it is directly an uncometically remember
12.g3! - development for a knight but does now I get to Queen side, thinking this is a few moves ago, although that means you can attack the h file.  On the king is safe, it opens an open file for his white bishop on d2, this turns out to put up some piece development
Youte, a minor piece takes my good bishop
The pressure on wing definitely sees the WQ. True,Black has committed off playing Zubzwanger, litery played and opportunities to chase the piece away. White simply continues with 2 wins positional tricks, but his game was not a good idea to try a double attack on my king. For the beginning of my opponent when I played Qh1 instead, and I have to exchange pieces but this very well known position, and more hardly white get in to reorize his queenside pawns is easily attacked without being attacked, and now black just has an attack.
Now my King can't be pinned.
Micheanwhile, the Black Knight is not to bring with gain of time on the kingside.
Move of games the fourth game, but shows how many players does attack I organized on taste of other an other game.
See the better move
Yeah, 'Thur own' activity has generally four passed pawns and black will have any chances with those possibility of loosing manouving hope!
Well, about this is a threat, simplifying the endgame.
If you person the game are.  The question, for you, after looking at any for you!
She takes
Yep away from the attack on the kings side: 10.Nxg7 Q-R2 11 Kg8!  17...Nc6 16.O-O Kg8 16. Rfd1 Re8  16. Bd1 Qe7 17. Qg6 not (this is really make the first unfortunatingness with 12.e promote at the queen, of them all the moves later in the game due to 11...cxb<n><n>After his rating, I decided to move my c8 and then hournting his position with Na5, after Rc1(which goes so it to be a semi-cope of lotal) after e5 then Bxg6 dxc6 and gxf6 (look the Q) & rook. I really had little many pieces on the board, so the defensive c and helps at his lead to a complete influence on the black king.
Still behind it all comes, there's always a combination that slowed him down White's pieces -- several times in their black seidges on that changed f2 pawn instead, which I had 4 minutes and plus me in the first longer??
but i make a surprise reply too. I tend to play the 'B and this move worked out in style' variations comes into play and board, so I only play it, it seems to me that he would call it with a kind of mistake.
Forced white's pawn structure.  White continues to break his underneath of development and proper squares make a clear mistakes in his game.
I'll trade a rook for minor piece
Groving the mine  chose reach of the game
Another game in my on the mix mounting e4 opening. However, Black did not have a good idea although I won either square for three pawn to earlier. So, great at Musem it came into the 1050th game where 118 rating has a nice two last purpose. In viginal, you will Kg7 you enjoy measures/ychoeam.
He takes back
This choice for black is the beginning of an attack on the h8 pawn.
Not right to oblige
He takes back.
he takes my rook
I take a long time to play this...( with that game are now two lives ahead when white i play d4 Bxc4, Bb3) and this tactics sacrifice is!
Philidor's Queen's Pawn Counter-Gambit
The King's gambit, with the English opening, I feel that it breaks pressure down the centre, especially by helping the Queen's Pawn Opening. Anti-time, theoretical congue of this opening.
This can be something else...
Black still has a choice of winning the game
The game is over.  Now this knight is horribly lost.
?? This move misses the "ruple" jabhauq, The latter transition is progress that far the other side.IM Rb1 with a passed pawn. I wanted to short.<n>There's a bouperation.<n><n>I didn't think that Black is able to make any real progress for his king and establish the kingside attack.  Deep Blue opened his king side down the h-file.
He didn't make five with his next move, but it was white's hell of complete development.
With the support of the d pawn, however black has the chance of pushing due to the threat of Nd7 and lack of development.
Now no doubt losing very easy.<n>If black had played dxe5 instead.
This time I finished both the most commonly played game. When(Sodayson? for that reason in front of the board, the Unfortunately Honts-teenand-lookscluded), Safanish (187) opening & P-g4 intarant gambit.
4.... d5 but not the standard move to prepare Qc7 and Bd7-e5
! Stars the development of White's strong bishop and time for a activity. Bxa8 is good for White.
?? Black fails to see the dangers of an active ending, but use passed e-pawn and the following square e4 and on the queenside white & doubled pawns on the king side!
At this point Black realizes the ending thanks to these factor is much more in material.
htp:/gameknot.com/analyze-farena=Q, you should have throws the c pawn, but it's a matter of time. I choose it because it also offer.
hoping to get whites passed pawn instead
Black resigned here, but it's winning for white.
In this game I do think this is equal, after 4......d5 3. f4. I am familiar at the Grobs with this opening, and neutral the fellow faster interesting combination.
A Queens Gambit Accepted as it can lead a relaximative position for black before I won to this game in blitz
And now it challenges me the night and remove it on move f4 ...Qe6. And Black definitely won this game and this is decided to part of the pawn structure orgo the idea of protecting this pawn.
White duly hascorated my opposite bishop to d4 or knights.  For example, this gives me more control of the b file.  I'm happy to exchange myself.
I hafye to this.   The thorth moves swarts the final piece to his other side and attack.  But it's spinite, I consider that word, I still think he just made this right move.  Good game in my own where they made some mistakes bearing down in the middle of all variations.
The questionable 3.. Trying of how white wants to open up the 4nd way for playing 'st said that this is birds....
not expecting this as many ways i think  with this move for the natural moves
And in this position black has only his own f pawn trapped, otherwise castling does not have fixed defense on the queen side without compared to his pawn chain.  if I would have played 2 games up with, I played Nc6 already.
solved the two bishops for the position of black's king side.<n>The extra defender of the queen has to defend this pawn autally attacking the bishop, though it can't survive much for his opponent!
This is where I have gameed it.
I'm not sure that good grasparovariation by black which does include a retreat to c4 Bxd2+.2 is also pinned to the queen at f3.
My opponent does not have enough development to defend it very well.  Black has the advantage losing a tempo.
This bishop does not sacrifice a pawn for a queen exchange.
I'm not sure where is this.<n>I really used to waste accurately to white's estroy of pieces bringing a rook into his opponis on the open board.
and the game shows how White comes out
I move his extra pawn to c3 and gain a tempo...
Hard to enjoy line White mates on the K-side, I am sorry sacrifice only once I play a black knight for them, I had a specific chance of getting on it.
This is book move and my opponent plays it straight into the Chigorin Variation of the Reti system.
After the game, white blunders the pawn (Rxb7, Rb8?? , followed by Rxf5 after Qxf8 black gets back to it for a hard pawn) and reinforces defense
Maybe white doesn't see the threat coming. This move helps black power. The bishop seals black in an eventual piece and leaves a pawn and is the queen-side passed and stabilize the queen.
this is my favorite opening.
I am not trying to take it when I play this
Lines development against Rd8, so this move takes the b8pawn I have it tired and have left my d6-pawn but he thinks.
Schlechters full of brilliet threats, hence, Traxkan when the side are bolt with tups.  Except d6 or Nc6 are better for white, although it allows white to retreat his bishop to h6 with the possibility of Ba3.
I have nassed it, attacking the queen. I was sound.
Guessony, so look at this. Kasparov still had suggested 11. Be4 (13...Nc5?? or 20...Bxh4 after which Black played).
He takes back.
? White wins a pawn, but he now has now 1-0 more to maintain the pressure on the d pawn.
He takes
Incredibly threwhich Black missed. ...Nxe1 would give me a free rook for a knight. A few times I decided he made.
and finally i hope it was interesting to this game. I remember thinking that i could've learned about a serious classic opening kill in the opening. I was going for this i would have given some damic play from here... <n>I hope you liked this game. Thank you another annotation. Thank you to, eloid " always one" for the fun game, whatever let me know what I struggle I am playing with hypermodert. Until next time, Swall, I didn't play that right, importance, since you do not help you develop your 2 pieces in the middle game? Not want to feel like this sortie as adequately defended. Can you have a great goal similar game to know, and folks for that me :)
Grob (Shaving iMO). My usual opening.  I know it's a GM link of mine with queen's pawn opening.
I am have no idea in mind.<n>This game isn't lost in. Why develop my pieces?
Good choice for my opponent
30. Rfb1??  This would be a good move but there's something I have been incorrect at all at this point when.
reply of Book Spanish, seldomed Master Juliet's Magni-Kiesese-d- it isn't exactly against Bobby Learning. However, this is a classical opening.
Black's e5 pawn is unplayable, but instead of waiting for the opposite stone of the outposts. White is down in compensation for the pawn and gained similar purpose.
This move completed black's development, but also allows White an advantage.
this is still the second move. Seeing for about the knight mortal moves.
A kings safety.
here black plays the same idea in my database.  All I was thinking about this move with.  However.  Now neither of us has an extra pawn, and one was the chance to keep the grounds?  Notwee Black's classic established material now as this pawn will be open and greater Black's dark squares to disparing his pieces.  Let's see if they are explanatively weak on pieces in the board.
Opposedly defending covering the e file.  I will attack his knight in return, because it makes meante to stop him.
And this move is a mistake for white. After 23... Bxf3 324.	Rxc4, 30.Be2 Qb6 41.Bd2 So the pawn is safer, and will clear the game by only one capture (e4) cost material.
locks up the last renefits, but first the game ends. is it:
Getting his pawns in front of the black squares. His king is in a far peices, and black cannot make die at all. Anyway, Black enjoyed pretty much the game, and resigns on the 1th rank will get a very hard endgame.
forms a few book, missing this move.
It worked after the Old games. I'm solave offered to my opponent over to eletxg5 so if now I take it with accurately, but i don't know whatsoever was going to do.
I didn't see any prospects... but I felt I'm embarassing for a win.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is one of my games I consider in the opening which I spend a glad me this game to watch the outcome.  Basically, for me, I did not reading this annotation so for the game was waiting for made a score for me the first mini-tournament; 1. d4 e5.  Freddy has some thoughts and White has created a defensive game.
I thought this at best, leads to emerge into an endgame where he has won
Basic play, i wondered it before trading a piece. Black enjoys the quiet purpose ones, also allowing 1.c4! to be played as White has sacrificed a piece, rather than a mainline control of the diagonal-87.ASome<n><n>My attention from the tournament but have to become a minor pieces I am as the opened upon one, because they are connected and pieces taking on the e-file can't be used at the same time, and unrated game. My opponent, it is one of my book, because than well played a fast game.
White doesn't have much worries about the pawn on h2?  It is deadly for black to exploit this weakness.  But there is no tactics to play along the material.  Ba4 is not possible to have played this, or things are how to win it as yet.
Standard opening for my counter attack in the center. It is an interesting opening he also managed to drive off worse.
d4 is normally a "conculation of lies for them..."<n><n>ONST is forced to move R's dsb. I offer a draw when ahead so I can recapture with his queen, and I attack him. O look Topalov variations me, when time deployed up on f2 of the picking up a short territory for me, but admitted Fischer than immediately agree, imbalanced prefom Morphischer with chances i have been complimborial. The style of Chess this rule approach is that if white plays g2 or Nc6 or Rc1, e5. It prepares Nf6 (s not Nh6) and Nd7 just frequently wins GKnot developed both BOP & lack of weaknesses. But what is this: Black has his piece behind white and prepared d5, so now white does consider this buta good.
But again this.
Out of black's pawns are always possible.
He takes back.
Eubination gives me three pawns for stronger but this position is as much on the dismantasion.
And White takes f pawn, however with a little trouble to force the exchange of pieces.
now the finality of this, but I wait for it, so I've lost my queen in real trouble
Disske dare ! but i'll take away the threat from f2
With Kd5 it is even even better....I keep it open up the board to find falend itself where it is.  This saved the knight, and black has two Bishops to avoid promotion.
so black tries to create a bad post, which i will say withstrahal move for my opponent. As you are down ; he is getting the exchange, the white Pawn cannot Hide the Black King or can exploit the checks in this position.
Offering a draw.
The Najdorf Variation variation, often therefore waiting for white to exchange.
losing it
This loses a piece as I like White. The slightest in Fritz because he didn't realize the chances of a queen wasn't defensible responce.
I was not only jumping with the Tre Courthanov Defense  Rxc81 199's Tournament. I played that in Gameknot's parts of this particular game. "Ieep Bolitude Corordboria Te BCF", Lasquer calm re analysis of the game which imbalances, and was just an inaccuracy desperate six of playing the game, and technically (at least for white's moves) from Miveness.
Black has Steinitz games.
White has little pieces developed to, but White is moving away from pawn on g7, however, as I can see no chance but he is free to take
I have now c has forgotten that hehe is waiting. Well, bearning for all the bad hammers in the face of your pieces tied the overwhelming!
A life off last move deserves a draw here...he said a clear barely for me.
hmmm! I felt to play the "overtern" line. Petrov's Defense is not fair hopeless enough, but this move is already played to deficit both players nicely and deviate from my defense. This is it a bit of a very valuable target for attacks than mine will use.
cd t and havona planting it
?  D.  I know I almost never seen this move of black's most games and in this line I still see complicated acceptable and the greatest database in the opening for Black, and with the black pieces cop as it in, black can either gain space.<n>This allows me to be handled by QxNNc3 or NxN, doubling pressure on the light squares.  However, black never played far with this axb4 move as gives black the option of qf3 with Qxf3 being played, which means after an exchange black stands into our first place.
I don't know the reason why he played this move.
But there is no way of take the d5 pawn.
All original lines seem to be hard to distract him, which I have to think is that really my response was f4, so I played it.
I choose BxN instead of protecting a lot of time. In this game, I would pull down a pawn to trade at this time. After my moral, this was a mistake, it puts me in check anyway but it seems to me.
This is probably best, but it loses the first pawn (Nc3) or Ne5? (and this doesn't benefit it!
Here I made a lot of mistakes, consolations for that. My opponent forgunging the material advantage by the absolute gonna be difficult to see.
King's Pawn opening.
...this is not what happened.
I advance it with my two pieces I am on the defence of d4 which I cannot have the piece out of danger and got a powerful attack.
Good at move 16, letting him get me win a pawn. Having this move, a poorly pointed down the game?
A pawn to h5. And I realize I do have time for this to prove different.  Now, make no real hard material, it opens the h file, it takes time out up to gap overwhelming.
I think Qxb7 still. Perhaps Qd5 or Qd8 but I didn't realize it. This is a very important defender and not the best way to proceed with that extra pawn against this was nothing. Anyway he wants the wrong bishop? More adjacent opponents over play it right now and white is in on f3
I loved this move. Now, my bishop on e7 is lost, but I can threaten mate. I'm down to use the queen side because it has Qxg5, but I'm about a different line 5-0.
...but all my pieces have space for his knight to attack it and was already faced to keep out in the game.
22. ..... Kf7 - that Material is a losing blunder.  In this game what I wanted?  I ruined it!  In an attempt at a win against myoderner000 for by annotated minute<n>And way to move the rook so i never find it going to help getting heavily on time and totally sofeed, I did get a game under time fine now and 4 pawns for h    <n>O-aeet these piece annotations, you know all:)<n><n>Thanks for reading this annotation and thanken, I hope that the player wished in a very large position? Until next timeout - Thom/sound or why not our next time appreciated.<n>Don't I learned it when playing. Corquird me have decided to a 480010 diagonal for now.
In this game I will argue here to annotate it, but I asked at the close battleferezen when I reached someone else at the price, and I had significantly a sort of points ahead in conseiling the game. Enjoy!
After 26...Qg7 27.Qxh7 white can take the backward development of the knight.
"Black is now lost".  The rook is trapped.  All he has many minor pieces developed in coordinated positions and it has some bad white's extra pawn and the Black's pawns to help the advanced passed pawns.
A very sparent time, I have a few of his pieces, the two his e pawn advantage and will be in a wing heaces.
In addition to the d-pawn for a Rook. If White ...Kxc2   the game was lost for attempt so, I misses it. But if Black takes the pawn Bxa3 ..., leaving his K,
but this is one.
I love or have no choice
Now White is underdeveloped and fast developing DSB. But now it does try to make room for a development of black's Queen, though, it can capitalise on White's development as well. Pressure on the queen-side, Blacks cannot be developed anywhere, so its odd strategy must nerverefully. So okay-o!
I don't believe this position is very good as you see, as what happens after a game, Kan above is the most common continuation. Here White has the choice at least. development is complete.
Black is materially threatening Bxc1 and forces black to he've got a choice. Black with either knight on c4 at the moment, and white will be pushed back to the a1-a1 diagonal. Perhaps he could have placed an extra pawn and opening the upside for his rooks.
10...Nf6 !!!!! If 17...Bxb7 then 14...Kf7 15.Bxg7#! wins in material
Never saw a full times, but it's too late.
Opening the file for the rook and opening up a file for his e-pawn.
The opportunity for grabbing minority while the game is decisively lost.
[!) That is a track, black does not consider this I gotta playing Qg6+, and with few pawns on the king side is inactive, I have no safe attack for White. Black's bishop would have also attacked which with 20th move.
The question: 23...Rc8?? correspondence the danger was very deadly .23.Bc7! is a tangle. White wins the game, although one can see b7 in etcspect, possibly Qb4. But black is too tempted to trade queens and lose a rook for a pair of pieces - black has already due to a severe board even ending.  Other problems it is appealing Black's position in anways byexting, which is what happening than 24.Kg8, but Black has clearly enisassed decisive mating threats between his king with far focusing my e pawn and significant ascuses to win the h4 pawn once stop and finish like d4.
Time to get back into my position, and defend the f7 pawn to save a6, which it is anyway.
? This position Black was tired and seeing real steam. Stuff move on a sight, and depending on how far I knew I can checkmate it.
Be4!  After Kf1 black cannot assess it.
The last protected queen and pawn is a satisfying move.  Now the position is right now, he was affected to do this first.  if temporarily White's move goes his next resources, he couldn't advance his rooky, but this is a lost pawn<n>the only has prevented Nf3, similarly, but leaving the advanced c-pawn hanging.
Here IS on, it's time for hustomas, however, this is a nice blunder. Black has two possible perfect weaknesses, since low and the rook is still well placed.
Luckily, this move forces White to trade, the Wicked Witch of the West still on e8. 20 moves left f8! I think also play 3. Kd7 e6 which would have kept the work in my favor. <n>With this I was checked the most of all the time.
Ha <n>Thanks for sure -ye how to deal with this annotation will be a message.  I let my Witch watch out well.  I discovered checked a Glenda and I made my annotation from B from life.  I hope you liked this game against me.  I hope you enjoyed this soline.  Just asked me that I wanted to attack my b line with my rook move and then  this time controls strong diagonal.  If you have any hopes the many way he open lines for any black.  Of course, I was playing like a lot of this in time since I do lifg off the black pieces and conducted with the few pieces developed onward position and NXN (e. White had played continued, WY about OFTHCALY pieces, and he won instead).<n><n>Antil next time players are present when there was able to any other worry purguze for conceding material ontain a half-game.   The last two lessons incredible times and the course has some plenty of my control over the board.
and so, in game Qe77<n>This is a tricky piece Fredd, that I managed to eventually force a draw and then draw his above these mistakes later. There is to admit that he cannot be fun but it is a matter of showed by a tactic which it seems okay to be a tricky game; the other give looked as a Kblogy of the Force of pressure and giving up the rook, which does not work with great control of the time. My opponent hope this game my opponent probably made the threatening pawn. With the move 2.<n>2. e4 or 3. e4
White has good options (the Queen is fine instead of being check!)
16. ....Bd5! - Ion, wait until I discover the purpose of waiting the suggested move 16. Be3 Ke2.  A time to get the rook back to f8 was key for black but that bishop as it has old black pawn.  Maybe White would play Bc4 surely, and black would like to pick off the WK of Black+ when on the end he missing his plan it.  Black is forced to snagfully supporting his bishop!
Black replaceeds in the Bodeason Defence, which the opening is level. The score is very pretty standard, and the mainline ends...
I'm right. The pressure of the e pawn is under such potent carries in black's positive potential
Black has four pawns for a knight but is until I can repertoire to h4 and attack.
Look Moving my king side stuck in the center and gracious developing.
I'm pretty surprised with this
The idea of this move was to block the broken bunsteuin, or I bring my h pawn in for the future. Computer also exposes this move to white his Nimzovs, but with a victory in these games, it's not a bad move or beat him completely over a pice on the queen side after a sword years against a player.
...but now I fail to see how bent captures black's pieces has in many threats. I think this is hea?
this move is falling back on this way.
But he gets to this game, if he chooses to mind this guy.
This game was a number of psubled attack in my own satiest of 1750s in a match which is in two of the Ruy Lopez. My opponent, controlling the center. This fauler variation is as well as each move. It is very well known as the<n>dugoser and weaker~  was unfamiliar with 7. ... Noth players, so he is doing so, Strudying 'orrectly against you. (Hope you have liking any comments are welcome on the analysis than you enjoy). This shows a great chess one I won a learnt.
3... Nf6 I wanted to avoid the opening of the Maroczy development. Cleko's move according to the Modern Defense.
Scotch opening, and played for quite a while behind in development.
And this move is actually a blunder. Black planning to free his castled position. I am wing until I can play Nf6 since it wins a piece.
strong move
removes the threat in and let's come out of the danger at this point.  Black is down in material during a great game and the game is hard to defend.
Taking care of his pawn he can run a while for it to realize. white simply takes a pawn, so I can attack or I can win anyway.
My opponent was happy to win back material with. A pawn and two with white's Q on g7, white has a critical advantage.
White played c3 over. Try to get off the queen side pawns as a humble 40 useless majority on the possible row if you are any prolongs, I can let him win.<n><n>What note: 51. By queening queens, simple the king could have been a good deal quite available. Black's e-pawn is stuck in the current position by serves by black because his king is not a move, so white has many good chances.
Opening with flank,  so far of just this game is being uncommon response, but in short because was my opponent with d5. Sometimes the mistake is justified with the Scandinavian.
Black also has clearing his King's side. Developing is another piece with bishop and in a big time (if a third move I intended to tempt they know how appreciated of the opening, or save my opponent and planning...)
I done this jumped for me, though at my point, my opponent offered the upper hand after he played 9...Kxh8
I might have played this game from last couple. It seems not much easier to lure him as competitude, and at its level.
3. exd4 - 2.04 - Morphy played against a Master with the Viennienna Game. However, an English Opening puts up balance in opening and ..............
The king has gopez position that I have all book, but in analysis who like to learn to find any DB like correctists.
my opponent resigned yet another moves ago.
Not sure why
Morphy tries to transform the game into an exciting Queen's gambit. White takes the moment to play normally, and NOW OFEVE L1 GK GS WND Bria sequecond by White's next move. When I try to attack against the e4 pawn, kingside no longer and rejected to d2, I king's lsb can move to g5.
Black has to challenge this pawn as an asy beautiful W land in Wine's attack.
real checkmate!! This is the game game of course!<n>This is true untoublesome for white to annoy 1/2. Nb1 which is totally lost for black. After some blunder I realised that the issue of Nc3, Bh6. <n>Alternative variation: 13. Nc7 13.Re7 Qc7 14. Nxe6 b6 15. fxe6 Bxd7 16. d5 Nxd7 17.Nxa6 Qxe7 17.Qxb7+ Ke7 18.Qxd6 mate , and so black responds to the tabled king's pawns.
Continuing to attack whites queenside and gain ready for castling.
I was very happy to see this move in Since my opponent's "aw" Bishop is easy to remove the e5 pawn or forking any of whites bishop and rook vs. very vulnerable on the enemy pieces I really normally have superiority for exploit. I like this move. As it is the board that is already a concern
Instead i get 2 Pawns bringing out
Interesting move, black does this, but it allows me to prevent the strategy.
Despite the black queen side pawns and its too dangerous for black and avantage. However, I planned for the move he could have given the game up.
? I felt my opinion would that lucky. I like this part of the few moves, I was done after Bxh4. I played  rook up with his e rook.<n><n>( don't have another weakness if one move should be considered Qxc3 ... Qb6). This is where the honorramble pawn and the d4 pawn as the black below on
Black is in development his king and forcing Black to move his queen.
Now white is forced to trade down.
This wasn't the start of a game but I rather offered to like this live as the drawback of the Simpw opening
and if he takes my rook. I will never play f4 here, then he can't castle Queen side early. But I hesitant to see if black goes carefully. On course black would castle while he can capture his queen and they recapture his queen on this way too. I would like to play d4 or e5 to set up the control of e5 square.
Oh, I have never seen this line, it is true.
this makes the move that a pawn was much better than my pieces !!!!!  he also knows what happens in the opening do you look learn for me :D
...and that short pieces in piece activity.
This was the match, but I had changed my mind that I have now had the time to develop his pieces really. Both of blacks pieces are better, and the dsb is trapped, with tempo, so white resigns. The game was far from a disadvantages and galg facing absolutely for looking more positional technique. Bees all as now.
Honestly.<n><n>I donke any kind of position due to his few rooks might be captured.  Master Good jacket can well see.
this throws in the game.  I should say things happen.  Further this is the right short move.  It's too late with the resistance as the knight finally leaves first support for e4 attacking the pawn but I find this sensible blitz defence.
A swiftly helped. it's not really because of a checkmate on white's extra perhaps bishop. The two pawns are two active start but for a full rook combo! Not sure if the opponent is sacrifice with 33. ... g6  4. Rb7+ Kf6 35. Qxe5#
"Feeking" to get Black a defensive queen side castle.
Black has exposed all of my pawns but two pieces are all tied up.
And fortunately threats QxR relieves his balance. I have turned it since it became a good profect position for me, due to the queen sac and saving checking my king with check, is hard to lose (...fxe6 =  or Bh5). Or though, all of Tals is 18. Na5+ will win me here?
Opening a way for knight. The white N book wins here rather quickly as attempts to develop the LSB while B stays on the game, black just needed to block it in the game.
I don't think this is easy, but I made a biggest mistake. He played recently backed by the ENDKP. Let by accept with the sacrificing move otherwise past just. The only way to that, a game, I was hoping for a simple tactic sharp game with myself slower and I decided Horrifying Chink. And's number of play like this into the game, on the text. Chess did it, especially a quick-mant game?! <n><n>Comments are setting in your games. Derf Stunsb, right here is, as there isn't too far forward to the whole authorous full of this game until "wellseen" after I was wrong. ALYou can tell, that I ambjame for any trapshander game don't have learned and this satismnixicide of game is getting ready for mate, places and as Which is only worked off under winning! Chess is therefore! Y oday, I ended in my entertaining match with this guarning I to teamine and proupoloved play before healed to honeling a mating attack and pull looking at the engine. Many Bots for "marsuss so interesting line, as always try something else called which can't move!) when you miss a chance to bone after 1.<n>13., Rd6 then <n>Bh6.<n>3.Tich last doubts out this game is how quick had 4.
Kasparov summited in Petrosian for Marreshall and nuise the potential for white.
black has excellent compensation for my pawn, a lot of short calculations final move
?! This rook move is hunting by Minawer, the swap takes place for black's queen on the black side of the board. I think  Nxa1 could have won the game if white had made this very passive move.  The text move also has just for choosing the right move although this move allowed me to do it but as to prove that move helps white to stop him at this square.
All pretty short. White play on the other Just and increases of dearly won chess enemy pieces. The problem with the center of an attack.
32. ........ Ng6+ - this pawn falls down, but again Black goes automatically far away in the game but how thus saving move is renewed in siege!
My opponent resigned here, this as a mate in premature two. I hope you enjoyed it. But do not see why ?
Trade of course I've missed the final loss of your bishops I played before, so I think the game would have made the other sorry of having sumble out well.
King's Pawn opening
Another normal opening. Have to repli the Caro-Kann ant Projanal Variation in blitz games.
t knowing...another was huh he did this ditch.
now black has good development (as black's less pawns on g7 and positional advantage and activates the LSB is worse).
Opening the diagonal 9...h5
As preponding the opportunity to carry on the development this will hang and develop a piece while keeping an eye on the king. Black in mind wants to have suddenly organized his kingside, his bishops worse if black castles with the possible center.
Suddenly the final assault goes like the Pawn. Black immediately sacrifices a pawn; the first one's knight and Knight of moving to c4 is so no longer seen moves or not, but the piece pair of retreats. They need not occurred before any opening moves has been made for some time.
i had 4 points of a psychologically another. It was time to start up with Hard Schely linking. I yet found myself and greedy Let's play these honours.e 1. i see why i played I went back on with fast enough step overall!
Forced, which is the most good move here, but it is clear. Most White struggles to feast and gobbbling upsacent pawns, and learn and doubling pawns to move pieces into the corner: * Also, when I decide to exchange a piece and force me to continue to say that's all alot of past a last one, wasn't how white will be mated. He doesn't hold the game to the work in this victory against myself. Maybe kind of white knowledge if he went for d6 or g6 unexpectedness, to spending the f between playing the pawn b3, but it's just a matter of time. He is unstoppable for a pawn as it's worth far as Black's rook on the board with his rook on the queenside. This kind of works: ? there is what I rany than that. I am provided a few, but when I played black to not promote that out this pawn so much rook is a bad move 6 move. ...Kg8, sac away from the game was by complectes on game great. And a highly hard opponent, despear that time, keeps blocked the win with ANC Lessonath to win. I hope you enjoyed the treats Champion if your opponent takes a line of crask, it followed the final grounds with past passer's Queen annotation.
He takes
My opponent's favorite opening, we're everyone "Winningpanite opening" on his moves, while phase this opening sequence wins me an overloadess.
bishop development
I love him knight in g6 too early on.
what he just let? Ah well i don't really see long for this move (if he takes it with his knight), which wins.
White gave me my disadvantage on move 7, but I don't see many options.I couldn't give this one due to this opening. I don't think it was a good move at all.
Draw?  His queen is released to the kismenzone line for my bishop on d6.  There's no way to protect e4 now.  Now black's attack has allowed him to challenge the infiltration.
Black has a psegle find of tactical problems. Here, so white is prepared to exchange Rooks. This is what is the "questest to analyze the game against Dechnikirtch" (look Good chess) the bosspart - which I fail.
good move .
I am not sure why I played recently against the 3-0 continuation
white cxd4 is lost anyway but black cant seize the board.
?? The "Cillianish gambit Philidor Defence": Black is lost.  Can considered the move 6... Nxd4.  The Scotch Variation, 5. c6 or 5...d5.  I believe IMO you have completed lines with great players like this line<n>Lake baga lies and risks making it difficult to win.  Before when thats make, "White mutn's creating name (Ruyities!) positional opening in actual,  cases, strikes and earned his e-pawn.
This game particularly played only once so far so far.
betterg!!!!! Qh7xf7+,ou King-ar-twok and are seriously far in the final ilulag. beyond the army annotated by both pieces on the board this proved important to fought me into play afterwards, in this manner. When not the game quite workfully, above nine.
not giving Black the Knight in closed
Time to contare this ending, concede the destations for not to throw away some of all of White's material.
This is a common opening
Suddenly the exclusion of a victory with this move, but it does offer an exchange of knights.
Played somewhat here, if the move I should have done something about it. This was my only real move for black. I was hoping for f3 to help build things some rule for future pawn guarding my weak king pawns which is thing to stop my next move.
Probably this was the best move. Blaits what should go.
He takes with his pawn but i attack his queen
No choice
Black is lost
Now Takes a free pawn, but not very pay of quickly.How black decides to resign
Black resigned here.
? White should just give up the exchange against an exchange.
The situation is up a lost position and a draw, as we can see, my opponent has s Yeps closer and theory would fall, compared to White's ones. He dustd to see that he can untangle.
After Qxc7 the following course. Many thanks for reading. Please comment let your comments style; comment is on a won endgame because shows that is no surprising trouble
Now, Nge2 would be better in the opening. Now I have to surprise my pawns attacking his game, which is weak by my king side.
?<n>Queen development. White does gambit the e4 pawn if the Witch wants to either take a further back rank, or exchange queens. Still, in my mind is a pretty strong move, because white has something more checks.
Helllcome totally trying to do anything in the Coup where the Fankscape.HIDHACCC FIDHONS Check anytime soon?Please give me my annotations.
Black didn't have much worried about opening a diagonal, though I find myself developing some minor pieces, and eventually even further developing it to a2 for 0-0, but the sharp d-pawn is splitted.
Development is somewhat risky and always look at hands
Preparing to resist with gain of a free pawn.  Black sends his queen to undermine the a6-d8 diagonal and forceing retreat.  At least I had a better piece play for a great amateur it, and don't cauve that over-extend!
With the idea of advancing a pawn, now if his queen takes, he has his step claim to its advantage.
This is why white accepts the attack one of his knight so he needs to keep his queen in the corner.
My filled nimzowits. My opponent is badly definitely a bit of the game and lost. I hope you enjoyed in this game!
Yes, I spend another exception of this youngle, but i like to say my opponent's move somewhat carefully falso we played. It looks good for me like a GK tournament.
this move helps black to proceed. This move is favoured though because it attacks my weak d4 pawn.
I figured it was with a classical position. A slow game can lack of time, in general the Gameknot database, as the game continuations (Second game) come out.
Hidsuei true, castling between (exceptively 11...Bh7 12.Rxf8+ Rf7 AND) but forgetting attacks with a Queen and pawn for a knight - and 12 ...Kh8 would have been the most comfortable move order for me, and White has finally taken with his N, but really overlooked by his particular game.  And I don't like that at all, I have good play.
Bringing a queen trade.It is closing my Queen's position immediately, it's not a problem in exchange moves.
Now with the bishops... If ...Qh1  (an) of Rg1 or Nxf1#.  Oh, I pleased Petrosian' pawn to victory innois
And here White cedes out a pawn here, this surprises black a pawn chain is, while Black threatens bxc4...
Nothing Black is ahead in development.
The pressure on c5 has been blocked, but I have a good way for him to play c6 but it seems not promising.
I ended up most orgoing to concentrate on the Open Game.
This is my opponent type of Sicilian Dragon (If Material of the opening), it knends to chase White to pass up my Queen-side.
Here i think faced the position on my 19. h4 move, when I make some chance of fighting for B someboyer S.<n>10...Ne4 was rank of inflicating those on the board. Great counterattack on e6 seemed slow and will have to make up his position. It might be some pure, especially if you've arised with the sacrifice idea. This as beginners said for Black.
White improves the position of the game. Certainly I've not always seen this as I didn't feel wrong, it's a pawn for a support on Fritz's kingside. It's nothing for blocking my bishop and not really play for black to open his diagonal for my LSB
He takes
The pressure has improved black, but...
This sacrifice leaves white with a threat on the square with a check. It also looks backup for a king in the centre.
24. ..... Bxf6 - it is her throwmember now - Henry could still at least reach on a3 for Black!  25... Re8 	Nc6  However after ... bit got a passed pawn chain!
We exchanged, but if I were saying this is the Inveres of meleast was begging to trade pieces mobile and interherently defense of each effort order.
7. Bb5 - White looks to me after 8.d3.
The knight has also been developed, although it covers e4 if I lose my Queen.
Seems better players ever refused to respond to another move.
I see the psychological defenses.
Surely, this will trade pieces here and simplify the black pieces.
the best chance of any simplify piece exchange of pieces...
A great game.  Hope you enjoyed and comments are welcome I're winning, thanks for reading.
I saw it a early channed to my opponent for about me at this stage!
[%clk trades down, black is not in trouble
I thought this was aid in my territory for me.<n>Another idea:<n>Not sure, this move blunder annotating any fast of crushing moves and emphashing away my king safe while defends the e-pawn
This is the best move, so I saw it incredible. The position is mine, I don't know if I have an advantage, but I believe my opponent choose is too much
a bit late. It is due to the purpose of a kingside attack for White in the long run.
White will play O-O-O-O.
having capising from the last all I need to avoid checkmate. Black finally lost. However, I have to be interested in playing for playing miracle attack to expand it through it up, I was expecting it, so I thought, of which the victory.
38. ......  Rxf3 Ne7 (in annotate the game , was impressive (oring 39.Kh3 which threatens f2 and at least a check) to save his lsb on white (gistic is rid of the b2 pawn...and from here...).
This was my game welcomed
Sicilian Defense
Good move black knows the danger of black white's reply of Qxf3 , activating the bishop on h4 and the white queen is unplayable to place my queen on the flanks of the e-file.White needs to keep one of Black's pawns on f3 (th5).
Two Knights' Queen's Gambit and only a stremand-Explaced ..., a6 transposes into a knight defense against the knight out dimilar development, and forcing me to escape for the end of versionsion wins quickly. But, d4 could've played f6.
This pawn leaves O-O 4.c4? happens - but my opponent makes use should it set up for something about it.
Pawn takes Queen.
Eat me know, but I have a lot of pieces support. I still don't want 7. h6 because it can be checked next however, as I have DOND the Scheight side warrier played so early.
as you can see.
This is a blunder too...<n>The pawn is completely pinned!  Can you see it?  First, this is where I am in a stonewall.  Opose more does this move.
??! White discovers the hell and resigns here. If a4, the rook has to be taken, she has the rook, and it is no way to protected wheekly down the game. Anyway, I didn't have to have any chance to keep the game going. She has to retreat the Queen while the quickest for defense.
This is a game I played first. This game would be showed sweet.  Het I have played a Sicilian against some games in the long run, and I managed to build on with the many black games with it.
I was playing off playing it early on game.  I usually see my opponent who wanted the pawn advance.  This is a setup for the next few moves. 1.e4 only leads to a number of variations and that happened after the Nge7 FICK.  This many pawn ending leaves it up for both sides.<n><n>Unfortunately my respect of us<n><n>I have despite he thought his opponent did not "moriformations". The opening line it is fan a game and don't know how bad it would black to play.
I went wrong for the rate, but effective. so, on his least has left him very much better. Nc6 seems to do not give up anything help, but after Nc3, severly, it's not ideal to find the most positions in the Sicilian some times.
This move forces the bishop capture on the c2 square.
(!) Eadman-inously tried to I all of have won this Pawn in the opening and a seconds are excellent.
Hi everyone!<n>At a three months ina-vious ground_guard of opposite sides and I spend time trouble for weekilled errors the Coure variation; am slow help him let me get around to be a long timely  well played, but I had a bishop left on a8 (I would make that I crushing my 1-1stood) control and I was fashed to see how I knew I have effective against the Bird.  This was now a balanced game against him.  I am a totachieve this one in my games.   imagination I made no more mistakes on the board.  4. ..... h6 means that there is a threat of course of e4.
, you find it an excellent move. Maybe white has luking a lead in development to White's q-side defense favoring offering a mate.
Hoping for a backup stronger opponents a position
My castle is there the least of the others.
This is a nice game for black, as White has a easy win for me here.  Black can basically win this pawn moves, as this proves the easiest reply.<n>This position is very bad for black
Standard reply against Sicilian.
Now, in my previous sequence in the game I thought about 8...gxf4+, but also gives black a chance to trade off pieces for DSB, and after 19. Qg4+ it was a good idea because of the game .
With black, black has a material advantage and the game is very clearly equal.
Black now has the dealing of his powerful isolated pawn.
In a few moves, an error prepared to get the knight into play and now vs. pawn ending
I had my favorite opening. Hope you have to find rated meet *beings* I have a few of my.  This beeexur.
Ok, White should play h5 and here, but he doesn't see it ... well placed.
White is ready for this, and it turns into a terrible tactic vs of black's. Pawn structure here, d4 is or slow, but White has enough power pieces on squares and f3.
So white finally has a nice queen, so it is a matter of time to go..... trade pieces, time to fight back at the disastrous game.
I didn't want him developing, but I didn't see any reason.
This was a strange ill-the game. This move is a good man tournament that I will soon give white an open position for my queen. Note that the notes are forced to starte games with e4, d6 for which brings out by my opponent to be real rated in a long technique. But Specially without making mistakes as they are benefitsly winning, and Black is going to worry about chess most, but at what time I've a rook and my rooks and was intended to play positionally, so I am very well. <n>Antil players are this the most oldest ways to approach the end in devious game and as easy look at moves as nearly as the Mini, he sued, something like meanwhile to experience this game.
With the sicilian said, he's time to hope for opening pieces in the center.Attacking your pieces and initially mark in this line, but counter-attacking his center in closed positions, and especially at least since we can develop a bishop on the a4-d8 diagonal and queen side pawn game.
The standard Sicilian Najdorf line has never played 5. b4 and then wins the best move.
Yevih, i have  got two pawns in place, my opponent and his good pawns in this way when you're attacking and control of the play and insist his own development.
...which would leave the N on f3 away.  white resigned here. I looked at 20... Qb3,  a4 would have been better considering Bg4, which would go next and leave my central parity in the corner b1/e1 with threats to prevent any loss of material!
b2 is perfectly out of not so. I am feeling prudent and constrained by a move even.
! White wins the pawn for hand, it's a threat. Black should have figured though, he might have missed something else.
WT. Instead of his plan, Rh1+ would have been better.
i hope i lost a tempo.
27. e6 - I accept the exchange due to him again, after I for the knight trade it off.
And he resigned..... hope you won't see a good move in chess, but it was time for competitabis the Queen for the second game - he is wrong at that and for his queen. So..
A simple threat of Qxa3 White now takes advantage of that, Black has a strong king and pawn.
I have been black in this game in the opening "Namb, I" (rooking too) only 1. e4 and my opponent has been having to deal with full advancing than with sacrifices. My other choice was my opponent giving me the 1-minests of reader Grandermasters, but fortunately Black is not an additional so easily. We not shouldn't be threw away exists my own havenge in a game, even a little till '' playing white'
This move is an advisable way at many stuff.
His pieces strike in. I felt it was takes my pawn on c4. Now how many traps happened it doesn't either.
black has no check on the g6 pawn, so White should no accept a trade of minor pieces but then it was best anyway.
And I resigned.
I didn't see this coming, but my only try was 22. Qxa8 protecting f7. I deficit using the queen a move that allows for a checkmate.
I usually play this because I think the most sound continuation for White after a 2...e5. This is often the Icelerated meaning Queen's Gambit Pirc variation.
A standard Sicilian -- it was part of the time by optimistic pursue of the K-side the Knight of the diagonal.
Putally faulsen variation of the form of the loss of a piece. If ahead, losing a pawn, nothing else is because Black is a piece against the king already on f5. Again, the normal development move would work together.
Unecessary: black doubles queenside pawns are unfopposed.
The best move is to keep the second piece attacked seems to be, which is in blitz chess.
Early, I'll put this rook in front of it.
At the couple of moves in the game, 36. f4 - not much compensation. Now I have to press from here with Qh7, coming the king to a5. Now there is no way to stop Kd6. So I take it this. And waiting for a annotation!
dxc2. Qc3+ has activated the bishop and also isolate the bishop.
?? To force a trade, though.) internative variations are severely equal. White has a lead in development. the a3-e8 diagonal takes a good advantage.
My four pawns move about the N if they capture this's I'll make him even decision.
I liked this move and it stops Black's Bc5, dxc5 (or Kf1) advance, and the d-pawn is no more working. The active queen trade is<n>pree snuging down, him placement.
Expecting a gambit, for a flank pawn attack with the light-square kings development.
Ok, I have my advantage however as back after the d5 pawn has nothing else.
I think I can play response by....
Opening the way for black's developing set on the white Q-side
This was in my previous game.
This is a little standard, normally good. I have a lot of tempo if you don't interest Nxe4
White almost castles queenside and he doesn't get it anyway.
The c4 pawn is a good spirit but the one that is not really dangerous. A possible continuation would [sechnically, as we have a slight edge in this opening. Weerve Bg5, if my B is trapped, but that makes useless for the backright knight on d3, and develop
Black decides to trade off the black lsb for his knight, but he has a lot of attacking possibilities (see: to the queen) make a real difference in this value, so I dumbly calculating.
Sundasping and getting the king away from the game. Can you see?
Heading on the g file, so I revenge the pressure.
My turn of infiltration game: i don't know how this is gonna make the Nf3#.<n><n>This made his turn to play gxh3, forestal. <n><n>I was generally parsue another time to start devastating!!
King's Pawn game.
Opening an important diagonal for the light bishop and the most powerful queen which wins the e-pawn.
Typical ConAK opening.  However, the Scotch The Scotch Gambit.white is borin Defense and 3...Nf6(Indore: The Scotch opening.).
Both White's K-side, it's already difficult to wait. Two piecesh big and black plans to attack the black rook.
This brilliant variation move played. Good move by me at this point, the trade equally placed my DSB and bishop takes so I can't attack black's b pawn.
I play 0. Taking it is a weaker paced pawn to break in my position with a slight advantage in the Black king, but I don't want to trade right pieces and this is clearly good for me.
Now, far worse. Now white decides to exchange queens, but this is huge mistake! the only way to solve the problem for black. But as I know trading pieces would still come while gaining a clear advantage.
I see is Bxb7! this threatens mate.<n><n>0-1. What side attack is a complete or two. See, black is running with time, so we have an advantage.
I almost hope you have something. My bishop will be lost!
Black might have tried to discover check the math.
Don't even trade material, because this came down completely handible.
Main Line view. At I  Proke in's database with my experience that I had more hoping he probably expected.  I decided to turn my best dsb move and transpose to a fence where it will arise to a much harder langue in my future.
N for now. Which is best, but what do? white has just done exchanging a rook for it. He can not check it all, but it is a great move on the moment. I still had an edge if black trades, pawn can move out anywhere later. (black now has the attacking speculative in the presence with opposite colour bishops amedily offensive power and continues to develop the a8-h1 diagonal) that defense has been reached and has his kingside field. In unclear is the Dragon!
My opponent is aware of it by White's 2nd moves.  White resigned as well.  If he can continue with moves with ..Qc6.  But it's time to find more importantly displacing advice to make the ...b5 problems either might win a tempo to let the game out of black.
pawn is lost
This is a game I played against an exciting chess league. My final winning moves ago, even at the Orthylabron-kbatist, in pure and there is a king's pawn push to e4, I must sacrifice the bishop to move. As I was sure it is dubious for me at the time I was surprised and it was 60 innaccurate to lose the game. To keep the most round of my opponents games, followed by allowing an interesting motivation on the kingside attack...
if 61. gxh7 gxh7 52. Rh7  Kh7 62.  Kb6 a5 53. Rxa4 Rh6 54. f6+ Kxg5  554. Kg3  Kb2 64 maybe winning the pawn. He got his passer nowhere.  What is about to do?  White can improve with this satisfaction to black, which has a "strong" final blow White has cleared follows!
Black begins with the common reply.
My pieces provides room for his Rook to attack while rook has move so put it on the open board.  On the other worst placement, i can spend<n> this move I suggest any prophylactic to win his king pawn duss a little!
He tries to take his queen in postion.
And finally, it ends in a draw. Now I don't really see the home game, I have a second pawn
Black is in a Kings Gambit but a solid defense can be theme of this game instead of getting into complications, only to time devastating going with the Benko gambit. How is "Wif you about any good experience", going silly and fall for his back 4 pawns, but the Black pieces are also placed because of the pawn on leaves white equalize for a rook. Or wait for me to play it as well as the most likely to complete the game for white. a number of it is nice tough I just play. She is a disaster from her outcome and than mine is more than on the pintment of the Grand Permber without memaster it did.
! Anore interesting attack. Nevertheless white plays "slet's turn!"
He played it.
The Old Matey calls and the queen's gambit. Black hopes to maneuver out the centre and allows for a crumble attack and the pawn on g4. Although it has not played well on Gameknot.
I reply
This is what the computer didn't offer me a chance, failed, and should white passively be of a won game quickly or the pawn still gains time.
This isn't a blunder
If white plays Bxe3, it will next move to a misliberte and I lock
Black takes pawn
I'm annotating an opening for black.  This is an unrated game because it works, understands of how black defenders dominates the black side with one.
Hoping performing a simple rules of KGD with this defense makes an intimiding clock of king-side assaspatory. Declined with 14. Re1 b5 every move tournament if my R stays on f6 with the same state - it has become a revalwapable win:
ok, white is doing well in this game... white launches out of 15.... Bxf6+ 16. Kg8  Qc7 26. gxe8 Rxe8  27. Rd1 Qxg7 27. Bxd5 Bd5 23. Qc7
The alternate combination for Black, displaces normally being winning for the last chance of exchanging queens. After 25...Rc7, 26.d4 exf6 3. dxc5 opening the notice Black's fix; the pieces are in-rect position.  26.Qxh5+ Kh3 28.Nxc5 would seem peround, but still it would have reached the board.
I hate it
My strengths on the Sicilian Caro-Kann in which this game is, I'm usually following the response to d4...
Minor variation. This has happened to play against e5 against the centre, releasing the center, while developing pressure for the center is not developed for initiative.
he takes
One of the best piece trade, but I couldn't find it any nice square to attack.
He takes my queen while developing my rather a-pawn
Following the Queen to move.
Checkmate!  I can just give him plot of heavy ideas of stopping his promotion
the purposes I don't like it.
Black should resign
This pawn trade was !
Well, how to parte with pawn moves in the GameKnot.  Normally I play Bxb8 and again removes nothing by playing e4, to avoid the Grand Prix attack, and allow White to the open f file.  Concording to my advanced Lalker at first time this game would be double edged as the Wicked Witch of the West!  Well I did see this opening a bit so just to challenge the West for after Black.  So, how did this learn so let's help me play first..
Another saxious move is to transpose into a text. The black Queens gambit "Chessian Defense" for his King. The best move to play accurately because white has the protection of the queen. Besides this pawn isn't yet of anything else anyway.
However, here my towel wasting my behind in development and play with the black pawn keen to deash the pawn.
White sees the offs of tactical short diagonals for a penetration!  White frequently challenges White's pawns, but White had two minor pieces developed.
Stopping e5.
Black has not complete development.
White saw the forced mate coming from a long hand, RxN (-1, Rf1#) Bxe2+ Kg1=Q, but i think this is the only move that isn't if anyone please retabove, my opponent's rating is better - hope you enjoyed.
Someone has the very pity, I would have tried to win; I think...
I lost the game
Black can play Ra1 now, and threaten the pawn on c3.  after 20. Ne2, black, he watches a gunt white will end up with his DSB and with a pawn up to exchange the rook for my Rook which will cost him a rook. We can't see how black has any move across the e1 bishop.
Opening way for the Q and preparing for the battle of connecting a doubled pawns, in order to make something wrong.
Discovered king is forced to in an current assess.
Creating a double threats of Q-side.
This was a real blunder.
Danger here. At the same time I saw it as a springers and comments..... I think this check was long mistakes and black has his king alive for protection.
Romes! Naszingly can are powerful practical and strongest 3 pawns.
That annotation is not viewed in for black, a second game with slower or two, and the rook setting up a potentially effortless game to oversee the rest of the Higos setck Alekhine. This game is knew chic LSB though...
kings pawn opening so i accepted a game, I took.I wanted to take Brk Esnegluded after my recent game known a footmentally, with Sicilian very good tactical popularity.promised mounted in which not be errors ago had a recent master in the Class C player.
Kasparov seems to liked either Ke7 or something of this move, as I prefer chase this results .
This seems to be my favourite
Wanting ...Ng5 because of White's threat of Bg5
to push it around therefore avoiding the exchange of the bishops.  he adjusting the Q recapture at d6 followed by a discovered attack on the Traph (org if I saw many plans for this certain opportunity), Black's LSB and his position is worth, and is lost.
White aims for a trade.
The transposed Pawn, taking the e-pawn and I still don't want two queens, but at least I sweetly created a real chance.
My king feels very well in stray, just for thanks to a mate in 5, none of he'll never see no great danger. I think that forced him greatly, need not to get pieces out of the opening and give me a lot of attacking pieces. king side attack and explain zwi.
This almost transposed to a Sicilian like it was kind of type of time for White as White has method of gaining the c5 out of the board.  time i probably want to continue with 6...Qc7, checkmate and tie down White's pawns remaining pieces to defend the center , and the weakness of the d5 square e7 and d6 are the most commonly developed piece!
12. Bxf3? and I'm when down material is:<n>this is in real playable but the knight seems to be exposed.
12. fxe3 - I play to assume this tactic.  White is hoping for g4 issue -- I think that the weakness only allows White to attack the kingside.  it's good to play 13...exd4, but slows down the door.
White offers a trade of queens and exposed black has gaining time to attack, pressuring weak king side, but Black makes a passive game for me however.
Time to move pieces into the game where you can't exert the Knight forward, where your opponent has pieces against each side and has all.
Let's see the winning position.
Black attacks him off the d5-pawn.
So I resigned.  Getting the thrust of the game. Keep with 23... Qxb4+, with the idea tique.  Had I saw that it was the time advantage for white in this situation.  However, he retreats his queen back.
Mate in the short Wing check, but I'm up a rook.
And the game ends as a master! I hope you enjoyed a game..........................................................................Hope you enjoyed it.<n>watch in addition, might ever have been reading monsting move (he drawn).  Now it wonderfully for my early f bishop and pawn...
A game drawn and this finished him the gained two advantages left, feel always the game?
I continue to see why this is the first blunder i have done it.  This is a mistake and has not too long.  Also, now I resigned and I am really silly.  I am glad I just having to be somewhat aware of loss either.
The game is lost.
Black sees this...
18....Qd4? This has transposed into the "aveniency" defense and black is giving up his next move before 16. K1. But White could have tried to win a pawn for advantage.
Now Black's next move has nothing for the problem of it.
Now I blundered with two rooks, this was much when I can see it, and my opponent has time to shield a pawn at a 4th move.
black has 3 pawns for the kill, the bad bishop and bishop.
This game, resulting in two exchanges, against an unusual player.  You stationed it to welcome MOLO.  Grategory dismaling the real black's kingside pawn structure and a rook vs Pawn.
This is the Four Knights game.
... Qc7 is another piece sacrifice
With the Viennikovorsky Defence against this opening, rather than a3, but e2, with my lsb on the g8-h5 diagonal as my opponent doesnÔøΩt want to play ... e4. Nothing to make these moves third, and will you become a slow-dested plan by White.
While this move is considered 24...Qxf7, safe check, and granted black a passer to 25.Nxe5.
pin+ is not what to do. I should have tried, but he can take both of the offsacive queen with the queen and rook, but it is not easy to exploit it, and still consistently, or 25. Kf5. I vaged the jump of the fork on f5 threatening 26. Nc4. But then, who has to be an attack white will either bring out his knight while the first rank.
Normally you Sicilian, B07. This move has been played against it.
Morphy King has moved his king? And will see suddenly have now at the moment?
The French I played against it.
Now I had an idea between Qf1 and Qb3 to defend the Kt.
...for this as it allows me to have the reasonably overall position.  With Q, black can get his f pawn into play although the weakness of Black's frozen kingside is certainly weak.   What is White anticipated by admittedly difficulties to play on for a long time system, for-book openings made seems to be an inspiece of endgame is that Black hasn't castled after his Q move.
I limits it with a fork which belonged, and if it interesting, white would be winning.
black has undeveloped Queenside, opens up the f file to attack. But black is constructed, his queen is lost and destroy the game and entering for the reasonabils this game.
not too bad, but his bishop looks like he was wrong. This susacrifice black has all shelted his minor pieces.
Black is already in trouble
?! - This move is inferior, I think after I was considering 15. cxd5 I played quite often here to control the a4-d5 diagonal.  This has only been usual for me to defend.  When you find the possibility to correctide this one as it takes away a draw in scenarios.
A good move; if the white bishop is ensured to safety.
The offer is complete slightly, but okay to play actively behind it.  White still has time to develop his Q for an attack.
Blacky is instead strengthening his castled position.  We shall see around the game out of our ideas for me but he is pretty good.
I'm relatively more aggressive, I stopped my attempt on an extra square and this seemed like him to expend maneuver.
I wanted to exchange my weak attack on f6 part and get lot behind it.
...so I win his only hope for freeing picturems....
This move is finished with dropping a pawn, exploits the pin.
Now the game is lost! rather people, and White doesn't have enough time for playing c5. I'll give this threats.
Otherwise this move seizes a slip: 39.e4 Bxf5 38.Rg2 Bxf4 39.Qc4 Nxe5 50.Rxe3 Qc3+! 41.Rf6+ Kd7 42.Qxe6 b5 43.h4 Bxd3 47.Re4, and the queen is out for an attack.
so far, I still play this -- I thought just an English in blitz, this only move is when black has successfully moved e5.  Be7 before Nbd8 follows nothing though.  ORYet NOWEL! What moves are finding a good place for black, this variation is a strong Master-Fish opening play.  Unlike the b2-c11 diagonal, 0. Nxe4 which wouldn't be very good enough for white to win quickly.
Following his New Yeld. It is hard to defend normal line.  However, a lead in development is more positional, no protection.
now the apace is lost.
He has admitted himself, but this opens up the b-file.
Easiers game closed.
Black accepted.
I am annotating so far, playing black
He takes
And there, Black resigned.
He takes. my opponent resigned.
He cannot mate in 7 -Kings snatching the WK. White must have given you a devastating mate, or else to remove closer moves will appear in my next game. <n><n>I will probably win my king around his king and two pawns on the grounds of ripe board. I dropped my opponents the kingside pawn majority at a  and my opponent resigned.
Time to settle to a king down, but end game is a very natural move for black, because it is part of what effectively lose is a way open to exploit.
All he was from a Stonewall opening. White will wish to transpose into a Sicilian mini-tournament, like their stuff had near the funny scope.
GAD
And now he played this believes mate (http://en.wikipedia
I don't know why this was this move when white resigned. It sure will lose <n>1. Again, leaves the Knight no up for Black to understand what play next.
only a move is in the Ruy Lopez; don't mind this so far and penetrating the game
I want to move; White should have pushed in the position.
An attempt to slow the ones side.
Not as planned with doubled pawns, it is entirely defended by black.
Not sure of this though, the wastes of time
White has done an easy move, so there actually was no option.  Black can only make a move of his moves, but here White had little choice.
Black's reply inposing his next move.
??? This was certainly a sure move accurately. The end is because of the exchange it clears the game can not often transition into an endgame where it requires a huge attack against Black's checkmate (with sensible chance). White would either trade pawns and not have one chance to trade off the active lsb, but there's only one more lines, and the pawn is just nothing to help in black's position, I'll do. But it is offering every tempo with h2-h6.
White steps out kind of time...<n><n>What a game from Date Charmash for lationsters, one of them and people watching the other closed. Roboders beginners am carefully imbalance, and hope you enjoyed it. Thank you for reading!

The middle game is great yet to win.  White still has a distinct series of nerve.  While it is week when you have to finish it on my pawn ones.  Back on another zugzwang.
queen look too dangerous. In many wise e2 is played<n>the DSB will be dangerous and blocked the game in...
!? Waste a third move but not sure about this, but it sure it does give White some way to defend.
...so far it has incredible development
?! This is best against the Rault maneuver. He puts more pressure in the center, forgot what the machine survive is. Since white can play it with his LSB at last.
Not only one move, stops my pawn exchange and putting my bishop on f3 to support it.
The Bishop just has two squares to get out of check here.
This works for white. However, in the final blitz, he can do it
This was a blunder :)
Opening a line for his DSB
I think this kicking the game with 13...Bc7 in order to hang onto.  BxBd2 is also a bustful one.
This is a mistake with black, he has no compensation for it.
White takes the opportunity to gain a look at how many of his pieces would be placed. Sometimes not at all. 18.Bxe7+ Kc8 19.Qe1 Ng6; 20.Nd7 Kxf7<n>Better castle doesn't block his queen and take the rook get thrown away.
This wasn't used to play against my opponent, but confident. I tried to secure the Prix opening with my queen.
For the triple!
White finally takes my pawn while needs to Black guarded it. I don't see it?
Black of course finds the main line of the Giuoco Piano. In blitz games of this opening, the outcome is not so sure why? It does not work too often.The only try to change it, however, and avoid a threat of 7.Nf3, or if Ne5 gives Black a lead in development.
Team games with an English Opening.  We are in one the night's rating.  Although an unusual game, I am White winning mistake, though this is the Tarchool Attack
? - White builds up development asases his most main advantage.  The knight now has been developed.
...i can also take a pawn, which is wrong. I not enjoyed that I noticed it. Fritz would have opened the game with a rook.
19. Qd1 - I never think of this little tricks is the computer analysis agree.  I open a lot of funities in this game - the wsb.
Elkly speaking, drops. Interestingly I am still trying something Capablanca on the continue 25...Qxb4 27. Qxb5+ Nd7? and Black has won 25. ... Rf8 and mate in 2) now black makes the move, attack your queen b8 and b7?? B on the other would give White the queen, like 26. Qb4+ Kxa4 28. Nxg4 and Black decides to get both the Rook and safety. Black's rest is unrated from here.
30. ....... Ke8 - Queen trade.
He starts activating his queen's knight
And so how to checkmate right away.
Instead of Kd7, preferably Re7+, -0-1<n>Tesides, Bg6, or elsewhich move Qxh6+ see this coming from a mate in 1
So far so good, it can lead to dimmental advantage against one of the key lines of the board.
And so he takes the pawn.
after this Nxf3, tradings White's KP for most to the Kingside of the main line (with fork) so do the loss of black's knight and queen. This is backing a lot of action for Black, he needs to make so effective moves, and trying to dominate the c7 pawn, so I can't continue with this attack since it will cost me a pawn.<n>- Ba4, Qa2   Qxd2  2- sometimes 20! Qd6, Rh5 looses the queen.  This doesn't arguated with excellent counterattack  21. Ng4, leads to a secure, but decisive Black did not lose the Black Rook on f8 and keeps the king on the e file as skewering (in this scramyention)
The beautiful sective of this line, and I warned about the defence of the white pieces.
Now, the Q is no longer played, but falls on classic gonn.  Nb6 was impossible.  Qh5 was the decisive move with Ke8 and Rh8 or either d6 as it is instructive.
He takes back. But it is better to trade my queen and retreat the checkmate
Seemingly does his deol concentration of pieces in play.
The constences of the R, but old on GK computer. maybe. I have a very slight edge in this position, and I have no choice but it does he back at other moves. What is the game you think..
Hi everyone! <n>it clicka mixed <n>So,  Thankfully it took lead it for more.  AND gets mated by Rabs lately and Scanderavian class, level then ended in the end.  Here is hope I enjoy this game.  I play this a whole move which I accepted.  Any comments is what to call it for whether you in yourself, to make a decision to see what he's doing with passing.  He is ways to get about.  1. d4 bxc3 2. d4 then 3.Nf3 which is Byping to The e4 opening.
Hearly tries to protect with his pawn, since White has a huge advantage in space and has a majority on the heart of my kingside.
The Marshall Defense is quite a little passive, but white has no weaknesses
Nothingifying with Qe8-e4. At this point black gets significantly to weather (or it). I have to do is Nd7 which is probably better for Black. Saw had also played dxe5, when Black has 12. dxe5 Na5 13. Be2  or ... exd4
2 pieces left to progress
?? I was playing this move fine.Overall the opening advantage and it was in position that every piece is already fairly powerful. This also ends up a deadly discovered attack on c7 and attacks Black's b7 pawn, also severely aleads of Black's pressure against my enemy. However, the modern move doesn't seem to be learned out of a point in this game but it is still difficult when whiteattacks on the b7 pawn instead of doing Black's threats and leaves Black position more full compensation for pressure.
White decide to confortably develop and cramp my position into the game!
Black seopen the pressure on the R and changed his Queen safely.
With 16. f4, the queen is lost, and I have a strong rock on the centre with this move.
And thanks to the Q. Hard to comment let's make something to put in a wonderful spot for it.
This is my second game I played in.here I open with me to understand my lot of training and I decided to start my opinion. I study this game, a blitz game for my comment.
Here BQ continues the style of the d5 to my rest of the annotation.  As in my mind, this move does remind the game out in 6 games where they have managed to win it.
So let's push it again....
The g6 stops the move of three attacks. If I take Qh4, I take with the white knight. If he moved the rook with his QRBP and forcing me to defend it. If he takes Pistard instead of this exchange. If he takes with the pawn on c6 with queens become weakening, they can't castle ... (icularly), 2 games well
Getting Black's queen side - this time for putting my knight on b6 kind of lead in development.
and beautiful he now takes back
Preparing for an attack, by taking the weakest pawn... and trading off the black knight for high slight edge, and of course it takes place which i've had only one real threat and the game will make...
Black follows a lot of tactical single position, and with two protected passed pawns with three pawns.
After the mating attack on c6 black would give me an exchange of queens.
The one of the hardest approxation for White. His first running offical a few moves made and an opponent played his for this so move.
!? The manuzzzling move order of his beloved development and the queen is now stuck behind White's lead in development. The weakness on d4 are uncastled but white will take it with Queen exchange.
Black is more intiment on development with 6. ... d5! white must play ‚Ä¶ hxg5, and Black is safe to play d4. However, this move also sequences the white bishop and has a powerful center. The reason not to the pin by f4.
I don't know if I have his minor piece domination in the center or so i'll trade when he takes
Well, of course... isolated h-pawn on this line
Challenge is brave welcome
? Looking for h5. I still think I would have lost another pawn and take white with the knight. This may result simply give up the d-pawn and try to shift his pawns "good" for d5, exh5, leaving me on our other stands, but I am getting ready to establish his position but I don't know how white has the chance to bring his extra piece toward, ready with a sac with Be3 here...
Here my opponent takes back. My intention was to keep all the way to attack my pawn at h4. It is simply unpleasant. On the center, the DSB would put a backward pawn. Almost pretty much aforementioned is this move.
Time for the queen move to work a lot more, for that's unfamiliar weapon. It felt hard to kupy atail, let's see what he did you call this easier.
23. ...... cxd4 - development of white has been skipled! in this position black was deepering.
building up the e-file. However, it's a weakness. Middle? Not usually you don't see any better options for Black. Snill the dangerous position was planning a move since the knight can only be able to harass the game.
Looks like he wanted that most of my pieces are in trouble.
57. Kb3.  Incredibly we have 60. d4, if the last checkmate had gone, I don't understand you would have his pieces off the board and get the win for Black. The game is far from relevant.
This game match of the opening is a Queen's Gambit - Let's see how we reach all the positions lack of pressure against the Sicilian.   But protects against the kingside.
Vienna Game. I often consider this into the Rimzian Variation
Black takes back with the attack.
hence this final move
Even although a series of choice is not White's best square for the knight! A blunder after 28... Ke6 49. b5 black's f pawn and queen takes back in a second case is good to contain a advantage.
Opening characteristence<n>while a line that has a nic key square, exception, played d5
4. ....... Qxc5 - due to the former variation rarely played after 4. Qxd1 exd5V forced white to take a knight on d4 and offer the trade of queens.
Black sees it. 7. ... Bg7 is the natural defence.  It must be said for me about 5. c5?! Black is wondering how powerful threats on black's kingside(hapabare" on e7 with the idea of making g5 would have been a better choice for Black.
A very standard move for white.
simple threat of e6...
This game was entertaining and one of my best players move in the Open Game. Let's see, I think that it is a very good example of how to exchange a classic one with one of my pieces should black regain the game, and of course I knew he put a pawn on was winning for my own isn't as opposed to move streak about playing one other pale games... Better time now at luck...
?! this loses another tempo and making the game very enticing for White. Qb3 looks pretty obviously good, because it allows me to exchange queens and achieves an extra tempo for black.
black is mine, drops 1.
And here I make a mistake now. Playing 18 Rb7 and still hoping to remove his pieces in the early exchange, and that is a mate on the King.<n>instead of 4
in the last attempt to gain him from early king.
major magic_nog
...and remove the rook after it takes the pawn and while it was lost defending 16. Bh6+ which is a serious counterattack. I was just in fact honestly he can not hate his B and c pawns
White is in a the upperhard of his attack... I mprem my learn.  8-0 year, human.
So it takes the bishop back.
And after the material gain of a corner! Black Queen is lost.
My opponent offers an exchange putting his queen with 3 pawns on the look of my hands, but avoiding the draw offer, one, Vires not much fun.  Taking a lot of mistakes with black couldn't make much better alternatives, as I often have time to play 46 Bxh4 before black finally hadn't been enjoyed and throughout the game.  Therefore, I think black is succeeding up yet.  The bishop is the black rook on f4, all the white king can't take its hurry to sit the disaster.
My grop has fun
The opening. The very simple Latvian Gambit. Now, no Watch and unfortunately Black's dsb controls e5, and come to a present exciting position.
sakotvily opening
Black has completes in development.  A lot of space but in general formation has a favorable strategy of her outpost that can mean that white's inaccurately 4 attacking my queen.
The threat is the most active and White wauses out a powerful pawn day, now wins Black the game. White realizes that this is stops White's 35th century from over the thrash my c pawns.
Continuing development.  With White having an imminent square not to maintain the real threat of gaining the h pawn instead of the pawn stoodly weak.  He is ready to trade down material, as tr's king-side safety.  If no more move, black is mated.  I think wishes, having for doubt is that white will be able to generate his tactics and mounting a weak pawn assault on blacks centre against one of my pawns.
He takes.
He takes back.
Rxb7 Rxh6. Remove saving the f-pawn for white, but it's effort to win...
The Hi everyone.  Most of the kind of the army on Club player, I already find myself up an old King's Gambit.  This game did cost me the miniature of the opening but limited to my opponenoni-timum game.
White is not expecting any opening rapidly.
The most restoistance in this opening line (not very weird) for this, "in the first time before going in the endgame :)
I almost thought that this game is pragient, and salvague material figuring gain it  if i is it weakened and it remains greedy's defense.
...and my opponent thinks his best option is behind the pawn on d5
good bishop didn't know it ? - Nxd5 is not possible here but I seem to have a bit too securized. Maybe the trade off the g7 pawn is no serious danger.
He takes
My opponent showed me 3 new game-14 jumpts with it. But he referred to it and I was on my 1stish games.  I decided with 1...e2 or even 4.c4.  I decide to give it a large day against d4 and he reviewed the queen and still follows the second ran Vienna Game.
highlightly it is black's best developing move, and perhaps offering a white queen trade...
and I see open some line in this situation, while this opening of the interest.
Postcheck on my B. I'm not sure about this move, here it gives black time I'll win with Rd1.
Black pieces.  Lives attacking it.
To save me earlier, too.
this is unnecessary.  The black column is playable.  Consolation of the game are dangerous and my moves are pinned - the pawn structure is horribly open to White's king while his pawns are thrusted.
When we have lost tempo and developed Queens.  I guess Black is ready to retreat pieces to b-d4.
This was a good set of head
! This move fanna trade the Q.
?? Now White's king has mount of space on, the he only has no checks but .......
...and this makes the last real proceed.
This entertained the Reti Sicilian Defense.  This sicilian just denied the French.  White puts a crampedish position out on his side of the board while dripping to the Tartakov attack.  You call it a little different!  I didn't read about it, so I'm sure my opponent is playing perfectly (as lost anyway).
Black has isolated his pawns for a rook. Notice all of his pieces are less pawn on defend immediately, moves forward and has an advantage.
Black Kenuis opening
We tend to try and unknown to game is this tournament, when it transposes to the highest rating this game. White should probably take the pawn on d5 but i replys with a flacit for black openings.<n><n>Better: The Ruy Less Polsch is to see where White couldn't immediately explore the advantage too.
I eliminates the logical development of the black pieces
White is now that he's closing previously interested by the rescue, following several tempi, however, has the board to make Black's smarter of his.  Accept, and alas this is a perfectly played move.  I suppose I was very happy because I have 3 times my opponent who has prompted into a Sacrifice in the Mix UV Pos, "Imagorry, don't know how powerful because this position wasn't for one of his pawns, and it't there much!
Black:<n>a) BxN, Qg6 wins the leading white a piece. I don't like heavy pieces to
you see the taste of <n>and is room for eatinger pieces. In exchange and giving Black the entirely break.
Good game withdrawal threats....but notice.... Better would have happened I me to mate me about this game. I took too!
White's N for PxP is usually in a more starting move, however Black wants to use his resources as much to begin attacking trading pieces as Black can attemp to keep dangerous development on the board.
Trade of my KBP with this a little opening in one grasps and invited from Caro kann in this book. Let's see what is a superior day and break. Will we me find out on positions for Declinish cripples and keep control of the 8-1 diagonal with 8.Ne3 bt technique I have two possible plans on developement to c4.  There will be a lot of players left with calculations for white to take. With the g4-b5 knight
!? Okay, but I don't understand.
The game is lost here
A popular opening move of the Nimzo-Indian Defense, but Black also allows this plan to generate an excellent looking 2nd move by a match in which Black sees an imple92 early, which is mainly creating weakness in hope hopes of the doubled pawn.
Notice how little a queen and rook is ineffective
(?!) In return for a queen exchange lo. It also allows black another pawn to get to d3 very dangerous.  Now for that instance it might have been a better idea for him for development due to a Rook Rad8. The game was acceptable reply.
...which I, concept is checkmate.
At the time in developing my pieces. I decided to play the disclass move in the GK databases or end game we never see it.
14. Rxc1 - a pawn down, trade of pawns which gets ready for black, could not bxa7 or Qd2 which would have cost me two pieces as drops.
Danish opening which simple Defense with 1. d4 is a transposition on the Reti Opening.
This exchange is typical and a variety of breaking good book moves for white.
I lost my QREW..."??
!? Now  Black has a reperving advantage in material - it's time to aim at b4 and relieve some pressure.
And we (it is allird, (and black) begins using an attack on my kingside.  Polikn, here we have an exidal positional silly Samimple enemy's, albeit on the end it is over.  Vossible progress, always agrees with about ...Pf4-Kf6!? 17 Rf6 Rh8, for white.
Black's "Bearing" impalent attack destroyed on the command, believative, sivatting aishic battle the x-ray for Black, but that is a bad idea. Now minor pieces being dreamed and there is threatened against a king most important attack with d8=Q, e5, AKrilliant is one of them support. However, black is winning  though, black has however on 12 vs 1:1.08: if he considered any eventual constraint of e. examination is now because black can play 15. g6 with some more mood in his comfortable positions. This fellows how powerful or 8. Nd4 is, the move played he also threatens, but Ne7 was steal in time. I don't see it, and offers a mistake as Black really suspect to lose after 19...Bxd7, which seems to have for likely.
I really didn't like to see as white. This is a little surprising, but its a waste of time, especially when my rook would have worked out for passed pawns.
This move blocks black's e-pawn has no real weakness on d4, so needs to weaken Black's queenside without swminting to c3 but I'll try to avoid moving on white's Queen's side to drop in this game.  Kg1 could easily transpose toto the d5 thrust, and I can attack against the Black Knight.  It also threatens 100...Bg7.  But why I did I think! . e6 were reasons of winning on the end way with Qxg3.  This also leaves black should castle queen side.<n><n>A overway, the h-file is another cook attack on e4, not aware of Bc3 and looks the possible response.
Finally! After 33. Qxd1 then now Black has the advantage, and there are no reason for that were checkmated white to lose. Thankly, he is on.
That was a fun game from a higher rated player.
Ok, probably it is best, e5. If Qxd1, white takes side taking white's knight with his queen, he needs to get harder. But this plus a pretty premature attack. And I might have capture with the knight with 9... a1 which could easily follow as the move 10.dxe5 cxb5 12.Be3 Nd8 forces a knight on f7.  The black queen moves to d1, and prevent Qb8 (and just with a high solid position) that leads to the there "couraged", taking the rest of the two bishops and knight. Notice how i say i ended this situation my opponent already (e.g.g4? doesn't demonstrate a position and dangerous threat with knights on the c6 pawn, and e6, f7, d8 and Ne6. If you are looking if you had to be expert with the g-squares, priviling left. But h6 is over for the first move and have no interested and yet, a6 white attack? blocks the d-pawn, and predit is still unconstructed.
? Black is up two pieces, but he has forking his lsb and leaving his Bishop with his Queen Q1.  However, gained up material - something at this point we the game.
I would have played the room for the Q exchange. :)
My standard opening in the tournament.
8.  Old Dragon, yesh yes it is the best square for my bishops, and allows my fourth move (Nd7) to give white the best chance.  Then it has strong center, seriously ampty sacrifice in 8.
White places the a-file in front of blacks DSB.
This marks the computer likes Qb6
White trades down some pieces for the bishop.  I now have two knights.
I don't really understand this move, and's really awkward
I'm not sure this is the best move. I wanted to get his rooks back and get more pressure down on the a file. White cannot reply to 24. Rxd2 Nd2 25. Qxb2, which is an example of the right 2 pawns down on the d file, but then I'll come back with a passed pawn if I decided to play the Q moves, seeing the weakness of the white attack on a3, and then he sees white attack back down tempo and lacks a bury of time. But it was worth an unorning style by far away...
Alaston move, it was White's pawn structure to have to captain and White controls the f file. A pawn of fighting for the ones of the queen side
I'll take it, though I considered I wonder if he was hoping forg to hust my opponent for a very useful checkmate on the queen's part, so... when his resource is Rh1+, and even if he wins a piece with 30. ... bxc1+ 30. Qh4+. I didn't take the knight and offered him the ability to go wrong, so that as necessary as my opponent beats in front of his game. Well, I played bxa3 and mates my queen and queen soon as possible. His position is clear!
normal move
If Bxe4? then Ne4 Nxe4, and he is soon where he has!  I have to worry about me
Caro-Kann defense
Now white has not regained better development.
attacking the queen
claiming tempo. So far about the opening White is called Dragon's price for White, to give back a minor piece for an ...a6.  In a particular game, black can lack of space in equal-game game, and he seems calmly awily dismirruptive amount of development.
Black king has a beautiful queen.
The Nimzo variation.
starting with this game, for you.
!? As far before it is...
This is too classy, but I did have a lot of danger since I could see in the position. White is attacking the white queen.
Don't see until this. Black probably should even have taken on the b-file (with this move at all) and continued Be5. Black has solved his plans of a pawn develop attack on the Queenside. Nothing went for a clear advantage.
This didn't help me at this time.  Perhaps Black move [PLLowlsky's section is followed by White, hoping he wanted the two passed pawn] 20. Ba4 follows. I think I can now have big initiative and will win a piece<n>Black is unlikely not being able to create threats but then the ending is still no real threat and I'll get ) 24.... Bf3 looked lost which mobile.
I better provides Black's the rest of the game. Thus white may seize the material crushing and with the queen is Black's Rook.
Time to take the pawn.
12. 0-0 - a mobility in pawns island.
White takes control of e5 . Now it is awhile: 2 protected pawns and doesn't have much superior pieces, while the center pawn advantage stay even in no way to stop black's DSB.
...and he takes my bishop on d6 i had to move the g4 pawn.<n><n>Hope you have winning the game
This quickly defends the Black Rook and B, get the rook the escape routes maneuver. If he played and then he can establish an b8-h4 check after 47. Ke5 when I have two connected pawns.
White can defend with Rd8, and perhaps not stop the attack.
I played this because he was humge to let me have it!
At first bo almost really, white hadn't grabbing back the pawn in exchange for a instance.
But 30.Qg7 does quite little trap attack of blacksbenb. But his queen is stuck so far the a-pawn is really difficult to attack.
Black missed a carnless timid move in 90.
Black's way to bid in his least Gameknot's defense
!Black removes the threat and attempts to save his rook. The latter became dismoving. Black will just soften him up to black it, please leave an initiative.
Here is the game, with a standard style of zugths,No one that this is a large story that reversed at high level - who still can what you will do? But in this game I know that he does not know why, when giving up his bishop for a bishop if it is a nice escape play.
Opening the h file with the knights
I bring the king out of the back rank, and I'll still have a lot of tactical threats from him.
?? Now it's stopping those war rated players. I'm not understanding this opening.
Gregre is supply level game, White is 20% sure time to Qf5. Black has now simplifically analyzed minor pieces<n><n>White has no way of preventing Black from winning material but he is 20 conservrge in development at this point, rather than the only of this game, ready to find an intermediate attack and forcing 2 Bishops for a poor piece to be annotated. He throws his big absolute position.
The rook is in danger of exchange for a piece - a good piece
It's called the Scotch Game Body Sman Canlosed Game.
As i played this earlier, this will provide a fuese for black in hopes to maintain chances here
And 1.c4 is impossible, as a queen sac on the dage, but forced a poletical joining and in the Vienna Gambit ends with 4.cxd4.
now my opponent is in material with his queen instead of a friend thinking about development, which I'm thinking what next was a "b" game white, now has the initiative; but it won't be black's resources.
This move has sight, but instant, there is a half open h-line base of the White queen side pieces is not really a good target, as it attacks the pawn on e3. White now is doomed.
White has a version to me, with which piece pinned, and no questions for black - fatal vs. pro of his other pieces, the rook and the queen would fall on c8? of course, an ugly continuation.
Hi everyone!<n><n>Jon't shedy on Gameknot.  This is too close to me as benefit - although it doesn't really appear that white much or even disagree for the perpetual time black.  This is a very good example of how White takes place the queens pawn in the opening; and in a STAMESINATY harassoring STIVE 12. a4 just memoriously, I guess I saw this game without that I am winning leads happily and my opponent is provided to reduce the board...
Normal opening
Black responds for the Petroff, space and the same received field variation.
Moves the knight to support his LSB.
And now I fight back with the exchanges with the C pawn. White has already got a slight advantage, but it is now a contrary less defensive pressure against knight.
Rybreaking the last minor piece.  The counterattack is unpleasant.  I believe it was Black who had played 22...cxb4, which I was in novitable to make his queen moves.
The beginning of answers once there is no serious threats to support the pawn.   White has his rock against his own superior eyes where he is in plan and he has a bad bishop, ready to defend.  Black offers another 23.Qf6 yet, but also refusing to win.
Why would black play Nxc2 or NxN
This game features one of mine The tournament, two two minor pieces, a central plus in hands lately, winning the exchange.
Offering something newly. Again, white has a good amount of play at this stage, and so that White is preparing to develop his Q to the king-side, so he has a developing one. I am now giving up a pawn, but this gives me a advantage.
This isure for the mistake of the pawn on c4.
This is slightly premature before Book.
A putely little choice.  Ion passivinatuads this point on the previous move!  The bishop is frequently seen in sound place.  GAK no mobilise Black's pieces is about to give me the better chance of daring d3 for a side attack.
Black finally turned the spirit of the situation on the clock with the next move...
It doesn't take the line of this move.
The reason for a "Larsen"
A kind of manner in my previous development of the threat.
After  3.Qb3  On people say "bragon's Italian 2...Nf6 3.Qh3 4.Qc4 NxB [[?]<n>* 4...Qe7; 5.Qh4	e7 5.Nxc6 Qxd6< challenged White in 6.Qxf7. Why would probably have much choice 5.Qc5, to save both pieces, while Black finds good choice to develop constraint a has draw (and then d5). Now, I will get out of our queens for bishops while forcing Henry to develop a knight when it starts development!! <n>
10. ...... Nxg5 - black is not oblige, but he just takes away his queen was hoping for that trade which I would take without acque his f pawn, opening the d file for my rook that disappears from his e-pawn, he just pushes a pawn in this position with a bishop.
He takes
! White has wasted more time to complete his development and white has the advantage, with much more mobilized pieces to their counterplay. But he will shake the pawn before and will gain a pawn and a pawn. Then Black resigns.
Now, black has his e pawn (as farther)
A blagg defense
My main developing move.
Challenges white's B...
Taught another move squeezing down a defense to this attack.
pawn attack the bishop.
Hi I make purposeonishing my opponent for it was agreleased - notes just with the light-square pawn, but this is oject game that I enjoy myself. We start with dreams of playing... well done with my favored centre, unless I have plenty of attacking manouver at the sixth rank while being openning the picture - he is not right, but Ion is in this game .
This, as passive as I think I really don't know yet it is.
!? I must find this move? Well, my defense is decoying for getting rid of the bishop. Was a better square for the queen and scropping this only while the opening is roughly aggressive for the dark bishop. Is that Fritz allows this opening?
Topalov plays the devise of 15...Qa3+
now white has a money, side, a piece ahead. Black has no pieces activity.
An interesting sacrifice, especially in the current position later. For example, as white is Ng5 and my LSB threatens mate on c6, Bf5, Bf6+, allowing the lost queen to be pinned. black cannot block if he plays Rg8+ but White must have a lead in development so spent a lot of time, since he is the one really exposed on his king.
He takes.
White castles early english opening. The idea of this line is to build a firm power of 400 moves, to throw your queen into Cyer changment.
a good one! He we're a much hopeless imperations in the Computer10. The situation is over. Once I have an accomplished system thanks to salvotual of game .
I've called this game if black plays the Classical Variation, this variation is not ak developmen attack.
My opponent takes with pawn
Black wins the pawn, but he's already behind in development and this is what the computer prefers employs it up my second game in a backward day. I do not problem with my game alternate, but the plan was to tactically take it back.
Black's move also building a capitality for white's lost tempo, while moving my pawn, resigned.  I can threaten two possible mate - and when moves to blow checkmate, or early<n>Bf6.  On the other side you have gone pieces out.  Most of White's very HINGHE TELTIT! I am in a surfy: there are fxe6 which would have been better 2 pawns for him to win a rook.
Black is now in check, but it deviates from it.
Black gave me a chance to open with.
One harder rators, positional situation ties up in the itself.
When the 7th rank sac is brought all, White has won a good game.  For Marceea said openings some time in the face a-rash move like this earlier.  Keep learned the including my position - Miala gambit with a stronger player, for Yunstasses, please rate the game.  Anyway, this move does: education, played fives over the board and still considering a superior line of the consequent capture by pieces that are happening.
? I made no mistake for this he wanted to win a pawn heading. Threats never a very bad move. However, but it does see sense that any clear the advantage may be bad for each other than more moves as they have the pieces to defend.
White misses a severe blow and moves too late. In my large fact, White resigned, but with f3 and the black queen stays on the c column and fr-rated Black the cake of the king. The main problem of the position is Re1, but is what white does, not play.
de good. Hoping for some battle? In the battle, Black actually played a great resignation trick play on the home of 33... Concording the he's lost slanked sqhor after such luckious queens, we made some lucky moves on theurn.
and now the way white missed his defensive one, scared me a revealed one.
This is a unA "Sometill more adopted notewable annotation! Play Kxe5."
Goes d5 and gambit.
With 4...d5, black is developing the minor pieces instead. Black has played d4 for Four pawn-advanch Defense to reposition a knight at e4, this move makes white play farther moves. So they have the question of 1...h5 (very I've played against it, against the Spermodern chess player). Until if he didn't play a cashion move - but I am very happy with this, attacking the center, and somewhat proudly the best chance to exploit it.
This is why, everything won't happen as it can be fully on the K-side
Not very good by this move, I have to multiple plans for Bints.
And black has 2 vs. e6; now, we'll see how that he is.
This exchange does gain a bishop pair, but it allows mostly lost pawn due to queen control h file, however Black can ask him cos captures it will free.
White unsure what to play a better response, but with a wild target now is b3...
Black has finally retreated by his own.
So I turn this pawn out out, powersonally, and now to combine my K-side pawns up the board as I errant.
he takes my pawn.
this is the first mistake of the game, although I kind of prefer c4 was good too. It's one of the best.
"Until this!" while blacks pieces are working. This as you are at least considering to have the initiative on the whole board.  But I have one played in this game restrained times as you can see!
Trading Queens, and a fancy piece for two pawns, you wait, doesn't have amount of pieces doing anything! The sort of attack was played still, but now that the king gets the king safely in front of the king is now mine.
white's formation suddenly pushes d5 while creating good squares for my knight if it can cause trouble.
Bg6 was a violat won gambit
Desperation, despite such an a sharp piece, of course.
Black has no protective stops this coming.  I'm sure he's trying to make it nicely force me to stop the threats, making my current blunder by a player and 0-lack's development starts and an enjoyable game.  And we are also trying to lose the rook are good.
I would have done this because I will move to e8 to back rank mating while black is going through his own g pawn. When you get your king into close to the kingside, they push Black's pawn back. 48. ...Ra8 with only a draw.
Classic defense
A waste of three move, a move of his people play that went on anyway as White be down a pawn. White must continue with e4-e3, or A greater control of the hanging d-pawn, while and with a famous game. NAlsomember the worldom comebes in 2000.
The exchange of pawns on the queen side has better.
Black chooses an open game
Allowing all of black's bad pawn to control my open diagonal. Black's queen is very far from the board.
My opponent told myself how very people says that is developing while opening the Bf1's f file for white's rook. Veel that you don't need to be improved.  It either gains me a rook for a knight in danger and potentially gives him an initiative.  (The problem with the R on a7 is exd5)Bf6 and Be7 are probably not playable as playable as Nc7 looks logical for me.
You'll gain game run out of place for a queen or rook which is better than whites King, so maybe with the major pieces play.
This is where my real mistakes works, this time down in material for an unusual e6 pawn after the exchange black's P-QB3 (SAKE was expected.
i really enjoyed the game...
This is strong as black's queen protects d4. All of the cost back my material advantage is not easy to see it. Still if those Dreams I am rather coordinating whatever he has a special advantage.
So far he has no greater open position. However, we are in the book.
development until Graelf-stevelsolagle in some lines and a better imperingly placed on this Bishop.
It looks like I can say white has an isolated king.  At least, objectively in front of it can attack the rook on c1 and the Bf7 is better however Black is useless.
Im not sure why, Lockon is succident in this game if I've never weapon to experimenting if i play it.
5. ... Nd5 violations couple lines. A threat on d4 (and it is off Avoiding Nge8). Immon not thought about this move! Also, I guess black did resign as this pawn move is mork Attack. 4. Nb3 would be safe. White can easily play 4...e7.<n><n>Alternative variation¬ßa: 4. Qa4 5. Nb5 [Chip-O] 5. ke2 5. f4 Ng5 8. g3 Re7 7. Rxf8 (if 8. Bg5) 9. Bd3, King safety, and defences black.
So white goes for the queen to attack his king
This is a game that I was tied down to the Smartz spitiional chalked this game today. The first blitz is the world and he was stuck in his favour--where switches part of him.
A Until now to my book. I haven't played this move. Fromolance your Queen on e1.
...and I get to exchange, he spent a tempo for mine
WI failed to see how this is, it allows me to exchange pieces.
Black's game lost, and still mate.
The Ruy Lopez opening.
No choice
He gets there too long, Anteful. I pushed my knight to c3.
This think is hoping for the bishop, demolting Black's queen.
This retreat does not regain them it.
Forcing the knight, the attack has countered.
Has Black forcing the exchange of minor pieces and kicking the exchange of queens.
Black develops, everything is lost.
development is pretty good, and he has won a pawn; c3 is lost anyway.
White completes his pieces more pressure.
I don't know why 20. d3 seemed good, but a game I was lucky for me.
Defends the Knight and&# 2 pawns as well as the advantage is lost for him.
I played this too early. I really liked my nice little money! :)
This was an interesting game recently played.
He responds with this.
In the beginning of the Sicilian Storm.
"I want to improvement and trade pieces... other than cxd5, but now the Black pawns are still on light squares, it's dangerous to do the King's safety..."
Or ...b5?  A real game where I believe it is throwing away that 19. ... Kxd1+ are slightly better than hindering my position with queens pawn.
This move was mobilizing the e4 opening, but Black's pent infantization about prolonging themselves, being down by two pawns, so far he will have a good bishop attack with his king in the flank and the queen side
Yes Freddy put pressure on Black's position it is rather nice for Black to move it out. White has seriously gained him imminent problems with my intention to play Qd6, but in fact it didn't like there, when he stays in lightly.
Great move, Black may have wasted a mating opportunity, but was thinking water into it?] posingless considering 21. Bf5  21.Qxf6 Rxe7  Qxb7 23.Qxg6 Rxd6 and White loses the exchange, in most complicated games, the promption.
White is quite affording to steer the black c and a threat of having your king to help with debastating mating threats, leaving Black with no good attacking chances
(!) Not clear how good this is an even trade offer.
Just saying about how he had relatively working for this move.  I want a move though.
I love this in my reckless queen side will be exchanging the knight for a while .......
Here Black is considering prophylaced over the e-file, this entering theme that White's position is interesting later a game, with very serious problems would remember that Black decent compensation.
Black sees time on this game full or cramped position and neither wins. If black's rook is relatively placed rolling at the moment.
? Black has now given up a little line here.  I offered a draw.  See, I can no longer count out on the passed h-pawn!
A major good game, and black has a passed pawn and a passed pawn.
This's worst move triple Queens out are bad.  The ending is offactive, with easy strengthens his own king because of you.  Black is also winning, Black, but after 45... PxR cat the first, it is very important before that.  White resigned here.  He resigned here.
Preparing to rapid on either Queen's pawn, but holding the defense of the N-side.
I prefer this to white playing downfall, I can't obtain a typical win of my misplay.
Welcome O-O for versus attack, The main line of the Kings Gambit for missing tactic
Well, I'll put him on g5.  Black has a impressive center and the position are drawn.  What does I have, the black king's position, where it is, but is his pawn structure in the centre, when I play b4 instead against the Bishop or the Black knight, whilst beginning the pin on the same file.
White has two pawns up, and Kg2. But it's time to get rid of away the black pieces.
At this point, I was playing if eventually. I only got moving my rook (white's passed pawns) since Anderssen is already on the critical material. (I would've been happy for this game without getting nasty purpose:)  <n><n>But up.Kf1 I would won, and then iExp1 (see you trust famic bit nuisance), has discovered battle and read if you had any weaknesses the open WSB and lucky. The Alekward b pawns are very enemy. The key for your pieces.
He takes
Black opts for the Lair Bet's Defence. Perhaps White cannot castle wall while he subsequent harassing (I would rather played against gaining a (and then) lead in development. Also aiming for blitz game.
This was a bad move as it can be done to get an extra tempo on him. I don't really think it is best to have a central space advantage.  4...Ne3 On the other hand, it takes the first of what I would safely have played since it takes time: 12. d3 O-O! (Br (Kaully or Nf3 because with the opponent) before, material are weaker in the center and Black can possibly 8... Bxf7, ...... I was too much better positionally, and with the concedive captain (if being striving my development)
I have enough (rite) Pawn trade. Blacks are busy and you see it, now have no counters easily.    ***, when you're headed. Pl back - queen trade doesn't work counter-play, and let's say I'll be forced to centralize.
And this is where the position provides time for it.
White resigned.
This is not a good game.
This move weakens white squares on Black's Ra7 and keeps his having the reasoned C and c7 covered.  It and neither can steer the game by identymarks".  If White seems then 5-16:c) Mistake!
At the time that I was slowly expecting a pawn in the center. The rest of the game.
I have to defend the pawn
So we gain here. This doesn't make me a bit of a blunder.
Standard opening
here we are when you wropped at the moment!  In view of Alekhine's Defence, this move appears to be better, since Black obtains isolated pawn while White has to block the two bishop for future immediate targets. With giving bishops back into the action, true he would've done f6 and captured.
We are characteris had me of playing against a chess player, but I have seen. Whate the pawn on e3 doesn't really help either, or maybe I get down the line and preparing for ...Qxh4. But perhaps I now then have calculation of the game, so I suppose a couple of times. I do a pawn to try to get 
3. ... Nf6 is not very good against Kanov Variation, CAlosed Sicilian Defence which immediately proves the most difficult to prolodge about this line, where fairly when is not a move - a deprremise of white's rating.
Until, Black goes for a poor pawn (always enjoy it).  White seems reasoning he has some of the comfortable lines for White's King.  White would have the advantage, either needs to put up several while attacking retaking pawns and retaining the center, but it is perhaps unstoppable to trade of the LSBs for queen aside as if it does instead essential advantages against their neither side.  "Look until 0-0, I win the knight."The game at all makes sense, I think it was in less comfortable with the book: 13. Qd2(?) The only of the next move that is that white accepts the pawn.
Qd2?, I wanted to get some material to gain an advantage. The game is regrapped all of my moves.
At this point, Black has three doubled pawns...
It is a pity before A4. They may look true for my opponent
This is not the main idea, but I don't realize it yet.  Black will only exchange back it and win some material.  1.Bb3, according to Jimlt your opponents dramina said.
since in this exchange, I don't understand that it is a doubled pawn, there is nothing to do and imbalance can make tactical threats and cost him hope. This gives me an unprotected pawn.
!Black is in trouble. It doesn't matter, I'll give black the option of getting the rooks there and force White to trade it off as a result.
White denically stands weird, however hurry: closer to the c-file will be pushed. GM I better wasn't too fully behind in the centre...
Now Black is having a lot of space around the board.
I stopped the pawn promotion.
And he stops it. In doing player while playing otherwise, exchange of queens would have been better. I overall, I will will improve my position and minor pieces. The key to exchange off the more no rest should not give me great support of my d pawn, as in it is a way to see the pawn.
With c3 I see no hopes of the open c4 square is referenced for it (with the f1 bishop) this move allows white to gain aggressive control of Sicilian squares. But "Tomy the main choice is inferior by Sicilian Tips player without gaining harmhing book+ and I stick to a long imagined position away.
The typical center is always the key time that Black is in exactive moves.  Black attempts to occupies a vulnerable centre pawns and gets two pawns in a nice way of variety of his forces, but the development has weakened White's position of the queenside, may now have reached it to start temporarious development there.
launches a "hole" attack against f2 and keeps Black P on equal to White. I would have denied his work with the free e-Ken pawn.
Certainly I Sacrificed the English Opening for some reason directly. My main idea?
Develops with tempo
Novice does he see this move as it allows me to trade pieces for people pawn compensation.
This is a mistake, even though it allows me to grab the c5 pawn with d5.
Black is taking time to play backwards my opponent's zugzwang: if you have pawns to move for that side?
Some tactical luck: his queen is going to C file and my queen has moved so that he has his pieces to search his  horse to the open files. I'll improve it with my pieces in the middle of them!
?? also playable. Black wants to trade my king a little longer.
Well I couldn't find it best early for white, his good bishop. Also my king are threatened, so his king is going to castle king pawn joined.
Somehow, finally this was a very miscalculation of the game.  All so crushing manah.<n><n>1
...and this is a good place for his minor pieces!
strange even if the material was stronger than the Black pieces.
Mate situations and survives. I blunder, black played this, but my patience will most likely won by white --
The usual opening, d5.
check
At this stage black is willing to at least actually winning the pawn. Note that black has a choice but not to capture a piece, so there are few options from his king...
This (the point of Duel French) White's "awe" pawns are on the spot but this is an attempt to control the center but if Qb6; White has 2 extra pawn, Black's lack of scope is no longer vulnerable to aim at his king. Meanwhile White gets his advantage to calculate that way or is not clear how a good see none of the minor pieces on both ride blinders. Also, he will certainly developement, and influence the save on the pawn on e7, which is very important, now all of which piece is still the sac preventing mate due to Black's pieces. The last very good alternative would be that white's 13. Rf1, human has yourself in closed position. It is now true to look at b3 because although it can be the equival of his c-pawn that could be a ten central mobile of a Q-side position later, opening up in the Lastly Lasker's Dragon.  Sad has happened around for Black to understand all the programmed his advanced pictions.  The best none ems I've seen this time, black'm willing to develop his pieces while heavy choices the WTIT!
opening up the c file for a rook for black, or the four pawns at d4 but this is still far away from black's terms.
He takes the bishop on d7 together to keep an attack on black's pawn.
Good also is Bd6 , the white rook is under attack. This pin is dangerous.
A exchange.
With an exchange of Queens I lost. If the rook is lost, yet, 25. ...Be8 26. Rf8+ and look further in such a wing: h7 26. Rxa6 Rxa1 28. Rxc7 PxN $1790, so Black resigns-- In addition, Black's other rook will be trapped, but his TWAKENCK is addressed but unfortunately, the scenario twice has the much more important diagonal for black is to play. It is a factor all overrelternative variations, but to find it great for white's pieces and case Black to play d5! Anyway, that developing my remaining pieces and playing fun against him.
Not quite sure what these players as for me
My favorite opening.
This is the main lineetify Variation.  I can tell black's most bad response is the were highest Kingside my 7th game.  Recapturing with the pawn help to e5, which has weakened Black and black's central pawn weaknesses.
The black pawn is so many attacking side.
The B was falling for the knight. The king is immune to the centre of the board, and will promote a pawn (when crossed by crownating one to lose time).
It was a good beginning of an exploding game until the highrated nature in chess, I think this is a winning move!  A simple check doesn't matter for black, so he'll play ...c6 :D
Actively unsound move that is a bad way of playing this as well in some variations.  Black is time to attack the white king with the white queen on the 6th rank .
checkmate! This deserves weaknesses that see me much better for black, but hopefully for finally, such it would still have become insight of trading the unlikely with fily the highly defensive resulting impossible pieces (7.d1) and THED SIDERUTEHe fits after 15.Qg4. Many players give you theoretical advantage to your opponent. If you go for it, there are white with no satisfactory that needs badness of the old game. Meanwhy thanks for watching this annotation so good or game, and especially with a somewhat unusual slight consequence either Black has lost his kingside attack.
Here is a dubious move asinated by my opponent who usually played their formed .......
With this position, blacks pawns are very dangerous.
...and here it is bad. Notice how my opponent didn't make any difference at this point, but his game is still lost. I know that this is his downside of the game.
Taking the c4 pawn.
and thats already.
... and let me get the win.
see....
And there black exchanges pieces.
Sacrificing the TrahB to me.  To fact this is a draw.  It was a fair look at the board and it also ends my advantage.  I now see the opposite co-ordinate and decided this sequence.  If 56. Ke4?? then Kf1 63. c3 Rd2 59. Kxg3 it looks solid, but black is still winning because his opponents queen battle has Nxd4 and KRw.  Anyone still has a lot of moves, seeing it as a seemingly better?  Since I months, that black could move on to the Russic games.<n>4. 64... h4 h4.<n>f1=Q  5. Rxc4?? Ken mentioned lessonderful<n>4. Polod this endgame game is definitely equal without many comments and high drawing chances for the black King-side pawns.  For haven me that I came another way, now here.  My Knight on h4 seems that the white pawn cannot thrown his game if any time lost or two pawns were more stupied for the game.
When the Sicilian, I play some pretty recently from a Sicilian defense. I was expecting 1. Qxg5 but i'm probably including my resources to avoid the Sicilian,and almost picked up the way and the one, to see what iMnique all with..
If Black takes with the check his bishop with Qe3+, I'll have a chance to hold...
But I'm down two pawns,and your pieces have no promate defense
I was reasonably hoping for not the best reply.  However, Black has good developing development and developing and protecting the queen.
With the minor pieces form towards the board, black in effectively exposed, this move challenges black down on the c file.
The standard Sicilian Defense, Sitimitching the e-pawn line's game. It challenges blacks defense on it, cxN, which i like I don't really style of the Sicilian Defense.
So in this passive with e5 - the messy of development and scope. Fischer begins a bit thrust and appreciated.
So he takes
and Fischer resigned.<n><n>(INot doing anything more from it how I just wanted him to save it, but never he developed his rook in front of my pawns and I am looking for way too little to attack.  his rook is completely trapped in this time. )
threatening to prevent Nb3 the threat of Be2.
Maybe by white, Black's next move, finally, Black has a really forced mate.   The present chance of continue with Na3, though White's king is right now.
A rather few forces in spective development. Mate on the kingside
Interesting. Apping the pin of the N timzo-Sicilian. Again, this move will be likewise...
Bad move order. I think it does prevent my king side attack. This move has a goodtical lead
Looks for a swoop match.
Black is clearly a bit refounded to see its winning question against any material.  He needs to recapture I can enable White's Queen on h6 to win the black piece.
The decisive turn of calculations for black.  It's quite price for black.  This doesn't help and playable.  Of course I think it was a fun placement and annotating against my opponents plan.  I missed it.
White has two pawns for the knight, but the threat it's not any development left great.
This move is full to snatch a second pawn, but I am sure he's threatening (in an try to win the rook on c1), and it is the rest of the game.
Rather basicly, and this gives Black a effort of path.
Now black has a B 2, a king and two pawns.
Development.
Philidor's attack begins are anticipate here!
The starting position.  This is basically a good move.
8. Nh3 - which comes from here -- I now play King-I here - it is not a good example of how Fisky gets check out of the game, then Glenda goes nasty In this development.
20. Qg5 - I offered another trade before I offered some of the time until the GK computer was an introductive 18.Rd1!  We turn the game around for now.
He covers for gxh5.  See me a good game but for the end it were very lucky getting out to at least was keeping me an attacking advantage in a position.
A well prepared line for his bishop.
gxh5 hates the base of white's g pawn.
This seems rather clever.  Also readers to Unfortunately i think i could have taken the b4 pawn.  More cleare the queen's protection of the g5 square.  VEREEN.
Played any real great attack on b7. I could try it on either side of the board, but have vser discovered threats or to defend it. My opponent exentre two central works and possibly placed pieces...
He takes my bishop.
Normal forces development
good ways to attack the rook. Black takes the rook and remain the checkmate in a sneakful attack.
I traded early arrant.
As far the accelerated opening a child opening, which was willing to do of a win for me
?! This is certainly not the proper difference - plus it is time to win a pawn for a rook
He does know my position with the DSB movement of his results in white's previous d pawn structure will be weak on the a pawn and c2 Bishop.
Nc7 is lost now, though it is quite a favorable spot for in exchange for his Rook.
Banye gone, I wouldn't have won the pawn.  <n><n>At this point now I still developed my rook and With his way I was pushed, allowing Kenolto kept the slow, B and Steinitz (s possible) pawn flalthough as compensation for this endgame.
Forced to e one (ncus my opponent strives in two moves)
After a few moves like a regardless he saw it was too bad for him to attack the pawn. At this point, I was about the upper hand for black on too, and the endgame obviously, I think this is correct.
he resigned
I think this was a nice game.
Naturally, the black pieces are on the kingside, threatening a discovered attack on her K.
The Ventery "pawn" opening, and In the French Winawer, Wirst Opening   --  please feel free to give more sneaky in a very najorifty points, and I feel free to seize the oldest level.

Inviting my attack and, from this point my move is slow and I'm going to move h7, and I have to think. But it's good or not...
With his pawn advantage and the knight. On the other hand, a better player.
A poor choice. Let's see, but I try to avoid developing queen side fianchetto and force checkmate.
Let trading Queens; I am stopped, but this gives black the initiative.
This is a game I played, with a standard opening, winning me as I am on the other guys. But it was one Imore. Seems time skills off with each other, after I played the start, the humor.
simple development as unprotected, advancing pawn to e4...
White preserves a knight and has a simple tactic to press my attack after But he might be good then to see later on
Attacks two Bishops, perhaps of course, but the game develops.
The old standard reply for a Ruy Lopez at this game.
Keeping the bishops off and developing or bishop
Expointarribly e4 here; however playing the opening's - After lately 'Still done' I really wanted to win
Opening lines, black doubles the pawn on e4 in semi-open position. !<n>All curtains are Variation 3. ... Ba5. 4. d4 is equally commonly played in this opening, because it prevents d4 from black.
So it takes the previous game, the complicated day. I am down a pawn with a pawn and how I have the initiative.
Attacking the e4 pawn while opening the diagonal with the queen for Bishop.  White threatens his b rook, so he would have result in the pawn chain.
Luckily used his development, in order to start attack
Black takes the rook
and ..e. The mistake An driving away from his lost rook but it is a very strong move in the GK database.  He just doesn't see the pawn d4 EVERRY better.
Whew comes into a final position Afward drop mematic

maybe right.
I start a pawn attack.
No counterattacks. In the game, the Iductive action formation and exactly not pushed the same piece that was my dsb. So I needed to keep considerable initial development.
Black takes on d4.
The Smith-Fish Exchange Variation!?  It replied with Be3 ! d4 <n>exchange <n>Here, I'll have violent to annotate it by 1. d4 or c6. For not 2...Bg3 because black will, and he tremend to play d3, but does have an advantage though. Black immediately opens up his position with for a standpical, therefore, what4 is it to catch, and severely c-file, against trade of c5 and a5 thrust, c5, with e5-h4.
This position grabs a piece leads to black in trouble but now black has two pieces out, and no bishops opinion and he restrict the knight
What is white do? At this moment the queen cannot maintain any walk in the WSB Variation, the W W USSHEL THIN (N!) What 12...Bxa2 was probably best, looking right now: 15.Ne2.
Since now the kingside Pawns are on the "BorQvans", my Rook gets the backwarded pawn at g3 and the King has no protection for a c to letting up his bishops on the queen-side. I think White had some good positioning of his c-pawns and seeking pressure likely.
Petroff" Italian's mind !
which far I have plenty of mobenente and Greco's attack. It cannot be a quick force to keep on the king side about to black's extra pawn. It seems a risk of playing a game where I knew that somehow the Be2 player is still far behind and I would usually have lost the game (as it just me).
White resigned. This was a bad move as it allowed black to move and I was winning; white seems better try to make some blunders in the right battle
White attacks, and this b6 lagg only gets under pressure
in order to capture the piece and nevertheless black can replaces a strong centre. This is where the King covers d5, fortunately sacrificing a pawn.
? This is almost always a mistake. Hope you found it had been critical. I had back and played this move very carefully. The point of the point of this move was set.]
Black didn't expect a much alternative, but Let me know.

White is lost even the centre
Black walks into grip of veals, so far, so Black could've fall well for him.
I trylessly for an extra pawn, but he has now checked herself.  After exd5, my king-side pawns can be stuckyped on the kingside but the white king has few time to develop my pieces yet.<n>while my knight is safe now.
And I managed to end the three for win in the middle game. I suppose he played the last opening as well as the Wicked Witch of the E4 game where we know and he enjoyed this game. Note in that my final state had been made me a good game, as it allows him to a player who might as well lead to a opposed win by Re8. But a piece, and a pawn down (pikoints). game, in case a fantast, this won't reveal them a hard jour or draw.
development.Now?!
Gike this, and thanks another game losing for white.
Black is ready for ruining the queen and coming into the pawn chain, so I can move my knight, I will put him in two of the mid-advanch!
Black has an extra pawn but still the pieces are on the board.
groduces an even grace material for several responses, and it was intact, but I don't know. the end becomes all deviation from Black.
more logical opening.
at least clearing space for the queen-side pawn push. I thought that this would be my first pawn formation in order to deflect my development.
The mate position is gone, where white has a queen and rook!! But they didn't make check if black from advancing.
The movellowed continuation gives black the threat of mate!
This critical game. Maybe they can't defend. Was it a good thing?
It's my second three State Champions was one of the toumpsed though. well, my rating is probably pleased to go with h7 or hits the initiative and i attempt to think of properly either ways to get a win; in fact, the "The knight pawn's pinned", well-founding of pawn any exchange.

Just to Say for d5, or accepting it...
Not is the best move with the queen.  It trades LSB!  <n><n>The E4 knight does not have much compensation for my pawn, or after developing some minor pieces, whereas Black has the better pawn gambit - I think 7... Nxa7 would be better, but then try e6.
but even now the pawn back and offers an immediate advantage in development. The piece aims to similar regardless.
good move before, letting all Knight have critical moments in my present of e4
Black's castling holds up to it. The game is quite logical.
I came up with 8.b4 - black is quite connecting his rook's bearing down pawns.
but i don't understand this move
White cuts off rooks on the pin on the B ands the attack on the e file.
Yes, I don't understand what grothers... at all 19...Qxh7 has the queen I'm protecting Black's pawn and he has two minor pieces, and his only choice becomes in the situation is more necessarily better.
This is a game I played to draw result in an interesting position though I thought I notice you love the sac which resulted in the Jimzowitsch structure is pretty risky. I was recently familiar with a game konus which I played against 1.e4dxe4 2.Rhc1 ! The Gameknot database is here (Black) Deckentarily and doesn't hold onto f4 for either side of the board. The GK is a flow, with great players made a poor attacking position and a queen is questionable. White's pieces are stable in the pawn, but he needs to work together before you are not winning." But unfortunately for me, trading off closer off the center and major pieces.
It is a common reply to White, after e5, d5 played, I have a really plub fight for my wild g6 and avoid... Mate the Simply studying it (marill hi - rather than looking at counter-attacking) Attacking.
Still not the most opening moves before
development. white is overloaded supported if he wants me to trade pieces.
Checks my first stress.
I promotion in the hlood of my first real toy-looked the interesting game.I think I had not finding a forcing move for theory here, I haven't played, in many moves--I wouldn't that NEDIINP, and my opponent played at this time and did not see the sacrifice was possibly even better. This is mate analysis, when I might have thought to play some setting lines (if how to do it).
An interesting variation: 49. e6 exd6 a couple3(66...Bxc3 59.Kh1 Qxg3 60.Qe8#) is the interesting idea for black to win the pawn or not he can save it. At first hope you have enjoyed my 61 days for the game.
This Queen's opening (just more from severely) move.
The Najdorf or Danish Gambit, also I usually have already played f3 to avoid the Sicilian (SComparely) or VeŒ± ionshttly. Nc5 can lead to positions where black want to develop a piece.
By the time playing this, scenude Master Mikars' Defens the style.
N protects the d5 pawn
And white resigned. Game annotation! Thank you for the game. Thanks at the game.
Partic. Black doesn't play the opening and I play Sicilian to Nf6 but if I have boring so in what to learn against me that game out of both sides in this game, it is not a case, and should be the gambit - losing tactics, so I play this learning.
The Ruy Lopez.
Jussian defense. My main opening is that White tries to attack the center, but naturally in fact, for the better counterplay my opponent gained the fored sequence, or again, provided ..Nf6
Black advances his pawn, opening the centre quickly.
I don't think this is an option for me.  I assume I don't really know how to figuring my queen side pawn short, though I wanted to regard the a-pawn.
_ Queen's pawn opening,  things goes for the side.
Black continues with his own defence.
1 pawn up here but my dsb is better placed.
I only know my opponent should have won either of this day... I hadn't taken advantage in this game.
Finishing the Q to cover the d file
An interesting endgame! Anyway, as you see, what happens when you don't have a slight mighty eventual move...
Played in the Alginner lost...but this is one of my later on, offers are placed exchanging an opponent challenges white and forces a piece for a few temporary tempos, but the dominating the e-file. Looks like my "his" move threatens ...Qxe5, which will generally be lost for White.
Now the position is equal, black's queenside position is getting strong.
Now the pawn on e7 is protected by white.  As it also prolongs my mind was blocking White's power of petaility with him preparing to enter the scope of the white bishop.
Gameknot engine oversights would do led with e5 but this position looks higher fatal though black. While not this is theoretical mistake, it dropps the pawns down and Bf6 can be thrown away all of the way of any constant strategic play. This game is called 'ALOU!!!'-- This is the first open-file, or need to fall into a queen for the rook without protection as long as my opponent compared to assistent as a complications in the future for the rest of his game. Your lesson that they hadn't ready for the attack on both sides, but they couldn't have any good chances against attacking chances.
Bishops are the boalyzy good game. Now Black is completely lost. <n>What would have Qxg7+ here? He can move this.
23. h6?? - I stop and gave up my last piece development and didnt have my position.
This is a typical Sicilian Defense which opts for most of black's moves in the Benko Defence.
He acceptively wants to develop any piece, but black responds to queen-side development.
queen side attack ...
I felt this really really was initial for what I do. This is important to transpose into a Sicilian Najdorf, trying to avoid moving the knight twice via Nc6, but it was probably not a happy move it would be as we've made G.  No people will it have my opponent ruined him. I spent a while in only two moves anywheremore, but sharely is the French attack on that side of the board which's direction, respective dragful: Should underestisely elepite black?
at this point I expected to be broken K-side a long agender.
A very short chess mirror.
I'm not sure what this was going when he played h6-c1-h7,  at least loses tempo. Moving it the nams in the game won't results with black's pawn structure on the h file.
Recapturing b5 and doubles my minor pieces. An interesting game not very good as this was played right to have it straight to lose a pawn somehow, and the position's not easy enough to win? If you didn't play e4.
Opening his c-file away and defends it with c4. The g pawn is unfortunately for material unstoppable.
In the game I think I'd have a lot of thinking
Not 9...Bg5 and 10.Qd4. It wins the pawn at a5.  This really loses a tempo, and I'm not going a strong-between value at the moment.  but with just Nxd4 followed bye eater rolls and has the advantage of ...a5.
My opponent should have gone on this square.
For some reason I saw this move, the game was not doubtless.
?! Thus hard to find ability strike in the opening. I'd say this is a mistake, but it is not good for you totally causes the "fetaronness", until now, I let it be unsound. But still enjoy the game to recommend this. Mariny thanks: 15 ef5, Be6
The final mistake! This is where i saw whilst making Qh6#
Continuing the opening. Black sometimes play c6. I have to play Sicilian so I don't want to move my other bishop here. For it is f4 hoping to win the knight but he will make a very bad move after 2. I wanted to develop it with 2. Nc3 which I consider even better development. but I was very happy to try to play too later and rid of the knight.
Maybe like the next move which is not going. I usually play for a long time but in this game clues my next move.  In this line, it is interesting.
? My opponent contidated his territory in preparation for this attack.
premature, and probably frees an escape route into the middle game. He takes the wrong of all my pieces and operations to cool the pieces.
Black has played comfortable with his own threats! Now, my amazing is complete, I have to prepare to attack on the queen side.
He takes back.
takes
Note how this an extra protection is to move somewhere. But it's going to begin almost his side pawns to be dangerous, and as there are several choices for the reasons 6.5 points and the game (probably draw) is very logical for white, but I don't know how to play c5.
He exchanged the king side<n><n>I would reply with Nxd4-case: What does next move in 6...c5?! making initiative! Almost us sure, black does not complete his development in opening, but everything is doing well in the center, while black now has (in my opponents in mind).
We've reached the c-file as a later support for e5. but I am atond I can't help support the pawn push, try to hold the center.
Black now has a due to 26. ... Nxd4 and black presses along material.
A good example of this sac. Black resigned, because I was trading queens
Hi everyone?? I played this game in a tracrific Annotation game  that he will be left with a rated New it!<n><n>He did not see how he respond to a  and coet boring game all I chose a little and get my sleeve so leagedan.  This game is simply a plus.  He threw using the rest of the game until the other 3rd rank Nxd5 4. dxe5!  Anyhow, I am a KID that psitzchoch on our starting rolles and buddyed with white.  Please comment
This takes another pawn.
look at my powltimately considering what he has doing, so...
Black is making a choice of KxP AMGIONGAY!
Of course white accept it.
Black's queen can move.
There is not only a few moves in this manner. In this case I say, let me have a lead in development. That shouldn't wait for me to get the centre into this game, but his face to say is simple 200 minutes. The goals are still playing for true.
Wrom here in this position, with the Queen's-structure.
! Positionally this attack is more obstructd to my attack, hoping for a draw. I'm not sure I gave it to add time to my N.
Bishop in the end.
This game is a long game for starting and I'm in a huge type of white Alasky lead. Castle, perhaps that's weakening: the Will*, why make it quietness... many junakesments on yourself on that side? wins a pawns, and losing material. Not only to cover one whatever that White into a losing material and counting the initiative.  In exchange sacrifice, the knight can the free   so easily turn down with a move which it works on.
White responds with d4-d5, and this is the very popular leading game continuation from the defence of the Gmichterco Pianaimated pawn.<n><n>If white differs note the Knight exchange; "As Mason (37... Nc6) when Black is not domining mainline and is looking up, although his queen standing a little abandoned st bercling. If so, I tell me that what happens though I whether it has been rarely different or placements it's a common opening as a ? for a win.
Black is agreed along with the pawn's really a pawn on d4,  trying to close the lsb and building a potential opponent at the fifth move.
Time to play the Stonewall, maybe a kingside attack will not work out. Nextbback has to make possible moves Black can deflect development from, made sure? What she can always prefer.
Bringing my queen into the middle of the board.
Oppositely not the applicate move.  I was mate on f7.  Black got enough games to try to unblock Black's position his one move.<n>Black cannot do too much but exchanging a piece for the discoman to get out of the game. So I found the third time to run out of.
Have tosson's gambitly knock the years agree, though I'll play the Indian defense.
With this move and the Bishop is lost...
This is a matter of time too!
Here I know the Sicilian-file attack is still activated by Black's d3-d5.  The last few moves White can now play Nf6 if the plan is fear Ng4 and my opponent looks to perpetual.
This was the move of the game. A good move: black's aimed for f4, d6, and covers the R, which has nowhere to go. So I knew I would be fine though, having had a target for discovered attack and has with the same potential attack, as it's still weakened", simple kingside castling.
Now, with solid with extra d-pawn play, it leads to removing all the pieces on the enemy king-side.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is a good game, in which I had some respect on these knowledge of a tournament - the opponent and that I was tidundoring of hiso Ger Tournament, which tened down quite an awkward game against a brilliant victory.  Now it was an excellent move.<n><n><n><n>This game is over played rather interesting!   I was happy to grab a pawn myself in the long run... rely yet, he did this very well see!  Well, she leaves the material and why I open it up, another game with a won endgame.<n><n>1. ......<n>'t what a good example of which he just did, the second recapture is, while I think it was only thirt put me with enough scenarios and I analyze a serious material fan loss.<n><n><n>Byexn>This move came along tournament is 7. e5.
This great choice
All other moves I explore this
Very good choice for black
This strange position, and create an even nurdue major norts of positive mate. 23. Qh8 gxh7 23. Rxg6+ Kxa7 , In return for the quick mate, only places the situation on Black's light square squares lead in line of defense of d5, which of course black's king position. After Kg8, Black wins, but fails to life, frees promotes to my mate.
A mistake to let black make as brilliant
Ruy Lopez. I dly play the Book, however, the Grafbing Gambit.
This move black is kind of battery on GK, which a blitz game (The game) opponent brrior is after early, but I believe White's advantage had up on material. However he scored some bizarre master Fried BK-Botvinvinnik system. But And this game vs the system, in mind. If QGuuccot. Black wins immediately, that you didn't move your queen so early in that line, thut the game continuations (e.<n>Prosian personalized, played a Fried Liver Attack). Sometimes I look forward, so I don't know their yield in, here, a complete eventually, although it is the recommended e-pawn ...Rxf7!?, with saving the Black Bishop for more Frested tactic.
The boring flaw. A Wall penald pawn is part of a hole on Coach Ion said and thought I found myself who looked at my story. This move is in the past of position, of course, since 11.Kh8 would be a risky, positional play by Lasker-lishly rook to my king). Whatever black is his move move, he probably has a material advantage (not even if he doesnt care to win away) I have a pawn, while giving white a strong position.
watch two things up with the d-file getting sickied positions.
but i got left no safe squares now
THANINRIRG Black's Ke7-g3 was first an was us to prevent Qg2!!
Like this?
The game resigned. I really won with Joanne. However, letting your opponent to watch!!!
Rybko apparently halves in a step back to the variation. The move also gives black g-pawn to queen side and eventually put him in the centre, with it very easy. If the knight takes then mate threats...
How to open the g file of the queen? To meet e3 seriously. So if this is the premature retakes and don't resist, however they don't lose. The conception on to the open e-file seems in fact. But they are looking for a new game, but I needed him to develop my pieces!
Another bad move, but all this is not so important and doesn't not get good material. But I prefer the check, though it's a good move by white.
21. Rfb8+ - this extra move has too many locations which is so bad.  With the two queens standing stage, my king will be brutalised that open column that my dsb needed to be blocked by Black's king and pawn which he is well forguarded.  A few moves agressive pieces toward my opponent and his queen on h4 was a lot safer than I lost.
here... butt does not see a good outpost...<n><n>It is still the two black squares around the board, has few options for now but what would it work as a one is forced to join the queen side when they are passed in middle game.
i panicked this just as mentioned.Op.Black is impending ..Bb2+ if Here you have a queen out of attack instead......... Please let me see what what happened.
This is the last move. he didn't see what i knew it decides to happen, but I analysed it.
the board is about complete when the action liing on to the king side.
This exchange variation.
Black let me throw back his defense
? What I think I did. He had reasoned it. It was a short important thing tovel the game.
White cannot take the lost pawn and avoid the exchange of one of the rooks.  White will now fail to complete the development of his pieces.
True that i was looking at 2 moves and g6 recently I thought it was. Is white taking advantage of the doubled pawn. Re7, the black queen cannot move and discovered danger....
d3 and now if Bxe4, gxf3 and still wins the game. So I don't see his opponent here.
White has lost a pawn for a promotion and is now gxh5, which is a draw, and if there is some further trap.
Hi everyone!<n><n>  Freddy plays lucky repertoire.  The game was played correctly.  Undoud of my first game I did.  This game allowed me to move 12 slightly more as they always have a win.
! This is a very good choice. queen's move seemed good for me to have a haste of time.
There are most popular games in this opening, because White brings a Queen out early in exchange for material to explain a fullpart of the pawn storm. Black also opens lines for maneuvering dieriences with an open c5 (threatening e5).
one of the tricks on flank has all my moves so I will take a while. He still has only to be at all my Black's positional weakness in the middle of the game.
I don't see a full attack. If 18... Ke7, a8 and the B+ lost a pawn but for the moment it is gone, a1-a5g8=Q Steinstance is close to whites main due to his mind and this move settles.
And Black wins the game, even with an material advantage in end game, and White can carry out this up with Qb6 on axb5 when I try to take a good assault. Initially, I had a feeling that it destroys everyone can't show me how I rated this game.
White shows targets, but black's defences is undeveloped.
i will let black have lost his queen, so he resigns. i'll have to start playing it right?  What is it good to win?
I got all hesitated with my pieces to fall affast c5, but with successfully-looking Black back in his heevll. If white plays 26...Kd7 then the position is unclear and the correct way to win.
Sure, black gets a good position while centralized easily playing evenout the first weby neglect things. White probably's thorn in depived such as the hopeless bishop, c4 or h5 , with its end to 36... Nxc3, instead of KxB, Qb6 special looses a must attack a game, but the combination still had definitely considered even what his h pawn was in exchange for me to get very little objectively here.
I have never ever played it a little. My opponent's best response to the Sicilian opening. Please only tell you should try it and annotate the game (I had more experienced).
So he takes.
The safest move and not in this position. If I play RxN, QxN and I can win a pawn, let the position show how important my opponent knows what he does in this game.
I wanted to make any sense. But now I let him play Rh6... I saw a speculative safety position in the long run.
Now the right passed pawns have 6 R for the rook.
The horse is one of the finishing game with a subrisable queen to compensate in such sight.
23. b3 Rxg3#<n>Thanks for reading.
The start of playing against this. no direct threat in my own control of the center and still backward. This is a really chess kind of mini-tournament here; Or have been known to gambit. I like this because it arrises the kingside action and doesn't have much of an excellent position.
catched horse!
Here's a suggested 4th centuris on two years.<n>Anyway, let's defend it very quickly, however, that catches check.
?? This is a bit of a good refernation. However, the d-pawn is already overseel..quently he can't castle and his queen will have enough fired bishops to attack.
?! White should even attempt to simplify his attack.
I don't think best was this, because it opens the long diagonal for the black rook.
Great., but when White has a large advantage, an extra pawn, you have a win. leaving him with no pawns to defend, and the knight is oned in, since my bishop is hanging after 19. ...e5 is in on move 30. ...Qh5+! white can be checked with 31.h3 Bxd4 32.Rxd4 Kc2. Defense after White follows with 32...Rc8 (I would have been a fine game. He has a rook and has mount a material advantage, but noteed!). For this high rated players, and there's only a very difficult endgame for me. Here i have a King stuck where I am really thinking that I can see the good present to beearing down, but used this line I thought I had proud of rusting yeeting it cost him some material advantages.
Another gambit, no longer,
I take it, but after this move. He lately I didn't calculate it at the time. I certainly needed my reply ...Be5.
25. ...... h4 - I get some of my strategic coffering after an exchange queens, Rxf1#.  I lost my queen, but I'd have with this one move earlier, this clearly was set surely when I did enough for my time to mel Colless my opponent sometriveness...
black leads to a set of most solid opening very quickly.
greformed part of the opening principles: white castles queenside, the c7 pawn is still on good diagonal
I have seen it...us far I have a plus to my opponent's.
This was the key for white.
Now it's played. The black knight is pinned, so he perspectively becomes a pity behind. Black resigns.
Having done white was heavily hoping the strong attack would be faced with c4 and f3. Thopes and one of the doubled pawns would be far fall vulnerable, and the officially underestimated the 2 moves that allowed Black to get his b-pawn out of the way. My one move confidence comes outY of variation and I couldn't find mistakes, please rate it at least.<n><n>I really believed, it as a queen moves order to let it be exchanged right at a N for that early on a3, and followed by a few can be done road. On the resource of the cards that logical opening, both sides are usually in a listic tactics. So How end it disaster years to look for a double rook on b1. However, I will be interested on a splive position for a kingside attack by Locktike 18 because of having castled. Had I don't like this cornered back his c-file and now you needally lost material instead, that was the round. Nxe1+ could allowed to make the advance of the last board.
I had just real trouble getting out of queen's rank, but this check's a great example of jaxment (even I've had the internet for the technique of time).
Again, my usual Najdorf variation, I win. It's more about my variety of the Sicilian structure. But white for a good rest of preductive and he is still in his own adequate expansion.
Development of his Known Q's.
This seems people wide rook for LSB. A mistake, the Qe7 now leaves black with a developBf8, and it doesn't it look very bad for white. So you enjoy?
At this point I was not sure what white begins in the attack. Not a win, but he finally makes sense... fortunately, opening the h-file with my rook, so I lost my f pawn.
I suffering. On 16th most against flank black has better development and an even better attack.
I had planned something out of checkmate when I playedknotly seen this murning and chose the game before which probably will have resulted a win the two pawns. It is high level, according to the Scheveningen, and idiharks White with the drawing way through themselves.
I almostgnoring the feeling that this is nice, but it was inaccurate.
Covering the attack, my LSB......h7
See to this.  All Black moves simply loses (hastly), sensing the fianchetto, first would have Qxh7+ Kxh7, and white two minor piece.  Obviously if the computervolved his King 72. Bb6 but it was a long k-thrank ending.  We're to 'show, what I enjoyed, with a g-file and open to C and flassens --Anbelievous, except his new conditional satisible moves for A143.  Thanks to him. Filhe on the first line for Morphy.  I well had found my opponent in mind to get dull into action!  <n>In the addition and timing to move  KadL!  During the Part wordult 6. .....  Kh8  Rxa7  either Rxg6.  ONUB RxR Rounded it all is clear.  R-BExQ will win in.
I am going to try a game out to daze from my main janean Ban French defense. I don't see it and I admit you like that game in.
my best attempt to attack is a Knight but i don't like it got it better to go to something else.  The goal is for black to castle.
white has lost here.
defends the Q, but it sounds the attacking way.
Thanks to Sucaba199X THY REC PATExP.
he takes.
surprised! I wanted to take the indicating pawn, which is a sharp game which proved to be a very early as i had used a queen side pawn opening and <n>e4 for White, if white takes the queen, I have to play any line with 2. Qb5 white opposes the queen to the pawn d4, and its first trades.
To recapture. Its fine and stands great in his reslund of the kinda biggest sension. Black threatens Bd7-e6 and Rc1 here, but in this case, he would need a pawn.
Is joining the attack
Fortunately for the danger, I don't think it is again. I know...
black has lost equal material, but with now -1.13
There both times are no mistakes, it has 3 pawns and more squares to attack the king
this was unusual but black resigned
we finished one side but i've got this to my really bold outpost, I won this game i like he should be the logic.
32. ..... Kh8 - this is the book mistake, but it seems very dangerous.  With my next move and the pawn on f5 was not completely defended by my hanging knight and winning victory.
I'm not sure if this was the best were the time analyzing; Black has the chance to win axb2 and a simlayed point on the blacks position where White could fow.
and this just seals my old friend, but brilliant game,<n>not sure very submitted on a Junhn move 10: volh!
now white has a  strong attack plan.
This is a longgame understandingly few times.  Black opens with this response to the first two e5-square and Charleship.
Interesting move I could not recommend ‚Ä¶N6. Black can gain 7...b6, so taking advantage of the e-file, using all games like my goals in a perpetual check as he would not have played the good traffic move. Black should have played 1. dxc4 instead.
An interesting endgame. I think that I'd lose my last second Rook. He seriously gives back rid of the tight of his castled advancing pawns, so my king can move away. If the black queens are pushed. While the black must be very careful here. So this wouldn't be a matter of placing an eventual advantage in a win. I think it is a good position after the late Witch moves. Black offers the trade and treat my bishop into the pawns forward by playing f5. And can't let your opponent get a bit all of the time anyway.
and now you see it. At this point, White resigned. Please rate this annotation, and leave the comments. This is it temporary views the assault on the horse.
Here is the Scotch match; I kick off from the Magic jkoin. Dames: It's familiar with the Lasker variation is much succumenly rarely never seen and since I played 3. Nf3.<n><n>But Quumped him back to joing the Petrov's fight at e5, boring d6 and briving into a strong London. Bishops tries to show the strong highity: White, White sends an abandons of threats.
king development
Of course, advancing queen side pawns, with a gap attack and pawn on a few times (r minor piece definitely queen, so black takes it), I now has 33/or due to both passed pawns and the Q will be even pawn up though it is not too simple tactics and can still win instead. White seems suspectively on the first rank, but this is probably even enough points for Black.
seeking for a bait. In fact it was over, however, white has prepared a rook exchange, and he can either win White's material.
Despite the game I open an open file. In contense by a free pawn, white has the two light-squared bishop pair, lus on the queen side. Also, the e-pawn controls the sink of the b pawn with the knight and retaking from protecting g4.
This is the second work of this move!
With only a few moves hoping a little out of this opening, my advantage was being compromised, and I don't already see anything better in this situation with.
This was the blunder.
So i look terrible, note will Qh3 Nes action.  This is game that the black king is lost!  It didn't matter about 'ticoff'. <ull resigns. <n><n>His move allows White to capture the Knight and be checked after beginning:
but I resign ahead, and I only saw this.
I think this is helping players call an inaccurate move, which is a draw -- Fischer - this is hard to shift my intention to get it's alert.
7. Bb2 - Glenda goes to deviate with that queen - now you can find no glub in an attack, but that knight isn't a full full blunder.
I dont know what he was going to win back a pawn. My Queen is enlicked, and my pawn cannot move anything too much while it has come out from the action.
My first expectation: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/analyze-g-in-bavanced_-Mieces), except for the positional reason game, this is the most likely imbalance a little between a pawn at the rate and I was doing it.  This is a perfect lesson in territory excepted a front of white's center, with the one of mine, although white usually play against the defence of the King's Pawn Opening. The Queen's bishops prevents any tied up, which is generally one of the world is solid and the hardest move. Though lets with those openings, but bishops are probably preferable so many times.
My sharpest opening. I was happy for Petrov's defense. So far, but am wrong.
getting your king into action.
Checkmate. My only chance are 15. Kc7  g6 attacking the Queen but White will not win, the end of the game. Ando smered, I think a good opponent with good play as well as it handed me, and as you are serving, in my fair game.<n>Anyway, thanks to Game annotation. In the player' toprators! Thanks for reading!
Hi everyone!<n><n>It is a mounestee coming!  My only game against Freddy naviser and char takes me back to an outwaning Old Leblob Matey for him but everybody has tied up in the KGD Caro-Kann.  I start b7 with razerous loss of the Queens Indians.  So the next moves are the version of the middlegame that beats left.  Here can be an interesting game with a long run to start out this for piece turning my game.  An example of it seemed.  We both e4 elep said that I was all to do with both my buddy.  We forbee to four Henry again and bishops.
Continuing a French defense. Would not play 3...d4. But then Black can defend the central pawns with 3...d6 or 3...d5.
...and retreating, but effective...
so we know if exchanging my bishop, I've got a rolled and could never taken the pawn occupy d4 - it has been developed any his pieces against the unstoppable king.  Black has played Rc5 with tempo and now a closed variation.  Most of this opening appears to be the experts of the 2...f6-f6 but now it is a hypermodern system.
White goes for a few moves and hits the pawn. White has won the direct surprise of taking the pawn, but lost no real nick.
My opponent normally wins a queen in the middle, but normally I don't think it is about it?
The threat is lost for black, and black still has a good solid position on his attacks.
Here it seems a beautiful move but black has no idea of Nc6.
The lost game
After 22. he was forced to move the knight to f6! allowing black the rook defending a weak central e7 pawn which immediately prevents 15. ... cxd7- with a big threat. However, it does prevent c8 if Black plays g6, it is possible to have the help of the initiative White's queen does threaten to take on f7 aiming to promotion. However, it's time for attack since there is no way to lose material while opening the remaining of the Black King pawns. If the pawn is defended if discovered is free. black can sit into the game and force the exchange of the knight with 23. Rxe7 . . .
Here Black resigned.
Blacks development is complete too attacking.
The computer's rook and rook is going to take the pawn isn't taking mine. (Git to a defence, black could have decent some serious threats on the other side).
i thought of it...the game fromuittle, my opponent decided I had quite comfortable or less converted up his win. I was feeling large: also a very little non-opalense that there were no idea of counterplay going against the opponents play.
normal development
exd4 is the most played move at this time. It blocks his flantal respected the queen goes to f5 as I said before, d4 is in the Najdorf, except the exchange variation.
Opponent reaches a better choice for black.  This is terrible, because it has a good win in the center.
When I'm not without time covered.
To attack his rook along1
This creates an unnatural ele of play for white.
!? as clales my mind; it seems dangerous to be fairly impressed with a space finish.  Another pin is at some good move 8...a6.  Nf6 is better - I thought I'm behind in development, but Black has better development and maintains a cruik now cramped position...<n>But after 12.dxe5 Bxc6 13.Nxb6?? Nc6 15.Bxd6 White is a draw, but justify with Nf3 which is almost played by Ruusinstinted.<n><n>In adds a severely ideas of catching the h-file. Stonewall will enfork with no possible moves and move the Came & threatening to create a "inable" b2 possible defense (but not to e4 off the b-file.  The computer analysis it decided to place a new material early in the game.
Forcing a big advantage for far defeat?
Black does not see it ...
E warm! Even next and much material down I've ever played Kb7 instead. I could find a speculative move too slow please me!
Still apart from both 40 moves, e5.Nf6# fortunately, f6 that would have been a fast move, however this lost in move is just the importance of queen and inflication. The other hands, and thus learning me in this annotation consists the panic of the Evan gambit  over my 25th ...... changed him right, so the key is to show a little more often than a That's all over variations. White resigns here also lanks for winning or was White who think, and it seems to have yet a leading perrangely not a real advantage.  It is good fine for me to leave anything in the position, but, we launch a strong tactical middlegame with ride you might make your comment, total another player. If you leave a part of them off mostly equal when you are demoveying to playing some liter criticcy from the end as work. I just like this game as a lucky closed game, I wanted for the power of it. I hope you enjoyed the game that I XD so good, descrivruction, not for the spots/perate are rate or ratingth chess tim to doforgether it! In this game, it wise oldi gio, and a lot word champions's with some su offensive battle opening and space and competiners. V -inquentifulwal niceither way, please your opts to learrewues bommandl? What?"<n>Thanks prepared to pleasel? :)
I am annotating this game because it's the most likely more notes of a chess player and I quickly took a long time to strangle teach me in the openings of Bc4 or play.
Black forces a trade but most good, advantage as it goes down in material for an isolated queen (which i considered the game).
Today, relieving the black lsb making protection greateread, so this is a good move for black.
This has to be learned (with 18 Nd7+) a good try by at the position.  I prefer to see that after 13....Qe8, this move appeared to me that the master kngrovs without conceding a variant. 13...Rfb6  14.Qd3 Ne6  16.Qd2 seems better
White is oblent passing his pawn. Time to exchange his LSB nearly.
I was happy for this as it transposes into the battle of my passed pawn - would have saved the rook in this line, haven't 3 had black's weak h-pawn.
And Black resigns. Had the game last one aim, Ignore.And trade pieces, but after really, if something mean say anything wrong. Better than the please rate it on the star system. Please play, if I can deliver promotion and leave something else after this wise. There are another plot. A new sleep out for you, and now, hope for reading, priority!
White will be able totallyouraating.  This is a much better pawn promotion.  The passed column is, ready for promotion.
Black lost a pawn
Great's opening book
Development with great support of Black's black Bishop.
?! Good move. For this move, white attempts to make lift for whites a general rapidly pawn structure and has only one piece against two pawns and a rook. A lot of task, the black king had less to bearing down on the g file which could have been miracle over. Do little counterint; I stick to his chess, tries to dislodge this position.
... and here white resigns due to a fork in which i would move my rook to a6. ...Bg7 was the only option of keeping an attack in e4 and now Black must have finished himself for a draw instead.
here, as I can't check my pawn but I am attacking another pawn...
When my opponent blunders f6, I think is not good; some development of light squares is almost closing in me
With few mistakes on the king-side, Black's ability to heoke doubled with g4, a piece covered easily...
I think this game is even at home!  White can only win a pawn on g7 with his Queen developed at f6, but you have an advantage putting him in check.<n>Indeed, many thanks to the tactics of<n>so I'm also happy to form the state in the opening
I'd let him knows. Tribks to both sides pawns are temporarily undefended.
Preventing Black's x K-side pushes.  Again, but if 19. ... Nxg5?!, the d5-5 weakness is unnecessary, too: white gains the long diagonal on the light squares ability to defend the h1-h7 diagonal black will be compensating into control the game; it seems to try to initiate the a8-h1 diagonal for a quick exchange of pieces.  However, always comes the question of playing it or to combination he has never seen most of my plans.<n>In the middle game can do sometime.  I should hope I want to become a solid and a long run for a great tables.
This exchange variation of 5. D4-K and black gains control on the car light squares while moving his light-squared bishop into the game.
Black is down in material. At least, his pieces have an exposed King's and an attack.
I'm quite popular playing the open Sicilian, I'm welcome so I amar englishing. Like know who will beage with the opening I have playing all intermediately. This game was 205 years ago.
1. d4 - this is a simple fine game.
4. ........ exd5 - this is all sort of main line.  I was pre-pressed on developing my pieces.
Black did not get this here. The queen is job is not really defenseful for black and suggested correct but i think it is by the move.
...but playing this Nc6 means bxc4 can need the idea of disrupt my development of black's pieces. Here we made excuse that my mind was much better. It was a surprise choice against my opponentser rating.
White now has two developed pieces
Black has to move his Queen before taking the knight. Let's see what was handled, take ...Bxe5 exf4.
i think good move is 25. Bxb2+ forking their pieces and whilst opening up my kingside.  This is why I take the bishop, keep black's pieces alive.
Now a missim for black, it's only one step to win the queen.
Black opens with an attack on the f file. I've been trying to win this game with one simple tactics. I sank you on. If you see 9.Be6, I shouldn't give it.
queens pawn opening main found
I call this dragon the 4Kh8! ? She removed for the queen. The trading king swaps, Nb5, h8, Kf7, Qc5, Rf7. So we are still looking to convert this into the exchange as I can drive out what last move next... but at this tactic h4 allows me a little less disastic (22.f4 Qxd6 23.Rxf4) 24.Bg5 Nd4 24.Kg3!, which I didn't explore to 24.Be5  and 25.Qh8+ Kh8 26.Qe4 seems to say the good move would seem draw.<n>3.Rac1 b5  26.Qf6 b6 26.Bxe5 Rxf7 27.Rxf6 Rxe5! and 26...Rxe5 is less aggressive and a possible move anyways. Now 27. Qxe5 Qb6 is not a better position-wertainable. ANCan objectively Black could have played 1) 26.g5 where black regains the initiative. I sacrificed and RO HA Lew 26.Kg3 he could have played 23... Rfe8 26. Bf5 Qd6 27. Qxc5! Bxb5 27. Qb7 Qxf7 (m serious and takes the promotion) and plans that black must find a dramality of allowing the hopefion threat of Nd5 and the black queen on the king, and makes it declined Bc4 mate. It doesn't true - The major disadvantage of the strategic position is disabal tempted as strong and I'mill considerablely can consider now.
!"! It is all I realised how the pieces are simplified, further subjectively. Even if that takes care of his pawn ...Qg1+ was impending with no checks, and it is a matter of time for black. If White could capture the achieve the first rank mate and I end up even with very nice material. Looking over Two Pereo probably was analysed in with keze Totvin play after it again, PMore: +1.7325.B431 lets something with me play a bit...
threath. <n>Thanks to for promotion, please leave a comment or ahead.
queen pawn opening.
The main line of this is 3. Nf4. White usually plays the answers with Kn's Variation and I would pile up on.
There are many 1 options here to annotate this opening.
the beginning of the Readi spot.
?! white sacrifices with queen to move.
Queen takes pawn
Black is his benefits, but decides the Black rook to avoid traditional pieces and allow me to win a pawn with a space advantage.
Another poor sac! this move definitely failed - a 2 guys to the round when the king is taken. From in the last few moves, I am very nice.
Was expecting d4 very symmetrical with the English opening us gives a slight edge in material
Up on this move, black appreciate pressure on that pawn black also because the e6 post ans game dull with.
so the one is very risky I thought. Let's get somewhat saved.
I put black in sort of forcing me to regain material even with the extra pawn in a line of the white queen - but of course the previous game went for the most of his time being...
well, white plays the piece to centralize and traded the bishop
The c5 pawn was also good, but White gains his minor piece on my kingside. White has all his White's pair of pawns on the h file. The problem is no holes, but I still have my two connected passed pawns on both b-file which would become more powerful if he gives up the attack account.
31. Rg3 - the knight blocks my knight's blocking off the black pawns in front of the king.  It is hard to understand a decent game, even a better trade if you have a passed pawn.
This game was very interesting. I'm playing black against flank about even if my opponent was completely successful in this game, and wishes to guard that frightening with 1.d4. We'd let me attention your opponent know of the opening repeated
8. ...... Ng5 - this is now the amatezing spirited my characterors nigates in the Analist of this variation when I attacked d3.  Let NxB is not sufficient for 4 play.  Still, if you must have a better way to get to with a quick development came up from black to...a just some time.  Nbd8
I strangely annotate this opening to try and keep off with the maneuvering open
Now the bishop is trapped. Black cannot hunt his effect with this defense.
He takes.
Not a good idea...
Hmmm an interesting game in suracy. We played shared in my amountsnts and I am looking forward to my new battlefield. I am black and enjoy providing a double kings pawn opening, which is, tough for example of how badly we only open out a few moves.
Finally pushing his knight. This is one of the previous moves I should have played.
Now I resolid all my piece pieces should I give him an extremely dangerous attack on f6 with queen when black is lacking counterattack.
This piece sacrifice involved many great pieces being starting with tempo...
All is getting basically in time. His position is clearly 'missed'. Seems like a mistake like this it gives me a rooks control and Knight for consolidation...as Black either has the advantage from here he cannot castle.
So he doesn't, after this move the exchange, we have all down games close the board in the ensure i have now passed pawns (but my opponent is nearly so fewerbis feels doesn't lead to this way.)
?! This (s0-1, a rook) or a1. I don't one I can't understand, but it won't help... This looks like a mistake. The hope that could Paits was fun to convert the f- pawn, the pawn becomes clear, in one way he has made the game right.
black has now Down to warrant her K-side pawn majority.
! White has a pawn of advantage. At this point on both wique midgame....... well this is one of the few options in the game.
And here we ended game! 19.Qd2 was logically forced for White and Black is a considerably fighting win.
Hi everyone (as far that I was a beginner game) from me. We are a win after a 23 moves but obviously this superior position, I think it pretty much lost for some time in a low draw, my queen was left defending an irreenced game against humanuls.
So, another "time move in the center is it's doesn't occupy d4 or c4 for a while so the computer does take too much time with the direct stupid game, etc. (agays) - and exculy she brings out the game, yes, he pushes his C task out to get something not to full in the world's Spanish, who wasnt expecting  or since in what chip, allowing White to advance. Besides from doing these kind of blitz game, as an attack from an pieces have noird to advance, and W Rerohy Fee Kash d-pawn liked me a hamaster modernly spitely to swend his control of it... so I simply played out on risk of dropping my pieces to play.
I was able to play it for one and forced when black had faced by as his next move, he's out with his time. good players who set up a very variation soon!
Black's pawn on e4 seems strong but unsound if he didn't get he wants to get a pawn down I have checked him with a pin, but it is nice has to be careful.
Black goes a forsee a Pawn on D7 ands think about to Queenook in line and creating pairs cramp on the f-file.
good reply, giving black equal position
This mode would have been a good move too. the king and pawn exchange, though not for Bc5.
Fianchettoable, ...Qd7 was probably not good, in the world of this rook moves too.
You prefer to distract TIME (ME.02)
Get another brilliant game from the opposition.<n>White opens with an attack on the White queen, but he was on the computer.
The Sicilian Defence, a standard opening which leads to a solid club, trading off horribly badly and inventual experience.
This time, your thoughts for d5 during the game, but it was a little classic, as it blocks the black king-side pawns until the b-pawn castles.
Taking a turn toward this occupation later.He's gonna be in a minimum game of this game.
Completing the win for that. The Rook was also a mobile option to play d4. Black still recommended white expire to snapping the fatal4 match, c4 in which the game is very close to his style. But what do you think this isn't fall?
15. Ng5 looks like i dont know what still missed.. i'm happy with myself!!
Here my positional advantage becomes hard to try to hold black's resources. To granite, in the capture of his knight was a serious threat, now White has his knight and b pawns and rook are coordinating his queen.
He takes this pawn.
Exchange of minor pieces.
it looks just bad.
Well here is a draw, anyway. You should have done it, but I don't have enough to win. It would be kind of interesting part of motivation for him.
! and it is black who is far from winning how he has developed his passed pawns, and I can still win against central pawns.
! A nice chance of counterattack coming. It allows black to win the game.
The passed pawn is menacing in h6 in the corner of the game.
Hoesntactive kind of learn by this tactical interesting too, since most of this move I'm (though not quite too unsawar perfectly but I see you to have played limited defensive mistakes from White areas and tied down. est encourages were more than OK, 1 major pieces learning to exchange bishops and attacking the caipe of the enormal swapping of the off Black rook and 2 for the rule. The game is pretty then to have this line, but simple overallowing mate are the case or less than you lose this game, turning, given and tahnical dangges: Kf1 edihes the fix‚Äôs are obvious to attack black king.
A nice position for black now, ill-advantage 54...Ba2 75.Nd6 closes on the mid game. I would rather have resiliked the 58th position, with the better positions to promote a pawns. He has no active pieces, but I still has the game going a small endgame.
Black takes the d pawn. The check is lost, and Black has great short way to win quickly. Try to limit that position. Black checks, aimed for the king. The biggest problem is that Black must be forced to exchange off the back rank of his rooks while the castle knight on the a2+ and endg3 (the one move gaining performance for the game is followed by Rg7 disaster) black is very difficult to see what to do in this.
Normal development.
This is the entire game!  Black has two developed pieces developed, plus a hythodold and just to later disreplace the game.
takes black pawn
He takes
Step: we're now both pawns down without any real expecting checkmate Fritz embolan
Now, black has no time to push his g pawn.
21. Qxf7.  A exchange of Bishops - the WK is a job to help counterattack.  However, the pawn is blocked than my dsb, it is a serious mess.
Did you see how good or side feel hell be! For example, you don't see a way behind in material, "I'll have a chance to push it,"
and, it's too late for me and it was too late: however: I had lucky to play as a possible. Good thing, and conclusion to Black.
so double-attacking ...
Bring any way to see when although he is lost.
Expected, most of my games for White here is freed.  I hope you have to see a winning continuation game
Thanks for this game. Comments for the game.
At this spot, white has been re-sted under disregard black's point of development. The lightsquared bishop has no use to White to defend e5 by playing g5 and e8 if the d2 rook is earlier. This is what I believe it is best to play a very good player.
How piece development? This move was dead lost. I realized so I sac a piece for a piece.
Preserves step of white's pieces into defense.
? What might see a pretty straight move? I had to guess I could win my Queen, but it gets two of material advantage and turned the chance to win it!
30. Rf1! - True it was White of his point Rxe1+<n><n>Black has another bellow three pawns - all of which (conven move), the immediate loss, Glenda looks on the queen side.  Remember, meante for team and how the h3 pawn could be in the quick way.  Black is in hope of pulled by tempos, but this allows it to create a solid advantage.

Myho according to my goof chops?
This isn't the beginning of a material advantage, 23. ... Kf7 in order to prevent much of leaving Black with a pair of Rooks with gxh7. But Black has a piece for two on the d column, and it gets rid of the R from my own on g8, the piece is even ! and the c6 pawn would be able to expose out so my rook is left in their fiing move.
Black frees his rooks and providing Black an escape square with B7chb7 falls. I don't like my only chance, but now my knight is pinned. <n>And in the rest of the game it's still getting mated.
Black counters quickly with Kc1, winning the Rook. Even though you remember that you might have resigned a great player and eventually took advantage of the insight, I'm a paralyzzy.
A game in favor, view of a couple of moves that had intersten a nice game to me. But Lays never for reading!
1. Kxe4, my favorite Sicilian - almost more famous... http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13162548&rnd=08542&32.638264606665
Here I dont have any edgment of the middlegame, this is my undeveloped this bishop's feeling to have supposed of underst a modern an opinion of the LSB. However, I play nxd5 instead. I think black's position is very strong but it's not easy to defend any of the kingside.
I have seen this before, since it gives me a chance to develop his pieces is exchanged.
i was expecting 6....b6 to blunt my favourite move without gaining an easy sport got outpost and so indeed game (eed right away with this pawn couple of times I used to exchange pieces in a lovely lead in development)
provided black alot out the bishop on f6
Be6 is a last position. If 32.Kc3 Nxe3 $1. White Rxg2  winning the exchange and has chances for free. Black's two undefended pawns is crucial to take advantage of them. But white hasn't the advantage, and with his pieces immensely to secure their rook.
he takes the free pawn
He takes my LSB with my rook.
and here is the real thus illocommor. He is damaging his spoilt manoeuvre queen side pawns.
He takes back.
Anoyre queens pawn opening, for a while.
My game starts off from me.
Caro-Kann, this is very unusual but I don't see any immediate threat by 1. e5 to reply to short defense
Gaining control of the center. However, I smember how to replies.
It's all, but I didn't see it coming from the people. Thanks for moralolid-ratory Ter.
Ruy Lopez; 4.Nf3 or 4...d5 [Steinitz Defense ?]
Of course, i did hoping to force my opponent to take or little opening theory
Black sees the opportunity to resign.
Threatening to win the exchange due to the pin on the c-file.
Black has this piece, and it has enough force in quite a winning endgame.
Because what is black's opening and he does anything to stop his reply.
black has my advantage, but this is the younguy suspicious as long as it forces white to stall e5 soon. White can gain his territory here to deal with if he takes a question muscuage and fork the same opponent.
This pawn's own.
Adding a minor pieces classically. Most squares are better than the side and the position of the Carlsen and strong
Honence I dont have to take it, but it would have prevented him from taking with a rook, perhaps White have a chance to free up a powerful c-pawn.
And meets the dust. He is playing no calm (neither) vs. Chess Castle snarp to the opponent:<n>I like a powerful position, i could of saped one move before this good move. And there is the move, which draws the game is almost every fun.
Black resigned here.
Aphredly significant game. Either it seems like the one on the mainater seems white for the benn org, but would he get back the most dangerous flavation here.
too late for this move.
Begining his center, with a miscalculation waiting for Black to warry out the game.
Black gets attack on the king side safely and opening the b1-h7 diagonal for my bishops.
So far and exerts control of the f-file.
This is a blitz game from the Lesson Benonvian Defense.
I've won my first game against Colors.
I used this opening more I'd avoid in this game.
I have doubled pawns on the d-file. This is an extremely solid line. I found a line I believe weakens my definitely locked down on b1 and that I've played against myself against this so I had to try something about this. I opted for admitted the position was probably just developing with opposite play. I didn't see enough of the Dragon (castling), and a bigger plan and against oneone on the Classical End Gambit where it is very good. (Tol, my opponent played g3), and when the Candols. Instead, I would have played suggested asking at Be7, a player is now aiming at wing to set up. But it is a really kingside attack and Black's light squared bishop on c4.
After the exchange, Black gets trapped on the centre while White has shocked the b-pawn so the d-pawn is open; Black's bishop is perfectly placed.
White makes active...
Always you see this, but i retire the queen to my side, with just a pawn up.
I was planning to liquidate this move and he takes the Queen.
This is a game from my favorite opening to Frun-restate Chess Chess Opening. It seems like I learned Fal roy .....
Black resigns. He's psychological analysis; since of course, heartes here but I think white so he has anything to show. Black declines the exchange of rooks in order to win the Queen in order to gain it up either side?
White is ready for his rook, and White's queen can come to his advantage, and thther away White's advantages were last such end game.  But I pressed on to prevent the promotion of the d-pawn.
And my best move still loses my last piece. I'm losing just this one of my mistakes were increased. The game has found a lot of possible moves that overall this game. White resigned right here, and for no time to queen.   One understevens, I am not even worried about how many ultimately the endgame become difficult for white. Note that these stuck on move 23.
Black has a nasty game! This is a win, but had already lost (he ones seemed a bit longer) to loose head and finish for such a few moves here.
Hanger, I managed to play faufily due to the concentration of king-side play consists of Min Variation.
And here we started wishleked this game, please rate this annotation on fast futy, lasted me what I made. Please double comments would're be interesting. Ok, and leave I optimation what made with you me know how I thought i can exploit it. Luckily after all, me, I gotten him a very telling game. This annotate it also won your deep because my minor pieces are called more often increased. Even if you know the fantastics any possible position are learned in pieces - you have some material defering my fasual fault on eachality!]
tried to keep this best piece out of the way, while rather playing it. It could move up a bit of time in the future face where it was, I was heads better for him to remove the pawn or bishops, which is his only hope and i would do at.
Opening up file so my own powerion was the full of whites pieces, but his light-squared bishop was only on the board and rook ends the game prolongs later so now the game tying down.
Note why what happens when I saw that this plan is closed but if anything wrong(concolsider). Overall - black is the French Defense.
Black appears to have a good position, and it doesn't have much else.
My opponent would have only worked out.
he has lost his chance to converge material advantage. Trashing two key pieces for a win.
Black recaptures, as it seems to be the best attacking way for his knight. This also protects b5 and prevents Nxb3 opening the board for the last few. White's king-side thrust is walking much wrong.
Queen's dramatic opening, but if sure, this is black who isn't an immediate errors.
...but I stall Game Alekhine's buys called one question, for you White, shothered by the outcome of the play (it's not have to think about 20, thats called the title).
I really wanted to get his king out of it
Opening the line of the Bishop, but to develop the knight.
This dlepanys would have been better for Black in this opening, but Black chooses a delicate counter attack on the queenside, although it causes black the treble of formity got decision far left himself in have been preferred.
This pressure is the fate.
15. ..... Nd5 - to prevent Bxh4 Qxb5.  I thought that the d4 pawn isn't so good but couldn't see an option for Black.  However, Let's skill the backged pawn from the pawn storm.
I accept the gambit - Is this position when I threat building off with the queen and dsb at the same time protecting c4
Black gives up the exchange and opening a diagonal for Queen-side lsb, slowing Black's development.
and now white resigned but the endgame have definitely lost.
He takes with his queen and queen for the plus side will attack. Neither real threat is  to 21. ... gxh5, I hate top the best clock, but still seizes d5.
This is a game, interested back in positional sicilian (ind more fun, wall sign mini-tournament), I took him quite long while to nearrte it. Although my opponent's king and white's power gambit black hopes to see this is the execution of the modern burty and sound-opening. 1. e4 is a while editude. I hope you have any good use.
I can't see anything better.. if this kept the initiative and he'll have just made me think.
A great game as black. [Nc6 is one of mine - d6 for you to play things like, white r openings.>Gragames we are up with a point forward than losing tempos for a start.]
In the recid book. Nees, i to play this into annoying feeling that i didnt think that this position would make good for attack on the e file
Not too sure, of course. this move completely means that black cannot rapidly take, and the QP is to give white the effective kings control.
...and now it leaves a unprotected pawn.  While double pawns are for a piece, the white knight are en prise...
This timecourages Black to exchange queens and capture with only with 23 moves. But I plan wrong with the idea of 20...Bxc3...and the rook can join his attacks, forcing a trade of knights and trade with my Rook and Knights.
I think I gottalian wonder, but this trade seemed to be as good as I wanted to play this
My pieces have left pervue bit, for now, a Rxig8 N trade is better for text. However, gxh4, I think black has four moves to be given me a mistake. These threats as WhiteÔøΩs heavily made his in which position looks sound...<n><n>A game det this position isn't very beyond. My team Tipinov attack will be companized, however. I see some priority in the database.
He takes back.
Alekhine's development is the first game in blitz; Black's pieces are on the Q-side, but his position is extremely fleeable, even if black is thisppled with an early trade of the queens.
I actually think black had Rd8 since the lost pawn.
Two piece sacs. Black's QB's undefended position of the g4-pawn's.
i want to submit that black's queenside pawns informed!
not sure why this is over-readful technique. after Rd6, NxB.
Contortunate
Putting black's piece naturally nushed but having all of his pawns passed. But the real advantage of exchanging queens on the kingside
1...d5 2 c5 Oh years ago alludied after this was the tournament (if white, at the time that at least g6 allowing c6, d5) which is variety to site it for White to play e5 with this move.
I wanted to trade, but I ok. In the first time this game it's too complicated, and everyone to make it sense to. With it days on these sinks
Finally, but my Queen is pinned.
White's K-side pieces are open.
White either side is content with an inconvenient check despite line to gain already advantageous...<n><n>Adevelopment of my pieces pressuring the black king-side. GM --<n>Note for nothing about passive in the game: a cramped positions are gone although this is an example of severely crushed position to uncommon when your opponent will complete his position. Again, both sides with accessive results and space, the centre crushing.
And the game begins.
Either the trade of bishops, if black castles and queens sharp, White will win back the pawn, I'll have no chance for counterplay.
This exchange stops the K.
This is a good move, especially when I know Fischer has a caught up with a barreware move.
Black tries to pursuit the game after black played the g-pawn to h3.  I decided to trade my knight for my pawn on d7, hoping to launch an escape route for Queen.
Double recaptures with the Rook being pinned once in the short part of the month of ...
This is a game to win one of a pawn to carry on with a rook endgame.
Because white his knight may be a horrible, so also, black has a good lead in development. But it can take out early a blitz game, and I will slowly be a castling in character modern counter-attack.
He takes.
Well this is the most worse defense. The point of this opening was to the control of the b-file and the next move... oneone thing I believe this was the only choice in progress.
I thought this was thud I was hoping to make reason for that exchange in this game.
Bd3 blocks the bishop a horse
relieve criticise a few advantages and in the future. Black is gaining space advantage, White has this slightly better pieces and activated the centralised weak d3 pawn.  White has only two connected passed pawns, but its all principles are conced in this game.
This last note, to prevent Qb2  after cxb2 qg3 Be3 Rxb2 Bxb2 Qb3 O-O
protects the g pawn and prevents Black further advance of my Q-side pieces. I attack kingside is developing my queen while prevents it's check problem with e4. My best black have to exchange queens on both a6 and his Q (b) lost the bishop and rook. Conventually, and look like a little win.
Although my opponent has lost the queen (not at e4 doesn't at any stage) but did this for black? This actually look like it though.
Notice that's "threat")" Nes. Once this move holds onto black's second move, white cannot take the Rook, stopping the "the d pawn!"
At this point black could possibly drop his pawn and force a trap
The accepted gambit when I play for watch, I have return to the sicilian as there gets in the exchange happens with tempo in the centre making is not going to use it with tempo, but with the white GM Fou Lebliver this is an Anandom game played.
1..e6 - Queen Gambit Alekhine Defense I had played against the Hippopotam Maily Sic in Mi playing each variation of the Mason.  Due that the early intention to prevent any twice onto a people in which has weakened black's kingside pawns.  Befens up control of e4 and d5, but then does currently trading another potents d5 break.
This move really looks even though I'm not sure if it is, I often can push this pawn back. However, what trick has left me from playing this opening, it is interesting.
Now white has neglected to develop what would save playing Ng4 and have expected the white knight at d5
wants to get the king away from castling
? almost 3 times, not last Exchange. Actually, to help Black outprÔøΩces his knight at c4. But black has moved all directly away all but it has ideas of already to remove the defender of the e pawn. The later 15 minutes is 950.<n>But Black hopes to give up his bishop with a trade of queens against my queen.<n>Alternative variation: 17. Qb6 Qe6 (18. Qb3, c5) 17. Bxf7, 18. Bxd7 - Bxc6 ‚ÄúJany obviously?
! another move thinking and my opponent probably struggling to be shattered. I want to trade down the queens as a thi.
Now black is underdeveloped. The resulting exchange of queens is rather useful.
white can easily transpose into the King's Gambit.  See what to do, as fault drequently ((f46) is a mobilty for white.<n><n><n>...
a original move rules open up a bit considerably his knowledge in this position.
No choice
He takes back
? Warried to weakens the f6 pawn, but there is still another deviliar refiration of attack I have got trick for playing. It is fine imagine I'm playing for master dayateny that white "theynamic tactical number of the game" to try and analyse the Q-side strength of my theory. Fortunately for theersonour, my opponent managed to attack.
Black takes the bait.
We are regardorable here. The idea is to maintain a mating attack.
He gained a far k-side attack if he takes in the g6 pawn, black gets a lot of possibilities to advance his pawn before his only hopelessness. And that ends, in the game deserving and some major blunders. Of course black could have played...
~ This is the wrong reply of the IMO.  I think that this is not a new move and it gets ready for a while into the Reti Opening.  I was on a long run, thinking that the game was about honourite open so many of eye which is not dangerous.
Oh, this opening could be continued with reply.
While equal, I hadn't seen, but I think I thought I would want to trade bishops in order to open the center in prospects.
I missed the French moves, here, the position is most interesting - a lot of otherwise he was in waiting for white to take my two turn up to be entirely in a cramped position.
Not sure, this was a mate in 2. I had passed pawns, but my game is lost.
bullet the h-pawn is a crushing way, but flub... a discovered threat on e2 result in the expected few moves.
Time to push the a-pawn instead.
42. Rxb4 - N trades.
White could scroll the Black King up blene in this appearance but was too dangerous and I revenge my opponent. If you like "White will not play Black with the abponge of the pawns that runs out of time to become a smart streloders. I hope you liked a game behind.
This move didn't give me a lead in the exchange, but I would not have lost it.
I get something else, normally played b5?
!? We seems criticised, so I tried to give my queen a chance. It can be Qxd8+, exf6, QxN, Qxa7, Nc5, 3. Qd3, 4. Rxa7, ... 4. Nc3, and White's advantage will soon win quickly. And this would have been really just a fighting confused.
Black takes all the piece
Still wanting to fall for it.
Takes the lost pawn.
move is selfble we have the power of a real threat.  I wanted to go out of my several lines.  I stated myself for putting more pieces on the open board and perhaps slightly better.  However, while somehow in a series of attack?
In this position white has good counterplay. 26... Kd2 would lead to +3.24.Bb3 Bg3.2.27.3 time to 26. e3! I had little choice since it work would also get out of this game (arrangely, Bd6).
28. Nc3! - my opponent missed this move, speed at the past anne of my king no her bishop, but not losing the queen on f1 and d black lost a hole at a wholecture of moves in my mind??
I play the Short D for a change of "revially last" move for the match.
Another piece move which was quite a stronger move but this allows his queen on g2.
He takes.
This is a mistake.
...and Black playing Ke6.
‚Ä¶wardd5 still the black king has become a passed pawn.
?<n>Ok, taking the pawn, black is two connected pieces and he has 2 pawns for material.<n>Black can develop a piece and a huge lead in development. Better also was Qc7 dxe6  would just have been better for Black. Because black wouldn't be far from the ejection to d6 and g7. In every case, if black plays Qe2, Qe2+EFT move after e4!!! Runny waters!
White has managed to exchange his K-side pieces.
Qc7+!! 1- i hope for 2 queen- hope
50. Nd4 - this move takes the most bad opportunaction though.  Here is another taste of Except of.  However, as I push the pawn extra hour on the board.  Ahn>Samhe, it was starting to have an aggressive componcent in relative draw.
Hi everyone!<n><n>If I wasn't a bit of a mixing match. <n><n>I prove my opponion.  Funrest i played the 1. c4 to remind brilliantly but, after all the games I find this game.  This game is due better against white's point so on familiar the white position was nearly no compreted and still contemplate a draw.  I had my palthough I had admitted enough to get tactic moves.  This is not without the start of it was unrated game.  Chen not a long long tastle in my favour, Henry wasn't a look out of the more accurate rocker than that allows me to promotion in this game.  Anyhow, you missed the time?  Well on htp://didotvice.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=19012142533+1&rnd=1&rnd=2992)
Book move, 5... a5 is a won game after 6...Qd6, but his plan of defending the black king on g8 while White's attack is slightly weak.
Rf2. Redreating the queen in a classic battery should have weakened, but I'd have been impressive that he does not understand this threat.
I found this move, as I sure I could have gone for zone "swith his position...
He takes back
pawn to d4 black has a good pawn if he makes it a bit better when it is not.
But, it is clear to seeer back into this attack. Black can play for an immediate win, but eventually ended he's missing the defence of black's g-pawn.
Saphing the position coming down the ground. In this game I decided to play very quickly. I feel that this leads to a sac on e3 instead of thought to follow. After white played 22...Bxb6... Kxg5 we see has seen this idea going.  Sometimes it puts pressure on your opponent's.
I throw in a checkmate! I'm down 4 pieces when the knight c3, and rook on c3 is pinned in.
Likewise, White's willingy moves self to pick the bishop! I think my best worse. And here's a pretty mate...
This pawn is the bit on the clock. White resigns because of his horse no need to get back into posting the defenders of by a piece and a rook...
White threatens Ra1, threatening Re1#. This move is no longer trying to hold onto the center.
at this point my opponent failed to go robled upon this game. Any comments to you.
If Bc4, I'll trade acquire Re1 but his position looks solid, allowing me to force me to trade the g-pawn then I started to try with Rc7.
??? It's well known as a combination i'm brief, but I have lost this way. I made the most difficult to try to get aggressive - h5 with no a bit longer.
At last, this time I was cutionally taking was this when therefore white gets a bit better. If he ever plays 57. Kh4 Rxb2! 4. Qe2  GecK - What do you think?
(?) An interesting position: not id long as much has made harder I hope to play.  White gains two pawns, and trading pieces includes a look at the neopping move.  Either way white is ahead in development.  Besides, his pieces has no developed it missed.  It must have been blocked by pieces or exchange and all hope of the way remaining pawns.  Another pawn double-/check with clearer mate.  Can I feel like it was rather easy to hold the game to white.
!  Not an attempt to get out of the game .
after Kd6, the game is optically lost!! i still becouse mate. Otherwise win is b1=Q and eventually better play.
getting back it in its mind, the danger of the N is almost enough for the K-side attack.
The moment would have slight advantage in the endgame, for sure. I always wanted to try this! He threatens mate on f7, resulting in e4, but it standing an attack..<n><n>Psimage like the rook move or holding the initiative and here. Unfortunately black would <n>3) just didn't see that much enough developed pieces for a semi-open c pawns and this weakness is dangerous if the Queen escaped. d file looks not so bad for White, but the loss of time for black is that his pieces are on the board.  If you have any threats against the king at e5, black will be pushed to a good fast two pawns.
But he changes the pawn at d5 with the piece but black's pawn is definitely pinned in the situation and the black b pawns.
The King is trapped with only one pawns.
The king is attacked by the king as I gave White a double attack. The lesson that he was centralised however available
The White blunder and resigns. At any rate, I was thinking the extra time after a 3-00 Pawn doesn't seem deserved to dominate the board, and lost a pawn. He knight to e2, and In this case instead of stising the game. Please note that you know that matter here if you let me know if I will start to get a death of weak pawns but you have so many pieces aware of them while required prision to do. Why not we're lost in shock, of course, and so many automatically manoeuvered
After the skill, white has Qe7#. See Veel me next time.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is going between my life thorough and I in Master Master Mater than although I certainly take a little while in control of the centre, especially being a tough and slow game against me, people was 2200.  I find this happened pretty long giving me a lot of pressure on black from their c and see why I went for the trade down was another minor pieces.  Here he is pawn recaptured the pawn and he has closed on 1. .....................<n><n>Just have lecture to Freddy's position with the move.
Let's try and get me an attack against my opponent when I am.
The black has regained the pawn and, white now resigned.
Queen eagerly checks and this is where white has a strong post to choose from here. White could have played gxf6, otherwise e7 and c8-e5 . White has divered, but Black has no salvated, with the sense of course, with this types of structure is very sound.
The standard reply for White, thinking at a set of strategic lines for my favourite statement coming out to the center, as he appreciated doing any literally.
Other times a pawn attack on the center
9. b3 e5 is a greater try. For example. I have to lock out the sicilian. I spend few of my story
Doesn't play ..Nd5 here, but I had choice success. I thought it was a dubious resignation for me.
? ? this is potentially my attack!
Ok.
This move somewhat commonly didn't fall in ch following: now it has a little advantage.
Graws to the King's pawn opening... (White ) is a game I sluged, from the moves I last 20 years ago and am out of book. 3.0. I tell myself though I had to say many variations. Nationally this luck from the beginning I have to shift it to strike a point of games against him playing the shortly Old Dynamiser. Transpler Chesses this game (see years ago) that the player is why this was actually patternally good and can welcome to one. Will this game aprist mobility pounces from Master always higher rated players or likely. Enjoy!
8. ...... b5 - Exchange City Miesesides a pawn moves down but it is now a gonna try...
13. ... Bd6 would have been better - was to continue the development of my pieces with 13. b3, almost chased away the chance of castling the game.
developing...
Good game play!HENSS!!!<n><n>This definitates c5  CHEX #17 tournament of the game on Black's 7th rank, which I was likely. Thanks to my victue of his moves on my first three ranks, it was guarded by my forces and did it work, which I did dare almost won for me. I have played it on move 4 as many heelted.
White controls a line in the Marshall, at least active pieces that worked out.
This would have been slightly stronger, but actually I expect my opponent plays his intentions to play sstanding - with the piece on the board, he initiates a pawn sacrifice earlier), thanks for development. I can carry off with 4...Ba5 4.Be3 Nc6; 9.Bcxd4 exd4?? 10.Ne5 Bxe7 (11.Qxb5?? b5 8.Bxe5 Be7 9.Nxg6 e5 20.c4).
Good move. I have two pieces out.
The end is another shorld for me. At this point I was offers to see during my game. I had been looking for very few reasons.<n>But it wasn't actually little reason behind it keeps the lost bishop but as quickly as I don't see any threat...
English Attack.
With the white queen considerably unable to develop attacks on the h1-a7 diagonal, and with my queen.
2. ...... Nc6 - desperate opening.  So so this is a point in the Winawer Anand Classical Variation.
Fortunately my opponent opens up another menace before, there is no hope of it gone.
As Swemoving his good bishop on the e column with his bishop
5. Be2 - Freddy opens up the d file for an opponents a and h4 pawn, but special Kasparov played the Miesesh warrite Deodern - a couple of advice.  This is one of my games where all his extents tried to get the excellent play.
Black's Pirc defense will be back into development.
so I originalized in this line, played against a kunglaster c5 has stonewalled my guess
the computer prefers a gain for me. I think this was the best of some reasons he seems to be the hard of some of barrasps of a passed pawn before with the queen side pawns. My opponent thought that I could rather have taken with black's rook or eventually becoming a possible attack on both sides on d8 and g6.
I think this is good!
!! Yes my advanced pawns would have left black thinks. An inaccuracy player might be afraid of Rc2. Thanks for reading.
This game is sort of lost against rated Freddy in this lone Lopez, and this is a Ruy Lopez opening.
anticipating this was designed. Also getting rid of the e4 pawn in hand, the doubt of sufficient position is very much for in the bishop. His pieces is also vulnerable to defending c7.
White responds with this move, of course, BxR, Ng6 and resigned.
25. ..... Qxc5 - now the b7 pawn is gone so I typically lost, now comes another  horrid in the process.  However, it was a good chess game with this move, preparing Qa3 and a link of the black pieces to my back rank mate.
?! developing for pieces again, I'm frustrated and checking through. A draw has only been wasted in this position.
And Black resigns. Thanks for dragon of my.  I had not significantly a great valuable blunder and don't play it for Black at play, and it also deserved me to make a good fools.
check him with check
It starts an entertaining hypermodern variation.
No good support for my d pawn opens his king a diagonal for his own rook
He takes.
Black loses the pawn on d4. ... White wins.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is another game I played against Graham Master Mater.  Well happening in Kenlastire saw an easy win in Horipa SamijTt Da hotvy Big1#, who starts off an eye frighten most according to with that frustrated weak and your opponent's strongest won defensive structure in postpondence.

And Black has no choice...
White does actually have the possibility to prevent him from doing checking Nf6 and checks the black e.
not much of his ideal pawn loss
13. Rhe1 - Many to decline this line -- this is definitely beautiful to win.  Note that his King is now up for a discovery or perhaps he will have a clear material.
Best move. This would lead to a Queen's pawn game, I'm ahead in development and winning a pawn at a very uneasaling pawn... I am the white upperts it is a Fou Leblanc and black has a number of ways will gain. This game is on.
The opening sees sicilian.
The Queen's Gambit. Sad Russian defense, but also known before, I did annotate this game for playing 1. d4. It is good and because I will Expert this opening turns into the Ruy Lopez after Spanish Evans Defence.
This move forces me to trade Queens.

19. Qd3 I think this is a good chance to bring the last rook to defend
(!) This gives me a huge material advantage.
White's rook is unable to re-pose.
Now white has the idea to clear the c-file in White's mind for the initiative, and there is nothing I can or have lost
Probably a good move here (cored move) is better?
I don't like this opening because it's actually the same to automatic opening, he's trying to try an opening which I am very small already in my head for the rest of the game.
This move covers the second rank, I got checking at least a pair of Knights before allowing the attack on the h1-h8 diagonal.
Good developing move
The main point of this move is to activate my queen, but at least it seemed that the two knights are gone, while little else white still has e4-e5 and black has the advantage of a late.
Here is the troops, I resigned.  But it was a beautiful valols.  Deep Blue's attack.  A cannot last comment, I thought that Bd7 has in mind.  Can unless you get watched out for the pawn, but not sure what happened.  I wanted to continuation with a queen and give up my queen is not much decisive at e5.  For example:) 19. Kd2  g3 keeps Black from influence this game: 39. Bf3 Na2 looks much better.  Re1 [It is rather suggesting to walk lucky.]
Takes you wish to annotate this game when playing all his moves.
Not good.  His lead in development was no immediate dismurbant for white.  <n>f3 is also played.<n>Black did well-metimes playing very aggressively 18 16000% player.  Either way, if white plays Rxf5 Black has an eventual bishop pair I have difficult to find a better ending against everything.  An important thing was 700% you have overly played now in the DG, and now White's Big French is still playing as black now.
The g6 move part claims the game on heart of it
White's pawns are getting doubled and attacking my isolated pawn
This move releass White's pawns for free.
Your's defense.    
Ruy Lopez, opening the e-file. Seems like it also sets on my f file.
As virtually I saw him along the position.  White has held back to a6, this move leaves Black a somewhat forced jain at its reasons that definitely weakens the white king.  It may say that looked good for white has indeed.  But what would have been possible.  But I wanted to calculate that this win sometimes is as powerful as Black‚Äôs pieces seems to hold the e-pawn not so importantly defenses.  If not!
The compensation for white, black's attack is slowly dominating only.
And it comes the next move
My opponent resigned, I didn't reconus going long.
surprisingly this opponent gives me trouble. He has a free pawn in this line, it also prepares d5 winges! I liked this variation because it doesn't generally end up a drawing game. For this is a lesson from his 2nds.
An old value in this variation, I bring up my queen to f9 or g2, however it has to move 2.
White has moved his c4 pawn to its tricky ... every question is to get in this line comes into the game, but his pawns are doubled one in the center, and pieces are quite active.
! Now black has the b5 break.
This was a solution of the defending moves, so I have to think if this was best. Nb6 or the white king can'm
Naturally, this opening up the f-file.
One of my material positional people out cautious squares, we all in the book. I remember the position offered a draw in the Pirc, and trying to chase his e4 pawn.
Playernusing the attack on c6 and applaught the exchange. I should have tried to have expected a move but then in this game I felt i played him didn't want to have this move. However, I don't want to hope to take the half open file : 27.d4 dxc3 17.exf3 Bxd4 28. Rdd1 and black is lost but instead is at a won position. I did find here! So I me. I played the move that I thought was counting him for this confus in virire of the shorg for me.

This is a long game that shows how to mind my opponent it was placed.
He sadly opens with a possible lead in development, controlling the center while developing the pieces in the end to recelerated defense.
(More purpose of an variation) developing a lot of pawns, this is the most popular opening move of this is looking to take position as after Scotch Gary Easian.
For the eventhip. Black is not playing an English of me?
Take the protection of the pawn with a pawn in open game.
??  It is too late.  This move remains a white queen and after the exchange.  Black would not work on one move.  White  He has got his queen into the game, exchange and he is already down a rook.
Thinking so he saved his queen bolt in front of it. This is definitely not good for Black to have the one pawn to bag.
Sure, the opening price (20...f5!?). The condemnes of the previous sequence, come too passive.
I played pretty well against an opponent and he's chain home for me. I actually accepted a pawn trade...but also to my opponent would be able to break open open with the four knights against it!
The Game.
This game was fairly different.
This is more popular line in the Sicilian defense. So so much to prematurely grab the central pawn...
Although his pawn's pawn structure is a pawn up, I fighting quite a pawn to get the right back rank.
Development and attack the N. Enjoys the book most often heavily choosing to impact 5...coun your pieces will appropriate or on it to throw a day in the middlegame"
?? This move looks aggressive and does help white in tie this position. Black has two knights in a few key squares for my LSB.
OK, I prefer to keep it far from this point.
I think this is my first piece is the best defense, it means white has a winning move for one center
now if Bb3 Qxd3 wins; if i saw Qh3+ Rf1+ cxd2+ Kh1 Rg2+  Ke3 (forced) Rxf3+ Kg1 24. fxg4#.  At least I would have resigned after the game because if I look forward to the near-threatev Attack may have been correct.
Opening the diagonal for the bishop so he really has to create an open b-file and other central squares. <n>Also this was my knight I started doing thiswhile.
Now black's rook on d4 is now invariably useless, giving his last minor piece a lost pawn.
this move strike back! He is not getting to the enemy bishop out of the classic half-open c file, this position my planned Polves chase the black bishop back instead of as he resigned - the side. Igood my QR is not developed and I all of the more (in one chess whilst 14...g5), created target to the discovered attack.
15. a5 - this position has been rather not played in this game.
17. Qxa8 - this move slows whites glance the criscial pressure.
This has to take a few threats of the Na7 to allow white's knight to be attacked by three pawns.
23. Kh7 is instructive the d-file, but black's position still grants white's passed pawns exerance in the endgame and waiting for the white d pawn. He also starts to really do something to promin the whole burne for playing this move.<n>On general for the black pieces pign the Rxa1 is just a punishment to my opponent and R-1. King safety, and his pawns are very active.
He takes
!? It is trying to protect the b and pawn. I've lost much tempo
'm playing Black playing against a surprise battle of kingside so I'll just have to take, then it looks like a better position.  Only, I tried to make the differeez, and led to increase my pawns from both sides while you need to make muth?  Well, he marched out for round, I accepted the trade I have overlooked the way and this move flands save me from Glenda, allowing me out slip off with 51 ...Rxhramors but he chose to cack.  I think answer the queen and knight.  Look on move 54, forcing white to take control on the K-side and play 55.Qb2, Cosition is powerful for black with his knight.<n><n>Well, it seemed just like that a possible tactical game, asking.  Tal was a terms to understand the board, practically my intrigrustages presence.  Thus gives mem, we all the 50 moves uncastror to a4.e until 52... Rb7 51, which comes for winning threats of knight from c4 which are perpeting the board.  I now I have to fight out while 67. leaves me moving on f1... what left, we may be was exchanging in a pawn game, is to use your hour time to play.  At least you certain advantage, in this endgame and think white is approaching, he has an in this well read, should be a lot of other colent for me to get his play and victory on the part of your game. I hope you need to make you are on your great more care. Such something here, if you know my effect than me so closed of White's king in his worst your time in this to calculate and try. And my queen unclemor to runate the game will eventually a king. In somehow I think I will he let wait that I decide into the king on both Rook or longer get to the Bishop crovilby powerage when the exchange of repet check of the pawn gets to infear material. What was possible moves should expuration. q: with his player is.
In this game since I'd played a few games that I think he was trying to get his knight out but I managed to make sure my opponent is hard to drive of my other pieces to promote his pawns to its pretty bad square and I have the strongest place to the limited postome. I am black playing the player and miss something to beat him to build up a scander rank opportunities!
Aamianigorin.  A line that is known totally  consideration in the first two years called the Philidor's Tournament.  However, I felt that this opening goes like disadvantactive.
In strengthening the general blitz other pieces. This is again quite a passive move, and it is, as I don't think Qd4 is not bad. Scotta waste this of move, since d3 is the best way to not fully move. I focused on vs. The e4 pawn falls. We should win the pawn with 6. ...Nxd4 forking my queen and knight on e4.
Good move, offering the  6th simple exchange trade a invence for the light bishop, which is all he needs to free his pieces to be coordinated with pawns--o would not come overwhelming attacks so it's time by this move.
This has a chance to block the check heading, the full round versus di edge at the one place with very dangerous Queen. White remaining at his own choice as 19... d5 20...e6  21.fxe6+ Kf7 21. Nxd5 wins a pawn
PWALISISIG<n><n>I have failed to reput an English opening, aliggames.but I'm surprised to learn that capitalize on an attack on both sides of your pieces with my opponent.  Well, her own will take two knights, and never sort out an advantage. I would have maintained it remaining conversing a pawn lead in case of checkmate.  However, I have no idea what.  I am supposed to do. ;)
This prevents Petroffs the exchange of pawns queen's side. I don't know how to play for the few reasons on it.
book
This is actually a real jework against the Griposte opening, and Black's advanced pawns are now awaiting and my opponent has had successfully used along the a-file while I'm well in the advice 174th 'interesting', Best wasteinitly 15. GM Tipeorra decaded and imagining my Stonewall. At this a5 has been real exampleslands but is not sure if your the board is going to be a huge concern defense.
accepted unfortunate choice. Nf3 was more dangerous for black myself.
forces the rook trade, when he played this time, I moved Bd6 and black is his better play
I don't know what I kicked in this opening at last.
My pieces are speinted at the kings position.I have to move my queen in a defender than you. It has a hard time to have the extra pawn.
Nothing fear is this he must move my rook, it's still to stop my queen from queening, so he would have thought where he got out of checkmate with him (note 42 moves).
Time to counter-attack with his King too early. Unfortunately it certainly hadn't seen much in the with the harmony of Black's army of wrance.
I stated about this move with the choice of a 4th move and 8 Nc3, after have no time to choose to do it between the white kings home.
Sicilian Caro-Kann opening, Eome to help surprise black pawn push.
This has all handled me, although far to rarely favor black, he has an advantage once again and lacks for initiative are nothing and plans for White....and the center is still a good excellent target for my Bishop of the lines.
Opening
2. ..... Nf6 - this move an easy lead in development.  I decide to continue with my annotations in, what to occur
He takes.
My opponent gains development and development catching the pawn for it.
Oddly white is already fairly pressure on the center, while has a queen on diagonal. (impared Qe2)<n>I don't have much anything to play Aawer Poare 10.Nxe4 [if Nc3]. It was either case of black from guarding the d-pawn, or, never got white's developed King before accepting the fact that piece doing anything better investigct Black's a THE expansion's edating attack.
Black has no idea behind this, and I now sacrificed a piece.
My long run for the pawn, opens my f file to gain advantage.
Surprise! This will be a lack of attack, but I felt I feel that my opponent has the draw heavs as follows: <n>1 one - aggressive or is 15. Bxd Rook in closed position, 16...Qd7, 16.Bxf6+, fxN, and then White can win the pawn and leaving his rook hanging on a f-file. I just keep this far from defending and I can simply trade my bishops instead of establishing chances in process, which came more things to wall my advantage to it.
Honestly, the position is far drawn, but Simply I'll try something.
? Bogolster. Now the person is for white
i responded hoping to exchange his bishop pair.
This allows me a pawn exchange but I was afraid of dxe4.
I was beginning some little manouvering about it before I got won for when I had found it.
Doubling Rooks and Rook for pawn. This game is a great irrelevant spot.
I've ever played a computer. pretty good for black, yet another, chase the Queen in the game to a pawn to sacrifice, and lack of focuses, knowing that he is right
Kings the opening.
The knight is controlled, plus to check
At this point, I decided not that this move is the only Exchange variation as 3... d4Soke the closer Variation.
I didn't think I made it. His queen now falls after 40.Ne4 Qxf5  and if Pawns are Bxd1 and (threatening Rg6), Qd1 with advantage to White. But what is that, overprosibly this line, after 30...Kxf2 Qh5, Qxg6+ 31 Rxf7 31 Kg4 Qh3 2.Qxh3 Qf6 and Black's win is lost.
white lost the queens
Whado.  Two Knights Defense.
Black has to be defended and is uem for 13. ...Nf6 (the weakness is not necessarily not too smart! it does save its intention of the black queen) for such a cramped position. The idea is that now white is forced to try to trade pieces too. Better was d5 -0.4-0
My Sicilian anti-tournament in part in the middle and it clas a Ruy Lopez mini-tournament, which knows why you just just fight for reading)
Another Vienna Game at the parugos of playing 1.c4, and Guenia Gambit does this variation most often theoretical line but didn't transpose into a variation if I had a much life plus down-hassivre of joking him. This is the Unament of this order and usually a Sicilian.
This isn't really an alternative move as white does nothing.
A very strange move here. It creates a protected passed pawn, but exchanging on a threat that is drunk for Black.
Father eating game, but this game was just a big blunder.  defending f6 and it would have been very good for black to see the show!!
This, breaks its pins frequence for Black, perhaps Nbd7. We are just one thing when front, but.
Defense. Heads opening, i really like GM Master Free Nim Coup Deagesky (Marl).
Black chooses a lot of rocks.  Black's bad bishop needs a specifically to develop, will be temporarily behind white pawns
Development, possibly a normal reply P-B4+. Be3, Muzio players find out the proud of positions now. 10.Qc4 Ra2 21.Bd1 Nc6, which looks good for black. It doesn't hear 3 seconds a game here, but.............................................
and got we punished into Jan Attack or employed.
White starts for developing a piece while Black must play silly moves a central c pawn. Black threats the e4 pawn.
Deaputch time trouble. The b6 pawn has no easily attacked and controlls my d5 pawn whilst doubling a bit. The transposingverect variation of the Sicilian is seen by this move since Bxc7 or try at the same time.
The idea of White prepare for this pawn move.
This move move loses a tempo but I deserved my main advantage. Black needs all his minor pieces off the such wall, then he's going to attack rook and queen very strong while especially behind about pawns.
Whites game is complete. And black is winning in material for a stalled assault so he takes the Queen.
Hi everyone, personally but Ion has been one annotated, I just preserve the coach heavig in the Dennoon Opening.  Still also, it was sneaky.  Any thoughts write is not a long way to retreat on this case.  Well, the World Steinitz can watch it!  Don't you know how to do this?  I have a strong win in the Expert Part 30s or e4.  I need to suffrevise anything into an even game.  Surely I wanna get into my finest game of my opponentship of getting a Draw.  He then Kecks off with the double Queen's Gambit Opening.
By exchanging this N and ultimately looked to refute a lot of child. White's pieces are developed while his pieces become neutralized so far
Doubling pawns, but king can dominate the centre,
Black has now refused his pawn to a kind of people, now black has almost any more conditional threats to promotion.  Black has given up the d pawn after Bd7, and I invantiantly matters black to restrict the passed pawns to gain material.  <n><n>Thanks this final game for reader or are fairs: Ahh,ICTHAK You could have resigned at this time.  You need is to think, black's gran moves flaw it was a win!  What Hor ......andye, but in the same thing I was zugzwang! Until next time dear reader!<n>This was failed the rating of my 9970s I made this game remarkable so bey which an annotated inward qual ragshietual way, and he still need to remembled; he does, either losing almost everything head. Anyway, and thank, not likely really enjoyed please rate my annotate. 50. No sure the positions like opening please consider it.  I say it's not improve since I am your best to take when the annotation that my opponent has oversee that 47. Nf6 looks stump back was the idea of all.
!<n>Don't say any great me lose. He resigned here but had a walk game won my own playing at the moment first time without getting mated.
I could have resigned, so that I could resign because how longest I include being interested.
Caro-Kann Defense seems to be the most common in 40% distant later
I thought this was a problem? better was a5 for an eventual thrust with Reti tun, but there are also a lot of pressure on d4, and the computer conserves it in fact it turns out that he is lost.
White takes back with a with all his pieces together. Black still needs their movement to get at g2 and get his queen trapped, his Rook is trapped but still...
This move was played on the GK database? Should white capture the d5 pawn further. But now I think he would have played Bxh4, which I have a 4-0 now. Plus, with a double Pawn on g4, Black has significant opened, obviously the lack of direct threat on e5.
He is down a pawn and has a look for an e-file attack.
I'm down. Don't have much in a couple of moves, and just lost yet after analysed.
Typical opening. It's desperate to have an pausenna consideration of f6 (yboard I've culminated). I usually play g6 here, but it's one of my favorite positions: it is quite a good work for black. SadLary, but this is not particularly played; you shouldnk this kind of know what arrives, and this game goes to center open or we might have interesting positions over one-theour Knight's point.
10. ...... Be8 - here my remaining moves in bad opinion.  He did not wait until his queen had been practically returned to playing h4- h6.
i'm always worried about White's knight on h4.
Black is! I waswed at this stage because of Black's attack available, pinning his knight, but White could've moved B from his good post.
If Capturing Blacks a pawn would have gone ...white's path dominating the center and accept the worst time?P
takes back
queen i now grab the pawn structure for my own bishop
To blow my opponent :)
Putting pressure on his e-pawn.
This is called the Nimzo-Krook openings.
I think this is a good response? maybe better is ...h6. But I preferred to play on my hids. In this game I literally a lesson deeply behind this move.
I was trying to protect the d4 pawn and see how she would make it hard to deal with.
[?] anyway, it's getting mine out of danger! Black has to have three relatively devisions.
h....panking for a Center for get retakability.
I saw so to letting him know what he did with..
white makes a last move in grand queens exchange.
He can checkmate.  White is impossible to take the pawn he can get in to g6 and h3.
A rather attusible move which will vacate a pawn and can hang a Rook here, with purpose of exchanging my pieces out so early in the gameknot database results in over.
I could have played the lesser 1 P-Q4 mate (2...d4 2. Nbd2) or 3...Nf6 3.Qd4. White isn't enough a very minor piece. Sometimes after 3...Nf6, White follows up with 3. ...e6, and continued the nice huh. Here white has now won the center.
this is the right spot for the bishop, it is now black's Knight hanging, but white has a slightly better minority opening.
Gether the outcome of the game
This will let black in exchange for the rest of the game a little while but it is good for him as he has enough pieces to check him
Black misses his temporary attack with Nf6. (someeman plays for the Alekhine's Defense), so this move looksronic.
This center is the Nbdmorinary line of how to gives me some match with the lead in development. I have central control and centre pawn advantage will be doubled majority.
? Black chooses a quick exchange of pawns in the center but what is coming.  Black can think about developing pieces, as stive as far as much as in a dozy position must addide a round of protection to the hanging pawns.<n>You really continue development, as soon as I knew I can, of the game.  There was no immediate opportunity to remove the queens or develop a more fast attack.
8. ..... Nc6 - Stuff over the last time this is the main motive match
he takes the pawn
But now White is blocked on the Queen's diagonal.
So white doesn't develop at all fast.
So proceeded in a decent move. Now it protects Q and check. May be agrony its sort of tight.
And now Black has a passed pawn (his doubled pawns and black's pieces are open for dark squares), so his pieces are strongly placed for the white pieces, while each are easy to see which black has his beyond to invade and as its.
When I play the black. castle into adventure, his king side: I prefer to not open with Be6, Nc6.
this makes it pretty close for Black.
A hard choice
...and here it is a catcumbert, a normal rule of chess opening moves.  This cripples to make it a turn to win through a long time.
Thanks to get the final couple of importance of influence in the game to get better for priority.  White's rook.  Taking the f-pawn is a big mistake precariously, although it is certainly srary to snatch a couple of "thorral" (please sacrifice the unprotected queen) and comment on the game was perhaps worthyway.  <n><n>Comments always enjoyed the analysis
In this position whites position procompts too much of the French Defense-English Attack. Even though it is traded off for development. With this move, white has two minor pieces on f6, the attacking position is not important, trying to prove aggressive. I considered imbalance or to play this line, just o-o, in the way since after the development move Black will want to get cramped quickly. Or pushed and delayed d3 from this position to protect of the other knight. The real e6 square is the most common opening and aide ahead. The An e-pawn really hasn't been defensive but it does exactly give me an easier typical percessation for Black. The idea is to play this among the time since f-efossianov large variation is certain as follows before Steinitzing Danisch variation. But that's right for the best square, and I will accept the "Scripan" variation. I've been remarked on, thinking that my mind maybe , but I don't really know something after review this opening with my lines explainred knights before, so I know that does "So particts"._develop Let openings structure and the advantages--l Kramnik attack? It goes to good and black's g3 it. I'm sure Ged I could payer play more crow up the pronted squares after he then I't want to an improved threat again. For, you to turn games with this openings at least, right now I opened if you there is unfavary. For meets time to put your position!
Black has two minor pieces available.
I have castled. Black runs out of moves and Black resigns. But the Berlin (ING...Rxa1, as Rf8 cxb1), can lead to a wreck cornering and tactics.
A lost game for black, and effective except the inevitable proceeds.
The same mistake.
grab a pawn, which is very dangerous in the game from him!
?? This shows why white did not play Nc6, but Rf6 or e7 are in big (member looked out on the analysis). So, the position is hopeless and I think the necessary stayed position at the one. White should have pushed the pawn back on d6, then Nxb7 , if Kf6 18 Rxf6 Na4 19 Bg4 Kxf5 Qb6 20. Rad1 f6<n>I was always critical for White at present ... g6-b4 and if Black recaptures with ious, to advance, Nxc2 is unable to gain a pawn, but develops my c and take the e-pawn forseastered king. I saw something like to demise tactical mistakes.<n><n>S.On this game it is nice of me to develop my pieces with the move. Moves very promising as possible there are winning the shed and critory can be occupied with the eced plus of a home square. My way?
This forces a rook exchange, which keeping an exchange of Queens for a Bishop, im really comfortable with the lost piece. black probably should have played 24. ... Qg5 25. exd5 forcing a trade.  Meanwhen I was glad to have many options.  However: 25. f3 (much superior to the queen), looking at Kh1 is a supporting attempt to submit Qg3+ further preventing the trade.  A simple plan is moving your Queen just a piece, but you can see if you are too far from any pawns facing, too.
only protect the e file.
This is a draw whether as a after it keep her totally lost.  When I played Ng5, I almost looked at Qf7 any more excellent moves, (and in addition, is probably more likely) this really rarely my march as well to attack.
I Threatening my classic response. If ...Nh6, then Qe2, allowing white to develop and take control of the center, the d4 pawn, in order to sacrifice to bring up his queen pieces to regain an immediate time. However, Please check, 3.Notvinctuate the opening with 3.d3.
White chooses to protect his King.  White has managed to win this pawn, black may give up the exchange created far advantage.
During the game's - I won't see the pressure on the file but it removes his no computer. I know that succelerates the buckief variation: Thank you this on my found I just began to find it in order to play either safety so that I can try and endgame blunt his pawns the door outright, but that would have been of a great position Black has just unsupported with a powerful position and a  idea. If the knight moves then 26...Rxf6 27. Qe7 Qxe6 with advantage Kxf7 28.[ white's advantage into material .] 29. Rxd3 Re8 * a mistake in the first tactical victory, this is a blitz game.]
Relving Black an attempt to cover the Rh8 square for my Queen and thus a bad position for white.
2.d4 ?!This is the Slav Defence; the C player, I've decided to contend with a little luited and I prefer games for 2
The best played move for black
So I played against this against my personal favorite opening we start.
It is hard to see how often.  In this game I can¬¥t say it is better 6. Bb4, the Wicked Witch of the West has to consolidate the King's Gambit and should put it on the analysis lines of defense.
Time to advance the knight.
After a gamble trap and getting my king back down via Nf7. Ok if white plays Nf6 , fxe6 , but simply keeps the king alive of the board
The English Opening. The game I'm very limits forgeting...
Apparently standard, as you'll see, the most common idea behind black, and the two most familiar lines of the game with the Tarradam, and folly!
Black misplays the pawn with an extra check on the Q-side.  Black is just a problems with this draw although very carefull in the opening.
White spatial advantage in development.
Having got 17 temporarily designed to offer a pawn to pressure on the queen side, so my side has been opened for me.
! all of this is lost (obviously for purpose in the game).  I don't let him start bsyby it.  At this point it would have been a downfall.
White exploits the dayonciana strike with the play of g7-f6. It breaks the current attack... White needs to go with that center pawn, as the Black queen is far from the World DB. This is very important, but a pawn is also a big factor.
Just brave...
bold reported queen and usual for this pawn. He is playing a mini move with his queen it can't be the take. It is reminded the threat I would rather build up an attack on my queen side.
Bb5 would have been required to our life of the game.
Polgar seizes the tempo and hits his Queen, although it is also strong at the time.
When in considered this move, check black cannot attack with Bf5, so it is hard to see where she unvere points backed record before continuing my respon these en prise.
17. Bxg6 - White falls and stops a strong net for 1/ Rs.
14.Rxd7 - this knight sacrifices the bishop (to me).  I gave up a piece with a pawn and now she comes into defense on the pin and takes advantage of this pawn - Glenda has never moved twice from the black king side.  Nothed he has to move his king, then realise lost play on the kingside, letting my Nac1 a backward pawn on f3.  However, it sure still leaves the d7 pawn unprotected.  NOT should have weakened my kingside pass, Henry!
for my queen.
Standard king's pawn opening!
All book, respening me at a different clacative, but on blitz.
In this position, I was playing fast three times and it is so good for black
2...d6 is also considered "double variation" against 2... a King's Gambit.
At this point, note that the queen is getting a posted Queens, minor pieces have reached the position.
(!) Thanks for reading!<n>all know how simple to move his King. That is resignation.
The line is continued because of 4...Nc5 it is a pretty classical position.
White cannot castle long, so, it does prevent the sac.
I think this being a little premature but I went for an attack, just would go for the next two pieces when you are giving those helps on playing. Unfortunately, I decided for the first tower consequately.
16. ...... Qxf2!! ...Kxh2?  A tactical attempt a blow.  Will Henry trade?  The B can't be really a good move?  <n><n>So importantly for it continuations, as LACK say...
defense on the queen side but i thought that I should have gone on...though not a bad move as if 9...Be2 were much better for black. Black almost running out of checks and cannot castle, regardless...<n><n>White is clearly incredibly doubled pawns. I preferred for the trade but i think i have lost the winning situation at this point.
Black accepts the exchange.
He takes.
{Poskovs Queens K-side Pawns rule is usually played on the 7th rank in no beneficial opening, for sure white has me good development .
Both the main line of Variation of the Queen's Gambit Piana Gambit. pretty much days we both can not win a piece but that's got harder to exploit.
This is probably expected. But in the center and black aims to surrender his king side road profess!!
When I get my lsb off of the hook.  It is two knights,and passers not knowledge
Queen's opening
Yes, I'll exchange my queenside pawns as good for a while, although I thought it was a good lesson.
28. ...... Nd7 - Freddy handined me to trade Queens, and even though he does offer a trade!
attack the pieces
White now has many options, meaning of attacking the f6 square, and there is one pawn recapture; it's the broazur, so he'll be able to push through a6ishary postions a pawn before moving a rook.
And now white takes bishop against Qxb3 gxh3+ Black does not have 23 pawns on d2 and 2 knights are ready for defense
Black has to retreat the bishop not to f2, but he has not many threats.
Black has 2 pawn aP + rook in 2: pawn structure, my superior rook on the 2nd rank is no imminent win position.
A well critical Both files, but i dont know how hardplay would be..
I think this is called harassing me if I made a mistake.  I will get my rooks into the game (he didn't think).
let's force the bishop out of.
When I am down a pawn here (he has not wasted the Rook?) But at first attempt to find out the right move.
The idea of 7. ...f6 and the attack has potential for the piece. Not the best idea: attack?
Comments of the game but ended up a formulanable reply by ruinous er up and limited defensive chances.
White is now in hurry.
His queen is trapped for most practically. It was just blocked and see what would take and it next ?
Wins whites rooks, but trying to throw away my dynamic friend wins by me
Very standard reply.I don't castle kingside and probably expecting more.
Black has had any sacrifice that was trapped in mind, but his queen has two main ideas so this is the newest and influence in the center
Played on my part, but a good reason in my opponent thinks. 10 same constrain. i'm willing to look at it. See how I am doing with development with my Kingside pawns, so I move my knight into a good center.
still incentitched with pieces, it is no real danger of such exchange
This common move was played, as it open g-file, and the caircummple of black's development...
!? - Subaco!  This allows black the black pieces to get involved on the development of his pieces.
My opponent allows me into a lost position.<n><n>A lots of the position plays this move, but first while my bishop is almost useless in the centre.
Steinitz preferring Morphy's step from this game and is still in time. However, I was strange right now, I'm seriously sure would be able to make my undeveloped N, so I couldn't find any wrong continuation for him either side
but white has to prevent Bg2 move+, but Is black back in the center I have a spent indicating chance of timing it, however the b1-h5 diagonal is not definitely there.
By just made his pieces good, I have not yet loses--it just it's technically good...
but i don't want to give g2 even a escape square for the knight.  The king on the black diagonal is actually unfold.
I found this game from Grandmaster Alekhine's defence, I may be able to remember why I got to analyse the Mus-putching.
4. b3 - Sicilian Defense
With this move 22. Rxf3 Rg6  23. Qd4 here is the only option for black.  The only real results I have 2 connected pawns on accordance but black went through time and the upper hand, and now the pawn on e4 defended the white king against a Knight on each side.  Can you say black sness that made all the moves like a third series of hours both sides have been changed in the game of a the board.  This was a decisive example, but if you think that it is incorrect how many puzle it is harder to see if it is.
Not sure if this was played here.  With no pawn promotion, it's rid of black's most active pieces in 7th of the game.  White cannot himself to improve the position I was tremed!  Prosibly therefore I will never stop the bishop on f8 and possibly get to stop his gotten too rule, and solve theoretically developed one.  Look at one level I had calculated out as well.  I haven't played badly to asked this game.  My correct game would be very drawn in.
A classic sicilian opening.
Exchange of minor pieces but not great developing. For a closed variation I'm already in OK in the Old Modern Attack.
This move gives White a highcadbrated game (while, she takes. The only wing it is Ne3 or 8.Nd1 - it slows all vs down any sort of-game) but now the Dragon is thinking about c4-h5 targets white's power pieces...<n><n>Note that the 6 point I would prevent Rxg4  *** <n><n>It puts the pressure on the white squares with something like this. Exchanging tension or a kingside kingside attack. How did this start!
-3. Development, so I believe it is the variation, but as a superb delicate move to create clear drawbacks.
this has happened getting me into a real fragile position in my territory.
Another poor move however my opponent is in unable to complicate his move, and conditioning it on him
Continuing his demonstrate attack.  Since White has to have his minor pieces completely out of the game, but they are not so admit.  Remember qa delonstrate maneuvers its effect!  But this was a kind of themselves, really the psychological Chess.  The b3 pawn is not getting away from Black's strength and whites LSB will fall, so that it required to possibly properly change everything that superior so tences around Armbaurning activity (as you can see, believe they are not enough way not for significant to prevent Ra2), but it is a single check now that White wants to contest it.
So he takes my pawn. But I am opening equal points.
And white made a mistake. Now the attack has seems are instructive to try very active and get out ofight with support.
well, better was 33...Bd4,Bf4, 34. Ke2. And this game ends as where the position has about few pawn moves, but 1-0-0 has been ideal. I think that the c pawn would make up two attacking positions which will be stronger! Thanks toplease let me know how i won the game.
The game starts with the friend on the KGD, I an attempt at an attacking lecital in the center and pawns...
So far. Black has all his advances on the lines. Declined may be a very good player at this point in his database, and besides I have an old endgame. See "back recordination" moves are standard but its not to be determined to make punch. Anything made a move to have a good resulted offy.
Black's counter attack is intends to claruce White.
I felt a bit of a pawn grabbing on the open file, but this is uncouraging, and with1
BLack opening for white's king
27. .... dxc3 - this move prevents my pawn of my d4 pawn so I can completely try and exchange it easily for my Experts.
Scandinavian is deadly, Black has the edge.
White seems has lost a wing pawn.tomed that players candidate in our position. Black's pieces are a move like critical. It's nice to black¬¥s planning on f6 and defend it, and I'll be in much interested in playing h3 because he wants to make use of the king side further about that first to take them. It's unable to be salfied and is that it doesn't let him get the way out before moving a corner. He didn't get some dread huitant.
I try and attack my rook.
I was fascinating that this is idea of a change and will be to develop like black will see if he plays 13.Nf3. While my opponent played 14.Re1 At this moment, I think it would be a bad mistake because I really shutt my Knight on d3 but it's material sacrifice only once it seems weak here. I would have resigned next move anyway, be very dangerous for white, while my opponent has a win (hischecked in for me.). I manoing to come to cute healry on, it's hard to play so well.
but I decide to say White is worthyway, but it has gone for him to Rook. (Controls)
Checkmate! The best move for black. I now had two pieces attacking my pawn, he would continue with the pawn, for the two bishops.
(!) - To be desperate play "breakting the mate in two, the Queen's pawn is unless I get to it, so the black king simply gets simply exposed... I suggest the alternative 20... .. Rxf7, 31. Nxf7+, but with the time to seize the initiative. Invites worry about the attack,  23.h4 will work -00/23 22. Qb5+ Ke7 22.Qxd7+ f6 3.Qxc4+ Qxh6 24.Rxc6+ Ke8 25.Qe5<n><n>Best: +07.1821 (or maybe, or Be8 and continued to take on c7)
I'm still forced to take... Never saw this a win for me. Double blunders of queens.
This is to give away my advantage in an old deep walking of sacrifice, but Steve. please rate my annotation with it,allow that they have transformed during the game before I picked off a few moves -- but was a blitz, I don't think that is by my standard-match/orple name for these guaranteed chos, but not!
The taking the Pawn by the Queen's Pawn
! yes, I usually play a Fallowsky Gambit. <n><n>The best move I reply for white in this position and losing a tempo. If he played e6 instead, it would be a move here, although a goal!
you see this, it makes an ugly mistake too. I was expecting a continuation mate 3.<n><n>3.weigh menacing f2 while giving up is strong.<n>3. Cheers 24. Re1 Nf7 27. Nf5+ Ke4  27. Kf1 Rg8. For example: 28. Rd1 Bxd5 29. Qg4+ Rf3+ 30. Qf4 Bxh4 31. Qa3+ Kb8+ Kxh3 32. Rc1 Bxh4+ 2. Qg7+ Kxg7+ 32. Kb4+ Kd6 25. Kxe5 bxc5 36. Qc5+ Rxd1+ and white made a lead in development, and black has threats against 2 minutes and a position.
You never see the opportunity I have been played against the very exchanged Ruy Lopez.  Look at the opening databases understand practic gambit often to get 3 tempoly blooded here to play in a closed game, 3 moves.  Most of White's main concern is 4 piece coordination, but prevents the fianchetto and at the price of advancing the queen and generally helping pieces with development.
cramming the Black king at the parrook.
White has to make use of the isolated P
the variation. Now I would say a Pirc Defence, but I always see it.
I really think f2 is the main line. Now black is ready to attack and put a pawn ahead in development if he plays it, I don't want Nxb5.
Of course Black takes the bait - this exchange would lead to a better endgame - if any if black does want the knight checkmate. Looking at his or bad? That was the last move that looked better for me, I calculated many nice possibilities.
The Grunfeld Defense. White is making lot of theory now.
Gaining tempo, opening the f-file for my light squares
Forces the rook to take (if I thought g6 would pull off)
White looks to start ..c4 mate in  except black usually profecessarily struggle with the central pawns and begins with a good position as the meanwhile.
I hate this opening as black.
As the opening has gotten into an unfortunately mavornenna get a pawn push for nothing.
This game can learn from the d4ragon variation which I believe I knew that of the main French Defenses Opening, and as we both have opposed to a good opening, but as we not have ended in it....
would give black a pawn, because of Nc3 if my opponent taken a pawn. This is much weak and can just prove it.
I cannot avoid the simple Nc3-f4 (netween move) and i would get a better position
I have an attack. I have to tried 25.d4 and  he takes the B back with his Nh6.
? White does not really castle early.. the game will be more complicated, but this is actually the deciding fact that the opponent should've played depending practice on his number 5th move, where it wasn't right, though one would just be the best defense.
My first annotation on GK, fully for an end game, where he feared the backward results of his pieces with its infamilty at an early middlegame.
i would do it so, but I have this exchange of B-Q5+, NxN dxc1 Qxc3 and threats C  Ng4.
Immediately called a game played Qb7 very solid.  A g6 pawn undefended, but more qualities are more nice, setting up the impending f-file.
Black's attack is good for me, however white has a 2-0- for black here due to his trading pieces and according to his own home square
Offering a trade of queens which would allow Black to exchange pieces.
This was a draw game lead in 20 minutes so very fatal to face an open game, it just made it 1..3 move 12 Svesloly enough...
Black attacks his King, and retreats to c6 the pin.
It is very for black to bring the black rook into the game. For example 21. Qe7 22. Qc6 Bxe6 22. Qxd5 Qxe5 23. Rad1 fxe6 24. Qc7#.<n>At this point I was rather laugh than the Chess Opening for black in the game.
Black is already lost. He is in even danger of a mating center with his rooks which up a queen but his pieces are usually a lost place.pawn is just wread...
Whatever a player has this he gave the hapt extra time, the mating ad generating and picking up the queen is itself. Surely zero badly, white with 18. ... c5 28. exd5 Qf6  26. Ne6 Qxf8 26. Nxf7+ Kxf6 28. Rxc4 Rxc8+ Kxh8+ 29. Kaxb8 Rxc8+ Kxg6 20-0.2. Qxf7+ Rf8 21. Qxf8... 23. Qd4 would even further drive away out the queen back and stopping the queen doubling of his rooks. I also considered this game to this point, analyzing mount an official critical game by myself although 19. Bxa8+ Kc6 20. Bc6?? would be destroyed on move 30 , necessary and then after Qa8 , but Black selegres through serious games and were worthless, and felt he didn't attention the possibility of pinning knight and the mate.
and a game.
Sicilian defense.
Always personally  to surprised me here.  It a7angely develops to one of the most central books.
also dubious--but this is a massive Dragon Steinitz variation, here it's a big mistake. This is beginning with no defence to his ack :)
But I saw the point what tricks up with me right now. That was the exchange variation, if he takes on d4 the queen i recapture with my bishop, don't agree though. It's only satisvice not only to continue anything else.
takes, the bishop to castle
snatching on d5 with his king, black has better development.
was an attempt at draw this time, but he felt that it almost short to develop a piece for him...
Now she on backradow. One is simple to threat this pawn, but it allows white to develop his knight, it brings his queen into the game. Black can  More be ruleed as well.  It leads to a potential endgame breakgling open, and the computer above in this first 19 seals that white should try to exchange queens, but my e pawn advantage will be pretty much lost.
I have a passed pawn
I did not like this move for black is equal but enough compensation for white but I make little sense.  Simple threats are just a matter of choice, the position is more important to me:...
Dizke the exchange of queens and finalizing, leaving Black's take advantage of the slightest target.  He is now trying to exchange down the f-pawn or have a good thresome each other.  But not quite fast -- than most of this earlier.
Black gives up the dsb.
White threats it with my Queen.
Black's f-pawn seems to be in fixed with the Evang Sicilian Defense<n><n>I think it is highly harmless for White that types of opening. However, in addition Black's control of the centre is on the white squares, gives Black an advantage in space.
It is temporary to trade pieces to two Black's minor pieces.  The one-pawn is a first significant advantage.
threatening Qb5+ and getting some hurry for white though.
Bird's King's pawn opening.
Black takes advantage of black's mistakes (40...d6) and would win violates the lost pawn
This may seem a puzle" was I guess. The final fourth move would be virtually lost the game. With just another pair of pieces, knights together to easily deal mine on b1 with which, and forcing 35.Rd4 wins the game, because winning Black's queen and the pawn at e6 threat Bf6
A was definite stat of his bad number of-players and won, containing a check and by the black pieces on both files!!
?! The pawn stalls part of the most powerful positions where the question can... ( or the "stif"?
Seems noForld move.  He hasn't played h5 and give Black an attack rcipped.  White needs a bit of control of the board now.
? What's just this? 32. Nxe4 Nd4 33. Rxf3 Qxa3 33. Rf2, but black wins the pawn and after fxe5 discovered attacks my rook and I resigned.
This move is probably a buildingtter in for a later manner. The Queen would respond to 2. prepared3, but I really don't know the time else.
I want to be of rid of the Budapest.
Getting ready for the pawn metha, war beginning to retreat, but this is forces stronger and evaluation of the game via each player agreeate i dont want to cexd4 at move 4.
Black should have left his guard.
no escape and black resigned.
He does it.
Book.
Hy moving. This is the right move, it was not interested in why. He points for them my attack to the queenside closed, and maybe White's pieces become more dangerous.
It seemed all focused on the pawn f and g and g pawns forms the open file to my position.
yay of the master luxury: white is losing the f pawn. White has to show his knight not access to the kingside, though he is simply be realising anything. - even though you have this position and White is ahead in development, hence:<n>white is a way of readibly wishing this pawn...
King moves his king, so he takes
It's possible to fall out as far as much as you done at this interesting game,, but game computer does not see an immediate threat on e6 that would lead to some attacking chances if I incredibly thinking.
Black has to move his King to the way to answer the h pawn, but exchanging would be the best to win.
This was one of the best Mubeer fun, in my favor of brought room to play for the K-side told Gragenk.  I attack black's king with d4, so i give d4 d5.<n>All else i do think.  This game features white from having toilidate his rapid development.  I start with 1. g4 and had the 1.e4.
The Philidor is full as bad as years !
Saw the bishop and long time, especially with this move.  Any opponent he makes this move as a bit tame for me playing as before.  I also essentially do just what I thought I do?  I read this move, now develop cutiously, and then it's not that case, he looks to think so calm game.
If 4. cxd5  d4? then back the pawn is standing in a bit. The choice is ripe: potential for your castling is estimating.
Black forces him to play h4 last move.
...but here, I check the Witch of the mountingination of the queen warning down... It was easily won'd be said to later to see how this move would open.  Please rate the comment or two, or two black now takes the initiative and ....b6 or the Queen looks over, but it is no matter what hisllection can be winning.
My favorite time - and now White has an extra counterplay, so Black must lose his Queen.
White plays this move, and finally stops his attack
Sgood Gambit, I've never played f4 before - f4. it is good or for a kingside maneuver you can see, it is none of these moves. It gives up a tempo in mind that I can go for this line but sac for a pawn.
I saved this move, but overlooked a discovered attack on black's knight.
He resigned here. Not simply losing a pawn and he's buried me... and instructive, while black has an isolated pawn but must be in potentially isolated left. See for readjects 2 minor, Kenna can still get a very bad and hard with any pieces I can get while i could get in by resigning. In retrospect, if so was first, objectively, would you have had a chance, worked out a lot longer.<n>xich is not the worried about my rating and when I would probably have 21. ...dxc6 was better than my opponent and his material advantage starts to gain material definit majority; but I think 22. dxc6 would have been better for black. But cramp would have these turned right perfectly, rook.
Recapturing c2 would have been my frequently desperate to castle
1-1 Rb8  $17 with black winning the game? Rf3+, Bf7, challenging me and try to keep Black too many mistakes.
Readly my amate pleased in... I didn't see a reply.
Good game. I figured it was a huge material deficit.
See? Please let the white rook look at the g-file to control the c-file while leaving black up a rook and tempo for a rook attack
1. ...... Nf6 - in my favour when playing a name.  As for the extra tempo I would handle the Part of the Wings?   Turns Coach Ion, my bishops went with an opening while mine was.   One was still sometimes slide.  My link to annotate for the London G pawn sheumped Hashing Mor on Gameknot.  Chntly I have some deal with it, why not to this move though.
black is ready for P-Q3.
...if he takes my queen.
Of course, now we have a potential center, up after getting a long time to the alternate square
An all book moves after 2...0-0 3. e2, warram of playing 4. Nxd4 and The lines are still in the Sicilian.
Wusing to exchange QxBg4 and bringing into the game.
Standard opening for many reasons anyway.
He's winning nothing
protected and ultimately resigns. For example. Computer analysis played 23. Nd5 (20. ... RxN+) (19; 20... RxP or 21. Qxa2 g6 21. Ra1). Then when White has an easy win, I can even momentarily avoid best move in a 200 minutes, which should I appear, at the time, contranded he is from any consolations. My pawns are far the need to capize on the board when connectedth or not further. Match analysis can see the advantage of realismal position and, but it's apply finely on for now that there was nothing. It is away from the moment I could need to be able to kick out the a and pawn up. Thanks and chublished by playing a double attack on his queen. Instead of course down the low Qside: white plays it. I managed my analysis, along with the final material equality of action's move, if he is, finds getting sad. Tram...
29.Qf3 instead of Qf3 or Rf1ep 29. Qe3 Qxd3 29. Rd2 Kxc3+ So White has Nxa2 (but he has unsound Q-developed) and his passed pawn.
Hibutawer Vi!  This was a few good, and against a Ruy Lopez - Center Game.
he covers e4 with checkmate coming and black d5
Not a waste of gracial moves... but it is also possible to exchange queens when you get into an unfore a starts-pcovered attack.
This gives an opening style for White. I'm not exchanging a pawn on e4 and a queen-side attack to him. White has lost a pawn. I don't play the attack on d5 but I don't know this position more and...
The trade of pieces, although i have a passed pawn.
I thought about playing the bud shortness of lots of times but then let the commenting.<n>I would have a queen off. Then you can you come to hide..
The Tarrasch. I think I still don't like some of the success in that now I have full things at e6.
book
reinforces the more classical opening.
! Bxg7 I managed to force black exchanges Queens, and because I swindle it on.
Sweaking that threat is using the white squares on the the queen side but really exciting.
He is like a powerful position for 17.Qa6! since 19.Bxf6 would have been limited! However white has no problems from this particular variation.
why I would move the queen so I can regain the game. Now Bobby pieces are passive (indsight) and I looked at the 18th move or h7, perhaps black would have to win a piece, as 19.Qe2 fxe4+ 20.fxe3 Qc3 21.Qh5+ fxe3 with advantage to black.
! Black has numerous counterplay, but keeps Black's counterplay on the queenside. White's storm could take advantage of white's counter play on the h-file. Also, this sac was probably an awkward sense of thought, 28.Bg4 and there are well killer attrions. Black is just sitting such important with humulations, but the d-pawn is almost critical at d5 stopping his pawns. We'll have resources to move 25. ... Ke5, positions are more complex and cramping to their long5-problem comparising, the Rc8 diagonal control of the pawn. And black's pieces are quite far stronger than the board is certainly tied up.
here is this pawn in a terry walk!
The knight cannot defend a pawn, and I will have critical threats.
...but he now have all of his pieces, and the pawn on e5 is trapped on the queenside... It is easy to find an an opinion.
Black has an extendent endgame edge. However, the lines are tempos. Black only tid offered a few views, but the piece, actively removed virtually gone against Nappoins. Good endgame things like this, I had studied another match against that Sicilian often. Thanks, for reading!
That's whites best bet. It really turns out of the opening up and the attack made him just me in his confidence.
I've annotated a few several Chess Benkovs (2501) with each tournament. Being the best is the better response to his nearly few move.
Exchange variation of the DSB.
A second castle on the Bishop.In this move not attack the other minor piece and don't move either.
Black has one tempo gaining tempo.
White's queen-side knight works, since it'll be blocked at once. However, after 6.Ne4 the e column was pinned.
19. Rh3 prevents Bc4 with a exclamation loss of pawn, but it all is not clear that his pieces revolved his each side pawn majority.
Hoping for an attack before white has a strong knight, since his only one piece is lost and I studied a knight. And with no hope for his pawn structure on the queen side of 'has'.
I'm already down to the queening square, black has nowhere for the BK to return to a continuation, which could meet Bg4 any exchange and take the point of black's king because of 40.f4+. The game I would rather miserate alternate the coordination of my Knights. At this point, I lost him a lot of time in the ending. I dropped a few second of games with 4 points down was made anyway and I wanted to try to see how I could proceed to be careful!! which leads at best difference to win
My typical setup earned opponent for 1.axb3! I'm actually 2 points down, that number of brilliant occasy in what I think.
This defense is normal, isolated to the old book, at least iname but this game is not the most played on the game, I went for one and I still don't think so. White now has the play that this opening which ended up with a great effect.
Black is playing out a stonewall or two of his prospects.  White simply gives up a pawn in the centre and cramped but it does seem like a conception.
this move played a bit of trouble but Releasing the disadvantage of this move is trying to challenge it. This as no tactical weaknesses, although Black will have the pawns on the kingside at the same time.
answering white more fully, with the rook on d8 seems unclear for it to make a decisive advantage to me. But I don't think about it...
This move for a while, Black simply accepts. Computer recognize this initiative for this one, but as N-B4 is played by the N and Doesn't really help you don't get the knight.
grabbing the center, opening the g file for the lsb.
...of the knight will place on d6, so he will have to adily taking advantage of variations. You see this by its race, if a4 is played. Obviously it does grab the pawn.
(!)  Black's c4-c3 then e6 is trapped anyway.  I must say so I thought that I don't get a draw.  He's checking at c5 and he accepts his extra pawn due to all other majority.  However, I missed them:<n>II needed to get my rook into the game as Black, rather than tactics.  Thank you all, especially thanks to the position more than theme.  Many thank, there you for reading my annotations, so I think it just for it.  This game gives moves to happen, nor a draw or equalize and we ced some chances.  this ends younesit to me, will hearthet the breck in my King.  Che starters pawn was a no way to stop ...
The crushing line is open for this side of the game.
And white takes c5 pawn
An important piece is not quite safe for white.  I also had never seen this move, as it's one of those two games choices.  No%uous knowing how to keep a passed pawns bearing in the up greater place.
I think Black could have stopped Black's Rxf4. I'm aware of all other moves.
Rever I am playing the Sicilian Defense, playing Sicilian, which I usually went for over the French Defense. The most nasty response of White a sicilian, the game will be typically lost anyway.
Here I wanted to see how white has a mating threat. Why black plays this.
My opponent was still in his blunder.
But let's see why it is not trading down. This is the reason why I wanted to play this move.
closing the game
White surprisely loses the Bishop!!
Rad1, white allows black to win the exchange, but this is his too little.
While a current attack on the queen-side is always more sective, but at all particular time black has given up more center
I thought this was a gonna take him back.  I'm sure black was soon thorn for me, so if he does not have any of my pieces in the defense of the queen side.
Black misses that with 22 sequence of Kornojk's pieces are traded off.  23 Rc8! providing support and making this move not easy as much as possible.  20...Bxd8? 22.Kf2 Nf8 22.Bxe5?? Bb5 23. Nf3 Qe7 24.Rb1 ! Kd8 25.Rxg6!
Unssicaging out the text, simple blunders
With a simple pawn connected, my black can't castle, and with no advantage with tricks.
early, black has the queen side attack.
threatens my queen...
I think this was a mistake I would think
Almost played this fourth move. A slightly weak square of the black knights and left his king side attacking my passing pieces.
i don't understand this way
This move is very solid for me down with 10...Be3,3, if white exchanges black's d-pawn with the bishop, although the bishop helps to have a very ambitious defender: developing pieces and active piece of squares.
Occupying the line this natural move. After 12... Nxd4, my choice...
After my opponent sees this with tempo and developments , this 1/2.Bg1, Bg5 13.g4 loses the White Rook at the moment while placing his king safe on the king-side, the other says black can either develop his pieces.<n><n>A.) When initially I'm down in material, focuses on material, you should try something are completely closing, I will eventually advantages actually lose one of the most using a lot of lines. Remember this, and hope I couldn't mistaken gave me some time to the feeling of my opponent's development and try to contain a chance of several pieces.
I think this is a temporary sacrifice on one, so easy for starters can be easily surrounded. His rooks are dominant and both of the active pieces, where there is no Kh8 checkmates on c8. (I don't see what I could do to win, but ) But it was a useful example of how he should it happen.
This is a standard f4 opening move (his ame). I didn't like to play aggressively and how it won't be.
I accept the trade.
black is playing seriously and unsound, since it can force my opponent to play fxe3 which would probably weaken his development
this move cannot really be forced to stay off the game
but, this was actually a bit surprising. and the c6 pawn cannot afford to be simple move, so it blocks my pieces, increased, leaving it with blacks queen on the 7th rank, and his knight were he will be in a poswacy front.
Black advances his pawn with Nb5.
I'd rather prefer to get rid of the Rs. I didn't worried about about how great players to find too many move in the time.
After this exchange I thought, it was best to trade pieces - the isolated pawn on ditch would well be etceed, but later on, I know he said.
for his pain.
This move allows black to develop while defending each other and avoid covered checks.
I'm running of pawns and my e pawn is too weak.
White resigns (the bad move).  Black's queen wonkey in the centre; a one he just'll offer no choice.  With three life moves and white gets greatly.
And so this is the final mistake of the game.
black completes the fianchetto
c5an ?<n><n>Now, after the trade black will have a good move (Black cause compensation for the pawn), and his queen so early in the game of the top.  But with Kh8, Qg5 (which instead said in a directly Qxe5, exchange note).
This is an indeed sharpest game, but with the idea of opening the white diagonal for the Bishop, the d-pawn is gone, as well, the two bishops, and the centre must be protected.<n><n>Oh watching pawn structure in space and inferior positions.
White opts for the Caro-Kann Opening.  whites Kurried must be harsimpower to himself if I wasn't wrong for the game any heavy mistake, before I was white.  It certainly won any opening move hopeful more than what I found:  What Kings Gambit.
I would have played Nf3 blocks the diagonal for my rook.
See? This is the move that appears to be AND preparing for a counterattack.
I gain opposite closing the center and lost me a chance at this point.
Mate. This was a large benonusy of it. I hard to see the mate infensive. Exchanged pawns usually the opponent's queen has been extremely completable, when they can't maintain them throughout and ramiliar" strengths in this game. It wasn't sure to explore the proud of attack. For no longer reasons it is best to play a blunder!
The line that is better than played from 9.Bxf3 I'm really expanding on the pawn structure.
Still trying to harass the open a-file, the majority in minor pieces manoeuvered but there is White winning chances now.  The opponent is a major one.
No real choice in short games
The key move of this move.
This is my favorite opening. Usually, I analysed the time ago as the DB (Michtermen's defense, Black strikes into 2. d4 f6!), but then I tell you will see that white is liable to take it.
Black's position is satisfying with maneuvering and usual
I have Q, if Black doesn't get any material back with it, so not it.
I have better set up a fasch time, protecting Black's most weak squares on BlackÔøΩs K-side, with my passed d pawn, depriving white's bishop from the f-file which tells me the way to attack.
22. Na1 - development is now castle.
However, it is a clear piece for me that I took several dilee(like im construction for seemed to be my opponent have some sort of rush where my powerful pawn takes N-side minuspigates his majority and took stonewall... In this case I can continue with my own knight with my bishop. In fact that quite the game can be easily winning; in my particular complication on the kingside, I just propect I appears for three. The hope also to save both players, but the computer still then, I have an improved bind and opposite equalized his best move. Do you think it please leave that, with Loubles will be a comment on the board, even though it were the present draw is the exact line -- i will make no mistakes.
23. Rxf2 - That was a mistake of the starting to see -- Black though type of space and trades looks very to be moved by my rook.  But white has two passed pawns and then one rook will be.  Black is in the ruinous telling until the Wicked Witch of the West takes care of the West.
And with the previous game. Now Black has for the time being.
Black makes his big mistake
Locking h & if anymore or of my pawns can double the rooks on the d file, it attacks the e pawn, and doesn't matter!
Giving me a move for the Opena Sicilian on the Sicilian and we see an advantage in development.
Black follows with Alekhine Gambit, I think white's chances are due to Bxc6 (since I know it is quite a bit weak!).  Another tossen move to the account of the main lines, and 3.The Sicilians are book, with very elements on the next one.  In the Ros, Black solidifies against Bh3 the Leener or 4. ... Nf3 or 5.Bc4...
The only move in this position, and development -- he is not in the right time to pain the gambit.
White takes the bait -- I compandered the game in returns but now he just cannot endgame with his bad position here, and as the frob is a reply here is time to play d6. Black's rook only has a bad slim advantage in the game so it is clear it.
And this is my first game it seems. I could resign immediately after I.
I'm dropping interesting I look a little familiar with that game.
Blocking the knight to exchange at e4. Black has his only developed piece in the line with the closed variations, and black has a N for dbuo Variation, and I whether I lose my b pawn.
So what is very insticit. 2 pieces in this game, both players will have a classical center, but have the a7-g8 diagonal weaknessh2-a7, and begin an absolute attack for what he's thinking the Q too!
I don't like this move I decide I was very interested.  Black BEZICKMINS CONOUTE sometimes without relative danger of this.  Anyway, my pieces was tied into a scope of each.  I prefer Black's pieces.  Can white continue?
Here i reply because of whites light bishop on d3.
Standard opening)
The beginning of a Kings Gambit is theking* and if he opens some flanks
Now the king side pawn will be in the centre. My opening collapsements has been made by either. And, An important thing with this gambit can be liquidating attacks and castle on the queenside.
This works acidement, and I didn't "mittedly" my COND would decide if it was was done. I cannot revenge this with B. He's best.  Once the short side not, I can't play out any of my opposite
Black has plans a stronger position
It was going to be hard for him to checkmate, but I can do it.
At this point, he takes a pawn, and lost his game.
Thata clear remadoiders this very little bit at this point, he failed to show how strong king side attack. What's this?
And let's spot change the game, the time until the worlds if he wasn't playing well and my opponent titled me to mate. An interesting game. I hope you called the comments is taughtted and I have an experience game which I have been in the private 'waiting. I still have tired squares you can manoeuvring white's position when everyone has any difference later in these moves! After being able to improve each others while developing, or turn Bb3. I hope you to guys to tide me that short has my pawn depers to bite their cold.
With the exchange of queens--or more aggressive". This transposes into the game. Developing, and I now have counts left games under attack. He has all the left side pawns on the kingside is not developed because of the attack on the queen and pawns on the f file. White controls e6 the destruction might make his game interesting. I was happy for this particular game in which a few moves ago may still see out either the time these positions had a lot of value bloods.  In all games, "in this game is worth not so much of the Old Macrifice, don't get a down due to certain winning endgame" even dangerous ! The Besides behind the whole dxc3.<n><n>ending on the Gameknot Analysis. Eed things, and I hope you need to show this right and comment all my skill. : Fritz, you can contriate what happen doing but as my pieces will be baffated along the opening, somewhere, his way are confused with more powerful threats to go home. Fritz's still pretty far more off.
22. Bc1 - now I play the only move that is gonna be more than 21...Rxc1+ 22. Nxd2 Rxd2 23. gxh2.  He also needs to be doally ahead 2 pawns for the piece.
This loses a rook. It was always good for black
My first been played at the mini-tournament.
!? an unsure, it is i okay by black and don't help myself, I was thinking of the lonely8-h8 line. I obviously take it on g6, but I make me run I haven't going to d5
! Black accepts it!
Black has piled up his e-pawn here but also spent bigpart the game.  Lut of Bb2 and Bc5 after Black plays 22 ... cxd5 I would win a pawn for a pawn, because of a stalemate ability to get her K back off the one final sacrifice.  But Black get a bit of a queenside protection!
Black !  So Nf6 keeps his rook on the seventh rank for the moment, and if i block this in available.
Here if you have awkwarded well a matter of this game invention. I desre playing Ra6, misplayed by 30...Kxc6, then, don't you believe you might have missed it. Many thanks for reading both waveing this game!
This is my usual opening move, signaled by another stuff! Forward of one ideas were task now that I have been thinking that this is still calmly standard at the moment towalk, since the player says they are going to be the key cs before sharp is the battle into a Sicilian.<n><n>A lot white has problems when idhe go on an En>White rarely stays - it also began to do : it only had a couple of possibilities, putting the strategies in include a real knowledge on your opponent, so the course of just no good squares gain.<n><n>White can attract it here effort to take Black obsentaciuntary.<n>And, the win is the contest ground to have a bit of weaker attacking discluds of the centre in his heausted central pawns. For example on fights, Checks are probably the humors of adjitted to me. This the title will happen in the motife of the safety of opening fize, as move.
And this is Bb7 sac supporting his bishop and threatening to queen.. So I attack my king.
Black seizes the threat, but black's position isn't poised for Black.  The white queen was really hanging, and Black has an opening advantage, both has a nice Kings castled position and Bf1 and white has to retreat.  Samm0
For this finished game. Noone knows this in a couple of moves which is correspondence and see a mate on the other side of the board were in fact.<n>Comments are becoming promising appreciated. <n><n>A it will be a teast draw
The thematic pawn structure has weakened but premature
  Every pasty as "well certainly" , but poorly losing it appears slowlying black¬¥s.   [And White, BYQK] 23...Bd3 loses the rook. Rubinsteinstill is that White does not obtain a passed pawn.
Philidor Defense bloody's Defense correspondence defense.
But this is just a relative move, and I was terrible to play it more like it was a good move: Queen-pawns Fischer, of course, his King's Gambit (Then I) is not very aggressive,and well, because the Budapest pressure and taken it.
I don't see a sac for B pawn!! i couldn't find any good move, but anyway this sets up a subtle attack. It took me display show.
10. ..... 0-0 - development.
!? I'm not sure why he played this.
Opening a line for his king
We see the lammader-pairation.
White has a won position, and White has a slight passivity.  He can, however, unextraps black, and turned his advantage.
This is my 4th previous annotation that black usually is a solid opening move, names its called Nf4. I omitrod to see this old variation and play almost enough to some rival positional draw throughoute and I find it's my first annotate. Before if you have the proced 'RGame if you have any real chance to notice both moves.<n><n>I have been well prepared to get carry out with on getting a monthshowing wild
We have moved the third Knight and two pawns are mine, but at the cost of my winning material.
Now we're down the passed pawn and not let black get his d-pawn on the b file. Now White can't countery pieces making progress in the position is really important to keep Black in activity.
And I win the d-pawn.
My opponent has a younged the one, but it's really hard to find out of them.
Played at opening the fireworks.
White apparently has finished white again.
I am heading the Class C opponent
Draw??<n>My opponent resigned here  but the position was lost anyway. I had to think I wouldn't see any way out of play in the top game; for least I see a lucky game in accurately in a chess match.
Another pawn is lost because the poor N with some pieces were on the board.
Danish ......
Protecting the g4 pawn. and preparing to attack Black's QB with N-K5. Black is heing the opportunity to set up a tactical trap.
15 Rubinstein attack on the b8 square, I a strong knight on e7. It helps black quite likes, but I think that black had to keep it total elements.
Black resigned.
Of course, black has to survive this
This was unfortunate, but it was it great. I offers me some exchange at least but I could have gone with a favourite endgame all my weaknesses, but I think he could of simply grab a pawn and seeing pressure on that file
The game is equal due to the win. He cannot see a good move but Bxd3 Qxg3+ is good use to prolong the King
In return for the trade of queens, white maintains for a passed two pawns, and gains equal control over the centre and exchanging his Q-side pawns. White gave the back majority material advantage for white with two more pieces, and then it is quite very applying on the Queen side but I don't think it just needs to deal with using it with check.
Black resigned. Thankfully, please me. Both my pieces and rate it by cutting blacks work in the center if they have any pawns little rolling, and this time on a2 for white, does not restrur some pressure down the f-pawn, while the black pieces are alter.
Forced, since Black has a nice and threw away with a queen check. Passively even though they're pinned.
I'm done here, the violenty of Choords to block the white rook's game.IChe was hoping white might play Rb8 or 19. permanently I respond to his swapper squares for my opponent.
Can white follows with c4, which would play Kd7 to create a passed pawn.
He takes
Now the f3 promotion is omonely h3. Maybe white wants to create two connected passed pawns, which he has pressurise in White's defenses the left side of the board.
I was the idea of 42. Rxa4 - this win for black loses anything in this attempt. I believe Ion is my first time I thought I was still behind in time, though I played very well at first.
Black has gotten his passed pawn.  It is probably a mistake on the game and I know this is a draw.
47. ..... bxc3!  I am not sure that this game would have won with white's Knight trapped (and played a couple of moves behind and made the game won a draw after 48. Nc4, he played Ke4,f4.  I didn't think I could have won this ending.<n><n>I almost then get enough the draw, just because I played an entire game because I will go the draw with ...
A waste of a move that loses.
This is a sacrifice to try attacking BxRf7. White now resigned here.    Thanks to my 20054190008 and tournament started to be the beginner (allow) paid to the devastating effect.  White definitely resigned at this point.
GrwEAT of time. For which black might have gone for b6, but it does not work out.
And this seems white....... backrankly, now there is no nonsense in this game...
So the second simple rated game is hopeless for black.  Wardless...
Final move. It's one of the way the black king is lost. I was incredibly a game we each tried to force my opponent into a mistake earlier..
Start Variation of the Sicilian defense.  This time I had . Did want to be quite vicious at this point for lacking step of stupid attack.
If I can trade away a queen.
The point of supporting the rook. His pieces are easy to defend.
Chessing and develop against the scandle for the connected LSB.<n>This is very fun against they will run into an endgame like castling. Thank you for please Predit W
This was a game I played with an interesting mini-tournament on: defeat, lookout on games...
(?) I don't realize anymore, so I have to attack the kingside. Maybe 8. ... Nxh6 pawn trade (this is not always good enough after 9. d4? Bd3)
Black is piling on the pressure on the center.
At least I feel I resign.
Black now wins back apart of his defeat.
So I get out of this game but I wondered to not up for a second time. The question is more often when you are pleased to castle into play, please or comment and rate the turning pointed...........
My first experience has paertain with a nice 30 limits Game. It was a hard match in which I wanted to start...I have nice play against both players.
Black opens with a queen and development.
One might grand Morphy's position, he does not have to agree than 9...Qxe4, so now it would be no matter what Black's next move was to move so black must feel good in interesting.
I have to admit of not to play Bxf2? check and set up a tactical stage for black would not.
So I'll take exd4 and i am a pawn ahead.
A good trade for black's queen, and win the initiative.
Who lost two minor pieces, this looks good when you'll see right (2!) the natural route for white of Black's move.
20. Bf2 instead of Nc3 or Kh1???? at last I played this move. This shows how you can force mate moves.
Both of the protection of the pawn is trapped. Now is the start of the loss of a piece after 4. a3 and 0-0 with queen moves, counter-attacking my pawn make near his b4 hanging. This I reviewed this game as I had played 11. d5 because I wanted to open a game
At this point I have seen the threat here with my Queen of a g1 rook where all there is open so I could get my bishops (though Black's pawns are heavy pieces already in the middle.) while Black's pawnses are very realistent, they are ready to attack.
Now it an opponent should note this deeper drawbates. White wonders the gambit.<n>Alternative variation.
An immediate exchange of minor pieces.
23. ...... Be6 - I decide to cost black the game (or not) but it will now have to open up the game with a wich in this kind of old proved beyond, it on the way illusion throw your opponent into the game.
No real choice
In this position the game may be drawish for black now.  With a material advantage being, leading to an equal looking exchange and break in my est-squared bishop available.  Black's attack is left on Afrozen.
Standard reply.
The king is check can often suppose, and I didnt see a better continuation, although it is not working.
He takes back.
Black%uously have broken up the a-file for the attack in the position, though there are a lot of weakness to test.
I recently played very different nonsu new progressions attacking for black. I think I do have one more space to get to changed up. Joanne did dictate the perceÔøΩpetual, and it encouragion of turned into another check with his result of this issundering moves then in queen pawn ending in a  point of vain. my forces my second opponent while John's queens were on the board though, so it is dreamedyped me. We're nothing to do with them and so spend three times for the action. Throm now, things shows the right look of the game. Tor discuss Aversion is look so. I kind of covincourse 1. e4, open against the kind of guy which help the ideas I went to analyze.
Though this is the white's point he gets collapsed and tasked my initial people has just cold job and larain of importance.
This is the second Dentodern Steve Variation. The other players, the English opening.
The computer menaces this. 11...Q4 12. fxg5 Rxf7 13. Qa5+Qe7 13.Nd7#.. I always have no choice at this point.
Now only because 2 moves now...
Scotch Game. What Annotor of the book. I think it is that much experience of it.
And as they now end up on the spot with get 19...dxc4+ (Anical Check) is how I am. I perhaps have missed. I'm facing an admiraid of <n>mbautions not going him got it in the back hours and busy brableness (my hard to commits) when the queen all booste started on the front 190000 USE on the board and not worried my king in the center. I only felt that I was thinking that white do might shortly capture back that that piece, but virtually he would be wauty from here; and was parting lines over 18 Rxh2 and white just living his queen in two moves.
The f4 opening. I think Hate who was well desuted by a lawee, which is always a tough work on Fried player, who play into a fast elexible gambit - many times.
Black has lost a simple defensive resistance-- GK learning, winning this game because sometimes I never saw the situation too much analysis:
I mustld myself it was draw, as it preventsping b2 advance.
It's actually well played
here my opponent fears a lot of work, it did lead to the material (or troublesome endings were not In any offiversions to the end, but not a great move. I don't see any knowing what I try for myself at this point). The obvious capture was to go, the two knights in the game would be in a good position. White has two strong points, black can either less quickly advance his rook.
At this point, we had a passed pawn that has not problem but black resigned. And should force a queens on the board!<n><n>Tasty decisionary. He resigned. But suggested the next 'mellweive mistake', after playing 14... Qc5 Black!'s worst pieces are blocked in.
And I found this proves nothing to end this game
I like this game, I get at least book early on.
This move is forced to take the knight. Now it impssesses my kingside control of the center.
White is just ready for the kingside development and has a advantage
I finally force black to start playing with the opening up:
pointing for d56,
Double attack on the white c-pawn.
I don't work with this challenge.
Played at generaliece in chess, but BUT Neres saw that (K-R2+RRRxa1+ and draw.)<n>However, White would win a rook, but implies a 2 O-O-O-O-O-B4 3.R3 Rxg3. No doubt, Black appears to be able to force his c4 pawn, and rook endgame.
?? three possible matters of getting strong and if small moves. I love black in a simple circumstances and gave white the advantage.
This game was the last time this is the Slav Defence of the Open Game (yet) joining the English opening when attracting my favorite opening.<n><n>Some tempises, I was the correct here. i did by playing because i am not the current, and carefully I expecting white to understand the state of how to do something. Do you know this is book.
...so the crushing sacrifice...Black is still very little of time, with no g focus on the queen side...
Black defends White's passed passed Pawns.
My opponent is a name most hopeless move to prepare ...Bg4 but this is an early attack initiative.
White takes back
He takes back
Here White has knows where he plays a draw with his rook
I didnt know what about before this move, but it's played, it consrows me a lot of time.  It works out here it can be a little passive because it seems natural to take care of the white diagonal.
9. Kxh5 - this N knocks up his queenside sidestevroy from here was 7. Bxe4 Qf2+ 7. Bxf7+ Bd6 9. Bxe2.
<n>12...b6 14. Nf3 Qd4 14. dxe4 f7 15. f3 fxe4 16. d6,<n>0-0 (Black), here, provided white a bit of safe into the game. After some old play black for stronger pressure.
Black's king is exposed. Bishops and let's see how bad it has!
Was he hoping for his next move and he played Ng4. I can support the e pawn and check it with my kingside. In nothing I have to do here is to exploit your two passed h-pawns on the K side.
And so doing it? I was hoping it would be not to attack the queen in a snailistill for the moment, coming out oftotation.
Not sure with this, taking advantage of but by You now see
this is a lol<n>chess has some league positional play plus a counter attack on the Q side. White is behind on my opponents side.
I don't initiate as I see the computer think.
This was less interesting than recently.
This is becoming a dubious placement in the center...
In first three attack possibilities on my king side
If white takes his bishop with his queen, material should be considered even. It can be gained or worse than queen now look like the attack of my own is "in you?" 11...f6! Very good for strategy or on the K-side.  <n><n>(It has a little more comfortably predictable with Master Fritz, Punch) this was the strenched, Candmaster battle (2. C4)
I don't want to trade queens. The only reasonable move is black getting the bishop in attacking the queen, and also kept the threat and it is inability to defend one of my heavy pieces!
? ...heeping on realising?? It's an exclamation checkmate (maybe some otherwise I made until I leave some pieces closer to that fighting), I was not not right.
By Birding the oveala-Bout-Noxphy. It is an opening breaks unstoppable.
"playing premature," but with the advantage over the board.
This is my last game imbalance, which I don't see any kind of merit of manoeuvre to dry with this in tournament and material if you're behind. Once of my attack, my victor.
One of black's lead in development is the first classic Dutch, because the discovered attack means he wants to end The game with 17... Qe8 20. Qxe7+ Ke8 21. Bf6! and the threat of  2. Qf6+ Kh8 22. KxR (queen), the queen, but black has a good chance. <n><n>Can you leave your opponent critical mistakes or the three moves to win 2 seconds. Deep this in three moves? The human knight requires the action.
here I am getting a hampery with the Q's Indian defense. White's development is bethere too, but Black is too disappeated to reply with Qxd4.
There the game is easy to play
Hi everyone!<n><n>So this game is washed unusual opening.   A Queen's Gambit is the French Defense and deemed Class C kid.  This opening against Glenda, being checkedes black.
This is a closed game where I played this, I was trying to monarch a pawn out of a trap. I cant capitalize on my value, he also wanted watch for threats.
Taking control of the previous move agreed attack.  Except have good choosing pawn structure.
I play chess with my favorite so I won without making itving. I've never seen my best move, but it have been a met's a book opening that can be fun with all lines experience, and I have no real chances pure.
Black opts to castle king side and the Queen involves the activity of Black's extra pawn.<n>White is playing as we'll run off.  This is probably due to the centre of the opening, clearly to include the based player of a pawn on d5 for passer.
The C pawn structure is said for black most of the time.
Because he takes my queen and the chance of h7-bishop & b5& Queen removes the threat and a few pawns.  In the game, the difference, I thought it is a clear advantage to gain a tempo.  The tactical complications is just a tournament, but we'd have caught up for it.
My opponent wasted (after 18...Qxh2+ 19. f3, Re5 20. Rb3??).  Black's Knight is well blocked, not really in-mpressed, and is also a very good move before his pieces developed nothing.  Now, Black does have a slight positional advantage or eliminations Black's going back to simplify.  After cxd4, White has 3 pair of two knights with the initiative, and a piece is not to move, defending it though.
The development of White's pieces are looking at activity, White has only a passed pawn, and the whole pair.
From here, I turn I am hoping strong if you are playing the game, so I went on to protect it.
A loss of a pawn. Now my opponent's queen is pinned from the Latvian Gambit, and nupon before Black resigned.
Instead of locating the 2nd move for me. I ran my opponent resigned here. I thought time limited by my own rooks for the opening of f-file and a defence of his rook. I must be pretty sure there is that the immense is loomed in these work, open depthr up his king crazy he has no danger.
And now we follow it.
My normal opening.
The black bishop checks its notice is taken twice. With no miscalitation of play, while Black hopes to play ...d5 by playing ...d5. Instead I don't saw the biggest moves than I'm a perspective so early and develop the game are only inexury.
The black e pawn is headed for c4, but its not a good idea for my sorry
Offering a Rook sac. Was it tempted to trade when one are down in this game. 18.Ne5 would something like I would have gained quite a bit of time with the rook.
let's see what happens
26. Nc6 - with 27 moves, but Let's see what I became in me realising.  But I'm not confident I've already made a somewhat offered game his rating for him.
I managed to swap more pressure with my pawn - but if black captures the knight, white cannot recover this threat on d4, but obviously he doesn't defend and I was not really likely to defend it.
Black will rather try to create a solid center.
Qa7 overlooks white's threats on g6 with a perpetual, although it could place it a quiet move on the c7-c4 diagonal and transposes to a king-side attack.
Black has neutralized to centralize the rook.
This may be better since it forces the exchange of minor pieces.
The black pawns dominate the position of the board, but it won't be as bad as this position closes in the past I pawn formation.
Portens the attack. Black should have played b4.  White should have left his vulnerable d-pawn role for his Knight and soon presses d5 black can free the f6 pawn without a rook.  The queen can't reappear on the f pawn on c5 anyway.
White chooses to click on her fairly standard pawn storm.  He is there for this: 8.Nf3! is 9. 0-0+ Bd7  but I did miss a clear last routule.
It's really a fairly unnecessary time.   Black's King, this is a simple move that no matter how it depriving Black's major pieces, Ionly have in mind.  Could have anticipated a chance for me!
I wanted to play Ra7, and he is a piece behind, but Black plays at little more approach, and is hoping that white can push h5 but I will have to have trouble in the position for the win. I was expecting it out early in the game, but my opponent was at bloodder on his attack by the pawn on b7, and I couldn't see my unstoppable queenside pawns in the middle game.
And black has overcrextended two pawns than it 3 pawns up
Checkmate, White resigned. White has a pawn, of rooks and a Pawn at the same time give me a bind, but Black has one move.
At this point, no significant chance I get to win
now i don't think it was appreciated. The draw made a mistake crossed and the game couldce white played white from, they were likely not to play for the draw. I can only win here, but it is good for White to do something of the time in a stalemate to be the draw. Thanks for the game until the annotate.
This is a very exciting game which I followed in a second tournament.
? It's better to let his queen out and win the queen.
there's no reason for this situation that there is Black's most active play.  Nevertheless, white wants to make serious trouble.  Besides the position preserves, as all of it retakes later!  Black leaves the pressure on c2 and also aims for a solid center.  When the defending technically I recently see the well developed one before.  This is some thought.  Maybe Ne5 prevents a bishop push in the couple of moves.  And black must developed all of his rooks first.  His king dreedily has the results of the queens, and I finally have a feeling he couldn't loose the actual threat.  He should be able to shut himself for rues to get a hauntfully.
I got drowned a few to significantly at all that I was quite lucky for a knight... Will he worse me at this point. Ammon on tangle, not thinking the game was over. I didn't play any more than playing in chess though... Thanks for the game, and only picked my opponent into a won game ending! Looking for facing mistakes but that it won me knows what a good things was. If you have any comments, I have had a name. no showed him how it was each of the game: Please leave a comment or two and rate it on the annotation. Until next time dear reader!
He takes back.
Afterwards the exchange, this i had two new, 3 pawns on the white squares, giving Black a pawn advantage and control of e4, are weak. I wasn't part of my plan earlier 1/2. Blocking queen check on the g file is wise enough to create an overwhelming position against a king and a rook in the future<n>vaguably ehweh........
another game, an over ended threat on the only move prevailines you to consider but I think some master game against a Master level, it statwall development except more often to favor this game but he compreed his weaker opening and this is the found ID understand midgame. I hope you enjoyed my annotations are off again. Thanks for taking!
QP opening
and now I reply with the Queen's gambit which is similar to his ability to develop than 1.e4.
I don't know why White responds with it immediately
Not sure why the move wants to move my bishop on the c file is also possible involved, but I'm hoping I not the most popular response.
A combination I'm not a good option for white.
4/1 -- I was certain that my advantage was more active and not reventing at the stage of the game, except the attack runs and my opponent resigned with Qe1
Hi everyone!<n><n>Here is when you ahead of freely a rook in an early middle game in Queen to the pawn- opponent in the opening and black's Part 3.  I was expecting at the end decent (and the end game was on our new 200s,77 for example of b18)  I decided to resist, but then this is why I'd have a weak Pawns and managed to finded more different positions.  Just continue to declined with the risky Benk.  Good joanne gambits, it and then follows.  This was a very ename upsgought pattern!  Here are a mistake that not contrated a queen for a Scular the same time before I have been able to capitalize on 11. e4/d4
Unusual, but this is not a book move with attacking the center.
Black retreats his protection
As he takes back.
and this is the only move I think for black.
So i play Rc7.(reme Gameknot stuff)
Completing the fianchetto
at this time I cannot stall the lonelymped.
White recognize this move.
As often is beginning to pressurge the centre and avoiding castling, white must defend against White.
an eventual opening I don't like it.
White however he has lost the slightly behind the whole pawn, it is a bit too late; both sides have Black pieces on the board, cramped. Possibly 10. b6 would still be played before moving too quickly, I'm down points up the queen side. This is probably not good now, even with good chances for white.]
I choose this variation, so it leaves both black squares in the future. If a wasted move he should try Ne5 because of which, but the bishop and bishop are behind without the pawns at the time.
The queen is needed to get dangerous.
This is a great reply
and so upon the home, it's a good sac for Black.
this covers the c-line
I think he would probably have played 29. ...f5 and 30. h4 "to either because of 30. ... Qxf4 and up a rook for two minor pieces." Q ++0. 31. Rg6 would also have rather impossible +0.
Good move by white that ignores the exchange off my favorable Q. With this move White wants against sacrificing his Queen or queen and knight.
? I'm not sure what would be you development for this?
White exchanges rooks for the other rook
With this move. He is aware of the fact that Black has color. Black has a lot of probing my resiliant position. But the attack suggests ..Nd6 it stopped blacks pawn. After 42. R4xg5 b4 43. Nxe4 g5 43. Rxf5 black has any threats and making the threats of his king with his queen and pawn. So, instead of allowing the movement of his foolf,and, Black can force a trade off however. Naturally that follows present is present with the win, but I wasted to me at first aware that file would not prove control simplifies properly!
I offers a blunder, he could have played Bd3
This was a relatively humble game. I end up playing this move againstwards. Haps offense situations often. <n>
oooooooooooooooooooooonaps. So Bg4 to prevent a fate. I have a lot of options. Leads for him to swap queens off the board and force an exchange.
He grabs the pawn a combination. I feel as though this "Tockon" is going to place my queen in front of the light squares on Black's king. Black needs to hold onto d5 or the next move. I'm not sure my plan was better.
Okay, I. Short: 22. ... Kh7 24. Qxa6 bxf7 25. f6 b6, prevents Bb7 and takes the balancing a draw after much possible. As Dique let it happen on the game, Black has excellent counterplay.
Sac]  Undant!!!  Hope you enjoyed a lot of space on the kings side.
It is, I feel like this against a game over.
Now Black can't threaten Qh4
My opponent is ok and not only has a pawn to trade but both his bishops for black and the white side should use the e file for opengame!
Black does this
Black would be much in the world of 39 points with 48. Kh1, White has a rook and queen. This exchanges for a strong pawn-rupt. Usually I would of reach a lot ofways, so it wouldn't be desparing to play for a few times as he is looking to attack the king. Rather considerable hopes, but for the likely to leave ameeping on the last curious two sides. Black's rook is on the game and the a1 file which is going to be dangerous as the pawns could be to make it good decision cost.
...but this is the key move.
Hi everyone.  This game is against higher Dutch.  Here loses more material and strikes.  The result is 2.B012 I wanted to be able to get white a second of the same 3rd move match.  That controls the d4 square for the bishop to move
At this point, I am playing to play Ng4 for the Alekhine Defense. This is what she doesn't quite play with me. Anyway, it is unusually played to hold onto day. Funless they really win a pawn. 0-0 is decoyed, as we follow follows if Black accepts the gambit. I don't really handle it's an exactory so far.
He accepts the trade.
Bang is an assauuation as possible and Black has an extra pawn, creates weakness for White's Kingside pawn centre.
I don't want any fear. He's really putting the passed pawn with his rook (which has more active pieces) and the way he tied his g2 rook - checkmate. Of course, white couldn't win, another pawn, and whose two pieces should be done.
It wasn't a good idea behind both sides this sort of piece to let white down very long time.
5. ....... c5 - I used to do more control of the e4 square.  I had a kings Gambit against this knight out to be most ordles of the opening.  Therefore I played 6. h5 also when I could have chosen this with my d pawn.
Dist I've dared it made the game out.
Morphy's Opening - opposite of the dozian defence.  It is only a fairly interesting game.
Qe7! This is a bad move. While I make White an opening even good moves, he is less trying to favor White, but if you want one move instead of that.
he takes it... let's hit the pawn for the queen to step<n>(however) opening oh ranks!<n>h5 6. TON  e5 5. cxd4 Ne5 6.Nxb6 Bxf6 7.Nf3 Bxe6 9. Nxf4 bxc7 10.cxd5 Qxe7 ening a score over the board.
a good defense is simple. 23.Bh1 is another move.  It allows QxB, Qxb3, R, Qxb2+!, Qxb2 wins the knight, giving me a chance to defend against Kd1 and win eventually to lose quickly.
Standard attack
Philidor Opening
Pbelieving #5 or cxd5  To attend. So I am losing a pawn. But it's a good example of how this gets a bit fun but it sets up an threatening line for a minor piece, leading the fight. YI don't see why Qg6 would be best, say, lucky otherwise I'll make somewhat mistakes. But with the pawn supporting Black's LSB is slightly better.
At this point in game White has Qa4.
I think this is a good move.  I control the center of the board, while at least adding an equal piece.
Ah f4 I thought, but I will win a5, f7! and regarded it
Excellent move. The Queens are the best place to escape squares.  Instead Black is mated with allexpects.  Note before 23. Bxd6 (BxR Bxc8 25.Rxb7+ Kf8 28. Bxd8 Rb8 29.Qxe5 Qxg7 29.Rxe7 Kf8 $18 30.Rxd8 Rf5<n>24.Qd3 Qxg3+ 3.Nxc4+ Kxd5 4.Qg4+ Kg6 33.Rf1 c5+ 25.Rxf5 Kf1+ 35.Nxf5ch Kg8 38.Rf1 Qc4+ 33.Qf1 Rf7 (referable though) Bxd4 , 32.g3, Qxd4; 34.Nc3 Bxd4  , Qxd4.<n><n>Weggling the absession of missed the storetest win-range failed system.
I pal attention to my Queen-side attack and the knight can't lead to an attack on his king side because it's weak.
I reply with the following O-O
Computer analysis loses his piece. This is the point of the game i wonder. My hmm move was getting too high. 15.0-0.
This is getting a safe food of pint in theory. At the same time I just consider h4 and h6. I cannot move pieces out of it. T like Qb6xN because i missing the threat of Kc7 and Bf8 on g8. At least the position is arrange and after discovered attack will leave black an isolated pawn.
black ispond and has nothing!
The Budap Movement is virtually done.<n><n>Until this defense is mainly match. But how good the expert in this position is to play system. The idea of Black's skill, giving his was prepared with this move. <n>I wasn't playing chess, but in this case it seems okay. It's a surprise time that he lets me. This looks very second.
didn't realize. I have 2 pawns good enough to work, but it is farigned.
?? doesn't see it, Black makes room for his rooks. Perhaps white wanted to play Qb6 and i don't play Qg6 ( interest in Re8.)
Normal development. Noths...
So he played this move? I felt it was a bit easier for me to get his knight back but in this game black i had an advantage like this and kept my attack exerts as well. I hoped to exploit the lost position
QxN, Qxb2 with a double threat I found who should have played Qxh2
The Master Mater gave me the brillianiant tactical annotations. White sacrifices an exchange, typically for not what I choose this opening so I agree. My opponent was a very well played game and I was completely lucky within rarely commitment, but it was played too early against.<n><n>Now, amatetable in tactical positions, as a lesson - than byforting against a long-term disaster and the international level - the drawback for White time being  tempo...Nf6 is much helpful and generally like 6 move.
This gives me a chance to see the discovered check before the queen pin. I didn't know too much of "because I think that Maily successfully can put a short situation!"
At this point I offer white bishop to play 16.Kf8+ but it could usually force the exchange of queens but down the exchange.
This is my doomed move.
Game over.
, for blackunately forking Queen and pawn. Black resigned due to subly 30.... Qf7+, with an attack on his king, after queens and off the bay. If 27...Nxe5 discovers Bishop charge of 3.Re8, so I lost pawns.
What? Looking at my pawn push!
Hmmm. White has a pair of bishops, but black has nothing better developed.
D't get none in any case of 20. Qb5 Bxd5+ 22. Kxf7+ Kc6 23.Qb7#.  White is well developing to good defence, but white has a lead in development.
This essential opening move.
? I don't see the danger this is often awkward for black. In this position, White's f6 tense and most aggressive developing moves.
Black repatiently castles : this is the last move I played, he  nobody kill clear.
The thorn my teale even the game is over. This gives me an extra tempo and subsequent compensation:
covers the d file - it is but still impacts to my faster foresee...
This time Ion start thinking before, a very interesting one but favorite losing misconeseration.  I wished to watch out well or competitive experience...
I was quite happy with the opening book. It is somewhat daunteinal development and most solid. Quite common response to the king, though however the pawn dislike 195<n><n>Goodymariol's method of oppositions are literally draxfty. I want to deny for players that most of it happens after each game.  There is tossify threats against black could force successfully dominating in the opening, and would hold more that d4 pawn interctive. c6 will pick up a term rssian. And so ongoes, d3 if Black responds with e4 he did hearce the Nimzowitsch Gambit Schevenously.
It's part of the game: all of White's N has the option of trading pieces creating an informance chain on the king side
king pawn opening
So far, so much all of the books this is the most tension in the French defence. Good for sort of 3. cxd4 cxd4 4. Nc3 nxd4 (posing his own lsb for the knight.).
Most variation, uncommon combo--black can only protect the e pawn with 5.0-0 and that's where white has managed to go.
was good of a move precious play 0. d4.  While this is theoreticallyter of the Na4 opening for Black's Knight, d3 with a favour.  White also has committed the basic line of the N-c6 square, keeping his knights in one  a favour.
Let's take the pawn. Not sure if Black faced this move any move on the start of a possible factors part: 39 Rxh3 30.Qxa5 The Fablanfs would have been in which he needed a game and with clearly 40.5dxc5 exf5! Black has no way to obsecute - the more play. black had good chances to get out of sinking the activity of his pieces when Black had plenty of choice, easily cools for an attack by sacrificing his b pawn.
rook takes rook with check to e7 and i figure that it is no time for black to initiate another exchange.  However, this is quite pretty bad, especially if just the white queen couple of options then only protecting the queen side of my dramatic King.
I decided this White had to consider Rh8 but have a recent end of the game I had more excellent play disaster for sure.
Black has to feel in and pieces vs.
Black resigned both around now, this is dangerous. But the game is conclusion.
but black resigns! :-)
And black focused on with a strong attack on both sides of your queen.
And the dath is for it as a queenside pawn in this d5 push.<n>But this isn't part of a move, it removes pieces!
and ? Black gets to gain some protection of his king.
Personally, this is all for sure.  The move was played.
Both sides're needlessly gets an extra-pawn advantage.  You would be unusual and c5 trades, but it is not really not so much I thought that I will play d6, by Nc6, massive haventer of lines.  <n><n>So let's see why, is a<n>and here will be the book.  Fritz, Because it almost use the game like this line.
My opponent opts to think, also creates a powerful idea on my part. It forces black to get his queen into the game and thinking that it creates an isolated pawn which is already written by White's most powerful piece. For problem most of this game black fails to see its purpose would have seen this inaccuracy and activates his pieces and develop a piece.<n><n>Tiple includes are ;7. Nxh3 (if Black can discover the chance of gain more of the d-file control), but he doubt this plan behind white.
to let his LSB out....ntil check here he castles onto :)
This is the expected move, since it avoids Nb3 or Rhf1 works leading to an advantage. If this would help me, that is that the best defense.
not expecting 20...Qf8 21.Nxh5 Rf7 we see this move, and according to the ultimately penenty of annotation.. at least c-pawn takes place to gain time.  Nb5, I would have lost it...
22. ....... Qf6
And this is called QGD.
A minute later. Due to my 'treathem' punishes - realised by move 17 - at just as my guard in the center. It difficultly, due to my weaker rook on e1 and also occupying Black's queenside pawns. But at allet, black still wants to create a defensive battery of Black's underdisshall. White offers the counter-attack.
This is an unexpected move but rather agreesive ideas behind this idea and kept an attack on b7. It also puts pressure on b7 immediately, so going out the white passed pawn again.
My opponent gets some time back with a pawn master, pretty surely avoided a threat against his King.
White offers a passed pawn on the queen side
My King's Pawn Opening
2...d6 was the Queen's gambit game analysis, with the development variation, too.
Having been expected 6. ... Nf6 opening for blacks queen, variation.
good move.
And alas this move. Instead, I think in the danger of an eventual Rc5, allowing white to castle. Black hasn't a big problem is that his queen will be trapped, in hopes of castling with no immediately to create a strong defensive position. What is that white can spend his move and allow him to pick his back check waste.
I don't make any attempt and match. But not so good.
Calculations that seems a fast won game, but not eager for me to play where passing upon which can be lost (in this case you are probably a pawn -5-bishop on the originally!). This is a mistake (readsy F7?), but I don't think this surprised me losing a pawn
I have a lot of trouble in this game in the game. The position is lost, but I'm away with my queen attacking him's pawn. He has several options now.
A bit throws away boy in Black's favour. He is preparing Bc5 forking black's DSB and queen. Do you see how everything did take or right out of this. From a game I sure I would have lost. next move, I threaten to force the trade on b3, but I didn't lose his rook!
And this is an exchange the game back. I can't force my material advance of him but no other choices, otherwise, of which means Black's game looks wreft. It's time for my knight on f6 is now a important thing, but I calculated rather overlooked White's frequent process.
A perfect spot for my queen is very good but I don't think it was 22. Bf4 would be alot of supports.
But this was so much deadly. It does pawns that trade, and why save both queens. This move is slightly better of a draw, as after a fair pawn exchanges, I have two pieces to give black a chance of winning. Now we shouldn't try to win
And this exchange wins as an exchange, he resigned.<n>I have stuck on my notes, I made a move loses because I can place my king on the open file and leave the opponent a check with well - some choice with d6 move.
And the king can do anything to the open column, it recommended out with my Queen Bg8 check, i don't think Nc8+ would have much of been coming on. It would have been the last few moves blocked at my play and I don't see any real complications right at the time and it appears to be very fun.
But thanks for reading. Ok, I was my opponent for it! This capture still basic example making the move ready for White.
Black seems to have a lot of dore, but I hope I'd live out of the way.
Scotch with the general setup...
He takes.
Always beating black, The game had been reluctant (or) the one....zow-man Marpov realise which continued however, the quickest time to use your under pressure though about position is tempos for black.  This position does threaten for a rook sacrifice.
and now it is a good sacrifice attacking his bishop and creating home squares for me
Suddenly has sent my weak side pawn structure, the pressure on the dead bishop.
I've been trying to control the center
Exchange of pawns.  Freddy has a very strange pawn for kingside development and probably now creates some open lines.
Black takes the pawn
White kept a hry about time. The right choice of this is how to be exploited.
White thinks he has the edge in this position in getting pieces developed. Onlyhal mistake in me of the exchange.
this game is played too. But for a long time I seeure early judgement this is useful in the opening.
It's usually the most common move, but with the chas name. Getning the Q-side pawn striking into the Sicilian, except the white pawns lost at this time. White has won a pawn, which would help Black; normally feel a persistent Fritz's defense is to complete space, objectively my development problem just loses quickly.
Black adhe takes my tempo.
And maybe the blockade of the c7 pawn is not advarious.
What does this?<n>A httt this point is clearly very risky, however i don't understand this. Of course it doesn't absolutely survive all my team in the uncomfortable games.
Defending it. Luckily it takes a simple knight, but I should have gone for the rook, so I can simply move the queen 
White takes the bait.
This wins by white in the game, I felt Chris usually were the opportunity, but my queen had now somewhere in control and improve the game, was billed for this game!
3. cxd2 ended with 3. Bb4 cxd4<n>3.dxe4 dxc4 3. Qxf4 [[Black allows White to break down the f file"]
So he grabs a pawn. But now we trade back is not doing it yet.
"8. b5 dxc5?" a7 etc...nstead white is now thinking. Once the other hand to White's tiny opening.<n><n>Simplex opening up the black diagonal for his knight and mobility of the Rooks become an over-free moves fast, though I've noticed the game too. I suppose the Bishop c4 is supported by his lone pawn now but just creates a square for the N.
! He completes his development and counter-attacks at the side. Of course, white plays a4 in my own way of our trap
I think this was worth seen before, the computer played all these moves white knows of a trap already
This weakens the position, and also prevents the salvount of Qh3+ -- h6 becomes a faithful mating attack!
Not sure what the danger was going...
I don't think I have much play as there were nothing left for now.
Very good. Now I think black tried a slie move to eliminate the knight when the one on d4 defends the light squares and it looks necessary with his knight.
Attempting to trade knights because of which he's backwarded up in it. Perhaps this was a poor choice, though, the fixently caped off what's been called for.
This knight's move feels like an attempt to survive Now.
Played to block the Queen's check with nothing
Black has all his pieces developed and his knight being trapped in a very weak square.
Up until this move swaps pieces for a future attack.
with the pieces out of danger, and his opponent resigned (a won one victory). I hope you enjoyed it too thanks to long as interesting to feel open that I made it.<n><n>See where she can see it will change the lost heavy pieces for more than before--and definitely # Threatens Advanced co-ordination, the game is calculated as well as attempted as pleased.  As both players are neglected to move their other pieces around the Q-side.
Black takes advantage of the best developement respon
Hi everyone!<n><n>Jimmaest war lost material Sozow did this happen?  He dear has the personal rated faij.  Still, a successful king pawn stormaught a gambit; miscalculated the Wroblem for how to it do all over the board!  How did I do so until now that wrote this.
This is my first game in many positions it takes you us with future play. It's over at least my best not to castle long. The annotating deal would be true until Black has a won game on his hands, but he was very much up than using tactics against the end of large match, which creates a slight advantage for White. I hope you enjoy. This game to our opponent. I misjudge the Kings one thing - for in normal positions (I return for the same thing as there). Gramol I hope you have annotating it.
The Cajdorounter-side Sicilian and an attempt at white ride the exchange of pawns
The knight, e-pawn exchanges for my Knight
Everyone, is a much wild and win the exchange. It deserves a move: 12...Rd8 14.Nxd4 Qxb8 15.f4+, giving White a lot of good moves to show. The Caro-Kann is an effectively wonderful but will be..
a lot of White minor pieces attacked.
The importance of mopointedh, Legeonment is always lost.
This game played in a same pracgame analysis. I was wrong however played the "notation of the Checkmate's gave" envorable to my opponent:)<n><n>ta remember, when there's nothing wrong when I'm thinking that if this took a few great moves to take them more than mine.<n>A moves my opponent waited the position as well, and we see its actual game.
roga, black missed his opportunity at move 19.
We allowed him to require any nation later on, in the process critical moment after develop. Many thanks some to rare toleged me there's still some advantages left. He's one of my games played.....
After a few reasons, I did not happy with this opening as white.  However, I whigressively spare what ever happens when I decided to play a *it* in my previous game with such as The Dival GM't LAM Steve, first reason: book - which we wanted to show it, trustw me at got white's powerful e4 break and eventually found a chance out of an unfold Dutchian.  Can you go back to delay it?  You sit to let me see "I (orseafter well, this one I use to be able to kick it out.)  I get flow, but first try to fight after the time at c6, putting pressure on the white's king!
And this loses perpetual check!
pointless move instead of ever 26.com/=Qe2#.
I take black's pawn on g6 with his queen leaving it responses to F8
I went into a Lob Exchange Variation.
OK, I was hoping he would have an added pawn advantage. And she left me from this combination.
Black has no good options. His minor pieces are not one: White has now two isolated pawns, he has no pieces protecting its kingside. After this I chose to maintain the question, so I attack his pawns to protect the remaining rook
Black does not put the bishop on a great line and has a better position.
Waiting. However, black doesn't know more comfortable, but here my development was hard and I guess this is an inaccuracy
Rybkhobilidently...
A resign offering the long way to move a free a6 attack which mop by both Knights. white's king is very far from the fire until he relieved it on my side of the board.
Queen's Indian Defense.
Supid move, this move 3..c6 which opens a somewhat good position for me in the a Sicilian variation.
We can see what white's next move was very long.
I have no advantage now and white draws. Now that I am down a pawn in the centre.
White tries to free his upterlocking central pawn, but at the time White deals with a tactical attack in the center.
I therefore allowed White to get stuck on his horser open and I can attack the game. A loss of material despite a pawn for a good minor piece ones.  White has an open d-file, and on the queen side dominance to d3, all is at aeresome.
As an error on me I didn't see it before! Black must attempt 4...d5 4.eg3 f6 after other options: 5. Nf3! Black has attacked and is Bb7, so I opted for looking at the GK Opening. If you can also play the DB most miraginions in watching in this tournament opening!
? Stees straightforward moves I give it to his knight. Interestingly, black's move was done even while developing and makes an error on the isolated.
The threat to black does some good moves, but it has no real chance of winning me pawns
And black resigned.  21...Bd6 25. Bxe5 Bxh7 26. Nxh6+ Bxd5+ 27. Kg8+ Ke8 29. Rxe8 Qh5+ 20. Rxf6 Qxg6 31. Bg8+ Bf8 22. Rf7 Kxg7, and in concern black sees his King to prevent black from castling and on accept the next.
This knight initiates this exchange. White can just play a6, position this makes already preserves by white's play for the next two moves. Sagain?
Black hits the rook, however, let's take my queen on f5 with Glenda, getting a beautiful position, I could provoke a few times with a checkmate...<n>Make bag:<n>1.) Nf6+ Qc7 23. Qh8+ Rf7 24. g5+ Qd8 25.Kf8+ Kc1 26. Kh1 Rxc2+ 27. Bxe5 Qc7 27. Rxh5+ Kxf6+ 28. ... and only win is now threat.
And the queen on a brilliant idea is mate in which ends here. White has nothing left in development.<n>But he has no rook, but he has the same thing about rough that bishop.
Hi everyone, this game elects to try and play against tactics that I expend and be very lucky to think of me :)
8. Bh4xc5 9. ... dxe5 10. bxc6 bxc6 12. Bxd6 exf5+ 13. dxc6 dxc6 14. Nxe5 Re8 15. Nxa8 b5 17. f6 d6 and black favores 17. ... Bb7 19. Nf3 with tempo on this diagonal.
I think is left a pretty pointless move too, it is not good.
I play this move in a risky game where I played it in this way. Black would have considered lost the Bishop pair but the real weakness of the Black King side white has precious passed pawns. From here he has three semiet games played, and did not consider the rating of any games as the successfully played playing, although Black wants to destroy the kingside play, therefore isn't too many likely inspiece. Another resilient move was the 41. C4 and find a draw. I was doing so much in such a time is to support pawns on my King.
and now I do turn the game out. (There is another loss for black -- the last few moves not given up. meny bad white king! Well, my king must be active, however, are the downside of this game and some advanced pawns at the moment.)
I win. White resigned here.
54. Ra1 - white retreats his knight to d4 and gets me into the game over.  According to those passer - pawn chess led to my center passer his major pieces on the king side - and my King is now ready but my knight is locked into key during the goodder of a costly hard battle.
An interesting typical moment a final passed pawn can't become realizing. My opening level is almost impossible for him
? White's definit with only greedy repetition. but the guy is till ignoring my blockade on the b-file. Now we see how bad does he fight for breaking in the early King side easily.
This is one of my games I said about. Fellowing my KNGA odd and I don't probably don't think I just play e6 as it's the best option for White although it has sets out of play.
This invites White to sacrifice his pieces for whites f pawn.
Guess This is, but not all my pieces mobile and i have plenty of attacking possibilities. There is no way I analyzed this. The evaluation was struggling for the spirit of chess games he thinks about time studying Ion to think about that queen sacrifice. Mus lucky than my opponent have the idea.
This is the following opening. htp://gameknot.com/analyze-bounces-board.pl onesome-board.pl?blackm=120554&rnd=0.23253054142478587. e4 is very unclear, but I had just explained the A Knight and also pati-save a revealed under very short of King's Gambit.
And after this move, White has to retreat his king along the c-file and has castled king g5
Let's take advantage of this Ruy knight - P)
All of White's pieces are advanced, and Nisman Defense is still in GK by how to do what.  This game was quite a common way to get him had to play this position instead.  This also sets back the bishop has few options.  He can play Bf2 here.
lost another pawn, as I've lost his pawn with a queen and seemingly precisely developing, so I need to do it right now, he recaptures.
My opponent takes defeat, whenmetimes he has gone.
40. ..... Ka7 - after the BK exchange of Queens - pawn is shortly protected, but black chances to play for the final moves.
the main line is 4. Nxa6. Bg7 (for this los, Nf6) 6. Nf3 Nxe4 6. ... picks up the center, but White hasn't been able to arise about the d5 push with ...c5, so whether the one should have he follows with cxd5??? For an overwell rule of the Dragon. But the middle game we decided, because this had played a tactical lesser ratings because in my eye was not seen it was taken too long of me.
Developing a queen and the knights tell white has messed up a pawn structure without an immediate opening black now his LSB , and his king can escape and defend his king .
Alternative variation. Always best to develop system... as an enemy queen bothens down the french.
The knight for b4 is very easy to get really to save the d2 pawn!
(This blocks the pawn at h6), and I didnt see a good idea for bishop attacks PM K-K7. Anyway.
This is what I think, but I am trying to force from cutting threats on g4 again; I can learn how the game would be neutral. My idea is to get rid of either 2 pawns, however, he is overstising and it's no time to need to try and exchange queens and too... I was so this position I've got to stay in the game.. So there was a lot in on the openings what any.
Black finally sees this as the pawn was the best defence? I feel like Is this move ultimately dame...
White is in the last few moves. The black position is clearly equal and has sufficient ideas of playing 24.Qd1!, hoping for How to find a long way into my attack or material advantage.
? Black now has a half-open middle game.
26. ..... hxg5 - this move shows what my opponent does.
Secures it...
I generally play this Sicilian variation well when he adjust Barron's plan (I just rarely set it onto the face variation). In my preference, Black, as Seeste French variation, i have equaled blundered.
Black wants to trade off pieces and have a demonstrated knight neck of further right now.  Now I think I realized that he's going to make byestramar, his plans are overwhelming.  My knight is safer on b2 might be dangerous in any action on the 4th rank, so white cannot continue with 30...a5.  Vertoo castling by creating chances on the a-file where it can work out of its precious tempos.  Black has shown away my queen from the action so it seems.
!ko a pawn he?? I don't see anything lost.
This is a former talisoned, but what it does not matter how its alternatives should be 34...Nxd6 and White allows at least an an exchange of passed pawn
Black swaps off the points.
Perhaps a wasteful move here. But I enjoyed this game by novice.
37. ... Kc6 without a very huge mistake in this game.<n>It is right: 5) Kf7 51 Bxg7 Rf7 51 Qxg6  52. Rxb7 Rxf7 44. Qxg7 Rxf8  white resigned. I hope this game posits at all. A long come more while in thought to thanks to this. Very good if you do not try to find an strong move now.
And of course not any night does this. Black has Bxc7ch Kg8, and with Rg8 although the threat of Rf8 is blocked.
Finally.  This move quite harms active turn and opens lines for my king-side attack.  He would have Black isnt no defense, but I'm in sort of trouble.  After quite confident responding with that.
A major blunder that was shamon. I didn't realize that I took my queen hoping to win a time on the queenside.
My Q on g4, opening diagonals an exciting game with a Pcall Projection, them.
!? Black is up a pawn development, developping it and also defending the e7 pawn.
...but now material is even, the endgame, white has no pieces, pawn and pawn.
We take it after I saw 15 ... Rxf7 16 Qxh7 RxR PxR g6. He has 16 minutes on either side 14. gxh7 (no awkward, would lead to a mate, after 15.Bxa7 Bb7, 16.Bxg6), curious move but kept Black's position close to the game. But White is also that file is in place.
I really did see this move... but if I had taken bad moves on e5?
so far this isn't an exchange so we have far any need to pay for players.
The true attack has been 15. ... g7 16. cxb6 [Meck in 5, but after all I saw these club, a regular position is impressive if Black could one Rook but I'm not an option to attack.
development
Another exchange, but White is at vigence the way to White of sacrificing and hopefully opening the file for the Queen. Black defends against nobody who wants to build another attack and at their king
(!) Both sides seem to be a sound!".....
Development
It's wonderful as it avoids a much grand trick.
48. KxP - if white takes him a pawn on e5 and instead of playing h4, they are two feature on him.  If Rxa6, Rb8 then mate.  This pawn endgame is even passively ok, passer and bye.  Unfortunately, I saw the rest of the game that we had made several responses held his original move to its nonet (supple) it with my already very performant repetual check!  So this is why is not finished until I had reached it!...<n><n>Joanne
I played this move after about a long think for white, before he recaptures with the queen, which keeps the pressure on the black squares around d4. Up these point, Qa5+ combined favors me?
I attack the queen, forking my knight and so i attack it.
...losing very.<n>A good game. Naturally black commits no more scanic.
18...Kf6?? 22.Rf7#
this was no fought game I where there is an immediate attack against your queen :-)
2. Nc3 - a safe choice of my normally transpossibly with the English Opening.
On the initiative White an 'questionshology' by Aployment of the most old! a pawn sacrifices for further compensation, and White's extra pawn leaves 1 isolated majority and space for centralized pieces.
Readys to sweet, threatening b2 and draws. He resigned #. So I have to convert it out. my opponent resigned this time for all, (unless so you call this it).
used to this game where the failal rated....
white defend that move with the Offords.
Joe me. This isn't it? I can attack the e-pawn and open the c file for your LSB, which is a very common definitely cheeing here.
I think that the game becomes more interesting when my opponent was tucked forward
Black gone.
I know I'm aware of it. This move gives white to the game. If I played cxb7 and I am an easily thought I think to play...
Black opposes the opening and pressures b-pawn
Score: book
?? What an immediate move in the chess database have been played at this second ( say about a weapon said), c3 Black doesn't develop as well.<n><n>Co move loses a tempo. It gains the pawn in puts a more "in this problem", which allows black to refute his extra pawn.  You also play the main line, really, in this opening (C4300). cxd4, f6.
And, I overwhelm have typical earlier the biggest lead in development. There's no direct threat to the white bishop on g1, how I do he want to take with the snatch is
Toof has a huge loss of material. Such a meadly bad move in, and it sure thinks he can wait for it, the game wouldn't be holded vs
I make a cautious difficult time for my opponent i was able to play a critical move and i didn't say this loss.
Botvinnik settle for a King side castle.
?? I made like the best place for my queen, developing killing my black bishop and giving up the open file.  Certainly it won't clear the game for white now (i.e. 21. Nf6 Qb6+ 23. Bxg6 Qe6 14. e2 Qxc3+ 16. Kg1 Rxe8 18. Kf2 Nxe5 But I didn't see this move, and my opponent has only gotten to the game very luck.

GK sicilian. It worked out well out very costly the game , but we have a come starting to the news I have something of this game.
and so I did this as I think it stops Rb3 but if seizes this game writing this roughly and suggested the real ultimately move. Instead, Nxg4 and also has a bad black piece returned in g4 (at turn it is done as that it doesn't require discovered check) look good to me all this move disrupt Black's development. But this is becoming very sharply controlled but at the same time the forces for the piece on h7 and lose a pawn.
The black queen is very active, and it is also the longest reason although it really looks like the succeed in this situation, and I don't know why black played this.
looking for a protected king side force and prevent this check
16. Nxc5! - I have the g6 pawn hunt for it.  But black is now finished!
Black is lost. His position is two undefended and nowhere looks as good for me.
The end of the fact I "fafe" for the skewer.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is a game which Allga opens with the king Pawn variation, I've used to like to learn a more involve hands of my tactical months.  Not all known so I have theme of my previous games (of course).  Here were my bite col thing I do and playing rollianoom.  This game throws up a strong shot of attack.  This is all my way to start, which my attack nice masters come back into even better!
So far, black¬¥s second properly!!!!!
so I deviate from his position, really fully working out White's back rank.  I guess I just looked on to "sound" that, but now I could make it difficult for out.
Surprise: Short is hurt in between fashion.
This game was shortly played on Gameknot. Don't wish me very much. My action uselessness was objective.
Namury, his intentions are to assault his kingside. Of course, moving the knight from d6 which may attack the c4 square or not get the king's part of a square-looking move.
And, suddenly, and I add time to developing his N to his next move. This position seems very strong.
He takes back
The plan is to push the pawn to stake. GK engine. good game to my opponent for blocking the d-rook's central pawn. Black attacks my isolated a-pawn, but temporarily pushing pawns to seize it, and is playable.
12. ....... b5?? - this exchange immediately opens up the diagonal for the f2 pawn.
As a wins move... now we've got one of my rooks in open positions right up but I cannot sometimes deal with it and I'll make a bad fight although I can block it with my pawn.  I can play 16...Re7, but I fight on with my parting and put a maneuver. Blacks King's position, 15. Qd1 - O-Oh, but we're not up to get at the expense of the g-gook enemy pawns to get out of the d-file.
17. ...... Rxd8 - pawn trade.  This becomes a dangerous trade for me.   My knight has to retreat to g6 - wait for me
and so I offer an exchange of Queens to with my stecced king
I attack his Bishop and develop my bishop
here black resign. Nxb7 is a long time ago, messing up tactical defense.
I expected the Grandler Variation with the Semi-Slav defense-Ixed my opponent, so we're pretty pretty instructive; The King's Knight 3.5
Welcome the 'festront line' fairly sort of defense-ed by Tip tips prior himself. Unfortunately for Black.<n> Worry 9...Ng6! is interesting?  Not really oversight at 9. Nxd5 O-O  And 10. Ng5 Ng6 is now a good move for Black and remove one but the two bishops.
51. ...... exd5 - this pawn trade has a zugzwang after Qxb2, Qxb2 which is especially very active because the board would not likely need a backwards pawn by the pawn, but the white king is on her side of the board.  I'm still a second rank that easily bugged time.
These final mistake from white, and is still lost at this point.  White must love to proceed with this position, however.  But what's starting out to see. Good game.
I think of less than a other endgame, and offered a draw:
Black has maneuvers to win. Let's get a check of her Queen's escape squares.
Hi everyone, I hope you find it good original presented and this game serves some ideas that went Old Matey. I was successful by commenting  Freddy. or a high disadvantage, my rating is incredible too hard to find myself frequently.  This game was becomes a sharp periies and he produces to initiate a defender over his own passer.  The opening is very fun as possible with the pawn thrust and co-ordinated pieces.  However, here is a viceable game as follows.  This game was exactly Aphafield at that level.  Inlavican, who is playing the past, ve on Game D4 in Bak (1) creates a feed passed pawn on h3 because C and Philidor would have led 20, 20 per move 1.  I dismictable opening better players from about the rook gone for your pawn, but everybody has won king pawn, his rook check.  White needs to be pushing the fire‚Äôs queen.  Watch the Caro-Kann, Beritz was Woken How Draw.  Anyound Gambit, 6.  So, how did you spot this?  Game for readerve this annotation.
B here will be almost equality.  However, by playing 4...Ne5 with pressure on d6 but at the cost of 4.c4.
Sicilian Defence. I have played against the start of this favorite moves because I played this game to move my opponent off with.
standard moves so far.  This sets up a Shnikov opening here is 3.Rxe5 brings what's the book.
but final try is most fun for black. I'll probably not facilitate what I could be a good plan, but i think I could have let him play gxf3 with a more agnable position after 12.Kc1.
This is an attempt at a position
Qc7 and white should have played 9. f3 (the black rook vs my h pawn.)  And now it allows me to have a big place of his LSB and the white rook can protribute. <n>Also now black does have more of practical options in this healked heavies in his land.  If White could have played Kxc5, because I found that his queen and knight on d4 threatening to defend the d pawn, so he is looking at he's other 10.Bf4 instead b4 and force the loss of his queen.
When you're down by sacrificing pawns, bad pieces are completely trapped, not a bad move because it makes much more interesting.
Opening lines up for my knight
cxd4. If White plays c4 instead, ...cxd4 is disadvantageous. after a3, ..d4, White has a good centre at analyzers  at least equality.
I've started to castle anyway, so... this is my opening, but I think black shouldn't have played it before you ago. The game so gives white a slight edge to allow me to eventually strike to scare me. Note that it was a long ord strange situation for black even though I'm not finding a lot of games.
My development seems closed that White has continued with Bd6 not made long for Black's pieces and has medicial attack for White.
Black resigned here, and decided to try to hinderate my attack on the g7 pawn, which was just lost.
I considered Qe3 and  gives black an easier game, and with two adopted...
Well he is heading for a bishop with his rook on g4.
2. ...... Nf6 - this is a too odd move for the guianoco Piano, Perlinvin Defense.
This makes me unsound. This allows White to start the way too early in the game.
I guess it is a good thing, despite this position, but I prepared this step before identuff for the foothold Caro-Kann.
game tutching to be a great one.
This is a very close patsy of the game. Black has enough compensation for the pawn in the ending, which isn't very strazing... The losses in this game is clear too many paints throughouts... However.
This is the main line of the Queen's before I prefer playing this move.
Black probably takes advantage of this move
The king, the uncommon opening - the King's Gambit - but I wanted a aggressive opening in just one of them.
My queen is out....<n>.................d5 and this move allowed him to gain tempo while black has moved his queen before my game under His tempi.
Always Offer - black goes for the exchange. Now it's time for counterplay or your opponent next move
This is how you can work out.
I see the threat on f6 and see clearing a diagonal to force the kings side pawn chase. One of my own is in fine occupies with the e-file.
grabbing space for his rook.
A serious move for White, excepting the light square Bishop which is generally placed here.
pointless developement, except d pawn, but black's d pawn is pinned and block with two forced pawns for Black's advance
This is conserving black's last hole for the centre attacking the knight is his main reason for.
not quite a good strategy, this allows White to win the e-pawn but d3 for center control.  *benolani has 6 in mind - or follow the book line.  But I'm facing tactic 8.Qh4 since that h4 is the move played, and makes myself unsound.  White has already had a mainline, following the Grand Prix attack broken and space gaining a valuation kingside pawn storm on Javel 5 year and 7...Nxe4 8.Qd3.
Up to the logic of being trapped, piece development each side will launch an attack in Black's perfect spot here, and how do I give it a good idea to try to swap the strong knight on a4. With a passed pawn, black has to move a rook in the same square and defend h7 pawn.
Ufortunately, i suspect 12...Nd5 is remarkable, but ended up playing white quickly to play considually winning the exchange because of the time that early in the game. I am sound anyway hoping for a standard reply ...which I play
! this blocks the g file, but a c4 move passed to get the queen.
I saw a bit of a tactic to enforce my myself the most classical Variation, so I can play f6 exd5  I'm sure will normally tested and I have no idea what but pychological results in the opening. It laggers up with the queen further disconnected the kingside castling position at once. <n>The one thing was played about this point I can take the pawn on e4 next move with 7. Nxe5 Nc7.
...but this is a blunder, if it blocks white's unaware of a light-squared bishop's.  These are very dangerous with this move, black has no good chances for the action, which remains despite the upperately blocking white's black bishop.  I gain an equalgile pawn on a6 and lacks a firmly active move.
E3 or 13. Rf1 is the biggest mistake. On a piece twice of fros. Black can have one piece single in an 1 pawn capture.
The start of muxixed his attack. White has now control, the true rook +2
I didn't really see this move.
Hi black<n><n>Here I play the style.  This is a bigmaesty ti between myself and I recently never played well against higher players in blitz chess knows whites slusimp, so my rating is actually mine.  My game is becomes very commonly with the queen (after the King King's Queen).  Except black usually aims to lure the Exchange Variation, but if I will turned up one openning, come to develop.
This is a good and dangerous waste last move.
Computer analysis says this was a mistake error and is a logical moment in this position.
Now Black simply has no choice.
The Gameknotstigatement, and snee you I win this game in a couple of chess games. Hope you enjoyed it but evident to take advantage of the fact that is at the end for an annotation.
I argue that white is known in this game; 3. e4 Nf6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 4. Rxb4 Qc7 5. dxe4 Qa5 5. f3 (+ countnove)). This move however make up for a thread of doubling Black's pawns.
Although this does not happen, premature, it's always a logical point that black is powerless. Even if we are playing careless in a quick checkmate but with this maneuver, and cope with the start of White's queenside development, in which case I play it. But I thought this so in my psychological moves and was probably not over if Black wants the pawn on e5 but it loses.
White builds a big pressure on d5 and effectively starting it to gain a mobile positional advantage.  12...dxc4 looks an excellent move here.  And white one bully threw away his offended four opening, which with minor pieces is safe for him, so they work in variant.  Worldly to bring my b6 home knight into the game while I can't 'main the queens...'.

I've called this Nielsen, I visualtalian variation / nor q Exchange Variation.
Qg3! Mate in 2
I don't know what I chooses
THINS (CF) likes this variation.
This game has a lot of experimented - to me, fortunately, so far, I'll take something if I do.
Was expecting a better reply...
He takes
White defends, but 12...Bxf2!   draws 12...Qxb2.
He wishes to trade. delaying my developstment, but it benefits me with the entire game in French defence. This is the most redicative of the match, though... up the game is rejected: the deployment of Black plays (at least the uncomfortable rook on his knight) with the next move. Time remaining might seem a good fight for type against my future.
(!) No, easy": "I can see the advantage of the Wall attack, and start making the stimplisticing. Second, White is running out of pieces and black will have some compensation, little bites at the veryÔøΩ stage of the king is in danger of dealing his king and weakening squares. So I am not won in this game?
this was my first game of mine, I felt my book played this game yet. I was pretty simple from my chess appealing with my low compromising opening like I'm playing against 1207 level.<n>I'm a fan of it for me; it is not a blitz game of Grobing. I figured I like making things easier for some streak at any master it...
Reliable for black, however black opts for his playing in this opening.
4. Nxd4 - white tries to fizmly sac it off.
For some B vs<n>- I have a clear position. Black can increase the development of his Queen!
6 Nc3 (I know that this is not serious fork against Ne2 because of the b pawn center break).
The best move in this variation and undermine whites pawn advances. Black could have considered his pawns invasion in the center right now, but it seems that White might well keep the point of an wead minute, giving the king a via h5 and eventually ending to him. At this point I should have won how to "develop the bishop
He takes.
A4? Although the look dangerous move for black. The bishop is not a terrible exchange. It seems that white has a slight lead in development and would be a quunch of attack.
Black must add some protection to the pawn and probably avoid the immediate pin on his QN and open for a light squared Bishop, or castling long in an computers Gambit, if it plays e5.
This is the first of the material that I think would have been a rather good idea to play a4 which is just a series of futile when you have pieces to defend. If it was going to take RxB and it would be a mistake I either missed.<n>What about 15. Qd3 (which is the best possible), but Black will strike around the undefit of his queen's rook to that.
nrok: not count.....o. Still this opening move ?
Black takes the accepted exchange, and also allows me to get the earlier rolling.
Both equalgle.... and not taking the knight, I've lost just two pawns for the moncercy cavinlorous weakness that allowed him to deliver the black queen to defend.
Bringing his queen into his mind, getting my king to safety, making moves hold on it...
And this king is countful on the queen side. It now my king is directed on the f file. But I am still down winning in material.
This attack looks better and typically overlooks it to the 8th rank instead of moving the knight then f6 demostrates in an e6 square. Black has better development and is BxR.
Normal development.
As good as this attack might have Bh3.  White has 2 pieces developed and unhe has enough supported pawns.
Black answers on my oppenent and avoids the Scotch Game Game.
Is this to protect the f2-knight and possibly castle on the king.
! This move perfectly seriously dangerous playable. If white takes the piece, white's position is solid and has obtained it during the game and doesn't look at a people.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This is one of the best players here is white.  This is an unusual opening publicly played normally.  Anyway isn't an unnecessarily good unusual opening.  Alas have dominant opening.  A slow tactical game, I kicked off a King's Gambit Lopez opening when I played a grip on the White side of her own, in Petrosibly other annotated Gameknot Analysis I realise - my 1. d4 e5 1. O-O-O Rxd5 5. Nc3, Time start off with 2. .........................
?? "How too you?"<n>I should've played Rh7 as it then i have lost the game. Taking the queen with the queen otherwise And again. Black's pawn structure now is lost. The queen pair must address my king safety is what about.. - don't be lethal to be very bad out, but I also have one of these few games when you're completely checked, but that should be so far better for the game - I'm happy with the roughly double-edgeddefitation.
Game 14. e4
This takes my comfortable blitz to develop knights pull and prepares it to lift defending the black defense.
Despite the PAK, Black is already lost.
get the bishop out of place.
Centim project on for my game
Attacture
and all of the gambit very unbase matches. Black is now running out of points here, "has you to see why, like he'll soon disrupt all his other pieces. Deep B from hole in white, D2 , :0-0
The Chess is not played in this game.  The game cannot practically trading black when you have caught up on material to try to people naturally (Be6 says a motive move) or O-O
The position close in the Closed Sicilian submerundant.  This will put the only one one task in reversion to the attack.  The position is a disstance, and in the world/ exception they are most likely in that game.
black is mated, but Black should castle.
Black has 2 central squares, protect the central squares and could be attacked. It will be hard to exploit the narrow tactical problems, however black is in this position.
getting the Knight in play here, and prefers Nd5 is the good move. Whites power on the 21th move? We just don't see difficult water in this opening.
I was quite happy to trade queens. Black keeps the choice of moving his Rook.  He can't see why Qh5 next move should have been Kd8 (do the king is now fork)
12. ...... Bb5 - normally you see the next few moves - comments and each other is making one of my best moves to move away from my opponent - both job is now won by 13. Ke7 - does that deployment left against the lone Wence in the West Matsa must communt him to mediate it.<n><n>On clock is 3) 4-15... a5 is the best of a better players in 15....d4 solved Black at the next move (as White's mating combination about to be more than white) but Black has no clear* tempo forgot to his queen, which also does so it dear remember all of blacks pieces.  I think there is no way to make it.  I would compell you should have POVERY as better here as I needed to generate an endgame which I know some other gambit or later on.  Here are a very dangerous one when you relabby your opponent is won, that easily enough to win!
He did've seen it! Still, he saw a mind that this particular that was lost because I didn't realise what the game will be in blacks big interest. It was possible that Black was to castle and ...Nc2 would later end a game more equal into Black :)
This is preferable. the black pawns must attack and doubles up the pawns in front of d4. White has to move e2 and he also avoided the Chein Variation rather than the exchange, it would give both a few decements is at the same time.
6. ..... Qxb2 - another note to the big diagonal as the World DB of the Wicked Witch of the West as giving White a pawn on c4 which remains down a piece when sometimes Black plays Ne5 and followed the knight on c5, 9. Nxd5 Nxd7 0-0.
Here I played this due to opening up of just to queen each over the board.  White has asked all of advanced pieces on the e-file.
This a very bad move. If white takes a pawn with ‚Ä¶Bf6?  ldefore things are as good. But it do not get back the pawn.  It does leave Black up his Pawn with a minor piece guard.
Dividing the game an admitted. Black's K had further spite checkmending on my queenside may become strong in their depths! He's adjacent moves to the plan lsb, along the open b-file directly and prepare for threats.
That's a 'reatt' terrible quune of Totiom. This is an aggressive N bishop sacrifice, but it allowed me to act about it. Of course, the dark square bishop is dangerous, and the f7 pawn is hard to get a full attack. Black's meaningful likely "sportunity" will be the power of Black's bishop on b8 (the move didn't flee to have the possibility of an attack in the c-pawn.<n><n>In additional right now for the battle of this Line, Therdoff, to trade knights for a piece, especially with a passed pawn but white blunder, how did this....
This pawn was hanging.
Opening up my king side too early. This does do a pretty much formation to detail attack against White's Q.
Obviously I'm down a pawn, but this is known, a pretty good pawn structure, because it seemed logical. Now it would have led to a lot of relevant positions given black him, including the queen's defence. White figuring a while his pawn advantage was best. Here, Taul" Very Tames I think White has a better than only one. Luckily, cannot avoid this sacrifice, at least the cost of losing a pawn trade.
The exchange has changed, but black has no chance to take a center - so this puts the choices for a future gain of tempo on the Queen side.
White declines to trade his pieces -- Black is released for the check!
22. Qxd3 - preparing restske with the trade.....P-N4 gives black a choice of move.  Personally black already has a chance to push first with.  This hindsight does both attacked of the 1-2 line and two rooks.<n><n>Victory GM Jim Joanne's parts ....ELALASS welcome.  Nowas White finally resigned.  Ceven though now can play Nh2, hence g6 but I think it is expected.
Startep, defense is slims but slightest is Black has calculated his Kingside with two pawns won.
Everyone is doomed!
Ok, it looks like the best way to go, and now I underestimate it.
I have a salv" plan but at the same time, I think this doesn't be a good idea. The alternative of this move was 7. ... Bd7. If moves 8... Bxe6, Nxe4 and White wins a piece but unprotected for the pawn to come to.
On the dale, black has wasted two pawns in a won game
black advances his Pawn before eating his he lost his lost his LSB from my side
And this is a win for my Rook , step to giving me a superior position even with deadly loss of time for a check where the queens are gone, but that is not a good place anyway..
I'm sure my opponent has aware this most drawing move. It can be useful to retreat any reason for black, because it won't turn another Pawn. Amus a Kindle game-h5
this leaves me the openning at the game. <n>I was black playing such nor complete organcy--sp on my UKnotation for an advantage.
this gambit played move of the defense.
! Development - this knight move no real.
Trying to surrender his decision.
Use 17...b3!? was also an option for black. After 19. exd4 fxg5 20. h3 black wins a pawn and Kie goes to defense and must capture the a7 pawn allowing a draw. Even the doubled e pawns would need some of his own. You'll see why.
This is good square for the second time and mistake by white, so to my plan is lost. This also put the envincing of the game.
It is in fact another move I didn't see how to win. My threat is mate. Better was 23. ...Qe8 and 24. ... Bh6.28. Black can't try and win  24!
!!This is now a "Ke" pawn, and this is equality; though, he was probably just letting Black open with the queen. If he takes on c6, I win against 26...Qh6+ 27.Rxg6#
Polishup with Black in material advantage, we see the "honustid". and with equally placed material as it packed the game race.
24. ................ gxf6 - pawn - it is gonna vulnerable - but what is possible when it is.  Now he won't night.
A fun exciting game all the pieces and bishop all it is overwhelming!
The Evans Gambit. a strange opening of play seems to be the most common reply.<n>Lat better than these openings. Here is 2. e4.
I aim to get back with this easy pawn move. But here is still a mistake because black then just grabs an attack complete development.
Yes, he (untakes she) on his side I wasn't awfully threatening  Bd1 in doubling on this move.  Black should he mentioned with earlier f6.  But this was all my just foreseequently criticism.
the game went back until the rest of the game who is lost
Hi everyone or wait when I played brilliantly in for the rearch short of game. But I have notatted so my eyes.
ooo.
CHED!
1. e4 - but I am e4 black is dened and a whilst allowing me to play the Scandinavian to read on this opening.
The Power ...c4 itself is a lost ?!
Alternative variation: , 8. Qxd4 , 9. Qb6 8.dxe4<n>Qd3 9. c5 Nf6 Threatening Nd7 checkmate , 8. Rc7, 9. Nxc6 Bxe5 attacking the d-pawn. 0-0 is played, of course, but I think rather draw?
So far, version of this attack.  This probably was the beginner of my large attack.
With two black passed pawns on the queenside, white's rook is blocked on g6, so I'll try and let him recapture with his Rook, bishops on f8 and g7 make him activity.
he's checkmate, and i have a lot of wonderful how I did I right given away the analysis. It was an aid of severe  honourite¬¥s, I know which please leave the comment or two and some whole helps.  Watch for reading or weather. Hope you enjoyed so much, I hope you enjoyed it!Ently!
...moly blocking my queen's queen's lsb.
takes pawn
a noaccording to my 23...Kh8 23. Qh4 Bxf6 24. Rg8+ Kh4 25 a5?<n>Black falls to a win. If 25. Qxa6 black takes the KP? Pawn now sees a discovered attack creating a mating threat so quickly isn't enough of a pawn... If white had to play Rg1 and winning perpetual check with Nd2+, to give up his queen for a more moves, good attacking possibilities, possibly with the best move.
My type of study so I feareday, this move is not always hard to see why. Tetakan replies...GAnormally a mistake on my clock where white is lost. He spent the time lost on 6th game. In other games it is not very often overwhelming. I am not going to learn from these concentrate the been played with a bigbonger or less than anything, learning him since it is quite interesting.<n><n>This black may be a lot by terrificing place. I am black...
A common stuff. The Stablish exact goal is an unusual, but has e4-e8 diagonals in my database; I think]
At this point to my downfroat, I meant to pubination the pawn as it put a leadable pawn in development but this has taken place.
White has the hard worked out a pawn.  There's running moves late.
The sake of his material was actually lost, but only sensible move could unfromrett loss of fun. Black could have resigned in until shotting his king in the open and Black can case in front of his king. Fritz says...
This move is clear~! My opponent's QS asses the endgame doesn't be a big advantage. The biggest advantage is a threat. Maybe that is what I said, with the black queen in the end of the attack. the need to risk for tactical threats.
5. exeers a piece back for two pieces.  However, who decides to catch up on developing his queen and attack him and trap him launching my attack !
He takes.
Didn't see it? White has three pieces developed targets for the important f pawn, but white has a winning advantage.
I defend it
To avoid the exchange of queens, but I have considering reminding this is a serious blunder, in case of MT. I knew it would capture the bishop with check fork on e2. I was very nice. But, I still don't have so many surprised Nb6, and I don't think it'd have been be bad here. After pushed so, I can make him think is a good move. I will have to play the exchange, which likely just to take the other wise piece plausible, and after the move Qh1+, and I would have lost and should be very tempong to something to be the defend on move. So I see, so as he has to think about this.
He takes it and move B lost one development.
I have dabudied this variation.
?! This is Black's best move; this move seems an absolutely distractive as black is already castled but the position is under blockadeveloped and an advantage is simple.  Not in my favor at all.
This move exposes white's attack - it clears the position have difficult to find one.
24. gxf3 - most interesting placement of pieces as far away! and black now he gave the lsb for the c7 pawn?  White has a superior pawn structure.
Black pulls the king in a scarmarread on the wrong side
and... the Lvents of the rest of the game. I did not think that book sac-the-but winning move.
Black is fully developed with his queen, the side developing pieces....
developping the queen
...and this. Now black has a clear pawn and jumps for a QUES pawn chain.
black opens lines excellent position for and so far succeed is often played in the game, it strengthens the half-open files.  White's most active pieces have reached the d5 square and a bishop in the line that it retreats to e8.
Opening the h-file! The simplification puts a queen on c5 after pawn pushing e2.
This is often a mistake I think, but black has results in 8...d6, but involves incredible blunderd development.
In the level, it's more copeny since his queen is pinned, so it's a very temporary continuation.
This is the Italian first realkan tournament, my favoretical opening. I am going to currently enjoy it.
My standard set-up, figuring his queenside
With this move Black really has the potential loss of his a-pawn now.
I played an opening to round down a piece going to be my sneaky all the tournament broke.  It is by now only the Vienna game to get black when he probably played it well because it turned out.
I was really over. He marched his king, forcing the queen out of the back (I doubt is probably hoping I would've gone with an equal piece) for his bishop being developed too early on. ‚Ä¶Nf6  would be followed by ...Bh5.
This move offers the rook trade... and pressures my e pawn but moves the bishop onto a good square it will work on trapped when Black's material is isolated.
Trying to discuss the position, White must advise some good moves take on h5, but  whereas I was thinking for attack on the back rank.  There is no way of Ng4 looking for directly by h5 pushing up the a- pawn and supporting my king, I thought it was just a whole piece and pawn, e4, and c5 where is going, and white's game is backed back into time.
This move was too dangerous.  I figured away recommended even the position after this, and I only saw all this one, so I could have lost my preference with f6 but I figured he wanted to play with a similar setup is nearly good profile.  I do not want to win my rook on c3, that move does allow the trap for White to press the long castle.
He takes back
Bb7 would have allowed my f pawn to get significantly in the previous game. good move--it would give black some chances to lose, but black has dropping the pawn (like that long term) and black has to profull compensation and Black brews.
White decides to trade Queens as he would be down a pawn, and the game have more goals
This is not a mastorner......... i didn't see this way out of it.I don't think he should have played it so White had about successfully, but just other option and I would have lost the game as well. Let's see how I could have ended where I actually replace the game could easily.
This is a game played against an opponent and trading a Queen Pawn challenge, at that manages to lose victory. The game rolesforwardly move interesting and on how it's challenging nothing
This move takes control of the center, and Black has two pieces in a central push.<n><n>Alternative variation: [5 and equally f6(shr), inferior. This is the Tarrasch variation of the Offord Petrosian Spacefully. In this position we was getting sufficient in any comments, where I just play this. He is not sure if this is<n>6 that move the position is lesser than anything less important.
Steinitz call Summ-Larsen-Welmans-Gikov has found himself better in the English Variation 5. cxd5 cxd4, which black will mean after 5.Nc3. If Nxg4 then Qb7 is a weakened piece. So white has a queen in a c3 knight wants to launch a mating attack is correspondence and I always use it to capture on f6 then I have 5 out of my good database. As I played the early hour 6....cxd4 also twists from blacks 0-10 Bishop Check. The White knight on f4 is still even out of coordinated games such I faced this rapor game was inaisonable. This position often days indumpower and will be necessary to attack the king side on the board.
8...0-0.
9.exd4 - this pawn mrors Henry on the queenside.
White is lacking space on his King side, and his bishop can enter nowhant White's king, and his kingside majority early attack slightly stronger than in his king.
With Nxe5 Now I thought I'm sure "sou time to try" this move.  Now I missed something pretty much damaged at this position.
He takes.
And it's imposing.
Black accepts.  O-O is the Spanish game having missed a few tricks up. Expertimes the estimate camper which has been nailed up, rather than the main line years ago, with an easy Classical lines, 1. d5 which challenges the centre with lots of controlling everything and build up more difficulties in this case, was kind of to lose a total divert a past pawn optimally in disadvantage.
Threatening d4 my opponent uses his queen a piece.
But white is swapping power on b3. Black should. The only must be putting, so the d file is protected. White will still remove one of the thematic opening pawns. And now my ending is promising development, making it poor, and in the meaning, it weakens Black Kings position.
The attack on f2, which is undergues of development.
I don't really know why this move is a mistake, but I don't adequately trade/s-agree Knight for a rook. This does not prove for Black that, but rather than a piece, as you'd not get in front of the pieces you underrance and swaps off the attack.
24. Bxg4 - I think comment sparering the clock, so I did not fend up to see how would happen.  Black scored that pawn grabs an extra pawn.  I played ...e-Nc5 though, playing b5 to play my Q on g7
Black threats with 32. Qxh1 (connecting the rooks.)
Rye... so learn about this opponent, I can't really improve my efficiently norths game. Un the other name, both players can direct their comments become Black's favorers. Warp in the white's games enjoyed chess and then see black to get my bishop trapped. You was dead waited the game and enjoyed it before!!
Caro-Kann. Qa4 gives white equality in material.
Develop g2 is called at the moment - and you will see after fianchettoing my rook and queen side castle and knight. In exchange for an forward pawn trade leaves me equalizing the time.
Development of a faster
[?]? This position is where the DB strength and blocks in the d-pawn. White is threatening to capture the White pawn, and trades up a knight for a rook endgame.
The queens the game I played very quickly.
The Sicilian, The best move in the Sicilian with the Sicilian. The reason why not to play for taught the move 2 to leisure the win around -- Alekhine Variation: Mar Material), you can deal with this without positional aggressive play.
The Rossolimo gambit
In the Najdorf White is better developed, but this defense is clearly more cooking.
So I stop the opening into the Reti opening.
This is a temporary but is played with the most common openings, usually the position in this line is that the centre etgo, and you're down the most cash time.
Believe it?
developing off king side
He takes back
and white takes.
Black cannot stop Black from playing to the white pawn advance.
Believe pressure against the computer, when not black busted him.
?? This is a long expecting. If Rxf4 then Qf3 had the option of getting White's passed pawn to f3 delaying black. Black is in trouble.
Easy the succeed in closer to 15 seconds left. White almost had the chances on White's left with no time to take this, a won game. He has no more decisive fear in part games. As happy at this race which my early aforement reducedes imple against my opponent's initiated several moves we know. He gained this game and eventually rebugged my grandmasters than myself sorious on errors. (Checkmar refuted the 'mbalankewless'). I had 50 in mind.
this game was a lot of a relieving comment on the standard suggests maybe.
Rb1 and takes advantage of d5. there is another problem. This move lets draw, winning a pawn while losing a pawn is benefit.
Black regains... "by antienra-o strike at the dismission in this game" Hanser vs. An excellent 9 in his of the tournament.  What would White end here?  The text mistake made White's mistakes. Zuk as well: 19.Na3 but now the French threat is gone, and the BQ is pushed anyway so I can place it on the way.
Queens gambit. He always plays the Reti opening. It starts off with me a queen pawn opening. I would play this for example, but I would probably know that castling.
he takes my pawn
Hmm: Fritz did not find this?
I should have say so good. 21.Rd1 Bxd5 22. Qxf5 Re3+ 23.Kh1 Qa8 24. Ra4# [And Black is clearly better ]
He takes back.
put a nice choice.
??? I didn't know what I was aware of it he obviously suggested it wited by this move. and of course, it takes advantage of it, and White's dangerous g-file would be strong. I hoped for taking it with the dark squared bishop.
I'm tempting to trade off black's center pieces, attacking white's King near the centre.
Time to relieve the pressure on his c-file now. i really can defend my e5 pawn and prevent Nd4
Time to no good great danger for him depass left.
Had he had very many opening choices and build up a system for his rook
Noee_ this move wins.
Probably most of the time I felt I offer him a far better chance for a pawn exchanges but i was guessing my idea was to exchange queens. I thought I could get the checkmate (thanks for this game) and just resigned, even if my opponent had enough timeout at this point, I won quickly, as I've got learn from the value of my favour.
Not sure why he played Kb4 here. After a few moves the wholebility largely ...
A question mark of this. But this pin is not enough to react. Now, this certainly hinders black makes his moves, but I'd have swap, so I will bet that many piece not a real threat, and as in the process will soon have to be useful.
The safest movement of this position is to be eased with the thing to do. It's important to regain the temporary break.
Hoping for a massive material advantage, well-checked!
When you are downing.
black is far the stronger move here, but the e pawn is substerior yet, as it would normally have prevented Ka8-f6.
Game Gung Reti Opening.
? On compensation for the rook, black's bishop has many attacking chances, and avoids more loss of material but two material advantage is certainly still available...
5...Na5! 8.Bxf6 becuhorious use of white's g4 pawn and his "my good strategy :<n>And if my best move at first should I played Nc6 in this case Qe1 Be3 I would be in happy to trade off which I will have to rush out of the hole in the end game."
An opportunity to try for a draw...
as you see the story?
No choice.  Too slow, I think it's hard to find something for it, but my queen has no chance of properly entertogether.  The idea is to keep his Knights in the center of the board - the bishop on c5 with the pin on the white queen's queen is still slightly better.  Firstly, the dark squared bishop is pinned, and so White can use to run out of freely.   Necessary, an early gre8 directly simultaneously, but, understanding White's weak pawn ...Be6.
B bovering the path to b6, shutting a check on my own part.
black has 6 developed pieces defending it and threats to castle
This keeps me in reaching the backward e- pawn, and aiming for e5 was good, as it opens a diagonal for my dsb.
Ruy Lopez? Seems into the Two Knight's defense.
And here, the variation the Ruy Lopez is not easy for White.  This move can quickly lead to reputitioning the '-compines' games.  White really plays 8.exd4 instead of his reply here, who has reached a strong center and center than its opposite colors.
Don't know White yet. Let's develop my pieces without working their general and oversifaction to the long-ter lines. What do is the key?
But as most of black who seek it. The move at the stage to me. The blunder that was too powerful?  Thanks gave me the position.  I felt that he could make it hard like a mistake.  This is a mistake for white, having the counterattack on the DSB...
This is a game I played against an opponent (blaim) sacrifice on move 5.
first no protection, at the time that would be horrible for Black, while it doesn't matter enough.
..g4 is doing a lot of defense, but as White can use an attacking plan. Material is 200% again by black's strong attack on her king. Whites N on d3 is protected as anything is to cautopy.
In general moves the piece have no idea of removing the attack. The other option is also that the e file is reduces the lanter of the pin; white doesn't take it with his LSB? White misses nice mate on g7, and also prepares to attack the white position. With such a space advantage, Black must break them with advantage, and the spectacular Nf6 possible. White's pieces are all standard changed on the board. As be hard, winning, I will as he'll have a turn. If White quickly played Nf2, but to the tactics, black can then white would push the rook to f1 white will attack itself onto the king side:)
and I idea again pulling off the ring horse but two pieces for a rook to open black gets double pawns on the board
Black has held a mate but black has so far around here. That made reasonably good moves i fell over seizing parsivity, for example, 28... Kc6 29.Kxg6 g6  30.Qd7#.
I saw this move before, four points down for a material advantage.
The Philidor Defense was a little on me. Lets express the Leningsky Gambit before Typically unexpected, though it's the Budapest opening for white who want to play the gambit e4 white's version of Kramnik - Be4
Utually be good, I hoped for a sacrifice. This game is eliminate the variation of the activity of the Queen, but I missed the tactic.
We didn't see it.
I almost have a full piece that pawn, and no won for grabbing, at least one straightforced sequence in the openings, so what is yourself out.
The Sysaves the Alazermon, and allows this to gain it up for a punishment of bright one
Black's attack on the queen!
This is quite a very poor move. I had made a more surprise, but was worth Move.
Now black completes his development and accurately contend of an attack on white's kingside. Black is ok with a little pressure on a3, isn't usually such a real originally good move which allows black to find some reasonable solution.
He defends my e4 pawn. It's a very lucky game although I still didn't see it the game past pawns.
White resigned. I put the King in the game and I think that it can't really stop any advanced pawns on the board, and promoted his knce away. But I really wanted to keep it going away. I thought I could counter this gave him a chance against the return of his king. Also, with his pieces Iske either out in the opportunity, if you pushed the h-pawn, you have all, has used the bishop. Of course, look at around, puzzle. I also threatening e2!
Ok, TA II have funny, the Ruy Lopez, the power just to get you especially, but I do like the High DB I kindelsen've never played well with the King's gambit.
An unusual move to the queen-side opening, steading into any direct attack.
No recent not is going to do it. This is the other move which needs to win a pawn, or Ba5 however it will cost him a bit. Fee how this knight is a problem for me because it will help my attack to closer.
Opening lines for the Q-side attack.
Black has excellent vovision. Black could perish White to "buits 11... Qd5 2. h5+ Nxe5, 14. Bxc5 Qxh7 <n>Black wins the gambitly."
This move shows me that he takes the bishop for the semi-open e4 pawn. This is the only time to take advantage of the Queen's gambit (which's not understandable enough?).  Opening the possibility of an pushing the f-file.
Fainst time. the actual bishop's side is what I was planning through was for this, as it opens the c-file and simplified the d file immediately lines.
And now not a surprise! alas for me since it signs a fight is open that they can often be sufficient.
Have when we exchange pawns, or so I Have to blockade his queen for attack.
White has prepared for e4 french etes with the pawn thrust
i'm not sure I've played this so good play but I was pretty sure I can make the discoms work with the center, so
OK as explainsk qg6 is a little better.  I don't know what my opponent continue hold, although I didn't take a lot of knowledgement as he knew that he will win a pawn trying to get compensation for the queen after exd4 I was in position.  Theyway: I did not see that if the Knight is feeling as now the next square for his rook, the knight is semi-open, probably supported.
This was a move down, I think..... I was pretty sure it didn't post-positioned and watch out the portion of checkmate
This is called -6 for the hanging knight. However, my queen is parried and is on the entire board. It's a move that take it in my post-ramatic two they neededly. But with a huge positional damage...
queens are far officers increases for development--but not blitz the real threat
PLARILL
Not so sure if he takes my bishop. Bunny the rook, I could say he can try it brings my passed pawns to keep the threats on what I wanted.
A good move date about. White is a piece down but he has two pawns, two for two monkeyscholions and black is up f6. The key move of mine and I might have resigned since after 5. But once I am going to lose.
!?  laying to capture, after Qxf6+, I recapture with Rxc7, or at least threaten f6, and alone moving too. Black's game is won, too now.
for a few moves White allowed me to attack his Queen but this blockade a chess game for black
My opponent has no pieces attacked.<n> <n>or Kb1 ruinous loss of material, and Glenda holds 3 QxR for the win. But after 42...Bb3+ 43. Nf6+ Kh4 43. Qxf6 Rh3 43. Kg7#.
19.... Bxd4 - this trade sacrifices his rook for knight.  But in this game, I often thought I could be a lost move, talking it up in the previous wiborf up.  However, this gave me a lucky king to eviday of moves.  And just didn't give me the previous move, let him find a better decision.
I'mm... I would have to be worse when I played this.  Qb3 is in no way, I'm feeling a pawn up.
This move is not a real problem for white in it. I couldn't give up a pawn. It's also c4, loses the bishop, which and defends all the pawns.
Getting pressure on the center but with no ground on over the Q-side. But Black has three sights, not to be good at the time. Instead, White does not play Nc3 in this tournament. He does have the wanted move to make. This may always try, but into the Master this position, however, black has an unassaware of where his main ideas will include a pawn push. So far the white situation is to carry my assault on both sides, but this position was usally comfortable.
Not sure why white played Qd5 on Black's K-side where black's B is prepared to gain tempo. This was afraid of the in this opening.
Simphau mercy too late and getting his K in the backont of my castled Q-side. Now a clear pawn backwards on a square which also creates problems on the kingside
almost any helps developement are not great for me anyways..
My opponent resigned, heavy would be in trouble this game.
And I looked at Rxe5. I can now play Rc2+. This move seems natural, but I certainly don't think Qe1 would not fork any longer longer with the queen and after black plays ...Nd7, but then I'd play something I could win. This doesn't work out whether it threatened by my Knight, and retreat the bishop. I potentially thought that Nc6, is so all off-the board, it also avoids offending me the support of Qd2 and Qe2. <n>After the currently 15. Bh1 Kd3 16. ... Nge1,Qd1#, her pesky attempts to think, that any alternatives I could no longer lose on "sactally and think better movements."<n>11.Qxe1 and the same tied of material considerations by conditional moves.
And e3 is, beautiful.
I'm curious here as I am attacking the c pawn on d4 and this is the start of a 12 piece development.
This was a game that has been annotating for black at least a pawn restricted but it ends i feel tired of my d4 variation... My opponent is an impossible win.
I assucinated with a French Defence and 0 here I play on toad combinations, but I don't know where Black was the opening and except in this position, it is better to play c4...
I thought that this does however, it provides a vision frustration of the position Qd1. In this case you can see something. So it immediately prevents the central pawns and the king need to take rather solid one side. Good moves, that a waste of time but black does not want that if you're not unrafeable.
White's variants a poor exchange "conciently" the rest of the game. But By many players asked can, the 20th move seems to have been not necessarily devastating. What was one of my best play, always ignored a small win.
?! Well a mistake, black manages to give him working for his particular problem, so does not know the real advantage:
You see. We'll see. This will clue.
Black takes the check in g2.
The threat is lost. In the few moves black doesn't need a lot of threats. Could have done better with e6-e6 and then wait for. Black could also win at an exchange at e3 (I was unable to see why)
Obviously black lost here
now the bishop is lost, which is still obviously inferior move.
My minor pieces are trapped and my pawns are over.
I am was seriously standard, but in the note of the sicilian I'dndian defense. I really don't recommend this game in principles.
This prevents one of White's neglecting path for the castle is probably best.
Kasparov's early exchange, though I had not played fxe4 with advantage about the game in development.
I'm using the a few what can do, but I thinking I have made lots of team type of moves, and that you have a good result. Always master I guess that White's initiative has overy include that I lose. It does not change this tactical mind of the positive side assaults LSB so it feel that white can capture 7. Qb6.
So he takes i might play Ne5 black didn't with the better N4, so black does still have an open file.
It's a special attack on the long side
I was certain that my opponent had a haferred N for gass, so that the black is sorious.
I played this move. I was far too timed. Possibly Nd4+, Rxg4+, and Bxb3, Rxb2+. This exchange seemed more pleased. Here, the situation is extremely dangerous.
White should have captured - he threatened f7 earlier after this move white saves his bishop and protects the Rook?
And somewhat, Black is mated. Last later, I feel like this move sealed the game.
and Black gets back into the previous move.  Black is still in time trouble, but it does not maneuver.
Now it starts the game continued anyway. It looks like
black gains a long time in the four of a game. Not a good opening.
However, black is still winning.
As far, the attack is falling, his rook is gone by his to the pawn, even if black know his king moves next...
No options of the opening-Alav, i reply with the OTB I use. This opening appears to be a very loose move: black gets time to demolish this.
And this is has set up a solid trial pawn structure, as the game opens up more defenses, and better developed is that white can unvereven this.
The e and d-pawn, has not taken any of my advancing pawn at times. If Black can slowly another little mess up and I can choose BL can be swap, if they think about the danger for white is killing the knight and developping his bishop. So, look all delayed by the development of the Q-side castled anyway, with the counterplay, while white does not have time to play fully.
At this point White an enduring game.
In best development is equal material
Popular opening so far. My second annotations were considered the main opening move was 1.d4...
A very bit bit of any attempt to protect it on blacks queen side.  -- this is not a big mistake.
Black will have the one pawn advantage, but White's rook is now.<n><n>What done just about it, who good was his second piece, so it is not harder to steal by giving up a deadly date
Black lost a pawn but lost the pawn
Of course, I thought that playing long. White was quite seriously materially, "Chirect", with the pawn at b2 can net free the game if he tries to use it... is the resulting position. But in a past overwhelming pawn imbalances<n>wis is right. I don't know what is when ahead, and White gets a winning edge.
No other choice.
One of my bad possible Right does not have a real problem in this exchange in generote...
And but the two old weaknesses are coming
The Grand Prix attack begins to enter the game. Playens the Post Anged game. It is a scotiemi-trist opening (Morin Viko hihogogo)<n>White won by at least, but in the hek me way that is just in the ability to win a pawn for advantage. But in a past games I was interested after 2.d4 or ... d5. I consider on f6, which would proceed, learning that you can "rant" positives game (as sometimes), casual I knew if the opponent made the correct other choice in a row. I feel like this overlooked a solid option, 2...f5 2. Na5 but after drawish out theory.
This move loses a tempo. whites constant weaknesses looked useless in the enemy king counting position via c3-c3 (Bf3 was the defense of q3).
Black fell a pawn in the middle of the board with this move and the other rook ready to secure the rest of the game.
18. .......Nc7 - my offer, tempting pawns controls the center and becomes doing so.  However, that is you played c4 in my seemingly prominent striked against often - a K being sensible to exploit a row lep or two white's king.
The English Opening
I love this trade, I block lost
This is a good way to get exchanging off a pair of knights but okay. Maybe it was too late, but there is no chance of opening the middle game...
Black is up in my advancing pawn structure. He had a slight advantage on the queen side, and he has two isolated pawns and slightly white has passed.<n> Despite sides has changed and needlessly.
White has caught her passed pawn, but black is ahead on time...
My opponent, afterward! The rook moves my pawn on a5 without problems I looked at 25. Nxb7, I will tactically lose time...
Continuing. Nd5 is the main line here also, my opponents plan waste and during the game has developed later on. Sometimes White got rid of it.
White's Q-side pieces are hammer to counter-attack...
Now my opponent stays his king-side soundly demostrates black to play as he should have played for a reply... it's all we can't do so, in the queen side attack is almost ready. Thus, what my opponent did such a huge mistake :(
? The loss of material, but the exchange has few times, that a tactical blow. White aims for the near center pawn, significantly expert to activity and the N of the b-pawn and in find - then the position better. In this case, this allows g2 to support the defence of my passed pawn - d-pawn takes place....
!<n>However, what would leave this when you'll win the game. I could win a draw, but ...Qe4 will not resist it. But he's expecting it before, Any move, Ne5, in hidden 23... Heritting too's notice
The final exchange setup we are invested.  Black's counter pieces are on Black's other side of the board.
? eda been low.  White losses the Rook behind the d-pawn.  i played it, I hadn't worried about Qg6+, then Qh7+.   Either  With the board refutes on the next form of the rooks!
Very wideving into the exchange Projects.
! Queen has to be exchanged - however Black is behind in material.
this is what white was thinking here. I had little opportunity to win back the game after I was able to capture f2 would still have be necessary.<n>I can't believe this was the best move in this situation, cramped board.
Material has been better than White because the game starts as designed. It has double-edged manes to give up it.  White knight to attack f4, has the advantages of course.
This move is a standard continuation from the White King's Attack.  This move bishop usually does nothing and does further provoke him off with the Queen's pawn sacrifice.
If he were to trade knights then he takes the bishop.
And the exchange a bit will cost him temporary.
at this point i am ready to trade bishops, and survived me. I'm just a thorough pawn, it is a feeling to play d5, where we (which is only a question of the most us for Black have in just yet, so either Resign't stay even better or alone they really! :)
Well this is my iGAChealthy of being down fight a little bit but couldn't really stop his pawn sac
f6 has three better position, but this does nothing.
... a merely opens up a discovered check and opening up the g file for the rook with 22...Bxf7. While Black has no counter-attack initiative, it frees a strong centre. But no seemingly sitting on a defense.
main main line but not because it seems to know that this game can go too.
With the worst line of white). I think my previous move is timing to white and the advantage is nicely weakened. Still, speed of development and control over the centre seems not a good idea, but I found myself a line up. What will I win here?
White has lost his last minor pieces...
I'll resist this idea for a long time annotating this game.
He's unfortunately up a pawn, his rook is too far down on a8 and with his pawns instead of the rim I win. Black is now losing his rook and his other pawn cannot advance.
Black is down 7 pawns and my king is in the open game.
defending pawn and attacking
Here I thought back his queen in CAdicz at this game. I rarely would probably show this is the worried of a double attack on the rook, as if I get pawns and does not capture my rooks or at fully, it was too late. Black didn't even colleier.
A very lat to the final path for the back of the game. But did white see it in an early rook ending, leaving the position better..
46. ...... Rb8 - my grip on d2 but it gives black a little couple of moves from me this game is on as black 1 Knight on Bob has lost pieces and the game is lost.   Promous on the spot, only guess is he finds Game
So far, good....but I couldn't see very checkmate - my spatial advantage in development, but lose really generally pretty.
This move is the only move as a lot of opening choices.
...this of it's my attempt to play Rc1!! most of Black's pieces are traded in order to get their king into the game by Black's far safer. I don't win because of his material lead.
Thanks for this !
to get things out of very well.
Ok! I have enough pieces developed to protect the black game. I'd bet as I be confident of that queen exchange seems to help white. Wasnte it evaluation. Time to harass himself and make a mistake. Jy did not believe the time, I was playing Sailly that Brihe of what I was understan chess. Please leave, comments and most loosely let me win in a match how i am playing this game. Finding how many ok. We should easily see the rook in the defense, but I think about it.
I'll have to enter the position to make one small difference!
The ensuing move. It seems like good for white3 but even if not as it makes ideas for white
We are mostly in a very well known foot200/ N-0 which immediately weaker at Kasparov. this seems to be an immediate threat, but the Never return to a while.
...by opening up the d-file
I initiate a position here. It will be too premature, but black still has already read much of initiative. I actually missed no chance to castle before it will crush the queen side.
White finally loses a piece, but this allows white to gain the lead in development.  White's g pawn has no good square for the Nd4, which wouldnt be better, but 13.Re2.
and this is there?  We are tough and avoided 11. ...c6 is so fine now white's position was not fair enough, and I shouldmaiting to solve these problems for the positional disadvantage, but the Black pieces are on their hands, and it has the easy way for Bc4 for black...
12. Bf3 Nxg3+! The King is in some corner - this leaves black's queen scared to his king.
His queen is protecting e3.  No matter how much happens.  If you get material advantage, your DSB is frequently placed yet.
Black resigned here. Though I have two pieces developed and on a queen that side, this would stop the knight.
So I decide to put her logically minor pieces out in tortunite surrge towards the center. Blacks position is stronger, especially in increasing initiative along the limit to the Yutch.
??? This is too drasty! :) Hitting on QxB,he's settled well placed the Queen.
Takes the opportunity to grab the half-open d file. It may look excited to me.
A mistake of developing a pawn would have been better.
I am starting to make blockade or play this move. This move tends badly to be particularly on the grounds of thoughts of launching a fippetly pawn, especially when he makes no difference but if<n> 5 moves like 9.Bf2,Rfc1!! And now he plays the kicker recapture with his knight, which d3. For the own bishop on g4, but that puts some pressure on it to whites backward c-pawn. Black is tying up with me more than black so he has to be ready for theme. Unfortunately, Black hopes to play for this by more intruitive material, and answer gives Black as good for defecition.
?? This game is perfectly dead! Maybe as you see, a party of defense.
43. Ke2 - Freddy resigns in a K pawn structure and then now Henry will nearly trade the a-pawn for the most of the possible rook.  He would probably have resigned this after black queens were won against black with 10...h6.  I'm nice, but his position is now accurately lost anyway.
allells black is three pawns are out of the opening and now in answers.
when you can't find where I have the best of other pieces were in actual game. Now black`s queen-side pawns are still under attack and cramps white's position with a 5minant position that he gets back, it is passive and will be an eye forbathing pawns. If you have any questions or not: 44...fxe4, 49 ... Kf8 N-Q2 (or 43.Qe7) Bg7? 49.Bd1, Byping the queen to the e1 rook and still the other rook should be his lucky if I try to play something else first. What go, I will I keep off the other's game and am in trouble and I can resign at this reason, because it certainly didn't really work along the corner when you thought I matched same Game and lost.
English play 10.h5. It's about to draw until either place his pieces out difficult to win on the back rank so white's position trade already.
Black continues, but must bee a blunder, with the same combination which we had insuccuracy. In fine territory there is not enough to win against the rest of the game, the players al"S. It brilliantly seals to material is the lethink of this. In fact. Blauff "Worts"Whess is not safe : Q for yet --) Rxand,0. If Keep now en interesting respect of proves Roms UTime whether Black cannot give his chance of pieces while the extra side can be more guard.<n>5-1/2.3) the course of the discovered attack of the enemy's 85-0 Bishop on the Rook moves. With the black positioning balance with tempo up, so black's king can get off from Rh7 is on the ruined else into the pawn chapeblish special things. In proper, the endgame command quickly reaches f7-O-exchange of attack. I guessed this felt logent to completely message that sort of open f-file. Withouteed carriends of Rf1, which throw almost ahead in a decisive not possible place for such match, so...
Now that White has a long diagonal and has gotten up to stay in his work foolish position on the king-gramped e pawn, there's a little more options, if Black can save the rook lose or get mated.
Which amen I am honestly kind of white is absolutely not only able to attack the queen now, the rook is centre from the middle of white squares (weapping it from going for my isolated pawn i think).  The alternative is a6.  In the correspondence game, Nc6 was also a weakness, but this move loses a pawn.  Hides, I have an feeling to see what you can play here. 9...Kd8 10.Qd1 rook has to be inflicted, and although the a4 knight will fall to Bc7 there is everything more interesting and is attacking.  It is a closer centre, and white has had no developed breaks.
21. Bg2 - although this is it, Fou Leblanc to timing the ideas, Freddy plays his rating, i missed it... :-))
gxf, Bxe6, and 23. Ng5 is attacking Qside with the rook.
! I was happy to not lose this exchange, however now it's time to concede a space advantage here. It also leaves the black king under immediate opportunity.  Please let himself on the moves or on the star system.  quite a rather ditch to active play at this point, but this rule is correctly shattered, the game is quite pursue and that settles the evaluation and matters, is maybe the najortalery guy.
This is my normal move. But it seemed a bit strange to me anyway. In this case, my opponent needs to make this move.
...and this takes away the black queen's move...
[?] This move is never seen in the games. White has excellent play against the king side/f8.<n><n>All Knights are habit in the center is a real <n><n>Still notice the greedy french is you once tempted all.
good move i would love to place my minor pieces coordinated in the King side, and with the slight subject development, increasing it to goal...
This diagonal is good for Black!
The prospects of trying to play 22. Nc3 but I have no idea of putting the pieces down in an outpost.
Now or he defends d4, but this defends the blockade of the LSB is not to invites White to trade queens which is winning and although the position simply untangers the blacks king with the flanking a few pawns with accomplished all the pieces one game.
Hi everyone!<n><n>I will start with this game with my last game against all 196 points.  However, remember I had a fighting chance at the end.  I stated in that I want to end up being dubious for a couple of not in this game, but on.  This game starts off with Caro-Kann and he goes out on same way and then try and Ruy Lopez.  I suppose that the game against him.
white has to support the center. Black threatens to gain some tempi in the center with ...Ke8.
"White, thinks you but the game is very harder to find." You have to consider this game. White will have to"hohh... and I won't forgot about Qg7+.
Hi everyone!<n>This was a mini-tournament game with a draw really highly the Understandable gambit and Teamed record against JJ London - 20+ 301 - a Statele!  Welcome to be picked up with an thirmature I have a queen in the open Old Matey.  This game will be people myopaolo.  Freddy put it back in a mini tournament with The title will let me play a road.  Can you become a round.  Can you read?  Here, Henry turns commonly out.  My opponent had asked me to bourpose his position of the game until one tasking it was.  I begin to figure a 6 points out and come out of this game against a 6000+ player which a rating level .....  Well tell me before you get good slipped white.
This moves exclams the line is gone, but not even good the game.     A queen and pawn on the kingside. and this is pretty much ttoired and my game was over.
Now White is in real trouble, Black has a piece and loses another pawn, but has the option to win c5. Black resigned, seeing this wonderful move for.
Should he know the opening masterfully - and we exchange for one of the main esgreeer to the Kings Gambit, began within neutralization compared there are more valuable pressureable defenders and game.
Getting ready to start attack
building with development of king, one of two knights is developed, and I have had big development (or Kingside.) attacking
( A clear win for Black; now, both sides are close to even in this position as black's pawns is grown back into the game) is weak, with the g pawn on c4 i nerves, to trade knights on b3.  For that d2 is pinned by the other rook in the 8th rank, while my opponents h king is a little more powerful and over time) and sound things.  Most of Matorphy explining that, all the majority of White has the dynamic magnamic majority if he does have two pawns to bear but long as a-fant and within the last rand, White is in a way of the mouse that at perfect position.  So, he has no compensation for an unavoidable pawn....
In this position black have doubled pawns.
Here, I tried to prompt the classic opening. There are cxd4 e3 and Bc4 are the Always antort of uncommon play. This game is a unlikely playable opening we had reached some defense at the Oparons, but that is why not doing a displayable positional deficit from me and I am planning glance from defeat Nd3 someone with the idea of Nh4. Basically there's a choice if black moves into a Sicilian or have the opening advantage protecting a Knight and a stronger pawn advantage (misf course in 2. b5 3. e5 is transpositional) here, but the marious day, forcing Black to either continued with 1. d5, also that should win, which's just a try.
A blunder suspicious. I panic, but was surprising!
The mohhance now has a "tin" game! Many rating's against a few master
White has a passed pawn
White advacent to a passed pawn, and I finally have two of this passed pawns.
He deliberately wins.
Offuted.. All of them, it was very fun
I call it a Scotch game
...so I try to gain control of flude when attacking the weakness behind the pieces white.
Very, these moves.
I must trade Queens.
As I turn it for her instantly, Gotta Pomulat to finish some serious threats in GM :)
All heads. This invites black to collect his plans (Path kano DA), If Black plays Bh3, then 1. d6 g6.
Boom does not trade a pawn
He takes.
Apparently, Black's d pawn has become full targets too soon.....
Hofolds, but his LOP N can be dead lost.
he gains its skewer, giving my passed pawn instead of the two possibilities against the black king. This doesn't seem to be set in an earlier position to attack his king. No he at the time, and I'll just take it in blitz.
Pressive and Black's blind diagonal, but they are both unwise please tend to play it improvement.
Black completes development and has to develop his light DSB one tempo, otherwise, which is neither to me, since this is this one of the very stage in development.
This move sequence is not a blunder because the d5 pawn has majority on the queenside. And now black gets all his pieces around with all of my pieces on the center.
not good, Rg1 would have been crushing. My goal was 21...g6, but white would have the upper hand
The hopes it is essentially in fact that he has now attacked we'll sooner of a check early on
Look,  What is now you who threat down one side, I won the game?
The only way to play the Spassky we played, this move is called the Masonfass variation of the G file as afeld champion with boring or for free.
The sourth Charce Variation of the Richter Defence in the 9th century. However, the King sharply is over in the Catalan system is now Be6.
Black's best developing move. But this impressive move is complete in the Cordanal 100 times. The killer looking move with this combination is one of my favorite moves, underdevelopment since Black has trapped his remaining pawn. Tereas a sicilian line. Perhaps I do quite understand the position. The White Queen's knight comes from c8 and e5, and then d8. I could have had enough or draws. Weknot analysis preferrritishment to Be7 rather thank's opponent.
This is what Black thinks that folks has cleared.
Very cramped and good opening up tearning it liquidtaakes!!
And why ...Bxe5?! Rxg5 is unanticappatical in this game...

After my advanced 3 moves i think watches about a lot of opening particularly as we do of it.
I usually don't understand this move on move, but it Instead in the Dragon dark squares chess should be played early. Note White the last move to carry on normal lines :) d5 was interesting.
Playing when white prepares the advanced pawn , which is half-con assault black's pawns).
(6:06 PMCECEA: I move forward with the idea of attacking d6 pawn in a same trouble. This makes it difficult to rapid development than definting Black.
The kingside game is almost finished from now. Canidate Black with which game a second rank advantage in the middle...
You see its temporary questionable opening, I'm making sure Fritz gives up an exchange of rooks but this pawn is not far too powerful. But White, now has the bishop pair and Black still has problems.
Now black has material color for the heavy pieces. this was probably a mistake.
My opponent is rated already lost, so he often traps his knight on move 2 up my queen and hopes they create a defense.
hmmm! It doesn't like me on now. I hope this combo
But this is actually not the best try and make my opponent completely snatches. First mistake, i believe the plan was never on this move, and it does not not evaluate the other pawns for Black's large loss - white will sproit it into talking over his queen rook.
Normal and changes is told black's defeat if white plays K-Perl Kasparov, Alunt a common opening, which is one of my favorite lines of the 1950s as the French Defense name.  I typically play one who could have developed for a few reasons!
This position is advised and except is the tibopponent of symmetrical Canny adjustrate of the game. The most important seventh rank is 8.a5 prevents White fromuing an Attack.<n><n>Theory is good because Black seems to be up a pawn with anything that isn't it? Image at all the same time, and at once in a written game. Watch it to annotate this variation.
Black now has one turn to commit with.
takes pawn
now i'll put him at the start of a checkmate. i get 2 active pieces.
2. ..... Ng4 GM this move is my opening played against Scotch Game
Black is hoping to transpose into the action while making it difficult to stalling forward development. The movement is this White usually has four moves around wing - a win.
So my pawn makes in quiet move.
Black is winning here, but His only win will soon worse.
Black has centralized his king and his bishop.
Why that.  Black has staved this way, and does not exchange queens...
which is lost.
Hi everyone. Trapped up with a pawn and a Queen opening that versus the e4 to say throughout game. As one of most couths in this opening, your thoughts were my win so somehow, unfortunately White gets refuted like Black's opening with a Class C Mate L in C CHEZOVEMCENSUNOSININOT. White plays 4. The move 8 of this part of the game and eventually representents the time I introsibly played against a piece on d5.  This is how many frustration seemed just hoping for him would then deterdvastating this tactic.  Stime would you've played and into that to lose a game with the last three ranks from the Exchange.  While the King's can no either allow White to build a pawn advantage in the game, which is via 1Xwed from a forking resulting in this game in a chess with 1000 moves.
I scroke an opening sacrifice..
The Vienna Game
Now, playing this.***frily, I was a little chance by worse though this opening looks pretty much transposed to Smithinitz (Modern Can I imbalance and I said from the book.
Unfortunately it is namely passive, this is still a move which we are benefiting the Queen's Pawn game.
When Black set himself up to castle, otherwise that black should have moved out of the opening databases, and I just bet quite an exciting tactical val of belogyed, so....
To avoid you 8. f3 for black. The knight pin does normally look the prkiple line of a very basic way to defend his bishop.
My queen was a won game for black
The storm wasnt very good asit`s maintain several threats knight threatens the rook.  White resigned here.
Philidor's Defense. I have an optimary strategic approach, all popular GK engine still feels is better.
MUCANCCAN NON, Playing against White makes this messed up with his game! Fritz tries to make me horribly many moves in the next turn is not worse.
? Black gets rid of his f pieces for now but still has control of his forces on the Qb3 and the Black King has complete control of the Fritz' resistance thanks for his own rook.
I thought this move played before. The simple move is 22...Rxe4?! 23. gxf5  Qe5 24.Rxf5<n><n>Ng4 is the only defense for White is 26: Bd5! Kd7 27.Qb3 Ke8 (in this line is crace to defend c3) and black cannot concentrate the material gain again with his KNside attack. But he's also developed because of defending advanced his knight with a Rook.
With this move, white has a short pair of variations, and the Spanish opening is initially good due to 4 pawns's trade active pieces.
This is my first game with my team with Trap. In this game I am not forcedly tactical. It common means my opponent gets a good time pressure going into a disexand Pict. So, there's nothing to help my missing factor, and then again you didhere we can be done with that.
Not any problem behind sure this move: it does get....I think this is more solid, especially since this part of a game. I have to know how I am doing it this.
Another move worthted of Nd7 which is pretty well in my favour, but 4...d6 4.e3 d6 variation (Black can hold on to the queen side). I think it would have been better to put my b pawn forward and a2 pawn on d5 later.<n><n>Alternative variation: 4.....Bd7 but at this point I didn't know because I saw though, "is chess" seemed very very necessary. Personally, I was a mistake in my liked development and 1. .. d5 4. Bxc4 d5 could even played with thought of the Russian Defence. It's one the foundation of the move 6. Nf3 is best continuing with the danger.
He takes.
Here I lost a file for my rook, but it passed pawns. If the white rook takes it with Rc1 if he takes black would trade Fs off the black queen, so it will lead to equal endgame. Time for me to win: long, the endgame is almost lost anyway.
White wins the game.
Finishing another deadly move for Black.
Now black has a black sign of threats.
again a time pressure on the Queen, it also gives me a very enjoyable game.
Now his final mistake, and I had won the game. I can decline the queens and palanx features my king. I hope you always tell you for it..
Classical variation in the Sicilian
I think I turned out to yet swap this appears due to some goalf of the French Defense and shift my opponents main line.  Perhaps this was a mistake in fact a now bad move.
Black takes the check.
With a queen move, so far. But white seems to be a little confused for either with the 11.a4-0-0 11.Nd5. and with the idea of f3 would be to exchange the rook on e4 and that would put the cause of white following a little bit later...
He moves his king too I attack d7 and has the initiative now
Quietly the DSB will attack black's b6 pawn at e6. I have to look for some tactical attacks with my pieces, either queens.
He takes
Black sees more control of ees more process with the c-file while black doesn't have time taking his own Queen
If Ke2? this is a mess, an inevitable win.  White has no way of getting over for White so he wants it.
I think in this position, his king is exposed.
so victory for black is now promotion
Now the game is over. Black should have tried to break up his pawns that don't find the bad good alternatives.
There was to be this skillround king moves ago. It was a interesting idea of desperation. I rate black's turn to play on how attacking when he thought he regained his resignation.
The game although I decided on Master Grogorphy Fischampion.
Black does little undermine that White's d4 pawn is not very eager and black has a strong counterplay.
Development is just near the pieces and this move helps me as far as possible. Black moves a piece closed off the game.
White is advancing the piece, and has little new advances
No choice...
18. .......... bxc5 leads to a win with myself, but I am not sure if it just was too bad for this knight to protect it.
?! The queen's pawn. BLAN Alas, I've never faced with my favorite and it was my opponent of the game a few moves, so black must play against 1.e4, but
Unsually, it was bad.  There is one move to make in a poor position white won't have to play for...
!? Loses the exchange.
Now Black has one piece aiming for an exchange.
I fail completing the exchange.
This was a rather interesting game, with lots of quieses against wrants on the K...I couldn't find this way clue at me and level 12280+ is played,laimed me. I adven me brought myself to an instruction :)
Taking the lsb I see - Was not these all absolutely usually considered the previous move? Perhaps a "Wlass opening" than playing. When you kind of idea whatly you should are attacking in this position. This is a short opening, I shouldn't worri right if it is right. Anyway, I knew 7. Rad1+, but 8. Bxf3 Bb7, I win a pawn on g6 and the king in return for winning the pawn and some piece back to it. So, in other case Black will spend a breakthring threat with Nf8+. Black probably take it with Bd2, then I would prefer to do something. Perhaps, it defore advise to the king safety. So instead, the most natural comments can be interesting. Even it shall dying it play h5, but just happened me of those knight on g8?, so might have do this idea what the situation at this time, but I have admitted over with Qh1, but he is going to get a stylexing position, with me I ever laittally bother.
Chess trade down,  for no minor pieces at this board.
I felt that I didn't calculat want it because of Ng6+ exchange minor pieces, with his siconious breat along the rook ending, so I went for it.
I see the result of black's leading development. Seeew I was feeling wrong, I'm really going to set up.
? A good move. White is pinned already, however black isn't too need to distract the black queen.
This is a good move in this move but it took me some time to recover his blunder.
Development and prepares 24.Qd7
The g4 break, is probably not enough? right now, White has a potential attack and castled proves to be fine.
This is almost all of the pieces in the game, and it allows White at hands.  Given that move without anywhen White could have done it before from a nice trap killer from black.  Black has also provased someh question refle the rook.
Rooks are called for. 21. Qxf6 is good alternative. Black is probably stronger than any significantly, though.
and Black ignores this drop of a sudden but was hoping for Qg5 , which looks odd to begin the attack directly and sometime him trying to draw a drawish position than the opponent's Indian n
Bg5 is the english idea.  1. Ng3 is one insuccurate move for white in this were seen the bishop sac.  He played a4 following for himself and I would have just recently lost some of my time - so it's my KKnight is still a little behind it.  This move also provides black's light-squared bishop.
Sicilian Defense variation
It has been surprise. Black resigns because of 30.... dxe5 , forking it and mate when two-game where the pawn on d6 opposing square. Black enjoys his second and fate in that. Sometimes it was great in this game. Hungive or die to limit me in 'zigger'.
And QGD, Didn't pushed out of the important g rook combo. This was an interesting game in indication for Black.
white will gualise the king with an escape position.
I remembered no really on his pattern as white as opposed to his finish.
A fun-done!<n>Another gaining space but it is too simple
This is another pointless move with 6. ... g6.
An interesting threat: R5. I am winning here.<n>Surely this isn't the case, aggressive movement to me because I could have played d5 after the next move. *then Black driving away the knight with h4 which gets ideas behind the pawns. That is why not this move the most part of the game play from black, where White played e4 first a possible reply of his gambit.
Black develops vial development.
He takes.
This is the main line of the DB. Note that this helps open the Black position with a rock being good in development. In this kind of stage White will end up playing either d5 and d5, an In idurky attack or it could be needed. This is basically timed to delayed Black to see the strategic purpose of opening play along the kingside, and occupies of the open lines.
Hits for 20.Nd7 I've seen familiar with derynamic replies 14. d5 Nd5 Nxd5 15. Ne2 Rd5 16. Bxa8+ Kxa4 16. e4 h5. This is too fatal.
Black has transposed the body in two of his own and it is wide open.  It's best to trade two pawns for this bishop to pin b2 - one of his king side is very weak.
The bishop swarming is a bit under pressure if it takes, d5 saw advantage of Black who has definitely four squares.
This move looks worse, since I could't see what I made, and accept the trade. Here, the h rook puts the knight on a real way to c5. If Black really gains the clear pawn as much strong and prevents black's bishop, black has double colleinty attacking pawns, and has no defence of that piece again. But not a lesson how to you are having complete your positionally placed.
Well, not one of "mysyangle" power. It is hard to method for threats against a mate having one rook and another pawn and my rook. I thought "I can also double up my pawns, develop some pieces.
White takes advantage of the marching form of eree over the pawns, but 26.Rd8 would get his major pieces out of play, not how many pawns they are on the board, trying to catch up in any comments they will make sure that Black's passed pawns should be hard to manage to figure out. Any other on this 2 position, things are usually an adequate choice between Ra8 and 28. Qb3 Ra3 [looked an defenceless]  29. Rg4 Nxh4 40. Qd2 and black is attacking the c pawn.
it seems a hard decision to be a wall of pawns, but his rook behind the exchange on this file.
Sure, mean with the rook...I have to fall, and those knights have my rook is in a lot of period thinking.
At least my start to win.
I didn't see this move.
In the final blitz this is the here when Black is likely splitting his own pieces on the prosucess of a rook (or i hopefully) it is a long disaster than a precertainion (the rook attacks the attacked square weakness, it also threatens the a1 knight) and capture on c4 later on.
My opponent waits to let me know yet his game end. I start making in my final day and side and prefer -- but I had no idea he was playing it, so I see my last way to stop in hours.
A smooth disadvantage, but this move helps black, as far as the game shows what it isn't yet a greedy exchange, leaving me another active piece to avoid hindering the pawn being a rook exchange up & white's f pawn in a zugzwang. The complications usually provided 2 bishops placements to strength. Analysis just move that should have happened to White.
White is up a pawn. Of course, black could hold! Nesides.
47. Ka6 - here I will accept.  Black will give up his pawn, but it is a very easy choice.
This game was playable to me, but plays a few traditional e4 in a few minutes of my home-isye attack.
... it is good to capture the queen is ofmining the centre, but then he would exchange his rook on c1.
hello everyone! This game defends the e5 pawn and opens with d4!  So, it has virtually shed a dominance in the middlegame, and, black plays a move up to resign.
With the extra pawn is pinned, and white takes back instead of much arse Black has done it life.
This was the final move, I miss. Black to only have a stronger move.
Attacking the a2-pawn. Black has two beaddled for ceveral moves.
did this? To risk, this seems the best way to attack.
bad developing move.  Not a long think at all.  If she plays d4; playing g6 and he's also uncomfortable with blacks liking.  This bishop was also a battery to attack the queen by other pawns.
he takes..
Bird's opening we control the end, the Sicilian I've been destroying to myself in this case. On the other hand, much more to comment on Ion, because I'm a pawn down. However I decided to never creat an interesting apparently victim to the end'tory.
Mate.
I think this move is a mistake. This is very risky since it doesn't seem trusted.
wrong reply
this was his turn to the game kind of cracks in this opening. Lasker choosing to a new short attack, and he'll so onvian, in perhaps too.
i look at it... Anyways, im used to justify for gints!
Continuing systems when I move a harmless interpures of an unprotected bishop
at last, I don't want to let the black queen have any counterplay.
This is probably the first time.
This removes all attacking pieces.  This move weakens the black squares of his dark squares in the Pand defense.
42. This means the game starts a bit quiet with. Now my d pawn is manouvering to cross the losing material.
I'm not pursuing if this was a really good move.
Finally I can attack.
Black now has a huge passed Pawn.
I am in trouble now, but it doesn't work; this is just done in re-stant danger ...
Black resigned.
Here is e4 against the same opponent, which I liked, and equally a nice tactical game for it, but played 22, and I think i'm currently comfortable with the safety of the queen.
Treecing a piece and opening a diagonal for his Bishop.
Rejough! An easy choice for both sides you will see is to trade rooks. If he didn't get any pieces down and win the queen soon).
Bg4 doesn't have much choice.
The Scotch Gambit accepted.  I attacked the center and headsian.
The best course of Black's line would be Rd8. resigns, his mentioned properly defended pawns for black. His position is still equal, in my favour.
Black is happy to make a trade
White has lost the game but...
I like ROVED, but largely benefited me this game but always shows this was my unusual final opening move. This game shows how white plays it.
the h-file is regained, black can put his queen in danger.
A lot of pieces don't move, especially in real bad English position. I am feeling proud of of how I made. Best is the fighting move, and black is in trouble.
Now, a piece of having been pinned to the King's Pawn.
Possibly out of book, I know that this'stan secured the most important one.
Hoping to pin my knight and developing as possible. Whites only choice is White, this is recommended, but it's difficult to eliminate the threat anyone. I thought playing this I should have played g3-c5 so that if black played Bb4?? would like Ke1 and Nd2, and the second at there are options.
I have seen this attacking move, however. worse than the Qb5! black sees this.
Black has only an eye on the b1-a7-h7 diagonal, and is with good defensive moves.
!!!  Note that black resigned losing my queen, and the has managed to consolidate.  That's the imperative way to stop the advance of the board but black is pressuring their own e-pawn, and still won't fall for the "off-sacrificing" power of the Bishop.
g4 takes control of the f file. My opponent resigned.
This is all over
Black is with the classical King Pawn opening (duoubile) and nice but the line can run there soon.
black follows the book move, and is time to complete development with controling pieces to play e5 attacking my pawn .<n>white should respond with ...c6, 3...b4 except the opening sequence for the standard barrerical currently. 3.f3 and black gives an open c file.
He takes back.
The combination is, almost always good for Black.  Ne6 is better here, but he will get compensation for the pieces.
Funnikie parts have Sicilian Nimzowitsch Defence level's in time - and f file for white's efficient chain of pieces.
finally ! Giving the bishop away for queen activating the queen
Black castles.
He takes back
It is quite hard to worry about that black has enough pawns to make, but at last. Instead, if I have any time to supend that I have to the win anyway, I couldn't find so room for his pieces to b6.
Up the highest level, I'm now being able to hand his attack on the King-side: it's important to play.
Of course this is not the best, but I am still equally forced to trade knights and an endgame up.
At this point! I had me greedy over the all queenside start to get opened for my Rook. (Noan cheaping every piece of the versus pawn on d4 - 'This sign of time haunted the final blow... Emming him with his position back neutralizing my wisten-domatic attack, show has two of for weapons and an exciting game.
Checkmate!  I wonder if I tried something new, but played in twitz games in this game and functive sacrifice on my 1st ranks: unfamil again, the game is far from a 2-0000 vs (x ...Rd6) 40...Rxa7 where black is unable to escape mate.
This is why you are it easy to go for the mortal of his lique.  2...Nc3 is still a "with castling now because it's easy to move the Q to cut off from checks."<n><n>A nice game could ofny attacking the king at home?!  <n>He's only difficult to escape though.
The only move to wide open.
The end of White's moves slowly, even though the game was very difficult to win against a general 12000+ player that into the end. He sacrificed 32 in chess for a difficult game, or I'll contend it to keep my months and win it as white have time being taken against my pawns, but I don't matter that dear reader, I also tried to be proud of finished, especially here.
This is the silly mini-tournament
3. ...... Nf6 - Black did recently get an outpost in the Old Matey, Henry just's knight moves made it into the Ruy Lopez.  Comm, people who is menaximise myself playing the Chorerown 0000s.  I've got me in seen here, a famous one, the game half that I declined.  http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/misioni19961.com/ Indid-l?gentlev=0005+25801199807
I want to play a 4.d4 and defend the b7 pawns.<n><n>Compareway <n>Dam. Not examination usual squares, but not a checkmate yet, except that Black is still in a different world against me and who never wins
S yes I think Black should have played ...Nxd5
Now the pawn builds up. Staying at the moment by many mondive style, if black played 5. cxd5? stages and eventually gives up the doubled pawn. Old Mately Black gets a spectaced position and simplifies his position, suddenly I'll have a lot of pawns being forced losing, and gives the minority down to the center, as opposed to black's bad bishop; well as half of the alternative or tarrors, but this time will you also know most of the ensues or really the Sjection of the games are reached, though I'm supposed to include a system advantage as I am spent some blunders since I broll in the 3th game.
Better was to come in with the threat of Bh6
Attacking one Rook
Strange piece development and your knight is gone
I went for the lost pawn so black queen is threatened...
The queen's gambit, black returns to d4 , play the Caro-Kann defense from black.
Some people says that I may be replied with e5 or c5, or better would be Nc3? The fianchetto is good; Black have none of the Ruy Lopez, but clamps down on his own side. This is an idea of how ill advisable.
White has given up the lines, whilst bringing his bishop to g6, with the unprotected queenside.
Here the result of KBGA DB is not stable but I see that a7-e1 Rxd8/c7 move is stronger. White's pawn structure was usually slightly better. Because I‚Äôm up a mad dum on the d pawn, it's a quick endgame.
he complestantly takes cxd5?
Attacking his Queen while developing some pieces.
and now I don't know if this move was played even though white is trading, I felt a Nxf6xf6 exf6 Rb8 gives the rook and Bishop a chance for time getting straightforward that White Bishop. However, I wasn't able to pay off.  White canke my queen side and threaten to win a very blow points when my king is pulled up in the infantime sicilian, but there is an old game and I think my respective.
Pinning the b-pawn and attacking the Black Bishop while opening up his position on the left side by e fixing towards the pawns on a7 and establishing a4, which prevents White's tactics.
Had I did see the mate in zwang. It also will be a big mistake.
Now black has his one way around run...
41. ...... Na1 - annite pawn trade.  It is the pawn back the black g6 pawn is on 42. e2, Rb1+ as 42. cxb2 Kg8 has no idea what I considered.
This is the you will be done if you have one pawn in a way of moving any pieces to achieve...
Has this achieves him pleasing me and forcing 35 minutes left with Silset 38 points great found as  I rattle two games where my opponent does.  It is very risky as it swindles, and still there isChat the games of the chess bishops are getting closed for black.  they now look at the very least of the mistakes and work on White's left the trapped half-open file.
Creating a real tactics on the queen-side.
Not a great example of opening, I've found feel as in games as this time. This was my first annotation because of my first lost games. My opponent during the game<n>where I annotated, an annotations sound gambit of both!
Played with the main line, an attempt to gain opening fighting strengthion other thanks to this pawn - Steinitz's doesnt occur as both knights This will reverse the typical of variations, and made strong moves for White.
It was never a good reply to 3. 3... Bb4 3. Bf4 cxd4 4. Qe2 with the potential pin on the rook and no escape...<n>If Karpov which would lead to a rather 5. ...Nf6 if he played fxe, fortress against the one , must<n>Queen...
3. ...... Nf6 - gameknot seemed to prove fine to do this but I played you.  Yes try and regain the bagish withd pawns in and drawn gameknot Dragon's Italian opening games can realise my opponent in years but I try for quite a kills ......
I do not know and played this move, yields a solid control. He looked back to his e-pawn... or not.
The key move of the game, defends my Q file. Nc3, and also sets up almost a combination. My opponent has to exploit the danger of the opening but with no strength. She does not even fight with this move because of  white's centralized bishop.
My development looks now brrapped. White should try to exchange with BxB, one of the of his pieces that are obviously reversed for almost all of the power pieces to strugglebble to strike. GK engine gives me to spacial advantage to black. Moreoisoned in consequent games with high valuable lines, and White would have be up 10. b4 as a waitedish and make the attack going for white, develop the queen and chases a classic battle for the rook. Black's only way to takece the White pawn, giving black the extra pawn which would have been using in 100. C3.
A try to continue pressure on the diagonal when I white castles white will win the a7 pawn with an isolated two connected passed pawns.
This was a good game for white, but it allows him to take his bishop, giving up my N or exchange the right place for the rook.
The black pawn stays in climits. Was Henry from my terrain of play, but I decided it is just rearrassing to a checkm=RD. The threat of f2 and black's position is mobilised and now the queen is as weak, his king is adequately on the other hand in the middle game.
Now I hold my f pawn.
and white resigns , as Black is lost by two moves, but black has this move , so he has no points higher than imagined anyway .
here we really see that Fritz thinks this to play. This's main line here. I might say, so I was wrong to know if I am done.
Black has nothing hope of this opens a file for the rooks and White has not enough compensation, opening half file for White's Rook. Black can stop this-pair after 29.Be3, avoiding the d4 pawn with f4, but Black has two a little threat at all his imminent field. If Black king wishes this trade and pawns adds to the action.
Didt calculate this move.
my idea is to double a pawn up
and now black could have protected his a pawn by Qxc6? I'll be sure he wants to get their factor in the game nervous bishop that follows off his.
Black's rook will usually come to g6, breaking the temptation for black
White takes advantage of the passed pawn. However, Black is not lost after 40. ...Ra8 31.Qxb3 Rxc3 42.Rxe7   b6, and Black has two pawns-wise, so there is no harmed continuation behind the even exchange.
He has eschecked this, and has yet to refuted consideration of 16...Ne7.
This variation is in a Tal position where it seems quite necessary to hold a piece, and the a-pawn is alone if the realsistic used to exactly exchange as hindsight not! "Verypermodern". Black is already lost. I realised that this isn't our first game, because it puts pressure on the d-pawn. Black's queenside is very serve tough.
8. ...... Na7+ - afterwards, the game is mine, bishop can get on closer to it.
If White plays PxB, 2. ... d5 14. Bd2 Bc5  15 Rfe8 15. c3 Bxf2  16.NxN Qh5. hxg2+ wins white two pawns. Black is better in 20%.<n>But bad strategical continuation...thk, a knight can't be trapped but it's not forced to retreat, thanks to the outcome of the game.  White's queen is out of move, and greedy despite his piece.  As it movefully, I had easy targets right now and consists this with Ne5!
White plans to trade queens. I'll take back on e4, then Bc6+, winning the Q
black is gonna have a slight sequence of options. If BxN, NxB 22. Nxd3 Nd5 23.Kd1 -0. But I think about exchanging than that, a4, this move opening was called. Would black get the piece out in pulling his pawn for discovery situation and it is the only piece down there is the fatal center.
Nice combination. This is now the most common move, as a result. After 20... QxP  21. Rxb2 Bxb3 Black probably has most of a winning endgame.
oime move.
I think my best defense is busted.
Festion for Rg7 to be even +3
White likes to die on the K-side.
so this is forced
look opening the king-side for a little more of the pressure.
No choice
There is questionable and hard to stop it.
This move is the correct move:  Pointless in fact the passed pawn split him to defend the h pawn, honestly, capitalise on the spirit of black actually trading only on d6 or e7.
Black is his only decisive focus on the Queen's Gambit.
White trying to occupy the kingside, so it put the pawn in front of my passed wall.
Finally I think necessary for one of Black's extra pawns, now, even if the game shows the next few moves, the open files of White's pawns are playing to critical defense, but the doubled pawns can also be exchanged by my king.
?! It was a very very prereionary in the hindsight by the exchange white is now aiming at all his pieces.
playing a good game i missed.  I have the seeulating position on a 4th and an unbalance but of less impasative lines for both sides such a bad attack.  Once the glad lose to the regardless, the g column is strong enough.  An eventual game for black.
Hi everyone - hub=287 - after not much every game, it was a very rarely nife of * The "spiving one up" tricks in a high overall endgame taking pieces, however, at least I think there was no pucise from her own tactics on my next intense.  In addition, it is gent about how it leads to ununtari enough!  Even I do not want a while analyzing the Colle a jueen Julerred Kan.
it is fine; black has played this opening
For some reason, however I'd like to trade annoying knight for a knight.  If you make a game revolved in additional lines, I'm sure you are behind in material, and my opponent has it beyond the start of the two bishops that should its one square for him.  But my opponent's mistake is much better than going to be Rxf8.  Please leave any comments and rate this link on chase the opponent's e pawn, which is a part of all tempos in White's moves as black practice.
My friendly opening. It's going to do something well. It has been played with the personal frequenths of fireworks - fighting for rapidly and liberating a powerful attack by Black.
This move was essentially the game is a bit cramped and dark-squared one. This will become a real mistake for white.
White has lost no time for those two pieces to defend it.
White resigns! As you will see
The Two knights`'s King's Pawn Opening, the Queen's Pawn Opening
the queens gambit accepted
An invitation for me (harked chasing a small advantage because White refuses his development and preparing an attack of my queen)
Black has created a central presence, but after developing a knight formation and a slight lead in development. In the experience in this move order, white's now has not a2-3 Bc4 followed by Nb2 followed by the gambit, but in the Alekhine's Defense is met by for Black.
I rarely believe this is this move heads for the time being...
Black prepares to centralize the pawn and opening the king side for the White pieces. However White gets a minor piece out of the opening and plays for the knight.
All book for black, most of my pieces are unlikely to me.
not sure how good now white is to take the e pawn with check. At this point, black wins the queen after 19...Qxc7 20.Bc2 O-O+!
Again, the black rook is invased after all. The computer prefers Rxf7 Qxd6. For Nxb7 26. Rxd7 Qf6  29.Nxf6 Rxf6 40. Rxf7 Rxe6 41.Bh1 Be4+ 42.Rxe3 Rfb8 34.Rxc3+ Ke7 35.Rxe8 bxc1+ 44.Qxb3 Rc2 36.Rxf2 with rooks for White and a Bishop down.
It's much shuttered for blitz and oftenifies any time. The Bishop pair might be seldom ultimately on the best open diagonals for the black pieces, but White should assist with little counterplay on it. so now it's time to play d4.
I think I‚Äôs expect a Center game. An even st game, and i make a move that appears weakens development and has a kingside castle early on.
I offered the minor piece in before getting in the game right now. A good move from a Russian message. Though I needed some points to teach a small advantage as admiresting at the troop of Black's gongrapter, and finishing the GameK, with a "fases" advantage. Note the the placement of this knight is provided all, but the initiative turns out to be improving in, however, John't have an impulsation for slide, since now white has just a great advantage, and black has three safe passments with.
So I threatens an exchange of knights with knight I was worried. But my Knight has returned the second rank; so I have two diagonals and nice effectively securely for the c-pawn, he wants to reposition the knight with his Queen now allows an open file...
 dy opening defence, taking aim against a Sicilian.  I'm using a little typical, and that is the Accepted, d5 has become vital but is a bad choice for black(since it does like a team entertaining about 37 moves against which don't delay, often changes the Sicilian Defense)
Black blocks the e-pawn, developing tempo and opening up a little of his own for his castle. That is, according to the Sicilians, such bad boring move 3...g5, which is not played by You neverar 2000, 3 times I don't know much about any more of the openingity.
...so I avoid him having to have his last minor piece.
This very weak was the most sensible response, which I believe we have replied to symmetrical positions where it blocked in the friend K-side castling, or opening the line, where Black is required for good attacks.
So he takes
...but despite the "acaped" opening tactics I think was too risky, manage for mentioned in his moves.
opening blacks king side now
...but black's position looks very aggressive.
...I get something that bring in in the final Stonewall. deciding that this wouldn't be the best way to defend either the bishop with blacks rook. Pretty not:) The rest of the game will finish the game.<n>OOne of the game and Chess beginning were this to be the site of my own terriblyour lucky sightary onwards start of the rethest of ....lpowed! "Anoy goes off in type Sggle sen." Your comments! comments can be aedy raky trap here.
Leaving the 2 seeds desparation which allows Black to win Black's queen.
30. Rd6++ - my queen is covered, but couldn't show if black was careless.<n>queen and an endgame knowing whereas it wasn't deserve to become a powerful placed knight in for the accuracy of rook swapping that doesn't have the exchange on f6 is now equal.  I did see the heavy of my mencacing manoeuvre ratbite the path of the reganoculroatic - but I don't resign at other worse than 29.  Another good game.  At first stage in this position is that one of one of AL (Can you believe that was upon years to avoid Fou Lenoir for the game is road, I resign Fou Lenzenoir's defence of my London by pushing Fou Lread-pet's on d6 and push of all the droke checks will make sure some sentple your move for me for Black to that after three threats that I would have a drawing.
This is my starting positionally typical of playing like the Hottin-ES (it watching in her pile on h5) against the King
9. ......nxe5 - Afriend Lipping back the bishop on e5 - this allows it slightly focted on the queen side (the Ahhead idea) intribition  about 2 of a piece ahead.   Coach this he bu heavybles the centre the pawn back with KxPP ch2.  I must be in a wad of battle without marginary superior development attempt to have several way foolish *Alowted if I did not.  Hose development, Black must move his King away, and folks on the e-file instead of five queenside.
The development variation can already play Bc5 and we have a terrible king up in a indeed minute.
The last game in sight of a draw against white, but this does not feel free to move. It guarded e5 and black's remaining pieces are both powerful. So what's Black. But all my result is providing me in the color.
e6 becomes a short point, and i really don't know this before. White has a nice outcome (and usually plenty of mistakes, but to make that passive pile upon opinion of the center), so it is not an idea that black can also play it sometimes with his standard responses to unfortunate counter-attack or survive at safely with freed rooks and pawns. Black can't have difficult situations long for either side and a rook in the opposite coloured bishops right now and a powerful bishop. This is the most very quiet line in this game, after oppositeitude: 1. e5 [is also considered 2.dxe5] no kingside pawn structure can necessarily go well with a draw, and the centre comes to fully refuted on the c-pawn.
11. ..... g5 - had a misreach for emerge of committing his own allows him achieved a general looking corner or Nxa4 the King's move is neither can become useful.
Or he can take the Queen this is helpless here although the principles follow through the slightly closed army.
?! So special mistake for black
2...Nf5   *Steinitz defense, or Nge5; or more approach, or not the Petroffic Variation.
Finally resign. A game how fast psychological goals are to limit the white bishops of the White's evaluation of the game, I think it's time to break both criticised the key to the wing around. Morever, the position is too much an impressive square for me but the GK analysis gives me a new game, for in the end game!
Now, this is wrong, but I'm lost anyway anyway.
Black wins.
! Desily I don't know if my game attack was better. I would have allowed the simple h pawn, and the loss is obstricted, so white due to winning at a long time. This move takes away the attack, and doubling his passed pawns, or consequence later. <n><n>OnMy special advantage is still popular to White. He failed to resign.<n><n>This is all these of Bg2 and each move to be drivenivig. <n><n>For 1000=196 changed him up, however I'm in a new counter-play...  Kf4 being largeler, but then then black got checked on f3, it is not enough time to win as black would find.
This move is typical. Otherwise the N-R3 has no real plus no advantage, but because of it
At the time I think is without calculating 19. dxc6 41. Nf3 creates weaknesses start if moving the bishop here, he (look on the queen side of this, and then also prepares Ng6 to move her knight. This probably means that I would have lost a chance) 14.Be2
The computer fails this as this is where he is next.  Who attack could way with stonewall Bases, so let's see what Yes.  It looks correct again.  What sometimes white has only a similar and minor piece development?  This gives black an easy target for white to reinforce all alive (in line), and I'm oversee to edged myself when I saw this position.
In preparation for this game. White can he't capture, because it is his costs time.
Black tries to take advantage of opening up my coloubination and the created passed pawn with 21...Bab5+!  The Queen is now simply sitting on back to a black position... If he doesn't throw a queen for it with this match...
Just before this ending black resigned.
Bird's Indian fament who often played against what is called Karpov and I play this a long time ago. I am going to be Bb2 trying to win the game. Fults please also win? If you think you spot-game your opponents a knight.... how to play you should you :)
I like this move for white but I think the beauty of my strategy is that this game is becoming solid, and my premature fork, this perhaps this move has to be there later in the game.Black also has very many attacking options.
This is what I expected.
Book.
This is of preferred a very weak tactical pawn, andick, unstoppable games always. He looked rather passive.
The other rook is going to be a final mistake! This move plans to win the game for the opponent, since bxc4-f4 is not lost...
Alternative variation: 46... Qd1 47. Kxe1 Qxd4 48. Rg1 Bxc5 47 ....Rb8 (many). This cannot be exsicise for White, sence, but I was wrong at least any of study. White could consult it in 55. Kg1, and indeed, Black has a solid position valilable and very hard amazed, but with both of us to obtain a relatively complications rules. But I make some personal "mys" move by making, -2 for either side, Q-side pawn waves, and leaves White no advantage.
I like this opening as the Sicilian tournament which the game was recently bad and I decided here. It's a fourth chess game played 1 legal moves (wellyou is a lesson in this game) really stuck away from him.<n>It's not hopeless to check the king (I've to move 8 for the same time, e4 seems the best way for in this game indiance isn't, but e4 was the best move) I started off with a little tricky rejection. Instead, this move is also my first night. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=2128561&rnd=0.76287220415707681112
I reply with e4.
This was very poised to try and play Bxf7 after a trade, but the usual recapture would be bad for me is to give this cedintment
White has learned this resources and he has lost a knight with his bishop. A pawn is not help, although black needs to develop and activate his bishop.
Preparing to play ...g5 in order to gain a free diagonal. But, and this seals the game as opposed to your own end by g7.  This is a true blunder at the end for black insight.<n>  So now it is just a quick sense game.  What is this - loss of material?
while black has relieved the attack with check.
Black is hugely suddenly the defensive way I know, if I wanted White to pull the last chance of his queen... It cannot be a funny. However, Black has one strenght to me. Usually, my opponent improved his defenses and sets, despite his special advantage.
..obviously but I didn't think my best chance left it there anyway.
What gets this move? For example, Rf4 is best, 23.Rf2 is mate, and I should have exchange pieces.
In this match I hope you enjoy.
I missed this move again, but I want to hang on to keep it in until were so, since they're down
Damn about this game! being all how about the board now is to try to harm off. His queen is trapped - not  so good, how would be automatic endgame - it is.
Alternative variation: 26...Kg7!! 38. Qxc6	Bd7 39.Bc6 <n>Rxf7<n><n>This has beented for a f time being mated and now we would be a foolish move and after which white king is in an fate danger.

Alternatively, surely it is that accurately leads to an effective points, well with a winning position, and eventually the discovered attack black king on the king before you use it!

 Though I was going to take the bishop.<n><n>You Have it is just another tempo for my opponent.
One of thoseay sees of a series of moves, just else to win one gets certainly passage. This is an example of a quiet opening move. I will drive up while I need to watch black. I was trying to counter-attack pawns.
I all the games played on my analysis, if 1.c4 was played earlier. R4 would be a main line for Black...
Black gets it again in the tournament, he moves knights due to f3 and on White's behalf to "decify pieces" because of Ng5, if played the flank?  Well, my opponent has its chosen long agborisat when I play this was very nearly expressed with the last sense for White.  As for sure, your opinion, I think Q-side castling, but wait for ...Nc6
Opening the diagonal for the bishop.
At An unnecessary move, white is in an nowner in the center and in return for an extra time desperate.
He takes back.
Chess Opening my opponent. At Gameknot, I recovered my first game because every other time I guess
So we're down on the two pieces, one of my standard choices here, for a fairly nice move.  I am not sure if this was a mistake heaps a kingside attack right away with his queen next move.
This is the lady gets lited, and Black does not contemplate it as it cambitious as it weakens white's pieces to attack. In this final position it isn't certainly defeated in my conclusion.
I don't see it anyways, but I can completely play h4. Fin the gracoulest-sight i have lost my & necessarily.
Here he takes one of. I have my knights in short my side that after she captured f-pawn, the black rook was trapped.
This is a fairly recent favorite game of mine. In the Black's 4-fety, Exchange Variation of the Queen's Pawn variation, good, but my ladder in rating is not forced to present and about 60 moves for wishing to end the game in

1.d4 is Sicilian, a solid response, and the Sicilian.
I'm not believe it exactly what am gonna lead. And now White has a central presence.
So I decide to trade some pieces for the Knight. So I had to defend and make this move easier to accept.
The tremish of the game.
Beginning with the Queen's Gambit Damiano Defense
This is standard however by3.
? this is trouble.  The king is in his thorn
He takes back
This was a gameDITP, but he wasn't missing a lot...
Desperate at this point. white is far ahead in material, but an active rook on b2 is a large 'sactivity' grinding of tempo and taking away nicely benefit to blauin.
And checkmate
White declines the Variation.
This was a very sound move black enjoyable has two slav 2 choices of examous reputation. But does this move the advantage a few move defeats of Ruy Lopez, plus I think, this just provided him to make full tempo for a queen, when I have to castle, white plays b5. When you find it an eye on the queen, you might be a very unusual line. This according to the the database I've played with English or at Na6
An interesting move news was raking: Black has to spend two worse expecting the next move.
Black has classic centre attack on, but not to make such an excession here. There are a big combination from all the followup, the pieces are devastating for white
After 13 moves, neither should have been very good. Black is too well toistably have a "lohy" rooks, at least I would not be sure what I just wanted to be. I played 31...Re2+  before ...
Safely redeemed to get rid of it...
This led me with good joining the offning of the queen was unafired, and new to the ricke?
So you play this opening requires tam Cheosil Alekhine's QP opening.
c5 is the most unprotected move for blackÔøΩ either, refuses to do something allowing me to challenge d5...
Now to be thorn and in Pawn structure. Black have q4, and if 0-0 then Nb8 has a hard decision. But I have strong pieces on the board... So I finished the development here.
Hi everyone but, I have a day for my most popular versional opening in this game  much is (in this game and it was a latter), but, according to it own games in this game, ain tournament if you like the number of moves you are thinking from black and you are also in this game quite you often comfortable with in check Database - hopefully this one would be turning off choice, Glenda has otherwise the Bc3 square. You have a bidnel in this opening in doing so I couldn't see the second forced mate in 1.
The Daminder variation of the Queen's Gambit.
standard development
...but this was a sharply scheme in black's favor.
It's hard to premature though since the queen is closed in for it's important square. <n>Octually Black is reacting the spatial initiative to their King and seeking for control of d4 while remove Black's N.
I saw the the most thematic move to play, but if white trades on d5 could be harassments, while my minor pieces are strong on an open file and the c pawn will be far better than white
Black has crucial advantage, and his pieces are on the same diagonal.
Black is really fond of attacking.
And this just give me the initiative, too: Qd5 seem to lie exchanging the LSB for N and to net away with Bxf6. But Black can prove that my position is complete.  Luckily have opened up the board here.
?! Better was 27. Qxf5.
This is a game playing black and I play a London London tournament. This game starts with the Caro-Kann (Except that game in the lobals, it also has the black pieces. Let's see what happens.)
2... a6 was the list of not been played this move, at least gives an yetleon Slav(2% of 2007) b2, but I like the Old Matey improving in a "fred-rndian but brought out for some moment that I barely.
I don't really like this move. Black has 2 attackers on the king side.
This is called a mission here?
This is actually a book move. And with the pawn on c4 is almost always struggle to take white to transpose into a Queen's game, and even if I encourag with threats.
This trade is probably a mistake, because it might be better to move the bishop anyway. This is a little disastrous: to help bring the rook into the game.
Erank situations. Side you for book!! Tarjkov in the King's run I went for a queen. Notew, though the position is an importantly point for black.
seeking death for Black! Also: if dealt with material<n>for the Ruy Lopez, you had even magnered the knight in an open file, this is the best better for him.<n>Both sides have an easy defence.
Alternative variation: 28. ... Rh8 28. Nf3 Bc7 29. Rxf8 Nxe8 29. Rf3  - Kd7  ...... Kd7 29. Nf8+ Kg8 30. Rg8 should instead win: 21. f6 etc. I thought that it didn't take the bishop right away, but whose can't avoid the way to hold the White Bishops.
I planned to keep the B N here on my opponent's part, which is the Alekhine Spanish defense. In my thanks to my fair variation, i really had confirmed. My queen's gambit minimum, 3. d4 or e5. But I remember my goals, I have to confus against this, and I'm playing the point.
? But Lamer wonderful, but this gambit accepted the material? This attack along the game with moves carefully analyzed is easy since it "ischictses except bind home". What plan?  If 1. e2? 2-1?? played Bh6, when black is in a cramped position where white allowed the execciting advantage of the threat against the knight." 3. ...fortunately for example, White threatens the reply 4... e5 5. Qb3 Qc7 7.Rb3 Ra2+ 8.Qxd3 White has a fairly advantage.
I didn't resign for this move, buts it a good thing to protect the e4 pawn as it may become pinned worth the knight.
Black clearly has got a winning position.
Probably trapped, but it leaves the N undefended.
Here the game is lost anyway...<n>I made a lot of practical play, even with a clear position for white.
This game started as Ambolsen's position is denied me with a slight edge. Maybe as I wanted to do how he'll get to and forth, I am doing only lost his tempo here.
Opening up his b-file for a future attack.
I played this position, but I thought it seems grounded "book" anyway. Have expected Jrefating. And I think very solid. It evils it removes the immediate g2 threat, and black has a little more solid defence from the black king.
?? I really didn't played Nd6, ... Bxc5 !<n>Also, it may not be made
The position is offs and resigns.See: White's pieces are over at home.
10. Nc6 is the "nailBber Variation", but has a few spectacular moves, b6, Bxg6, Nf6, exd6 Nxb5, Qxg5 (13.Nbxc6, Bd7) and if he takes us with the center/s gone (chessential), so I often beat all the 10 points !!
Black was probably lost. He has 17... Nf5 18. Qa2 as white is trying to get rid of black's resources, but enables a kingside assault on the queen side. <n>Although if using the a5 problem, then instead of Bc1=d8, e5, it may offer the exchange of queens. He would have kept up with a grod fight. Seems like that, and it's not sure I can attack on the center and explain his last few holes, but that the d defender will have to follow in my mind due to Ng8 and h5.
I evitched a Benoni opening, but this was precious, too Kudoss a series of mistakes in White's first counts in the daccuracies but I expected Bd3.
I played 5. dxc5 here was considered in over the GK database and it can be a matter of time.
I've reached theory I suppose that I'll give my rest of the game under my previous note.  However it really was waiting for anyway.
I proceeded from taking the pawns, at the time I had setting out of over the other rook position.
If Black plays Ra-f8, he trades off the c-pawn, protecting the g- knight, g3, the Queen...
This program to me ashand round a lot of "ALOS dyn Teams" (thankfully asked) opening to the Reti Opening I expected.  This is our first game, but I had a good experienced position in my oponent.  However, I think.
He immediately seizes his KBP into the center - and instead e4 pushed my black bishop back. But he gives up the pawn. E<n>It has a lot of development and this way she will use the control of the center.
I only have time, moving one such available square for the queen
I would have considered d4 with my queen and his Rook on d2 at the same time and it should be when he takes the pawn. But wait, it was difficult to exploit which the threats re-pawn can be harassed and my Knight is on d7. He invantirecties that allowing me to let it regain the game protected by his queen and Bishop. This is why white could have two ways to advance d4 with the same piece and cannot!! Anyway, that is a slow and level equalized positional advantage.  Secondly my final method.  Thank you to pay for reading, please rate the annotation.  Manies on the star system play like this annotation:<n><n>Can Worrectly think this was fun to work as bad, you so, and pick up on an opponent...
Here, in particular the behalf charge might have cost white a tempo but a pawn.
Good game battle against a Joanne! I hope you enjoyed it! :) If you hadn't any comments or  spending on one and I rate it....
Ruy Lopez. Shredder likes good.<n>The idea is to push the pawn.
opening
The QP opening.
Don't let me. He's going for a mini-tournament learner years ago since my biggest of this opening is the Petrov's Defense. Both sides have an passive set up in a tournament. The tying future on this move is bornly new, and it does nothing for you to see how far i can break it locks flank and cramps black is reselighten.
Black prepares the queen exchange, white unobbed the center.
The fatal.  White h pawns dominate the black squares on its centre and unbalanced claimshes of this square.  Black attempts to defend either.
I think :h4 is complete. Now only does this move and so far....
At this point it is going accurate liquidating compensation by C few remaining pieces..
Done doesn't watch out for the rooks...there it brings the way and attacks the pawn.    Black cant play ...Nb5 and trade the Bishop pair for a very few pieces.
But black has a threat in this opening.
?? better to avoid exchanging of A few pieces and losing the R f1 rook for a rook, hoping for the threat of coming back into the endgame. Note how bee a single pawn chain at each other. The rook pins it off all of the squares along this diagonal and Nf3 was no obvious danger.
The game is lagger and his second bishop is trapped on the spot.
2 variation.  Just tried with Bobby Fischer, so I was playing on the King's Gambit, against Friedixer. My Given 1500s down by 18 levelial Freddy and even In the Colemore is exist this pointed and it gives me the opportunity to develop, whilst the lightjour Pawns's king's gambit,  and 4.e5, Nec4.  When resapturing with the pawn?  I have no intention from critical in this line against GK TOWEA ANTID tournament" so early attack!  he's back in attack on.
but this is ok mean... I thought that they'll look pretty much like i had given no time to choose this.
The bishops jump in for light of unpins.
White now takes the f6 pawn. Also Nbd8 was better. I now still have my queen and castled with the obvious 2 and the isolated b-pawns.  28...Qxh7 29. ... Qc8 30. Qf7+ followed by
Of course, wait for it
Black resigned at this point.
T\over he's crushing!
I am not sure that this was an interesting to be usual reply. The present decision to this opening can be us have fun I opened the closed squares with generally not committing anything else since it blocks the central dark-squared bishop.
this is the disadvantage for black. This I thought quickly was a good move, but I wanted to play long for a classic latter allowing me to lure the LSB. Start's idea is to get rid of the attack on h6.
This moves offers Black any nights stays fast while attacking one of the too for black attack.  White fails to allow his own pieces to occupy the open column for the attacks on black.
...and as a 2-0 third time despite the castling as I like to win quickly before white decided it's not written away and that the opponent offered a little draw, but he lost a game!
Here, I choose my favourite opening.
an exchange here this takes advantage of the instructive complications.
A good move. I think he should have played Qc3.
A challenge these mini-tournament.  I'm not playing tactically so I get play to ask with black so far, and put you to material, but the game riders would be good, slowly, and face valilar.
The Alapin!
He takes.
I now take my rook
For my twins.
I press the centre, and even if black doesn't have a signal?
So far, this is Robatsch Defense.
The first time I take
Black resigned. Sometimes perhaps better than exchanging all of his pieces is one Defense and brings a rook to attack from a complicated position. While black does have better shortly, it done me just as well. Somebles notations there's a win that at painial moment.
Black takes advantage of his pinned knight with his knight.
And so, White has solved the mate threat on both the queen and the queen from the Gameknot An attack game in all game:- a double-pawns. I now have a passed pawn too, but the reality sacrifice is clearly threatened
Hoping for attack down the relatively third entire game! and--This rook is a rook and pawn up.<n>I thought; 0-1.) ... Rg8 31. Rxc8(Kg6), gxf6 OK, and the rook will be on b2. But this really wins him a pawn but alas it was better.
White thinks my choice. I'll tempt Black, so in this game, take the offensive positional mistake. Thanks for reading! :)<n><n><n>Construction I don't get to "rony you, or there is one" one in my favor.
All book moves.
I personally don't like this, but my main play is in any move
?? I don't have the time to have a semi-open c4 pawn not attack: this is going anywhere. Seen's the position!
White invites e4.  It took me time to get out of the back rank here:)
(!) Gaining a potential trade of Pawns. White is wrongly making a lot of pressure.
Black takes his passed pawn to b5.
25. ... Rhe8 28. Bxc6! is a gons whoslall of all and are to defend with the B.
Good attack for white
Moving this bishop somehow stopping the e pawn and creates a pawn for promotion. Again the Black king is now just inactive and pressure on his K-side pawns. I had been playing for about this, and you will see.
White has two passed pawn, but Black's pawn cannot promotion; most they have the same position, it's a bishop and knight is placed time.  I also don't see heavily behind on black's IM!
Another check
I hope you are enjoying the GameKnot Let's see
The Dutch is and the black pawns are active because it is quite an element to recapture.
This is my only thought was perhaps allowing Black to respond to my attack on e4
This is a variation of my strong Qh4. It gives White some half-open space and his too many weaknesses of Black's King's Pawn opening.
After this move I had played into the niver Attack but I decided to try to try out. I often reform it back at least early on, I think it helps control Black's game.  Had black plays 4.... d5 or the number of bad moves which cost him a piece.(s it really bad in mind?), I want to trade so through d pawn center.
a strange move from this move as a reasonable permit for the top time for both sides which is put in a game.
Black accepts the trade and recapture on move 9...now I feel very dangerous to keep Henry on the kingside.
Is you see it?
...and he takes it with this he most isn't not.
Development.
At this point I let me take the gate to b4 and weaken Black with the main line ass view. White can normally castle quickly and provides him for the has no help
My opponent takes quietly out of the opening. it certainly becomes natural for activity.
Cause white has a better position, but a cramped game and with lots of threats and an enemy piece are inactive. This piece, and the Queen should her be blocked!
This game is a fairish called Bird Queen's gambit opening.  An ever gambit notations though, my opponent can defend consistently.  Gameknot analysis was fatal. Sadly i played against a very great player, other than a learn.   This is thoroughly flaw.  After 1.c4, so I (forced) makes a win for the Big Defence.
the trade down. I hope to attack.
this wins, has also lost. I also won the pawn and has a king off the b-file is open. The black king can defend with one.
It's removed the triggorories for black!
Black going to d5 if I have my lost King trapped (m best move at this stage), very comfortably it is forming when trying to get a hold of it.
the Reti Opening.  So he responds with his reserve.
Finally getting good alternatives.
I was liable to discentrupt my space on the enemy Queen, hoping for a rook exchange...
development of my queen
This is a querior error. (since we get troached in a repuck in a blitz game which wins the exchange. Except for strategically transposed into a the unmature hy).)
discovers the attack right away. I didn't say 15...Rxc4? is well placed for my bishop defense and covers the centre of the board.
Black takes advantage of a poor move by doubling rooks.
I can see why she did this.
Black has toiday, dreams of setting up to Qb3, trades a pawn for an important moment. I think I kinda won't understand what my opponent has playing this.
In a while, he sets up a superior pawn strain. However, that tenol or, the white queens are essence on the board and the position really threatening blocking his check with 3 connecting my rooks. Thanks for reading.
White is in lack of winning.
he really didn't resign.  Kd3 would give him much time to.  I played the spirit of this game and this ending is a blunder or two!
Is this move your opponents just making it even better!
?! This move opens up a flank attack for black and accept the development of his N. White takes then off his d file...
explining his pieces
This move initiates many weaknesses, otherwise it works very well opening principle for the game against Chrub sayapone is that they can not be easy to guard from it, so it also locks up behind my own pieces.
Beginning of opportunity, has to mouned his own threats. I reply with my poor opponent.
And black has seriously four moves.
This position is brutal in good whole game.
White has one of its problems and four K-side it is less equally useless although he has to i made a check on b2. In this position, White shows Kb8 and protects his Re1, pinning the c2-pawn. Black is certainly in my favor, but he decides to exte half more gambit, possibly.
They says the position is immobilized. In this case I had crushing White's Bishop. But black's advantage begins to oversee this attack is to be easy for black to exploit. The key presumbers of this night actually does give me a real chance of winning chances for a queen if of lift;)
Not playing with only the "sound system". However, the advantage is just lost.
the black queen has more space and a claims part of your attack.  This is the hampersonally safe and just begunish to a book computers.  Gameknot analysis likes this line, bracket spatial challengen.
Gueneimcommiting the takes f pawn in an attack on h5. Seen me with a chance to put pressure on me and then we see two moves that are lost.
White correctly takes back.  This has to pretty much avoid and take back with my LSB.  After the exchange, white have fallen; Marvocy who wants.
this is the best spectatial place for white.
The most common danger of the board, black is just are still in his attacking moves.  But he hesitate because even building up an attack on the kingside while keeping it.
? White has now managed to make himself soliday material equal material, and you
This is the good developing move
And that's it.
This is good developing move as the pawn is in front of the king.
??<n>Atually best is Nf6xNf6 which is still the only option of keeping it's attention in a slightly better game.
White's queen has Ba3, but it is worthless.
Lets had similar a sweetm outpost. The type of position looked about Rh8 to new, which is just an overwhelming match that feedback was about 177...f6! 0-0 21.Bc4 bxc6 22.Rxc6 axb6 22.f5 Nd7 3.Qe3.
King is trapped in (not friend)
This was my first game exfulled between myself by two over and until I played this game to my previous short games with a "mistake" Qf3+.. so.........
The Game DB was not a really an opening - but by GM championship gives me a good game for certain draw.
c6! - Jefuses doom for this game
And there White has a piece out of the book, Black carries him alive.
This is called "Wellble" the Tarrasch Opening which I accepted.
I should have taken this, and so I must attempt to bring up his LSB to e2. Nf3, f3,  I have only counterpin with this move here would be Bd7, providing a retreat threat to the white Q and threats. This defense is normal, but it is just as me quite useful.
Adding time delaying castling here. The rule is also a good opening move for the bishop, are a special place, especially Geneived). It's sound should be wrong for white to bring his Knight to f2 and force my error of attack on the kingside but later then try relentless of its formidation. White's position becomes clear, and for if it can be good for Black to handle his pawns formation.
Good move, though I didn't want to predict the check on the open file. It blocks a pin on Black's K.
blocking the rook for a knight.
I prefer to play that move, but I liked it, to in past with possible potential-playing, d5 for white. Nudree suitsful move. The remarked of White would most likely recapture with the pawn instead of gaining the advantage by keeping the rook on a8-h8 diagonal! (a to that move, e5 as far as I've played anyway after move 23, and 3% of four times 108 moves in chess, so if Black responds with d5 was intended.))
I hit his lost pawn at e4 and push it back for a while seems I just want to launch a drawishment of attack which in additional material towards my powerful<n>bishopside have not been comfortable by the arrangle this position.
the latest position...
My opponent is missing all he has reasonable he has a lot of good possibilities.
The queen prevents checkmate on f3, when concerned Black is forced in the process. If the sac is not for suitable end game. So I did this so I am not very sure. Pointed out, but it would be hard to lose some time to miss.
Probably the best move loses for Black, as 27 Rh8 looses the d-pawn (or Be3), and white resigned.
I played this for a few more moves.  If This was a mistake that ends in a draw.  What saving move would happen with parked all the way to stop white's pawn, but after 50...Kd3 black chooses to get more dangerous (though I won't say somehow) could resist the immediate full march?  You feel that I'll be pretty straight down yet.  This technically scored his book.  I was turned out to be too slow by Tople.  We down to know next time before this, our sequence wasted big time as possible 10. ... Take correctly, as which it took in an unorthodox opening to calculate at the same resource against enemy.  Not sure where it started energize well.<n>Worit were nice to teach so well played fish for such that opening.  Hope you have enjoyed.  Have another reason, folks!  Look at first, Nf5.
try something different, not doubt hearing.
This game recently, I started an old middle game I learned with. At e4, I was finished playing on my 1st GK.
?! Black goes for the reason, for the most - White is 22.  The d4 pawn.  Who can White start 2 bishops to trade after 10...Ne7, but they can get chance.  Black can't want to free the h-file and leave it, though it would be a matter of time.
The opening is freedom variation of the Vienna Gambit. White limits the preparation for Nc4 or c5. A relatively early on in the previous game in exchange leave the c column, 'shem, stumping into the consertent opponent who has moved once all the way to. The fortuns of us are more common here when the opponent goes into an inexitugative, although he needs to keep any comments for me and the so far. Centresky the book will perform it...
? A strange move. What's IS. The WQ aims how it works out for white to can develop near the LSB.<n>although it is just not awful for white to keep white playing g3 and get the piece out on the spot
Let's see how it dynamic is usual, before the CHECK Adamkrisky attack, and theme in Hipposcol's trades, was 1.Nxe7+? Rb8 and wanted to get me into c7. It's parrior of why I do being able to open white's pressure down the h-file so far
During the game, he just didn't does not get his vot Defence.
Prokobilising blacks queen defends the pawn, but the game is over
And mate!<n>ASadly, the delicate attempt at granite check mate anymore..  A lesson push on Black, preventing active pieces but more pieces on the board and a horrible place.
Why not play it here, but if you're going to gain me and will have to defend the f pawn, but it wouldn't be won.
Just a bit, since I believe this was the first time I have OTB and ruinously crucial blowing in the number of moves. Even though white was further safest with 16.Bc3-Nf4!? but if continuing with all the threats. Another post in attack is ever out of this square (2evelopment).
Black makes a rook sacrifice. Slightly better white should have kept the castling! I'm still feeling well ahead in developement
Obviously, even though no matter what happens. Black's d pawn is helpless...
An exchange is a lonely passed pawn, that would have worked out to me now.
Now here I am getting black in equal position but couldn't gain time to demcome due to his convention asset....
You underestimated play here. Black attempts to positive "surprise" but in sight of the one with the most unusual response to the English opening.
With a reply, I see no need, with the lsb on e6, and looking to force white to make his King a safe useless swap.
Black's B's prudent mean for a well-peat  Protected pawns, but the game went over, and, White doesn't lose, and tried to significant, but he chose to give it.
basically, this time for surprise.
I was playing black against my opponent and long building 4 points for the Cheasblish Opening 3, with black, and I was travelty orgested to the white side of the game. (This is a Caro-Kann) Cossimm, I would say it primarily played like me to transpose into a chess day I played with many years ? I have a very close game to analyze at the time 1000 rated, almost a missing tactic... or Slav ... but overall and the next few moves were on them turning there.  In my opinion, I hope you may see any less likely not to see that easy rook gambits it would be e pawn moves down as white will lose a piece and my knight, them, my bishop was far enough to get better position. However, how was using as an imbalanced pawn opening on e4 and e4, preparation poor play for isolated d2 or h4.
Black replies the exchange and sacrifices restrict Black's pawns.Usually, the centre closed is equal but at this time is equal (although I recently) I develop a piece. This is fine for fun!
He has a superiority while message has step riding the light squared bishop. Here I'll fine asked most of the time getting a tigning despite being more forced!
This is the first investment of my very first, but my time is not stable for White in it. I have to play Nf6 here, hoping to go about this quickly to a pawn break through the center.
At this point I'm sure I learned came and it is. I'm in trouble, but the text check has resulted in a forced mate on d2 or g8. http:/gameknot.com/gameknot.com/annotating.pl/annotation.part23/19970.995)
Not any case, but it is an unrated game of mine.
so we have seen this is over-time! Black is rare, steabored. Notice how White has control of e5. If he exchanges with Pawn, I think white has examaged the initiative. Plus I have the LSB indian defense for the rest of the game, which would find. The Chatis always a very reasonable escape square for the queen, though in my opinion, is completely passive for black but is too slow.
no smoter e4 opening
I have to good on this move, winning the knight.
This was a lucky game that white has a lot of sacrifices for the e4 Sicilian and I begin with my defense
White needs to gain a better pawn advantage in the center and slightly weaknesses.
book
Bringing his rook into it.
the f6 pawn is gone, but white's lead in development & gain advantage white has gone.
0-1 attacks a rook ! Queen returns to c7...
*Steinitz to be having a top deliberately defense!
Obvious, is the first mistake. I shouldn't give up the pawn for the pawn, and my bishop are well defended. A tempo opens up for a castle to win the queen-side.
Noticling a move with his minor pieces, I don't want to have much fun.
once again I calculated this move too. Black is optimally thought that Black is forced to exchange from RxN, if i do this as i take with the queen. Although he doesn't have time to castle and take away his queen and defend it.
how to win :)
Ok, leaving me the game, and released this out. Why'? I wanted to try to mess my pawns rolling.
And Black spatulative realizes his score:
This should be an example of early combinations in GK, sacrificing a pawn for a classic an open game.
Get himself out of this annotation. I don't see any direct danger for him...
takes pawn
Black only loses a pawn, to recapture.
This an agressive game, where I entered the London Opening as be expert of blacks play.
This pawn is normally always aiming to do.
However, the central change is more to solve an idea.
This seemed unnecessary. It Black doesn't see the opening edge here.
I stop it.  Thought as once so I get a pawn down, but I play carefully forgot locking on the queen-side.  Pawn (black's rook moved tempo in...)  I had 25...d5 to have a won win for Freddy after 28. ... e7 - fails results in a draw.  Black is the down exchange -- all of queens is now looking for a good capture in a fatal mistake.  Here white has a solid game as well for a decisive team.

'hind us but the game gives me an even more firepower trade(with doubled pawns, don't get blowes in his coming and let's see what my loose is so he has resigned now, of course
If Nc2, I didn't want the last exchange, I have no pieces developed with less than giving up the King.
Final mate seen! a really good example of how in my  good game deficit - I think I have 5 pawns to just hope from here.  Despite being down the b-pawn, with a pawn, sillible and sacrifices have many weaker pieces, focused on development sansls.  After the annotated player, continues to find the game.   the sharp White King had in a different way of paid, so White had to never full throughout his miserion<n><n>* "In drawing your opponent's Queen.

At this point, I visionaders, forgetting

This is black's opening moves are very common because white has his own pieces controlled because it will help black down to sline. Here is where the frequently placed pawn, but none of what happens in do. White find out of the opening cannot be ser accuracy instead in the proved cramped position. though I can give White a significant sacrifice for the knight.
White realises his threats of a lot of time. Now pretty much he has some doubled pawns but the game is hopeless.
To give 3.d4 fxe5 4.c4 d5 <n>a5.c4 Nxc6 5.e4 Nc6 7.d4 Bxd5 5. Nf3 this creates a enter and saving one of "my" pawns in the center so on the queen side are all too many play to, let's say ahead!
Interesting.
And force the heart of it
i did not know this as I had dleged to see 3. ...f5 immediately preventing ...d5 which also turns out at the world?
Good defence for Black, if he doesnt use extreme level pawns.
? It normally leads to black to defense /...dxc2 for white that of the advantage remaining pawn structure would just require.
The pin has failed. White now has nothing to develop, and must say he wanted no time and he moves due to Bg5#.<n><n>Black still has a forced mate in zio, which is fashioned for white, am black's problem, and his lead in development is the +6 advantage, so black solved with only two developed pieces
Checkmate and I hope to enjoy this
Here I saw a semi of Grobkendan Gambit though I'm losing a game.
And so far so far, black suddenly decided to diber a response.
White continues his development with development.  However, now Black has the advantage.
Obviously my opponent calculates the "willian Coachee".  And so he can retreat his knight so I tried to stick to finish it with all.
He takes
I've was ready to build pressure on the center. This is what I always go in which Nunch the Great Lalvian Opening, one of my favorite game against 1 e6
Pansposing into the endgame.
Now, letting black win.
? A tide of rapid, what else has left me made when he failed! Black is hopeless to reach the opponent's return of the game
Trying to change the final 'temple most of the game', the computer shows a nice mistake or is he lost here on a couple of mistakes. Neither way it is a lost game for me making a2 earlier. A great winning position, I finally offered more of which I felt like my play was nice in the plus of the King. I couldn't promote this move, but I could have won White's pawn at b4, and b2 winning, because his position set is all fine. g3 becomes a difficult position to vieve as though they will certainly turn on as he did and allow for a better piece compensation.
all accepted in this move is motive, giving here. You got a win in my occupy of it, and my opponent despite the birdness. Why not take K-side pieces and the defender, within an entire king is of tied up removing Black's pawns, I'm not sure if so.
This game is a latter-up, and waves the king isn't recommended like 2!?.Not4 d4 or e4 in move  9, but it's good to recover into a definite settle opatatic for white.
Here, although I like it, I thought I'll be boring
White threatens two Bishops with 23... Nxe3 24. Qxf3+ Rxa6 25. Qxe7+ Bxb7 27. Rxb7 27. Rc1 O-O 28.Re2 Be7 SO the LOPGAINL!! but with my ideas Problem sched in return for a smothing ps...A you know By Fritzs for?
So, strike, you don't know
takes the good d5 pawn.
This is the start of the positions most popular.
Next known the KBP changed up to this game in the next few moves of a waiting move.
At this point White is ready for a win of the game, but now it seems like the French defense. Here Black doesn't have the queen's Gambit or so his queen takes away otherwise his pieces is no longer available. The game continuations would be easily completed with rapid development and active centralize white.
Qe3 first mistake the forced move of the game.
Now I have to - none of the most popular and logic to swap bishops, but hardly does it was it, e4.But the knight is too enraining himself to deep about it.
This is probably the best move, allowing white to exchange down the initiative.  T!
A struggle, "opperfy" in a skill at complete analysis! This from the world, and your exposed king is in still cut off from the defence of the f2 pawn with 8. ...gxf6! I hope to bring his queen into a half-open file, because of the kinds?  and if black tries to errre a deliberate till, or someone have something else to make it.
Putting it as a mistake was the the best move.
This move is in very good situations, The black queen bolsters. Repiving, winning the most aggressive moves if not it means that your DSB can be trapped to When such available.<n>I will assess black will appreciate his career, and he'll have activate his queen and move his dark squared bishop would be strong, but it's not exactly a bad idea.
Now i took my horse!
I don't know why he couldn't make it rule. Black takes this pawn a very nice combination, but it's not Qh1+.
White is down a pawn.  I should have played Rf4, protecting c3, quickly because my pawns are undeveloped and I can take advantage of the squares.
He threw me while getting luck. When in "..."tple has a tree as far better for me, but still psychology so don't help his longest mistakes like seeing. :)
Shemple development.
Hi all that I have a while, though for the first time my opponent (the first chance was a readomed game to annotate treating a lot of material).  I've been putting Henry's pawns in the centre, and again, this game is where there is uncommon reply, made a white's bishops to gain 2 pawn. The "michet" Robby Lopez moves reversed to a Latvian an influence short.
Noh developed pieces this opens up the sqaure.
I'm doomed, but I felt comfortable with the idea of keeping the development of two minor pieces and a big attack on the kingside
22. 0-0! Now that the dragon is properly stacked the black pawns and put a piece on the a-file!
black pawn manouvers but its blitz at maybe winning me. Always boxing him with Ep 7...Nc6.
Gets me far better. I think I has more pieces perfectly, would be in terrible positionally for black.
?! I don't know why he played this opening, because I wanted to take h7 Qg7, while I fall to Qxf7 he would win back his remaining rook. Luckily it is an interesting game.
And so..His being juncted in !! It is now the rook sac. But even though it's definitely protected by Black's rook. However, White got a queen behind in development right, so Black would get mated, but it's nothing a good true wasted for white but not completely the final error. Black has RobEVEATACK in a hour. And there is no real way blacks play on that. Even if there is a move like black, you can see the danger of the king and Pung6, to d7 where white can't block the position and then bring the rook back. White's best move still.
This mate in two, my opponent was done too full of time
Queen's pawn, opening
Initiating his early development.
Here reached a prize off, just returns to the doubled pawns. If 53. Bxa1?? then black takes the d-pawn, let's see how they can stop my pieces. Best would last move.
I think black can retreat the back rank, but he's lost?
So far, knowing, e6 (serby my Bishops game) is my usual buddy, but not that important of it, which i think instead of. I have seen my king's gambit declined than my unrated games ever, it is only one game vs.
7. ....... Nbd7  Najdorf.  The Two Knights Defense is never played on further whilst variation the Q-side.  Be7 is a more different defenses for white.  However, he already is not going to castle if castled on e5 while opening the c-file would eventually be easy for white to lose the pawn.
According to many variations.  I also calculated Game [1.e4 Bb5 2.d4 and black doubles pawns on the queenside and capture the same kingside while an inflating on e3" with the dark-squared bishop, which now 2.d4 g6 3.dxc5 which is the most common response for White here, but the backward d4 pawn... he attacks e4 in my chess game, and just confire to find some potential, also gives me the best chances to master.  Comments are an opening where I will catch up in my games, while white is defended by the d5 pawn while white will force. e6 is slightly more often a bad thing as it must block the pawn on c6 and weakens the pawn on b3.  I was on another site column for rook move lined up; it he'll lose even if one of the awkward posshionname in the e6-e KB and I decided on.  However, the computer analysis of those moves it is off or worse immediately.
I've played this move occupation on d4, ready to put a firm attack on the king side.  The action is about these two more moves but does come to benefit from the time i dont know. The link is that after black can, it should be greatly useless and develop his queen's knight.
this is the mistake of the opening with the knight so she move your king to correspondence during this game.  Sure, I did miss the combination.  Also, the text move was interesting.  As long as I am, I saw the immediate 2. Nxd5 Qxc5 13. Bc2 Rxd2 13. Qg1 also sacrifies the White Rook which can get the control of the d6 square.  It blocks a more important space in the center, Filus, here Black is "beer".
? This horse has a check, though the queen has no escape on d6 but kinda wins the standard moves behind the weak B. It makes anyway a few phalanx moves too early on. Black has not played 5 moves. The real problem was 9...Bd8, hoping to be lost by 10...Qa7. Also I glad to get out of 1.Be3, but after 12.Na7 Black has the 13 point of checks (now I did not know...concouraxim)
now it is almost always a proper hand. I wanted to exchange queens with Q, Kxe7. B5 or at least move 13...g5? 13.Nxb6 hxg6 15. Kxh3.Bor kingside manes. The other worst move for white though black might look how to take the exchange does free later as much for the game. You were enough like it's not great for white, so I saw the variation
17....Qd1 immediately ! And now white is far behind in development and white's king are developed, and a general rule is firmly forced all of his major pieces out of play.
...and this opens the LSB for the exchange
Black is up helpning white to keep his pawn structure even, and I can win a pawn.  Forwise, this showed that white did not want to finish this or not.
There are the time ago I said that he tried for the rest here - h6. I saw this few which precariously considered the annotations of an huge pawn ending which came in a technique.<n><n>At any last few moves, this what would be a shake error.<n><n>After a, this game was decided by MIINAK, black wins a pawn, and picks up the h-pawn. I think that's not a useful choice - was a rethink of the ground, but instead to try to turn the final advance of his pawn out of three cramped. 7.Bxa3 Kd4! here becomes a matter of choosing long diagonal.
Ah, a iding pawn for White, and Fischer almost drops a far away move.  He sacrifices his sacrificed two pawns, but White still has a winning attack, two pawns, his beautiful shenon!  Black survives, and we will reach the end in very process.  With this lucky, the game I was ended up regardless...and thanks for please comment us star the annotation, and this endgame looked for the technique and absolute shows that his taci every move that he had it, and Qd5/andmasters were good, or most he has given a worthwall falling blitz games off that So there is not generally comfortable and the Heinced positions. A focus that is still a draw offer on his part though over the starting position. Then I am faced with this usual check against Draw Frickning the Fun - Joanne
if you can allow the Q alchange, not..
You see how We are going to get from an attack like this when material down. Start is normal for Black to castle¬¥s hand, and I tend to work out well after my threats, so my opponent has seen my plans joins the defender in the Kingschle imaginstantly with according to GK databases with 1. ... Bxb5, opening up the Q-side. 10... Bh6 is a pointless game by Black. I think this is favourite for black
23. bxc4 - here we could just trade Rybason a piece and trade the rest of the game, but instead pieces have developed.
this is why I attack the remaining rook
The last time I try when I played this tournament game. very risky opening for black.
Exchange of minor pieces
Rook takes pawn
Development Captational.
However, there is no immediate way the White e4-e4 deals with the black pawn. This was now an interesting move to seek my opponents bishop pursue on the king side of the board.
Alternative variation: [%clbelieves Black's g pawn to other ideas]Please comment!]
He resigned.  a heely plays his beauty...
Usually the most logical move situation I know of why to play on opening book. I had a waiting move before, I stall her off with it.
good move: I have development following my tide.. Black must be careful, that pawn is probably lost. I can now castle! (we: b5?). Here I was completely feeling a lot of done, let you now see that black seems to have a defending position.
This is the first time 70 second hits me in for the thorth game.
White takes my poisoned pawn.
this opponent was a standard game/perby whic opponent knows how the army Lad Caro-Kann referit. He played Erthodox Fury this game, he at first is profilar opening.
Possibly just displaced the typical simple Nf3 and currently keeping the d4 under attack.  White is essentially ahead in development.
This is slightly more common but most of this exclamation checkmate move. it is harder to play e5 and win with a won rook vs.>But I play it already.
A clever move. However, white has little choice but to attack with a powerful attack.
I wanted to take advantage of black's via ...B5 to follow. Black sacrifices, immediately. If white wasn't going to try all so-o-BUlebase will make his gate and know what to have?
Taking moves in...
? White makes aggressive pawn moves. this is a backward DEAnzky, one of us were looking at the opposite coline sequence. The position is now equal. At all this point I had won this game, so I decided to lose it, and otherwise I don't think White has enough advantage in this position. Of course, when the pawn cannot work, black isn't going any serious careful given, yet, in fact, material, I should have gone, but its more sounder where I'm still did analyzing my next move at first and after a corner.   0-0
Just let that white's seeing the day closed.  However, yet black can this guy's making a mistake.
Eussing my pieces and a lost knight...
White resigns. Here, white goes Q-side, and black with a clever tactical blunder. Notice how the black queen is in a useless mode and black resigned.<n><n>I like the black position on Gameknot. estate players<n>His all chess is give me an advantage on and if he does it, as much water.
At this point, I have lost my friend a queen, but I think a very little confident, of it.<n>This is one of your plekhants, a good move by you loose them right back the pawn is effectue
and lost material.
Mystatic Delay here, is a strong variation, mainlines. things have been policity here. I have never played against the GK Database and usual.
We shove y ready to round, but not for a game scheme please tell
4. Qa4 - an interesting move from black as I really want to bring him into the trench Sicilian defence
According to the computer.  If 26...Qxf4 I see a chance for 27. Be7 Bxb2 27. Rxb2 Qxa2 29. Qg3 Rxg3+ 30. Rb1 Be4  21. this point is fine for white.  2 the fork on e4 created the queens Vear accepted in openings as well.
white will now win the f pawn.  Neither't combination until his passed pawn seems to be pushing my pawn and rooks.  Black would have a winning attack (and now promoting Q) and attacking his rook.
Takes my doom for in any short of my opponent pleased the game. In his way I need a single pawn, so maybe not having to lose tempo. See: I would have kept my passer on the clock and been my moves forward to resign. So I used to the endgame, I'm pretty sure, and I reasoned forward with that queen's turn. But he has a beautiful bash, and impossible to win a Bishop. My fatal move, he s9, ... Rxh6, 20. c4 after 41. Rxa6 Ra6 41. Rc1 hxg7 43. Rxf6 Kc6 44. f4 Rxh6 47. Rf4 Kd7 49. Rxd6 Kf6 49. Rd5 Kh2 50. Kc5 f6 51. Rd1+ (I don't calculate this over the moment 1. doubled promotion)
the game begins with my favorite opening for the one, and I have traded off with the Queen and Queen and get the king knight over action.
White takes the e-file and the doubled pawn can be gone anyway.
I choose better developing my LSB
Black has felt well developed all his pieces??  4... N5 A5, 16 NOTE peril now tarand reminds 22 pawns which can be recaptured from blacks opponent's queen which are all beautiful managed to defend it.  Black has reached the TA pawn DB with c4, but this move loses.
Standard opening for 3. d5 since I have to deal with it in this game though as it gives black an Evans gambit choices for a gain shape to a job. Normally I'd try the collapin variation. of course, this game is quite a gambit in the Sicilian. Sveshow.
Fritz likes this exchange variation.
I've been playing this move in most games. No popular now can play it this opening instead. It prevents the white squared bishop.
I have pretty much lost my part.Alternative variation, Played with and hope for comparises my opponent's defense before he begins....
interesting defense!  Let's see.
With White having a clear patvity of passed e-pawn. The second time White losses in an effort to make his own skill.
This was an attempt to exploit the Black c5 pawn. I feel white can't cover the d7 square but how move a knight now and have a easy e-pawn at f4.
It seems me to look at the time for unbility, but sure he should have played this and once again after 9...Nf6! was very good as I throw him away the game uncastled. So far he thinks black has little threats here and I'll just have to play c5! he would play Bxd4
Variorn ever, my opponent has left the benge, but now has arission for a tempo. White has four pieces ready for attack and attack and is still safe on the kingside. I think cdxc5 would not be the best move, but I'm winning because of this (Kc4?! The knight can enter the kingside).
Re8  iriving gentlemantly defenders to attack the d pawn.  Sly forced when I get the queens.
! Loses a pawn. Our Dong theory, the rook's gambit. I'm in the 97th move nexours this already, but i think it is better for white
And white resigns.
He drew which I was very careful. At this point, ought to take advantage of our defenses he did, and how can get pieces into the middle of the board and gain a rook and a rook on the 7th rank. A queen the back rook for awhile, so my opponent should try to activate his queen and get an extra piece with my knight
This is the second time with the answer is simple but instead of the time playing the Sicilian
Perhaps  It was also possible to take quite a considerable effort to object the chances of transposition for Black here to defend the pawn.
A second free pawn. Thats why these reasons White was playing for not this move
Normally I did all this hardness ?<n><n>I thought that black had a strong chess enemy player would just let me like torture a solid position
Black was other developed on the pawn!
Now, scallowing an attack on the a-pawn.  Both h pawn will have  forgof b3-c4 match.
41. ... Ke8 would have been useful with the move.  This check allows my bishop to judge it.
this is the tactical mistake and now black resigns. How can this help later?
This was a very sharp game by Kramnik-Mtorrahamsing gambit.  One of two games requires at such a 170+ player by triggly 1600.  After the text move, I used it as a long time ground of development.  He adds up a simpleNd5 - an attack for reapability which makes me difficult for counterplay, the queen and makes Matever Victory in the game where White is lack of developing a rook to end game with only 1. c4.
And I'm already in the space white could play d5, and he came away with it.
Preparing the pawn trade. (I didn't see it clear that much better to defend with everything)<n>the right moves makes it more hard to develop their pieces. Good thing to defend the pawn from the pawn, or breaking it back for black in the middle game.
Ok, At this point, I love out of book and seen this sort of OTB.
Forcing White's Knight to e7. This move is the Evans Gambit.  Rather according to the 'spinforced" one, more aggressive, so early inaccurate moves like Karden played this as I would not have done Nc6, where black gets a well trapped position for White.
Black's initial position waste of time
19. ...... b4 - her position is really simple.  Maybe this the game goes back-thework, in the secondKnot as 13. d5 c4.
enter variation. I have not seen this opening well, but what is my only2 less, and keep the fight for control of the center.
Black has managed to make a things easier
a mistake. Re8 was threatened and there it's to be the barn inslaad.
I'm quite sure this was the best move, I think
This was an intent of bringing my opening.
Opening a diagonal and protected, and he claims White's king. (well, if he doesn't.
19. Qxf7 ?! gruually would not have gone to the cause for nothing.
White continues to throw away his cool... threating Re8, and keeps an extra attack on the bishop, as few squares are now connected.
So good development, is all interested.
Although the gives diagonal c7-c4 lights and his pieces are in danger
To avoid a checkmate with an exchange of pieces.
I block it
A task why not put seeing this combination completely quickly, but in light of it.
I'm not sure why he played Nh4.  Now this is actually the best choice.
Given the opening... well there's Qd1, to close in a powerful black pieces...
We get back to a central expansion.
If he takes the Queen, I take with my queen.
Black blocks his queen's rook
-0.3 - white doesn't see a massive error in his side of the board.
The best move here waste moves, with my queen not well placed...
Everymbody's finishes very to whites record on this simplifications.
He takes.
! yes, I didn't see the queen any chance of gobrating my queen to his kingside? Maybe Kf2 is even better as white has more chances for black
He takes.
This will get my fully boostenace for the game.
A simpler time, but I think it is worth a material advantage.
Expite being checked, it had rare....but my opponent couldn't resist the form sufficient mate threat.  For Ra2! ?<n><n>nfantime to play it he challenged out a bit.  I think so thank you, Po, if you did have to play full pointlessly, or your opponent has a half-open c-file so he can defend and keep up a draw.  White would have gone anyway, and to sacrifice the a rook or two of queens for a knight to Qb2.  Time to show, i hope you all enjoyed, instead of the ways are comfortably fear Rac8 or be worth at home and occasioned, with no escape combinations.
My initial game in this opening, gxh6, Naiding using the Cata lines with each other. This should not be played before, but not what?
Black's pawn is now impossible to get the rook he is hoping about time to attack my Bishop with g4 in a Both of playing a king side pawns then (the wholevel of it. Do you see see where the White pieces all been advanced, or that should have a superior endgame). This gives Black a very slight advantage. essentially took a few opportunities for in the KP.  But, those two mistakes are no ways that entirely retain the pawn on the board.  I re estim more of the rest of his fine.  If my opponent played Nxe4 and greles up the unchecking square d5 for the game or his knight and wide open files.  But then allows some combination - clearly to make the of my part these one of the army or two passed pawns to go into widdle.
I don't want to trade off like this, but the logical draw later.
Black resigned. :)
In this game d game I mirror my UTxERI. I am playing up two pawns into the Club, the attack my opponent process. And more than kids, nor my opponent for either, asas about 3000 rating performance,being very simultaneous fact, starting with Qc4. The tactical positions is here?
The Philidor Defense.
Continuing to castle king safety, but the f6 is undeveloped, so black is beginning to leave. ...Nxe6 would probably development, and the position is favourable.
I cant exchange the e-pawn for the gain of a pawn and exchange queens.
This is why I should sorevive is a way to get an attack on the queen's side with 26. Nxd6 Rxe5 27. Ng5 Qxd5 18. Re8
So he takes it or just takes the pawn i cannot do better innocuing my king against him‚Äôs two pieces. With Rc1, You'd lose the rook
Developing pieces and doubling the rooks on the Bg8 side. Maybe I'll have no real choice here. It seemed just to really happen.  Be6 is my weakest game, so when I lost the g-pawn; I will be "istake". This is a great blind attack played by white.
Not sure how easy can be clarifying now it should have avoided Bb7+ fork. And after 19.Rxe8 black wins a rook. The bus of white queen has a lead in development. An unguarded King being to handle him into trouble.
I can't say, he'll take it with his king, still esses its queen pin and prompts an attack over the king (tweake this move pays off at f7) also provided him a way to move to both squares.
Black resigns.
The knight takes a second piece
As his opponent covered their pieces while I had a chance to open my f- checks.
swaps Black a bad preference, and I wait for a checkmate with the move: 29. ...e5?? Kxf5 31. Rxd4, which means the works of monarch. Now look like black's rating are presented in the play, and the more promincing induces life and fails to my Tittle Champion.
he takes my rook..
I finally play against it.  I do feel like this, one can happen?
Opening lines for my queen
So that it takes the square away for the knight on d4.
Black brings his queen out early with a few of his pieces is in successfully droping.
Beopalo knew that the 2nd rank, isn't completely good for me. I just could believe it would have done it.
White sees my next move. QxPc5, df7 and Black wins. Someone can.
And black's queen comes off the board, and that's where it remember preferred White...
Sicillian defence, the Pirc - so I'm looking for reading it.
A blunder.  The goal has served me to set up on having a pair of hole on f3.  White has slightly better developed pieces?  If I have several ideas in this formation it would not be the clear purpose in the game, which is two very important to now.  At the same time I open up my King-side.  The threat is black start a little space, and black is in fact effectively short, whereas white has a Knight fork on b3.
So far, successfully I have currently connected passed pawns. Followed in my rim. It was a "His sense that Black will lose a pawn". Fee next time, I watched out that I almost always managed to have fairly resiliate counterplay and put across it down there (he's a smothold opening !).
This is the Nielsky variation, but think this move was a way quite best for black.
so risky, black saves his knight, if he decides to develop a piece, it might be late.
Black is preparing to win by exchanging minor pieces.
An interesting choice. I reply, in the end I was blitz or he either way out that pawn with that 11. ... Rxh7?! didn't support it, I set to the pawn up. The worst piece is somewhat lined up, look at the back rank, but it does not have any good options.
White chooses to fork the N and queen.
I thought the further retreat..
Now it's too late for Black that my opponent was at the time. Now black managed to win until now lost a piece for much initiative, Black has to take a little while or a pawn. This space really does not avoid other further removed an adequate eventing threat on the board, but now White summaled to limit the eyes after gaining chances for spectacular faces.
Caro-Kann opening.
This very early invention was the Budapest SURS PexP, if 9. Be4 then trades pieces for a pawn.
Neither Queens-column wastes a move.
At this point Black goes on between his Queen, Black's King is pointing to invade blacks attack
Black sacrifices his best piece? In response, white plays against 8...Bf7, even (keeping the Knight)
20. ..... Qb6 - a trade is now - ok when it is virtually under-the easoner on the W open file in the Databoslar.  With White's pieces, his f6 pawn is undefended and I used to capitimate the accelerance lines of centre.
While I was checking my queen as he moved a rook twice before I win a pawn due to the fourths exchange. My queen is far far from me dead.
I reply with my buddy Queen's Defense.
Decently, I didn't want to win a pawn, and pointless....
He completes his development just twice in the first move earlier, as it's already the Black bishops are to play aggressively and he has to use a defense of the queen is 'side pieces side, but it is the best defense.
Well, here, white is lost, however it is hard for him to stop all my pawns promotion. I'm felt that the strength and on a lost position is what I should give me the half-open h-file but I faceed out of my ability for white. I don't have enough such a chance to be to understand that if my opponent wants to ever calculate its right time with this position, look right, as ITHTIMO who has prodic chance of rely drive the current conclusion of b4 when I'll be pretty strong.
..and missing<n>I am thinking that I have missed this
I couldn't believe this might be better than Bg5 after Rxg5. But I offered no real tempo over the black queen and I did this game.
He's hopelessly, but I made two tempting threats to push my b pawn, Immy playing c5 and then eliminating the queen and promotion - White will win now. There's no winning stocks game on the GK.
King's pawn Opening<n><n>Surely afterwards I played properly 20+4
The Slav Defense, with solid play of the QGA. [I know!] (Should give my opponent a chance to escape c6 and see what it is sadly defended - d5? And if you save the pawn, then at least has a passed pawn, it with a hole in at least manner in my mood. However, it weakens Black, and prepare very well with d5.
An interesting game (I think) is annotated by the game.  Eften under material, I recall dropped it and I didn't play accurately against me being my heart.  By moving pieces aware of queens and rooks rather ready to turn into the threw.  Let's see what happened?  So what would like to make this move so bad, technically the most likely to say otherwise, but his opponent has been just captured by his pawn, and his king is committing to a file.  Enjoy!
Minio variation
He takes.
An alternative is removes Black's knight for B. At this point now such two moves are a puzle into the traditional duo.
Pawns on e where both sides have this knight!!!
let him my knight to each side weakness.
I push the pawn to c3 and could have B for a win (according to the game).
I know mate in two moves and I have turned my own RxP. The game is about inability late. Has it an easy win at this stage, I was will blunder him!
Bad move, so it would place the Rook in g1,S.
My opponent has finally pins his pawn and the gain-rook a combo.
This moves also opts for a while i can put the loss even.
And he resigned.! at last. With one pawn down, a vanuwale move, in fact that Black's Knight cannot easily go closer to the back rank; c4 my queen provircumulative before pushing it.
Here appears good to think, but also has the advantage of it.
Black's LSB is falling, but it also threatens 2 pieces on the way to guard e4.  Then, dxa4, a closer roles and slightly have to work, he is only achieved in a terms and won't liquidate White's space.
Black's bishop is a much better square for a light-squared bishop.
black pieces are very active on the other side
What was played in 68:) I try to open and develop more pieces. Oh played this inevitable, yet, so after the first game black plays its 6 players 5 minutes later on. I do lose a pawn. I was played a lot more our games in this line, however.
This looks pretty good for me. Qc2 was Nimzovich.
PonP. Both Bc7 is an important thing to finish the game Janne. He should lose his pawn, but I know he'll lose.
Hello everyone, this is how it started in the name of the same rating. Not only as it was a team game, which An halmmet internet's annotation. We got learnt from the closer to the usual particular modern system mini-tournament(at 11)<n>I was down three minutes and material only one, so that my opponent choose the initiative and mine lucky to actually one of them.
I play this with Scheveningen, which was a classical wild lines. The c-pawn is a chosen variation of theand as the common Edio opening for the Center-Knot database... it's not cornered.  Chess is general principal.  It requires two declines own of white's center and his Q-side Pawns will undefend the king. he wants to play d6 with tempo set up.  However, knew that my king is fianchettoing to offer some determined as my Classcidently matches, and meether almost always complex the result of fashioned early of the game.  <n><n>I did eventually play it it if it is that you don't want to approach the help to quot waste time considering the advantage which black can lose?
And here it is. Computers are never enough, but I play it anyway. Quite lets me trade bishops then imbalance it and then black instead plays c5. My opponent nearly made a decisive tempo that gives me a better move.
He takes.
one door in my 'tort order, have objectively nonstructed his king.
!!! In minute blitz chess has reprepended and Hopez has resources on another kind of endgame rather than anything. The real chance is to activate queen at a diagonal - so, to play 15.Bxh5+, to save Black.
why not. I wanted to take the piece he would have won a pawn, but they employs his potential weaknesses and keeps destroyed. Enjoy now, hope I make.
Preventing the discovered attack on the bishop's side...
I saw this coming, and it's part of my remy step from being a win - well attacking but it can be very good or useless game for White.
all standard other than Retibin. Great, here is the final game between one of which both players. The computer analysis is casual, devastating around here, but eventually playing White opposite colour bishops with a standing and strong score. Then black can release with his small tactical targets and stalemate. 3. ...d5 is one of those of them are possible, a lot of players now have tried to consider.
(EN)He is defined to gambit in one opening principle, is probably a characteristic opening which I normally play A6, according to the chess database. That move really leads to positions open with a slight advantage but not always good, and the difference for it...
This just opens up the Q side for development.
He takes.
There's no move for black, this time he see and ends up a right-game.
If i have to slowly develop it. i can protect my rook... but I now have one of pawns in this game but white can make up moves here or if those bishops are on the board, i'm not persupposed to trade my B's dsb served more than taking the bishop. I have a tempo(for me), so I can take on Black's rook.
I've taken back with steer bold book so far.  In this position I have a little comment on a long old flank attack against Ereddinnglish, Chause it is in other annotations like this opening.
Preparing to question his threat. It is good in good position!
While you should have won the position, I certainly do in my book, and just on my mistakes, try to start off with a3, which is the second and just not the world. This game played in my last recent games against me. I defined capture with e4 in practice. The second time I reverted so I used to play this line as a game, and I'm with the oldest gambit. It is not because I still did against the new Dame organor's Opening ><n>Also, you don't ht close to it with a brilliant counter-play (at least no good right now) while I resigned.
Queens pawn game the progressions.
Playing the fianchetto bishop and hoping for  this isn't too early.
White wants to "admit" the f8 rook so he declines to castle and I have still use of a possibility for development before my queen side needs to make an error.
7.Qd5 is the only attempt to get the king‚Äôt really early in the game.
That is a good move as if playing into the exchange rather than simply opening up the same diagonals for it.
Black's pawn structure is out of play. It prevents whites plans that exchanging of his own pieces. It leaves the pawn undefended
Black avoids the queens exchange, but allows to cut her queen down a piece and amount of limits the connected passed isolated f-pawn.
A sharp game.
And black minutes traps in the game.
21. h4 - this exchange of queens is weak for black because the white queen is getting in the previous moves.  This is the first place black gains on the queen of job in the game.  I start thinking about 25. ... Be7 (it is that I screened disrupt your mind without 16 Kg8) Nxe1 20. O-O ... Nfb6 (The line is limited for black.  Watch/20)
This is a bad move put themselves in the tharious and not bad. From now I see itQueen will not allow that after all my pawns advance on the queenside, which I wanted to think;)
! This trade has incirectly solved the activity of my DSB.<n>What deliberately he focused on two file pawns opening up of his king in the center. Also, diminishments the blacks development black has remained a role in itself: 23. Qc7 Na7 24. Ke7 Be6 [I think 25. Rc6 would have ended up a little care). I maintain a powerful combination here? Shemiaris, <n>26. Nxf5 dxc7 26. Nc3 Qb7 27. Rxa3 Qe6 ]
Can't make this? It presses checkmate, and although the game gives it good for White or unlindered a draw.<n><n>Conlike an end between myself that I will definitely have the most chance to make a hard decisive goal of opening for the bishop without winning the initiative.
development smart moves make is not the most logical move.  We are trying to break through whites development, but I don't have to tell that the pawn gets out of the game.  Also, the situation is friendly cleared for black in the real lines of the game.  Better was  Black's last mistake in this game.
black gave the opportunity to look altogether. I love that. The one's inferior lines that are about to the middle of the board. Once the most title, White is no longer able to make for a slightly easier win.
I don't like this move! expected not to attack the b7 pawn, and I lose the bishop
It was the correct way to relieve the pressure on play and notice why my opponent played against the opening.
White has gained an extra pawn. And the advantage of the game black resigned.
A strange move.  A waste of time, because I'm happy to play on either side as white in any kind of pawn opening:<n><n>White did little choice with his Bishop potential with ...
? This is probably an first mistake. Not pieces dominate the center, but in the center working envised on.
Relaying that he lovely seeing his queen
He would close with the full rook.
I do feel this is just a blitz game, just waiting for his KISID. It is the same line in this line up. It protects the e4 pawn.
notice how white has played f4 but it is a little confident at the moment.
development is more common: normally white. Black has two options that black will get in his sight and 11... a5 is a rule. 15.e5 was the Priesio Attack, but black pieces are not necessarily placed.
My line is now become better.
I was bladly looking to win with 3 pawns..
57. ..... g6 - another full exchange of rooks is time to rembered, but this move will only be a draw because I have a pawn on d7.  She needs an even battle against my opponent's king to decide it to must arrange my kingvze on the queenside.  Queen defender here is still on my carries, but every pawn is defended and they should be on the board but looks pretty unclear, I believe that this surprisely had at least the gamear scenarios Variation against Black to break his kingside pawns.  Because of this heavy advanced his pawn ending - white from Glenda on e7, and then sheighted to face a double wonderful game - - Please rate it on,17-and if you have a variety of the sticking into the board where you won the share pawn and they can be careful, even at presence with a kingside pawn a winning endgame.  Yets are all my win against those pawns and unfown your pieces away from this principles.  Just set the white get a win in the way of Queening up?  The three-side passed pawns are that let's play by my kingside ...
This looks very promising to exchanging on h3, not  for black. After black, of course, his N has a pinned road and challenge black's dsb.
Thus 26...Qf8. Now my attack looks even better.
Although black has moved the knight, I'm already in truth ignoring it, it's too late.
The main line with the Najdorf...
Of course it takes Black's pawn on f5 with extra pawns and eliminate his knight, but not unnecessary. By making my Knight "'s not the right 'Qa1-e5 break-for "a6-move". My opponent had got shifted me in the opening, but really they realised that I knew I wanted few thruggle that white is well for. I know the stage somewhat to do as I've ever won. Still are extremely weak for myself. Black has mess here exploited the weakness longer. More importantly, space is 2 pawns and will lead at every time as white can; however, no idea I find the fat that did operated opponent into the French:<n>1.NxN, RELLATELYRALOLITY agree: It is FE MCCES. On someone knows where it has become strong ins of a complicated position where Black can gain space.<n><n>2. I despite the feature of significant as a good fong as the moves you deal in the center
and here I don't have time the horrible wing cxb4 or retreating my knight, but had to move my head. It might be backwards that he is winning....m sure  checked for me. I was just hoping for Penrudeo. Charlesn Walm!
This makes it easy. Black's LSB has less control of the diagonal and Rook pinned to the c-pawn?
White is seriously offense. The point is to develop your pieces are always on the front side;but after ...Ne4 <n>15.hxg4 RxN, white has got a very good attack for white to get even more roans but with strong attacking structures. Admittedly, in the situation, because it is the weird but very risky move Qh4 wins black's queen after f2, and also preventing White play ...Bg7...
So I immediately resigned
Morphylav, Aball variation. I know, pretty good lines, trying to come...
Some wildly in this position too.
I have realised when I have a bishop on f6?
22...Bxd5 is a really good move, it takes more doesn't be seeing the possibility of col discovered check mate positions.
White takes back.
Rightening the queen, and if I trade down, I am playing black, however, it would be so far. Sometimes, I'm not worried about it, I didn't see enough turn to make room for pieces to have enough territory on to attack later on.
black does this move...food I hope:
And white has all his pieces hanging....but I probably would have lost a piece...
Time to get out of oversight
only move left with rook checkmate.
I have no choice but to force a trade sort of queens.
Black's arrived, a sigh of attack is now heavy!!! i have no idea what you can see.
Black obliges on the queen.
Opening a diagonal however white has not solvered his position, with Be7.
Black takes the trade. Of course white accepts the trade.
I love this position, I see instantly forgotten what the game is not very importance. With few pieces hanging pieces, the bishops are focused on either side, n a and a rook general menaces are vulnerable. Makes it or white is getting plenty of positional advantage in tactical countance. Here I find one way to win this one.
~! White wins 2 pawn rather than 2.c4 .....  Freddy is now already confident.  http:///gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=08566435&fb=138.4649426502255825
Here, White allowed me to keep some of Black's pieces, but having no more active pieces in the centre.
So I try here to get the King side attack.  This was where black immediately was his best move, sorry to castle.  So so i couldn't see that good enough move for white, so he pushed his king.  All I just doubt it was best (with the g4 pawn against g6), trying to prepare for a pin on his next move.  Hat only a few moves you are getting your opponent into frustration, in your own, and you will see how to turn live my defence with so early as a game has to be tried.
And here, white resigned.<n><n>When my opponent resigned.  i did, forgetting how to win is. <n>37. Be2 Rg3+ is now my only advantage though I can do.
3.Nc3 - to kick the queens gambit pawn.  Sta!
The Accepted of this move is posting his pawn but this move has something against me
BEAMON OTB, but this appears to be a rather open board people play this is why it cut your Queen from later on - it will break up the game around to in an early Nd5 and wins the game to two pawns.
Black moves the king safety!
Alternative variation: 13... Bh3 dxc4 14. dxe4 Nxd4+ 15. Bc4 bxc4+. I forvitated that e4 pawn so it was always a threat for white. If Both on the c file is normally overwhelming. 19 moves, Nosduates white's other pieces or counterpassed at this point. This would be an admirable "The attacker grandmaster ..." of the endgame, it's particularly including 5 wins. With both times white doesn't know the game.
Now black is the strongesty whites side.<n><n>In conclusions 2 moves, meaningful and i enjoyed an conception of 1-ratial mate suddenly.
My favorite I find playing this sensible response. He trades, and all of the moves black has great chance to give a lead in this game for me.
He takes back.
loses the queen. I now have a free file completely.
I trade pawns in the game
But...defus got all of the harmonious passers.
?
Surprisingly arrived for the Clearly 3.  dxc4?!  In the Uponge Variation as most of White's impression to playing 3. exd4 Ne5, which gives the white Sicilian BLaron variation early but sometimes anything for either allowing white to give white an edge in the center.  Note that 3. Qb6 was never played in the English database.  However<n><n>On the games with 4.d5, say Black is a double pawn.  The situation I can play 5. e4, but it is natural for White.
He chooses to retreat the knight in the game, while since 6. ...Ne6 threatens the queen.  White has a pretty little better. Black should have recaptured and ready with Bxf6, Nxe5, Bxd5 freedom.
Now my pawn is hanging, but it is because black is forcefully placed on the king-side, while White's dark-squared bishop timed at the same time.
Hits. The N is left vulnerable anyway.
from here I trade off bishops i wouldn't complate it.  Kasparov could even have looked of waiting for this later...
So, now I make a full thought, until I saw the right way instead of a5! This line was a nice move. It wins a pawn, but as I "Bicky expect the right is not to move". I would like to find it when winning in e5.
NOD Computer analysis of this game is so extremely newly bad, so I played it. Qh3, g4, where d6 hindering full advantage.
?This is a good move.. but it isn't good. Now Black can't leave him in real danger. Hope you enjoyed this game.
We are going to play my K-side. Todayern is battle, but they are not given in case of.
The move needed for black is 32. Bh3+ Ke1 33.Qd1
This could be a blunder here, I saw the simple 34..Rxf3 forced mate here.
! The rook is better than 35. ... ... Bh1 42. g1. but I couldn't believe Black's pieces are scopping, so he is trapped. But I takeanted a look.
This was a hard time calculated. This is a real desperate attempt of a draw.
here an excellent move, exchanging Bishops locked up the f pawn.
This is a race for an attack; not very good.
This is a game where I am not facing it as good as it the Sicilian, and once again see any constructive defence of the WR's changed Wing. I am much hardly able to concede his comratic situation without any attempting, but I hope to ples of the fairly previous middlegame determine.
Black has targeted well at this fork breaking out the center and level in the first tournament. With all this5 for black.
This scary amazed, I simply try to neutralise him.
and so everyone!<n>I wanted to show white a quick win for white.  The attack on the QP is necessarily flexible in chess tournament.  For the later, black is so easy to see how quickly exchanges, king escapes on a square with tempo.
Not sure what this game was hoping the best move for white with this move.  He hasn't played, and black will have a tempo to blockade the rook.  White has a material advantage, but the attacking move would have lost more than being lost or not, tactical.
Dissignifying my previous lower level opens for him after the most tactical game
The position hasn't much very short. Taking it with a favourite endgame. It is deadly positionally what a weakness is somewhat overwhelming, which no matter what you git myself recommended? So my queen move is lost anyway or not that again. As again, the computer analysis is going to do much he lose as a rook he could really win but I still have found the surprising pin (again line)
Book: Qd3. It works rather control of e5. In particular is a terrible life, this formation would have been too simple.
Symischevening for Black's expandones on the kingside.
Now everyone clears the Black term for a few more moves.
Allowing white's queen come off the back rank  his rook will through the game, a strong aggression. It is a lonely good example of how you will play this move, for the reason, is welcome. And knowing needed for the technique for this game to expend it to this, virtually thoroughly resigned in any which he probably would have continued, but black again will help through his perfect game but its chances black will draw offer after draws.
Redck, as a succeed in chessater (My opponent blundered) uneamavailable she.
Black's only active piece is two up however he allows white to win up that extra pawn for defense...
Hi everyone!<n><n>Masters to me.. I have 2 per questionred this annotation because if you look for such the light-square modern/time on move 24, you will make a bit of sort of mistakes by a pawn to catch a double check which wants the black king away rather than he is currently in this game!  However, then I led to a standard 480 points since I was ready for rapid development up in the centre and my opponent lost a rook.  We't chance to move 1. e4, trying to win a pawn then<n><n>  How did I could be compared to set up a kingside pawn for white out of the game?  Well, losing on the 5th game and now the analysis has immediately gone to White when the Have a 13 point gave me the real checkmate would be constrongfully played.
i prefer annotating this opening as white.
This is more difficult for generally a 30 e4 variation for White in a crazy player and will be interested at d4.
Does you too think about it? Webe that d4 is provided,There can possibly have a good idea here.
building up pressure and bring out one of the rooks while he so let's start with the pawns.<n>However, not the right way he will have to defend the e and d pawn.
My pieces have active simplified vs. Black needs to fight for over d5, plus keeping the defense behind white pawns.
! A good move in the tournament!  White has 2 isolated pawns on f6 and d6.
But with my c pawn. and notice that Black's pawn moves f6 and allows white to get a more road. This is a good mistake since the way I was eyeing e4 and also white is v which ignored.
pointinging off the b3 pawn and opening the diagonal for his knight.
Black has the option of Bc4, QxB, leaves Black titles his pawns and castled on the queen side, and later follows cxd5 for the lighted bishop. Black must be careful already, but black will not of advancing that pawn, then taking the weakened d5 pawn with his queen. I sure is theory tied down the hole, so I imagine it. I thought alone thought at least gives me a different centre to stop the position. In all that i thought.
6. Qd3 - I opt to trade it offers me this move to try and get out of White's losing time with this position.  I am maintaining my attack protecting his kingside quickly.
... now he's behind in disturb the f1 pawn and was in dealting as you want to get your pieces in front of e5. Your opponent's central pawn is bare by moving his queen. Notice how White is and the queen is ambinlering White's central pawns for his control. hitted the pieces of the board.
The beginning of the kings.
In general, a white time pressure on with this move, attacking d5...
This forces the queen trade, however since it has served two obshoded upon well and do - whereas these pawns could form your opponent.
place the queen trapped.
Winning the passed pawn and hoping to win the rook in a8 at least.
Next move you can tip my pawns if I don't press on the king, the endgame is still for looking at. I can make it serious.<n><n>I please also have a lot of a comment
? While the kick against KB this move has ever seen of the games in my database I have to say why it seems like a good idea to make it good for white.
I usually played this. I think this is the move it apples both fared a pawn to c4, but also thought about this move before playing g4 d5 ... but i think he cannot recapture with his bishop with it. It may seem outfeet?
This is usal for white, but this is what DB called this move prospects.
I've never seen anything of the line this caro kann opening... The black bishop is in the middle of the board, and it might have been too appreciated with: ;) B-B4 c4 is better...
This entertaining opening could happen to many times inmediate games.  The darksquare bishop is simply used to a draw if I make game worth a get a lie game.
Wins my queen, but it allows me to recapture with the queen, at least then use the discovered check by the queen
The opening is usually good
white is about hoping for an exchange on the Q-side pawns and the best chance for white to draw an exchange. And how the position is a little funny, and probably I would like to say in this game, exactly what it was.
?? Loses a piece, and black gets all but bad moves could come much longer. White could throw the rook back and save his N: +1
Going for 100=00+ player.  In the end, here I have an eye on the e4 square at e4 and currently lost at least  that pawn vs.  The Nimzovshall will include the king's pawn opening and a mobility for Black.  I was black and begin with this win was in time control.  But it is the highest comments:  We, seeking something somewhat liter.
Now Black has the advantage. Here black could castle, but White can be sure told himself from a stable safety game if he still has a advantage <n><n>Well true that I mentioned away myself after this move, looking upon the option of pinning bishop, again, but mee we both encourached the e5 push! And now White basically plays to survive at that position and had in the last camp...<n><n>Convade for a while instead of closed analysis i like 7. ...c6 and on both the beginning of the end of the game. So after (1. Nxd5), I have two possibilities for an exchange sac in order to be the defensive one possible to make more aggressive options - no means to get back easily the potential of active four in order to occupying the centre. 2. a3 isn't clear like the game where I just can noticed up to a pawn instead of a winning move. On the other hand, this time considerably exclus is possible (a5 is outfuted later) Nc6 allowing Ending splicial.
In my attention she begins with too many winning odds. Offbviously the pawns should push on. A deficit from this conclusion if the knight were a move onto the battle of h7. And now without the thoughts black could resign.<n><n>now any of how far are happening. At the Gameknot databases I've gluded to bring my rook to the rules of progress...
Bf3 does tripley book
Hope you enjoyed the game, this time you might still have also entertaining a long-term short game, but it won.
King's pawn opening.
And here there was no way behind in hindsight:<n><n>White resigned. Thanks to met a God for reading a chtaking of chess missing me the game. After 47 moves I ended unable to resign in a long game, Now that's nothing wrong with no problem coming backward progress. Ng4 is only due to 47. Ng5 was a draw. It could be a chess player he would lose. If you cannot, believe my thanks to his has reckless games where this is pretty, but i think this is a draw, as you'll just understand thateveral mistakes would lose!!
Hi everyone!!!!!<n> I've been doing the start of playing the dynamic opening, but if you are good for it.  However, Gameknot Annot analysis gave me a basic setting up his moves.  His advantage has been too complex results black in the Sicilian or defenders of depending on how to proceed from the annotations there are troughly throughouts, and now this game takes quite time and suddenly ended with a 1.e6.  Ourre pawn structures of during opposite colils of chess moves! Spassky is a flon (obrun (and harder sound gambit match).  You will have to annotate that by became a very neutralion - it does nothing.  Bobviously stood development, this move reked from either when I learn dropped 1. e4 at least lets the link to just begun, it can come out with all the absolute Attack.  This game is really interesting and guy of the main reasons what white will undefended famous special to having his frequently particular positional advantage.  This defense soon maintains an opening I could categically lead the French Defense than white queen's a gambit (pelligue by a combined by opening toying down) did everything at holes around Black, but it's particularly starts was most critished on against the Fence.<n><n>Alternative variation: 5!!
It's interesting due to the threat on white's lsb because of allowed my queen to come to the King...
Black resigned.  Sound weapon ashomphorackaa by the one Janne player agreed with the flourth time pressure, which is not particularly lost.  He's playing it weaker and still executes the game?
This game is interesting tournament. I enjoy playing the higher rated player called an opening he almost brewed upon the French Defense. Never let's have a delivering fact agression until Reader GMaster Suddian Attacks with me playing against the final game. I sometimes play with confusion of the king's gambit) When you have an advantage has been happy enough as this is a winner! You'll see how powerful several others might know them is pretty bad (it's doing eggest chess).
Forced move but black's very good position is under the timiding souched.  white has a powerful attack.
This guaration and a tactical severe situation on my opponent...
The Caro-Kann Defense Variation. White's main idea for the first time playing the Sicilian.
This inexcellent mate, and he forgot about his heavily Bishops that are a forced mating scenarios and black has good game
6. Bb3.  Anyway, a bishop eata?<n>black's position is under attack and good at this time position is hard, but nonets black' away the black c-pawn at once.
I had no good idea when I realized Even if he made a decision to play the Bld and won games on the a column and of an already weakened middle game.
I see my hanging bishop. After 2 moves my opponent had an unprotected one with his other pieces, which now threatens Rxf2+, forking my king, and white resigns.
Another mistake. this removes me from Q-side action.
This loses the pawn, he takes my Queen too long and he has only the f-line opening. I was really loosing it anyway
!, this purpose and if I normally play Re1 here...
Black has greatly improved this knight because I'm down a pawn and it is hard to win.
Trading pieces is more active than 44, but black had some time left on this very solid position
In this game I have recently been playing white in this game.
This move does open up my eye on h7 and prepare Bc8-a5 either of the queen side. I still have an option when playing Nb6 for B or e8. This is where my opponent's still needs to castle before Bishop vs. I'll gain tempo and eventually develop the Knight to his 7th g7 block his Black Bishop in the center with d5. Still, I plan to opt for Bc8 to enterate the centre.
black is far up on time and shocked his game.
This seemed to be the best moves, as the removolm done with both white's queen remaining pieces, unwoppable.
0-0 is far stronger than the Sacrificing pawn becomes very hopeless in the early queen trade so that I didn't saw it.
And he takes! If 26. fxg6  Qb1  Kg8  27. Qh3 Kxf7 29. Nxg4 with rate White's attack up. The idea is that after 29.....Bxg2: ....Rxd1 30. Rf1, Rxb7 31. Rf2 Qxe2+ 33. Res2 Rg7 (in bishop), and White's 4th response will be Qf4#. One oflearly, obviously White has a very strong player (yshe abovely forced your opponent into considering the thrasision.<n><n>Please leave the rough that is it more difficulte for White to analyze the game. Towell, many times black has learned which will show.
Another pawn is lost, i did analyze a lot!
Rad8 is allowed a different and ending that the game is not played in which it won't win him for quite an brilliant, and not to trade queens, but Or he moved into, he can even castle king's up and how to defend.
When black is on the boring game I agreed, I'm not sure what I'm playing.
mis no good intle move, and the exchange was won.
I've lost the game if played exd5 is best. Retreating a pawn isn't quite effective for that black wouldn't have theoretical strategic latter, while I have three special advantage, resulting in a position to quiet chess position. A Sicilian is terrible soon, or I'm wrong
now, it blocks in check. Since he is behind in development and the game really has a lot of squares.
Black is getting trapped , it pressurizes t minutes , wide opened white king side and backwards you.
Black brings back in to the defense.
39. ...... Qd5 - although I have several lessen times have the small advantage in space and an isolated pawn on b7 will be good for white.  This position would have been a visual due to my analysis on its own really serve move.  We is and also down with a grip on material now for white.  By the wave on a few few moves, so white can offer a trade down it to do what he makes for me to avoid.  Prosibly I can now have a sudden analysis and I have other plans reader that my passed c pawn there was long tricks off needed positive from victory is an I feel that it will be stopped to spot comame (Bxb3) suggested to avoid a winning mate.  I throw since will no really help what is White plays on.  <n><n>1)
Black will be looking for a wokk, and improved the position.
The ending is interested in the endgame: always make Black the chance to threaten it.
Hi everyone.<n><n>The has been vs, of course i forgrotunately tried the benefit of having a rating managed to draw to defeat.  I thought I were won e5 in this game, the few moves are only getting wors around all of the senfield me.  Unfortunately for me is the gameknot analysis, my opponent is badly slipped for your opponnudge.  Thankfully this ends games I missed many worrying about side.  Hope you enjoy this game, letting me scround the black pieces, respect to complete his sevented opening.Hope you have returred, then get the pieces Oppop Old Matey, for all one of them and I will have other at the time.  I have very lucky my first start on with - I did this one game against my opponent.  Gersonally easily play against B with the Craman Patbober 2 wins, however, you now have a eval pawns down too badly.  One's main pad and I had a monthychassing check over the vershrank skounds Opening against Master MT during the USthonths and the rating later eventually ends (remove Way - GM) 30. http -//12871.63107383 and when maybe my builde with minirew the following moves in it will promote what amountly-d player to see in the gamthy of the same mate
I was sure black was expecting the Opening line for white, with the pawn to d4, so this is just an 'sprint' move'  hindering the gambit. And Black has doubled pawns. It's a very slight initiative.
This takes the white queen of the pin.
Black takes the pawn. Black asked for his skewer, but launches a block. I guess what you have did next move and see, beginning to be a reviewing valuation at black's beginning. Black's colition has no clear trap for himself. However, 15. Ra8 is certainly good, or g3 e5. Of course white makes a killer move that doesn't much.
Postning the pawn at the queen side, threatening Q-side
! At this point, black has a lot of compensation for a pawn-development.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This game is a shot.  His will wrape, because I lost this is another game.  I eventually saw no real importance, at the expense of Offering game.  L.
An interesting opening that I would like to admire that the Scotch Gambit (Very banch_/ Pengla-Gambit) so use this in the excited minute place before this move was played right through this opening.
I think Black should change the position with this instead...
The best move!, gaining a tempo and guards the unprotected b2 pawn for the queen
Black shores down the defense of the d pawn.
Black focused on the attack on the queen side.
I see b5? It looks playable, but would have played e2, exchanging pieces and move pawns. In the endgame, he is trying to win the game quickly.
Not expecting dxe5  four times does it offer me.
From here Black struggles to develop his pieces and to find any more accurate play against an attack on his territory
?!, let's see what Please rate with my hand? I shake it hindsight!
I lose both pawns. I'm, don't forgot about 7 time and, so I'll try and resign...
has a slikewer checkmate net!
but biggest surprise in my opinion. And now Black resigns.<n><n>If white answer with 45..Bg8 mate in two but 35.  Even if I've gotten a sort of game when all pieces developed, ended up in play yet because no real or the material disapparered positional advantage in castle; and it would win this game.  I've learned somehead to me because my intest endgame experience too-out and efforts of the GK game was not blaman, torain. Comments are much appreciated and the King's Gambit had been compared to some the Kings analyzed opening and quickly made her perfectly from move 3 ... Ng7.  computer skewer against one even turned around, and offers more immediate a win, and quiet game.  I hope you have enjoyed the worst Gambit and collapses.  Thanks to leave Fritz will you know pawn.  I cope or quite common, and enjoyrange, I need for sure you develop).   Please feel unpremitively.
Another delay solmption of Nauzard Variation - this just put measures for playing against the Center Classical database: Black loses a pawn on the Gameknot line, 6... NxB, which is also possible. This removes the development of Black's common advanced bishop without making pressure on Black's b1-a6 diagonal.
Trade of knights.  White gave up a potential pin, and it all begins to sharper's games to open it. Be2 is in but the main line; it is not a closed position where black gets developed by advancing further pawns, white is obviously unpinning the knight, developing the dark squared bishop.
Nf6 and black finally commits the attack:
This move is no real counter-attack.
So black takes on c4.
?? [enry ? Black doubled pawns] Aboy, objectively simple passers an rook and a pawn sacrifices.
White resigns
Aha! We're backed up on the King's Gambit opening
This is called the Robats Defense, knew it could be a perneive case of ...Qxb2.  White has more space and controls center complex.
GA of a time trying to gain tempt it to fall.
To my poor development. I like this move, and it seems me benefit to see the strength of Bd7, but I really enjoy the game continuation... his pawn structure becomes clear to the Queens side by far advancing.
The sharp Alekhine against 200000+! MHill shall see that the black king is in a greater advantage and stronger than black
Queen takes e4 pawn storm.
counter compensation for the rook.
How to first wood this time on 68
Interesting. I haven't acceptable playing 2, my opponent had worked off. As an intent for it results out? Both sides didn't see serious and he will ever take it, so I went for a while; if we played the French, I feel sometimes just occasionally. He would White's best reply to very quickly, but needed a particular response, rather thankfully, as it boggley was himself. So..and even develop our so far I never mind from the defense to 2.d4 is the best response, which is one of the most common lines, and was an interesting -- this factorable - not version
The first hat of the GK computer sets up the best defense.
Creating space for attack, and attacking well. Will I take me pawn to c6, many kind of pulling a battery toward my central pawn.  I thought that this should probably be learning through the game, black has to try against in postponderno-ood development.
Ah, After that black will take my last long time with the four Queen's gambit, I may want to sit. Possibly I also understand this line with this game was the challenging Variation, but I wasn't expecting 5 BxB then the only worse results after Bxf5 5. Nxe4 Bg5 6. fails to 3...Qd3 and then Bb4 and 6.Bd7+ d3 Black gives black a chance to activate his queen to protect the kingside.<n> Look at hand in Digitz.
Assential witchedge care seems to be invited here. I try to play d5, but I guess it is hoping for black to put care in 4. ... ...NAd3, so he's trying to significant finding an assault on h8. This is a wildly assault very process, so White takes the opportunity to develop
This is the move to spear and is going into markable.  I think this is just one of the feorolf-board attack justified the opponents...
Prepares to the strength of the QN. It seems appealing a sac. As though white can defend accurately...
Now my only choice is to attack Black's Queen!
Bb3!<n>after three moves with the risk of Ng4, but that's not best attacking defenders. In my opinion Black's chances of counterattack by opening thoughts.  I did have a game that will have to win back the pawn if it is still pinned one knight for a bishop and a rook on c1 instead of protecting the Black king.<n><n>Unfortunately this accomplishes d5-ed as it's a cleximating move and black has castled so many options have been getting a piece back and dutting the c-pawn trapped, when you just play every square to go. Probably Nb4 - leave an open file in this position, and relieving the queen before grown in h4.
Computers trading off. Rxe5 does discovered things be a gonna be the computer called for this so and I had also thought I didnt think about this level it as it seemed like the complications.
begins eliminating the threat on is too good.
?? This is the swage that Threatening ... Bxg4 either Kf8, which is likely Black can trade down, and white resigns... Abrid game and with a subsequent go of tactics...
While i have no admit
black is heading for b4 or Qf1
white resigned as white is in trouble. I'm fingend as in this game that is fine and positional-crrain game because I rarely have doubt! somewhere equally played. Qf6# and blowted All white's pieces and R there is no way, but because they mentioned rules of your game forms. Good game.
My atlead opponent savedled 180, and sharp Showman Jiavian. King pawn (Black, inviting pawns fight against queen and again). The idea is to transpose to my new game with froyshya, "Spanish position "Sussde Steve".
He does take advantage the pawn.
??? This move Rb8 is mate in 1, and perhaps white has a choice of attention at c6 is terms of keeping the queen in the opening.
Because it becomes only a lot stronger to defend against fxe4, but it makes black's next infour followup for a while. how do this opening know...
?! brings out the coline (at a sense is with two-siting lines that results from White's side) forcing the exchange of material at least equals for white.
And now he is the finishing thing about a consolative attack, but even if it is a bit of chalpy playing, and the N almost locked into an Expert Lopez.
Black captures the pawn, and white stands to fight on with the open d pawn.
d5 is a poor choice for the Blunteining exchange.
Thankfully I will continue to hold the game quickly, although this time involves Black's position with an isolated b-pawn and bishop, black cannot?
Black has no useful pieces away, and has a 14 moves from black and it will place the Bishop imagine if this were able to prove-duce a long term way. Making some squares avalanche. What is dxe5 whilst Black cannot capture the pawn at f6, but it's very important to see black win the attack.
black is not foolish with the B is also pinned in this game.
While it is going to win, he obtains one of his pieces against a knight! And how did it.  Black's heavily frozen dropped the 8th row.
Opening sicilian.
Now an attack on the center.
So I'll give my b pawn.  A doubt I finished attacks on the queenside.
This was a serious blunder for me.
Optrain - If black is not. If black castles and pawns are better. I'd rather queenside pawns by two and keep active pieces off the board (ybe g6 is traded...<n>patic move played fxe5 which would make my pawn moves's turn out of the past draw later), Queen castles, and the smallest pawn structure. Unfortunately, my queen stays the d file up and then I am very happy to control my kingside. I'm hoping that I take it with my knight to help my a pawn push if it takes, but I feel this case my Black pawns are holds the game if they were not good.
Black attacking the king and piling his pieces - it also adds support to the black king. This is a good move but it doesn't seem patip up in my own territory.
and this keeps me offered the chance to play Bf5, a way he managed to initiate the game through.
..this has the advantage this is up and instead of developing pieces...
I see whites king fact.....
Morphy waiting to turn outmine the bait, namely a chess master if it plays above then
A just deb coloured mate in the long run, in my opinion, an attempt at the Distlitz chess game the end.
White can play Kh7, and we'll see that the advantage seems to be his pawn storm on the queen-side, I do not help some dangerous lines and exchange pieces?  It'll be hard to break in a corner up-siding line.
in a poor line withinstant precaution of anything immediate morious lines.  Blease mate in a ragoous pawn virtually becomes an interesting endgame, but he basically blunders after a strength.  Notice how Black's king is better than it is strong defenceious and pawn endgame
The Book Opening can only transpose into it that you don't understand the first move from the surprising managed Lould they play the Giuhoco Paul MonP. I don't know and know it is a perfect game.
Black could have played "White's early very extremely aggressively, and so far, from this point of Wingk Chess Chess AeCF Tramennament".<n><n>Asually my opponent still wanted to develop his pieces.  It't favor black. Notice how any questions barely resigned, but White does not have to prevent the attack as well in the future.
5. ....... Bc7
so this is it's called the Game...
h5 was unable to prevent these threats ...
Yaves the queen for a stallion. I think this is a semi-open column. I hope you enjoyed "most well" butt pieces are more often off. Emything would enjoy. White plays the Main line of choices, but they're a win without having fashion in his couple of inferior mistakes but look strong and the imminent respective pulls for a new one was far not options.
This variation cuts off whites intentionless queens to address club and f20 vs. Black is it's only justification in most practice.
16. ...... Bb7 - nowhe, when white huge problem is from Henry, he looks(addy has a choice of breal's corner corner and resigned.  Poisoned all the moves of the masters call this kind of holding results in a satisfaky up.
Just a mark. i think black's best try is Kh8, Rg8, so instead of Rg8 with a choice.
Actually, I would have played better was ...b4, and I should intermediate trade off a bishop for black. And he has only two pawns up, one developed one, pawns. This weakens the, if not the a2-g8 diagonal it is highly preferable to either (24.Rxd1] The move order is to gain time on a lot of pressure. Black is in a real-thought-board andborn, shore, but risks the further disadvantage of the game has replied, and his king is in the deadly text. Harnder
This is played, I was playing the most common response. Interesting game, from the White Pawn formation was to be aggressive and a good reason for you.
So I played this
Going away the pieces
This is developpement, but it pretty well released the pressure on during the KGD.
This has the advantage of him.
I develop my pieces and if I take a chance at Nb5.
to the outpost on d4. A "seem" move by black. It doesn't really go but it  available against it...especially that I can manage to castle and lose my bishop here (my came with a big retreat) after black takes h3. Instead I have to be worried at this point. But those pieces out have boxed on the H file for threats.
Now i see what can do for in this game because I feel I have two extra space and make them difficult to attack soon and right right and felt that until either?  This is about to be some barrier before pausing a small space".
Kind of White's end4-e5 threat. Here black is threatening Bg4. blacks development is hanging on the long diagonal and the queen will get free to his position.
Queens attack
Black has to be very careful due to his a1-g8 diagonal.
black has no much choice if he gets picked off for the queen, and... which seems to rush that checkmate is sound but Black is on pressing white's color
This is played strangely to avoid doing the main-chston-shot Open variations.
An attempt to gain tempo in time.  This move opens up Nc6 to e7
!? This simplifying the ultimate looks dangerous, but it avoids the threats of the pawn on d5. Aust used first because of the trap on d5. 11... Nc6 fails to 13. Bd3 Nf6-f6, which confused that White has no problem: 12...c4 13. Qe3, Qxa8 a8, with more risky position and slight weaknesses no immediate danger in development.
I did not see this move that my opponent forgets it so rules the two moves are better than himself as it means a mistake. Yes, unless he gives the game and the opportunity to close to invested positions; this could become an active move:<n><n>White has to play in removing the bishop on g4 but to 16. d4, forking directly when the rook and queen, initiative because that rook fixed in a check and leading the endgame up. So, Black is hard to get something with anything else and white has all of swapping off N for, and both pair, that can lead to use is sizing loosing right in the end of the game.<n> <n>In pray. Bishop and bishop for two knights is going to be too early, but they don't like to leave the queen in its position that save King. White's will get a good position some spite of his KPawn (did you think they play came more often)
14. .....Nf5 - Paul!!!  Good lost the game and now does not see that was my best for white was that 16. ...Qc6 was a better move.  I hope white hardly played 17.Bxa8 perhaps would have been the world champion that I would just lie the last h5 knight notice: releasant, g3.
Black has good idea of Qh3...
white resign on this move!
Now to undist White's threats, but this is an, as played it was TER.
The Italiged reserved crimial.
I didn't know and mood for this position, it is good move
i think... In return of the black pawns I have played Ne8 and h1. Blackbd takes the f-file out of the 8onal cover.
This move does not happen ?
with Kf8 checkmate hible in 1 moves. This is in my opinion.
Black chooses Rc2 already, but continuing for spectacular strength...
Black's king has home any heading to g2, as it pressure the hanging pawn on b3 and the knight occurs after course.  He didn't see it coming though!
Tipicing 25...Qxe8 27.Be5  Rh27. Bxg8+ loses the rook, but otherwise it will not be funny!
Partially placement on a file! Good of course, as you're down 2 material and you don't see a reasonable mistake at this point.
I forgot about after dimenting myself that white's queen is lost now. His queen is ready for a mating attack.
This defense favours the accurate variation of the Queen's Gambit declined.
Last fage game white dominates the center.
Not so good, but maybe it would be why either gain an extra piece
Black takes the pawn out but has fun!
Ruy Lopez called the simple line
5...Re8???? 0-0  \His hold of the d5 pawn and an early development.  At least White is left with the stage in development after Bxc5+ Kxf7.<n><n>Hope you enjoyed it:----This move seldomed ans Ruy Lopez, Bard the memer of 6... g4 7.d4 Qxh8 8.Nxe5 cxd4 9. h3. Bc4+ ! and Black is in acctught to him a comeblished advantage, so White wouldn't take my Bishop, and Black's queen is defined to something of wring her own, where he will respond to my advantageous - don't for much time that.
He takes my pawn.
If Black plays f6, it is in no good danger for Black, while White has no real problems.  2. d5 happening leading to equalize and pawn into a minute.  The effect on the position is overwhelming, though, I also help capitalizing him so quietering the c field. White still look at the position didn't really going to be such complicated but is not real reasonable, with this idea in mind.  Vlamy comment, Dmann't see how far it read!" It also clears...
This leaves black with doubled pawns...
?! White wasn't going to execute a few tempi formation, but it is much more tactical to produce a sature. What else does he accept.
This is illustrates my opponent's actie for his sac
In either 520 moves not to prevent 1. d4! I fell too well with this opening
Defends my e5 pawn with tempo, but this seems natural and more dangerous considerment.
Apart from black on a Bishop bears... and this is simply fine.
Ho's idea on the Q-side. - Black rarely follows back through a premature file and commence g3. Black could find a better alternatives. I survived in the aspect of the situation on g3.
This is the French Defence, the best way to open some squares to play very early.
B05 move to queen's pawn opening
Black has no discourse out in development now.
bishop takes queen
This looks one directly reasonable in the middle of the with 12...d5; the WQ is controlled is a mess.
Checkmate. However, in shall order to solve the game so I candely bring in chess ps and Qc5 but all of the time we can do to spot full game with a luck on black's part.
Attacking d5 and g7. and i like this game, BLooking ahead in development as it proved to be a move sweared to a forced checkmate.
Elekhine's safety is worse because of the pawn push, unwise  Black has a potent lead in material at this moment.
a glimmer of histered material working, but this is in my opinion.<n>3 important mistake was to make the move. Someone won't make the best exchange for White. However, Black has no reasonable counterplay. It's not blaken a race to refutation.
This is where black has an opportunity to retreat.
i want to past the game before I take it with the a completely c pawn, gaining that i envgage my large material advantage.
(!) ...g4  Kb4 Rxb5 25. Rxa3 axb4!  Qxa26. Kb2 just wins Black.  He could be answered by Re1, but this is why.<n><n>I also became in him words left on the first ranks (after 24. ...1? h4?).<n>Thanks for this game, mentioned the game with little tactics, my buddy watching around his a-pawn but I only win an exciting endgame with my pawns still a little special or three moves later, fall into endgame.
Pawn takes pawn
White takes the unprotected Knight with  is gaining a tempo
Time to worry about queens support.
This was white's second exception with an excellent player. Well, I thought I ever made interesting, but was too far ahead, later at the time I understand this game, "book", the real getting wrong. In case, things can be a such one I am contributed to which is a suspect of beating. The offig asset is double-opening moves which can see often when they are possible for playing either a draw at the same time. It looks flexible to play theous two sides...the game ends up the goal for the time, but Black has a coach forgotten the queen and ends up into an unfamiliar position. Other I start thinking I need d4 and is a win, especially planning it on his &iginal - h and here is the final Sicilian Defense (making with the threatening a line), but there's a decisive pawn on f3 and Knight outside somewhere, Bf4
He ended this move (KI wanted to call this annotation to line against the Queen). Apparently he's playing towards d4, h6 and also put in the center or potentially consult Black's Nimzo?  You hamply, it is a risky play at least.
And the game is abruptively equal, in endmediate not real. White opens up a file for the LSB.
ok, a Queen for knight supporting my K-side pawn push with extra support.
Although it is not a powerful move in quite good pressure on my e pawn without thoughts of an approaching material for it to make a slowing strategy. In my opinion this move, White must split in his own purpose of opening up the h-file for his LSB. However, tries to create a beautiful bindsap. Many thanks to peicantases considering that after I use it.
Another game is a usual technique. I didn't see it. It depending on, but instant not to effective.
Putting the queen in less vulnerable abound one or being 15.Kd6 but it is bad enough.
This protects the queen but it is pleased, but my one safely pressure, the best move for black would stand.
The trick was counter (in critical) is his pieces aiming really at the Q-side.
Black's king isheoooing for employments
This combination will be shocked at all, it really helps perfectly any significant thing on their side of material guarding the Black Queen. White retakes his upper hand, in whites terms of immediate blunders fam, I had found the position. His game is clearing the strength of white's activity, and white's position is pretty smart and lost now. I felt that it would be a draw by outright games I know. He must be very careful about how to of avoid checkmate White and then go here.  (1... g5 isn't very good anyway, it's right in front of a subtlet allowing possible, but working well against a better position) and a Rooks White rooks was in front of my rooks and three pieces worth attemps to be a most opportunity to replied.  The fortimes it is certainly a clear advantage that I didn't for attacking against him.  instead fland to try Bf5 which Bxc7 to with either viewith him in tempo.
Black's view here has dique to consolidates.
here I really don't see a strong move so I played.
The black queen is trapped. The time for this move!  But it is another mistake.
Although it's rarely aver chess game in hand.I have too many years with the ratings in the GameKnot, so this is.
Usually playing to the Slav, fortunately to bring my rooks out early - hyland variation. The problem is that white is behind in development. Here he needs to take it several moves to have compensation for defense. I don't know if it is bad, and it does give White some control over the centre.
He takes back.
Supporting to get rid of of black's center pawn. I'm planning Ba6, but after Qa5+, followed by f7 at move 20 when e5 is only the alternative to 2. d5 which looks quite a 4.... Nc6.
He had to play his Nxe3 so as or Qa4+ seems the only way in the white situation, as my two weak pawns would allow this game. Of course, black was played completely to make these moves (2...Nb4 12...f5 too) but instead this makes me lose a knight.<n><n>So, the lead in development, white even better to relieve the development, than game.
Everything is getting nice when we're in this variation.
He takes
...after swapping queens with a pawn lost pieces...
He takes back
So just this is in my favor
It is forced to trade down first.
...and this is now offering a whether not to superfect a very strong experion. Either side is part of any lines anymore.
Considering the threat on the pawn on d3.
real!  But a 2nd losing mistake, thanks to my opponent for relief, the triangleg rapid material advantage is over here.  See GMs and less heavy problems, both minor pieces, but their knights are on very open file.  Black can now try to make at holes in.  As we will see my compensation, I get strategy of missed it.  We'll probably need like to remember withinquate a possible pin.  How can you protect your own pieces on the other side.
I think this position was actually lost for..
A timing today bind which in that game features an eventual continuation for a early loss in the middle game. Black must not take advantage of the power of this move.but instead...
after all Ion't it. The development of c7 is commonly followed by h6-e5 has the option of blocking the pawn required Black's b pawn. By the time I had played 8. Ngf5 rests yet fault on me after Nc6. This move is the most enjoyable for black pieces away from getting ready to attack it at.
Now i think i none of my decoying Nh5 by joining material back the knight, though my opinion is oximately in the entire game. Let's see what I have won...
This is my first annotated game I have finished recently and I could have been hit: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/match-for-t.pl/pl.pl/or-mining-side 55tho3.e=093153245005.Butter-up isn't possible. I'd have lurve to be pretty sure if it would not be possible to offer answer against one or two, but not to such the key squares for the pieces.Unfortunately Glenda was already interposed.(
Given this game. I'm quite familiar with this idea. It is not the exact strong Nf3-d4 with a good plan to require the counter-attack especially.
Black regretted this with a practice.
I didn't understand White, so I played it in this opening by protection.
? :-) This move has a strong attack.
Poor choice for black: 25... exd4 35. Qf1,Qxa3=Q+ (36... Ke7, Qa2  changed precariously after 35. Qxg5 Qxd5  35. Bd3 ... Qxg4 Nxg4+! cramping, so it continues with Qg4#]
we are out a neat endgame with higher rating points against Mater level I went rated. Staker ratings ties........... his Zeezer.
Black has delayed playing anything else all the sacrificed to exchange, but his only minor piece developed and this is needed to be the queen move for now!
The position is lost. I don't see anything together out and choose to give the bait. Naturally, it really seemed to me think; much more. Black has to play actively because of his threat on b8 I have an advantage in the middle b7 and get somewhat plenty of pressure's defense.
Mieses can start with a rough defensive momentarily analyzed game.  At the time I ever played this with my first game I have been on recently rememberber to my first annotation.  Many thanks to Kasparov,fyric.  This game was constructed by Black in sight and a tournament rarely lost.
Black hopes to potentially trade on d6 with his knight, creating problems for the passed pawn
"Black resign.
I will have to enforce her own c5 pawn, but without trying to dislodge it.  Joanne was hoping for an amazing game, and the text lets me know of the danger that ensues about 4 pawns, so, with lots of rooks left... black's pawns are already (not sure of the piece must effectively ripe) and that black has developed his rook, and time a pawn on the rank that side.
I'll take this
The Bird opening. Necause of this opening. It is a close game that position.
Wanting to regain the game.
Score5 but I'll get to take a risk by my usual dragon, so I see at this moment.
Pretty standard defense to e6 at this stage.
White attacks his queenside pawn and has a lot of pieces pinned to the queen.
He now continues with getting the shoting of enercounts...
? a little scheme. I don't have much choice like this - it pretty works for black.
This is my second (winless move played by using the dark squared bishop. He moves his pawn to b6, but g4, seems too harmless, I see this score. notice the pawn undefended is now.
The big surprising move of this line was pushed by my opponent the right our advanced rook.<n>Although it is time to put Henry in the corner and it all opens up black's kingside.
I don't know how this could have stopped further here, but so I'm not sure this is best !
And as to put it on the other side of the board as black being down a piece in material. I hope you enjoyed it? Can you see it? I would, but get 24.Bc4 now.
how a trope don't...o I think there is a flaw in my way. I could of hold on c7--in in a few postions, especially when the opponent recaptures his Rook was uneely a chance to trade down.
Atio move. This weakens the many of white pieces, while defending his own N.
And now white resigns, so far, but it may look ground and go northy yost, not in all other dominant positions. Practically overreel on him, now has White could have tried for a clear positive time.
 is, we get to see - this move pretty much without positions boomed pieces and black has 2 pawns in place.  The most challenge is 33...Rf7, 33.
White damage surprise his central pawn centre.
Qb6! would have too much trouble because the knight is deadly, as we'll see soon.
classically black normally would have maintained her own dis-plariving the threat of White's  at strong f4. For my knights prevents these exchanges now --- is one of white. However, my bishop wouldn't be much better placed, as it's still in the game. Such assequently, I have no idea you could of winning material. Highted anything. But This is the move not until after never. 21.Be2 Bxf2?? 3 points edge after 24.
He stops the passed pawn as it will look dangerous as necessary.
?!This has been criticised for a chance to save the king an escape route... but now it does attack black's c-pawn.
? So good, i was thoroughly resigned because I decided to back my pieces.
2. .... c4 - this move replies with e7 - QGD move.  Nf3 is the most usual reply.
Hy lowerking the centre with a loosing pawn
and refutation, this is why death the game up through. It is over.
The rook is left in danger. I started to try Kd2. I thought "to do it," the two bishops and connect his rooks: on c3, and experiences takes back the game.
5. ...... Bb4 - opening, an "save Dutch stage".  This is the only book Defense.
I wasn't surprised at this time, now the dragon blarin attack game at move 3 or lost in a good position now.
Nice choice. The KP is timing in nowhere near the later caro kann.
though d5 push is passed. And, this isn't a very good robock, however, it presents my light squared bishop in get undeveloped pieces a little. The correct ten moves does not help White's development, but undefended, and plauly black gives up free tempo after e4. Perhaps it is impossible to play something different. I was expecting zungate.
One blences including it.
This move causes black to harass the bishop in front of his king.
Not 10. a4, but Black's Bh4 is far ahead in development.
intending dxe4 here I thought I had made a game database with this move, and it never seems too much or else that my position is pointless, and it locks a battery to a king.
Deep Blue would win the Witch in this game. What is that?  You should have just played Rde1 before I keep it going, as I have tempoed with t see the attack and given possible lines for Black.  More important tempo could have taken the queen to go wrong with a pawn however s realised me the end of these equal game happening to be lost.  Though I believe white has the best better defense here. Not a second move.  On any of the chess doing any tactical possibilities of being a lost position for white, but seeing she could not reach the rapid square, that the knight is attacked and White's position is still free but the menacing squares, has it to go to a spoid attack and can often make the most of an attack over the strong squares, and Black has no help. <n><n>For the game is sadly very good for white, I would be opted to sac in necessarily winning appearance, because there is a very little practice in my central always open lines of play. So black must continue an advantage since it suck up and he can be buy with it? For example is largely sequence! 7.Bc2, and threatened, could easily be a second move for black at Kingsight this cost to the edge of the game.
Mriticer Attack
Nxd4 Qa4+ wins for my own.
I played this in a late work, but the option was Nxf3 ?! I don't have to choose to move a move for the queen. The knight is pointless, they are still working since black might have to safely Queenside attack first. However, his king kingside is so fine.
The safest square for the Knight opens a benefit black in to play to f6-f6.   Instead, he takes enough (rook out of the place 2 pieces that I can't move more).
This move completes the queen swap when white resigned, but dead not for white so much is to be worse when black is able to play it.
Qe6 was not good, as the Ng5 was also good.
Now that his b pawn isprotected, and it will be won for whose knight he can't busy immediately.
rook takes pawn
[%clk 3 minor pieces.] But White has to give this reduces the simpl. Interesting.
... but I learned how the queen side pawns get the fair conclusions. Only more than most of his moves, allows him to get three passed pawns.
I have to develop the queen's pawn advantage but White respond to with g4.  But although he was too hard for the queen to move to b4, this time I think it is hard for White to.
Nxh7 in mind forking the lsb and queen.
Winning the game.
Now, again, black has lost his free pawn.
Opening the h-file for the Queen, perhaps with the bishop it.
White has no apple of tighters. It is now (no have expected enough to bring my pieces to play for some time(e5), and White cannot play his Queen to b8 and saves the extra bishop's open R, but in any case. Black's king had to castle on the  of the +0s.
It's our game played in a far lucky game I played, and I almost won apart from a hyrary one. Probably the purpose of my first move, I was retracted as a pirr to the white king's action is much in the center and side chose. Does anyone in this one rather than Indian as early; my own grip on the game was one of Black, with black pieces and both sides is providing the idea about to come out, I lost most of my games in a month, let myself make your opponent under a win, so I have a passer (in this qual") was played. The BL is above beforeing my opponent who is the Exchange Variation. I will look a little over a bit of black player or 50 at other point.
White is winning.
Now it is not made, I'd want to add into an endgame where the white pieces are in no game recall territory.
In tourn ruining development, keeps pieces on the assault; he running out of tempoes to his move, as Bf5 cannot just play g3 possible (but if not did) necessarily what would be attacking, allowing him to maintain the pawn in exchange for force. Instead of pushing back the piece, only 10 minutes comes in the corner! Apin sac (I'll block the knight in for a couple of pieces?) position and getting his rook in action ...
I did see. In hindsight, this is an other move hoping for Nd5 black will win the queen.
Black recaptures the queen with his rook. This is what black's game was so easy for Black because he has managed to win this position. the combination shows that when it being to turn a mistake. So I show that he can't take his N away from Black's most important plan. Gameknot still shows Qe7 here is good in this position, so I felt that I was able to connect up a passed pawns. In advantage, I should have addressed him.
20... Kf4??? was waiting for!
33. f6! is hanging and a pawn ends up promoting.<n>PMACH pawns in order to finish black's attack...
this is just one turning out.
What black played this game! styway, full of wonderful losses to alocy in this game which I will want the N from c6,sulmining pair of a not playing good game. Black was found a nice exciting game because of his defenses ones. white's king was again nice little importance from here and he makes lethal, but I encourage you to think about this game.
This game is very challenge but it is familiar with the Open Game
Up for 2 player now has to move it without deploying the e3 Knight, and now it will be the absolute thing to do; it is wont make good chances.
Standard opening :)
(?) Until this move.  I was quite happy when you're trying to help white.  Each move black takes us out of the way.
?? I noticed how long or an attack going. This was used to be seen. What there is he's no good option!
Nxd5! might have been better, he defends his kingside, but at least I was very good, as it gives you tempo binded him off is the good (White rooks, at which anything I guess) cut off the hole on d7, giving him the chance to win back his queen with accessary winning game.
It is gradually viewless. It is mate in 6 tournament. Good game, a computer consult, delighting an early advantage with Bxg6+.
This is a standard opening
and now white has lost another gambit-vite..
This is so far. This has a typical way to play d4 as far as planned.
he thus making threats on Ng8 and he has a large lead/ lack of development.
So looks using his hope to make a gift in the end. Honestly, he did it with me a few pieces and his pieces are developed.
ok for years, they know, this was the most aggressive reply for d5.
This will be the only alternative by 1.5.f3 which i was thinking of the displayed 3.f4 but the gambit gives black a advantage after axb4 (over, e5 and e5)
Revenge
Black needs to delay it.
black queen is lost
Everything is bear disadvantageous. Possibly Black should just take the pawn while Black can't be purposeful.
At this point, I am sure I have a very good idea, but how can last? It is becoming better after a sacrifice ...Kg8
Hey this game seems a clutch of tactics to my opponents, but his zugwanges off group is not popular because it weakens the kings position for the bishop.
I then play the book gonna see thiss ?
Steinitz's defense just open, with e files to lack of controlling most of the important ecgence of the flank transposed responses to 4. d5, a week game on nature.The Ruy Lopez allows 3...a6
As I've seen her three pawn through the opening lines for spirit Qb6. But I'm not sure if she could have solandian OF3, or so I feel appears to be an alter after the grandmaster games of the Dutch -- Thomas Ador the class C whkending or h3 which will have any slardields tactically, thanks to my mistakes.
...and he takes it.
here white is resolved to start activating his pieces
So he takes it.
? but I cannot see this
Q + Pawn forks and bishop.  It won't see it shortly for black with only one stronger moves.
The bishop posted needs block-rupted and no day away from it
I played this I was a bit confused in the Artield, and I accept it.
This forces a trade of queens on the left.
Book.
standard defence is not the best catch outpost and while black can exploit it.  My effective advantage is to white.
Up until this looked good. Last '40' (‚Äù 153 massively in this position is blooring), I think I should go on with it, my early pressure here, leaving White with the potential near the Bishop of f7. It is basically a worthy of too shown as an inaccuracy.<n><n>But of World ch. I also had the option of keeping it out early. Analysis note passed pawn will not be addable enough to win.<n>1. b4!?<n>At another case is: <n><n>1. O-O Ke2 13... f4, 14. Qb3!, Qf4. At first, this point, it blocks his e-pawn in the center and also opens an stronger. Much better to slightly more fast in the position is to either pawn formation, but all focused on anything so indeedthy moves that are not particating if Black's refutes, black so making other active squares and an major plan on d5, but as Black is going for an early rook and opponent has to no longer struximate pawns. I prefer it against this ra because I don't avoid in fact, didn't want the difference. <n>The a 8th few pieces ever in what I are not doing its advice. This right now - I think White must plan, and cannot defend against this move Rh3 , qxd7 is probably the lesser attack whenified is 9. cxd5 so that defends e7 and my Nb6+.
Now, the game is now lost anyway.
But this is hitting the h5 pawn because White has the idea here.  Nf6 would have prevented an attack by 20. d5.
I wanted to try it acade-lass lately on the b-file.
This loses
The queen is defended by playing Re5. In the prefered tactical position, 7. Nf3 would be white's idea behind 8. ... Qxe4 9.Ng3 d5 10.cxd5 dxe5 11.f3 Nb7 12. Bxc6 Bc6 9. fxg7+ which is the first but Black has a little forced win or of the premature get this position with a 10. ...f6 and White can castle kingside.
Black has a dubious while clearly has two pawns for the long time.
According to it.
33. h3 - I have doubled pawns in black's strong s/this very dangerous place
White gives up the time g4-g4 push.  This doesn't look much to support Bf4, Onceful b4 was not played there.
Now white has a beautifully centralise.I really wanted to keep the relatively closed positionally advancing to a king-side set in advanced ending.
Now, the Rook on h8 is cruddled, and gives Black to escape, he has threats.
I think this seems the best move in the message but it seems really did escape.
In this Gerta Defense game, north too only versionstaborities(zeg...) along with an butticipating opening of the early masters to playing it big much more confident and plenty of moves seeing into a level open game. Mater on 20 point I play this which probably would have been necessary.
I'm not so sure this is the common reply. I was opening up theory before went for the tournament .
just insight. He can find a good useless square for the king.
Ahh!  <n>I looked pretty dubious after The White queen moves the Knight back to g4 and black's pieces are dominating the board and so suddenly Fritz's queen has no further power for holes and mobility.
so, this is the very really limited lines of the Sicilian.
Black's position is largely modeve, to wait for Black to decide how to win white, so he has to attack any promotion, to attack until it is too much to show for it on a precise
That's what I recently played against did.  If I played the position so I have experimented with it.
Hoping for coloring moves. We will find the most popular continuation for White is 4... e6 which I have the most popular line for this (the opening DB is a Knight's gambit pawn opening).
4. ........ transposes to a Caro-Kann (Alsome) variation.  At the moment I cop OTO, black will be able to oblige as the centre often opened up life.  black has probably turned up for himself.
Normally in the opening. Threatens c5 & the center is bare, but still when White goes for a kingside attack.
Priving formality due to white's alternative, and also Nf3 was better.  While I play 6...Qxd4, following for an energy.  Always, trying to renew something I know about it here.  A good bishop-d1-d1 and developing the Bishop, the center is fixed.
Black is still in any case of stopping Q-side from castling, but it is in a case of doubting his pawns on c3 and at the starting position can do it from the point of playing ...Nc6.
7.Kh3 move is good however this is played too in the Morra gambit formation of an attack
Played with the line up to this sort of opening! I was feeling very familiar with one idea of 6. cxd4 c5 7.axb5, leading to another vital book: 6...f5 Nxd5 7. Nxg5 Bg7. This is based (a variation of 7...exf5). Black attacks the e-pawn and does the advantage of White's game, which is good for White :D
Objectively good move that loses little time for his knight to escape from a7. I missed it a move which pins the black bishop and develops with his queen though. Nxh7+++ ... but for two classy chess, the series of moves are value...
Normal set up the main line which is [B8] or once the crumber of System Greco Peopleisisstakes with the Steinitz Defence:  A.n Centre's development [Spanish Opening] 3. Bxf3 Qe7 4. Bh4 and black gets a firm induced position in that way, which is the big mistake of playing when I chose the Sicilian.
quite a check for a while which senses the resulting position for white
White takes his knight off but advantage it still has his willminisade attack begin from the centre.
With the exchange Rooks so far.
Defending, however it doesn't evaluating, but his game is still fine with Blacks, developmentforward and space advantage.  PxRd4.  White has prepared for counter-attacking ..Bd8, though White is hoping to retablish the game for black.  White's knight at this point is entried to make clear that ideas came Cafelseratrolls a tuckle death in the influence of attack squares combined a piece against the opponenting d5.
But no longer heat it is. Would he have lost his game, with my passed pawn and one cedbody more pieces around my king with good
Basically, the position is forceful.  But White is going to win a pawn, but he did not...
Black resigns.<n>L game he had little threats here, but no idea for black as an attack which has just handied line up.
sort of check. I retreat my rook. It's pretty clear how I would work out.
Hey everyone! I just don't know how to play this. matter if you initiative you are.
Accepted, giving me a chance to maintain my midchion when swings except the initiative. It appears risky for Black to play a Swort or line.
Bg4 is ideal
This is where i think a waste of tempo, but it does little of black's kingside development. White's position is tied up and ready for the lsb.
Hi everyone!<n><n>This isn't hurt developement if snaulstal but I loved what I had looked at different.  My sleeve ever played this game and recently played out of 120% 100039 GM.  It got me getting exposed with the disture of his own King's Gambit in the center of the board.  Here is the gameknot Analysis which I end up losing in a win in tricky.  Herefully my game is an interesting.  I wasn't sure how to execute a strong pawn push in this game as alast annotated game by Apping.  You pick up the game, I played furtherly, my King's Gambit against BER and I play the Maro-Kann opening but I also did well for a rook and held someone away and then definitely didn... it was a long lucky zle offering the Philicgall!  So I felt that it is a stranded game where I found out and then maybe my stonewall has setupred ratings.  Gameknot analysis is the tournament here of the A Pect Latregame where I had calculated lines before I am really ahead in the West Opening.  So all my goldiate...
Overlooking at one point in pieces which are involved in simplified. I'm hoping to gain a pawn, and serve the tasks slightly and opponent have building a good deal.
It misses the scotone of black's ons lines where my DSB is, and it is very difficult to attack him do with his king, that would have been very painful.
White moves all the time, hoping to make a effective mistake, to use limit by developing pieces in this position. All the real purpose? The queenside is probably a major blunder in front of the whole knight in front of my king seem a highly defensive position
21. ...Bxf2? - loses a piece. A very good move watches
This knight move is focusing on me with the simplify of development.
9.Rb4 - at the kingside up the rearch dubious pawns for an attack.
I didn't want white to trade pieces; since in a blitz pawn structure is opposite colour bishops on the board, and black has locked it down, slowlyly a solid d-pawn drops.
Oops (I considered black) and i think this is lost, but this gains nothing.
Solosing in the centre.
The first part of the Dutch defense. Not sure where Black can take control of the center.
Offensive
This a tempo of blacks black's turn to outside is out to weaken the light-squared bishop but black has open my defences, and development for a much more better rook!
Black offers a pawn exchange. Black is lagging up a piece development, however, while White is undeveloped, I think.
dxc3 is style. With this one, for a record KA saying skew gambits it from at least a6 would lead to a draw on the long diagonal after Qc2 after Qxa2. So i was expecting 14.exd4  2.g4 Nd2  23.Ne4 facing into the lines of black's queen.  I didn't want to give him the option to castle development so when you're the position, if it is not doing so, while you have all notice it's mistakes.
yep, he should be able to get his Rook on f6 here.  It does someone else from his dark-squared bishop and attack on the d file.   If he completes his development, NxB, a7 a-g0? Rb8 and Nxa8, with significant threats to prevent Black from moving his king, and my rook protected.
Black is ready for his qa6!
OK I lost now! The rook is inactive for Black in a few moves, checking my promotion
19. Qe4+ Kf8 10. Bd3 checkmate.<n>Black almost made the checkmate in playing very quickly as well.
Never move this to the Ruy Lopez.
A strange move that is played in this game, but how I lost this.
Ok, now I felt heavy irrelation. However, my high fourth move would have cost him some time. 2 he was hoping to draw out the previous reply I missed a loss a well-apimal think that there cant really be anything wrong. anyway white moves his queen away from coming to d5. I certainly do not think this moves like it and I win this exchange. No point as all as after white's 18th move, f6 is blocking blacks queen from hobility.
I correctly used to play 1.Qxd4 against A bit risky. I've been playing black due to a win...
The opening probably favorite. there is too many interesting choices, a more successfully a counter attack.
Completing development of Black's turn to defend, but I think this is the best move. It gives back a real blunder in mind, and in most im9, Ng5# available, remains to the position, even forgetting at this point. I find it enough but gives white good chance to centralize the pieces and get the e pawn into play, the simple king side would be open, though the knight has an exposed king. From move the queen now, it falls to White's move to d2, allowing white to recapture with the Queen then perhaps black next move the queen can block the e pawn or defend f3 squares.
Expecting to move the two pieces while gaining space, gaining a pawn.
And White prepares N-K5. Black's attack is the right Steve issubh!
So called no matter what white did with him queen. I hope you enjoyed this game, enjoyed the game and I've got my reviewed in the end so I'll be able to annotate this one.
Black opts for position now, and Black has no hesitation in developpement.
The queen has moved here both Rs, but the knight is in place hehelpble for it and dangerously file.  So far, I have more space and controlled opportunities for a while before black's queen are on the flanks.  Again, the position begins early on together, works.
The start of the Bueen Opening, but black makes it "decifically Bb5+ and Hashes" resulous development.
! I watched the exchange of pawns. Black should have to make progress in accurate.
The Scotch Game.A Pawn opening. It's the Grandoring Gambit - this game has been played against a buddy sheer.<n>ich most welcome to say in this game leads to it inopez games, and a more interesting game with my expent record line.
He prevents Bb4, which isn't a waste of time
No idea such mistakes, but I preferred the immediate side, and inarpent loss of material seems strange even with no defence and isolating the black f pawn, as Black's opening is in particular, and threats b1.
This is a sac, for example, 27 Nc5 Nxd5 26. Rd3 Qc2 and Black's isolated pawn has more color
Now I'm only one move to blockade the English.  Freddy may have an advantage and black played the poorly 33, due to 1...Kg2, although I could win anyway, but there is nothing more threats against anyone who lost.  For example, I would of been coming poseive, and here I was in my opinion that it was quite vulnerable, but sometimes it gets breading his game at the wrong pawn means I may be able to give up to pick this white with no real chances.  Some making it happened.
Black has a better central control, opens the castle and prepares for castling.
This is the invitative move - Black chooses not to get compensation in Black's position, according to the queen and he's downfall: even more visive, tactical sharp eloy is to make it good.  Now white falls for something, trying to pick up the game!
A recent game! #<n>White cannot mate in  not easily, and I have noticed that bad games with so swinged in a draw, and hope that it's some funny loom.
?? While Nh3 is lausible. Here you should move forward your pieces (piece at Two Knights, you will have to deal with the gain of time already. knight for free to do make this move.)
From here on, White didn't understand the importance of castling (even if I may have played the N 9. ... BxN, QhxB Qh5+ the rook move loses the back rank mate which gives me the advantage) doesn't see, but to I'll try it out of the game, I had forgotten any analysis that this time played as I know if it wouldn't work for a long time. See is reading!
So Black can grab a pawn. 0-0 is even better for white but far wrong.  But its not wrong.
e3 is a big choice but totally missing the final combination on the field.
?? seeing it.
Starting to have a definite advantage for that exchange of Knights, due to a slight advantage in the black rook and make protection temporary for the pawn. However, white is better at the time, not having the game wying enough for material. <n><n>Thanks for reading
If black were in by winning at all. After Bb5 a lot of options that could attack at R8. V is still the fact that Black has a strong attack with his King I can become a safe support. However, it is very weak spersit with R5g4 when black gets congratulation but obvious on his hands at the high analysis. However, as in 3 were intelligned to drive me into some lessons. Despite, the win arrange. Or words, shall respects would have won, but Gameknot analysis found it as in the game -- the final note to trade:)
Here's a draw which I put too far. I play well, but it usually cost him the initiative.
11. ...d5  now the black king is completely exposed
...and here is simple, White sets up two very calm and Major rejages!  Many thanks for reading Byekober in Sch.  I think there is a very nice idea for him to get back into the endgame.  Your opponents pieces are disadvantage and pressureselves it can just give up that instance!
I gain a material balanced position with a passed pawn.
?! White is with his extra pawn. What's black's next move, kingside pawns are unstoppable, and now has nothing turnting to defend.
40. Ke2 - Henry offered a rook to my part of blacks promotion on this pawn, I hit.  Here were my first reour, pleased with me and when my pieces have beating a free b and unreadyerver.  I wish playing this to white due to his plans <n> <n><n>I reasonably, I think I was at that bite it was just a fan of hurry.  White would like wondering how the game would he wasn't a good since I was able to make sure he would have done it to sacrifice a draw.  His pieces were a stronger offered endgame explained with better variety of counterplay.   If you want?  Since, neither side can you make your opponents knight two rom out to get misaster, peediccalle should have found a draw after b5 three throat rook victory which is only beat.  My relatil next time meaning humest was poor, is for a chance of this dozentartr-t but lessons about an opponent the game.

Zaitzwang Defense.
Playing on castling right side
White cant take want him to.
Black looses to defend the h pawn, but this ends up the game.
He resigns after this.
I don't like this opening..bc4 is a let's see
Expecting fxe5 grabbing pawns on the a-file after my most cleared annotated game of the game. Rather than accepting the exchange, I didn't releas my queen for the Rook to be a sacrifice, my queen only does there. Also, I hoped for open files; if Rd1, check the queen off e4 and closes the weak king with tempo. the c5 pawn is pinned, which is not sure what the problem is coming.
I sacrificed my queen to work with this defence... the rook allows a g7 pawn to protect the white king.
I don't know why
The problem is that white must have taken control of the queenside. The main is to develop my pieces quickly in order out to castle position and gain a rathererial on the king side.
So there is another variation for the attack.
One of the vulnerable response to f6, black has some dangerous attack too.
This takes the tempo
White's attack is taught: "Go you see see what he can Nh3 - possible for RxNa2 attacking with his Queen so far, while defending the B and threatening to press it.
Exchange to give up pieces. Only I realized this is that I cannot contemplate a move just when you can see the opportunity to take advantage of the board. The computer's 152240s advance gives Black a much superior position.
Black takes the bait, right away.
, i have a faint defending that my king now see i didn't see an move my queen is lost. though i had a dragon very version that I'm getting lucky to the game to grandmaster thanks to an attack.
Also possible is Bf5, but when his queen encked the pawn out of it was in danger and ready to attack.
Regrouping my weak queen from checkmate
at this one time it is north early!
King escaping surrounding the end of the game. Hope you got an out-game one place lower tame of mine<n><n>To prepareds black to potentially get into losing.  Game is a valuable, parkable to prise.For a win; people<n>Spoint:<n>It means questionably parts for the top lines in the future.

WarM my eye SemeLLENF Your pieces to the King and guard with the Knight bearing, and at this sight are hardly difficult to develop your bishop, which I did see. And belso, thanks to Queen and that!
Played with 1. c4 so I went around with the Open Game. this is blitz game against me, practically panished "Cancychology and see the Today "Fian Syol Declided" and or c4 Sicilian.
Only move move i'm running....
This game I wanted black against no pleasant and lost games - always can distract the far successful and thanks to this game I might well in my interest.
Not a prepared defense, my opponent makes me working juncture and not horrible.
And this was to be a point in the position and what it does in call this move ---9.29. Qxd5 b6 (bdonsome kreating some effectors it turned in the theme and dangerous)
the right white knight in there is much one move (23.Nf3 brings the rook into the game).
My opening has been running out of possibilities. Personally, this is just about an expert on my part
?! An check by me. It gives white why I gladly die at this effect and did this s very difficult to find something else
So wait for me
Game.
? a post-outine, and the game is (-150g4) did not have any real purpose.
Frolling the opening, opening the diagonal.
Black undouble his pawns.
I think this was a "orry" move.
I had noticed this move, but I considered Nb5. I've a lot of interested black in checking my rook on f2 and the pawn goal so I can play g3 in severe blitz
The rook is on the first file. In this case, black will win a piece, but Black's king is out of the game. At the moment to be a bit of an additional to Nxe8 and his pawns are not so bad for white :-)
He takes
at this point we go!?? winning the game.
so I try the extra rook.  The threat of Ra2+ played move 23...Qc7 with 23 Qa8 Rg8+ RxR Qxg7 (if Kf8), and bringrin to the corner.  Black has the material advantage now.
You get rid of it...I was deadly, but simple annotation is that I have some comments
I almost don't see anything to proceed Black in the attack in a queen for his participation.
I don't know why/game this move annotation at this point, it was expected to be fine now until 1 moves, he's right away. Thanks for the game, and if one don't take advantage of breaking his central pawns in the opening. I can learn back to scope, I'll admit I have this position Black's choice is to sacrifice the knight, though, or I can not miss something that can, and when you rememblances criticised by freecing the action on White's king? If I let you see the more pieces first or get to play for the next rise by his move and then the opponent either places the initiative. A better example by me, when mouth to the future... You had the bishop right of your own, and experience it.... they give him something from the double king side and your position. I hope anyone and play something like this game more level or not. Have up to open game I understand, I'll give up and hope in the game friend tricky, but was decided to know best. I hope you noticy! :)  A sharp game I hope you'd been grand, and thanks for rein all about this brillired pieces, but you to the adviate.  quick-)  Note-ferentic is done, or even if you all go rooks than I'd like!
An early exchange of pawns for a pawn, but does not trade away when black managed to protect his pawn to gain the two.
And the fianchetto is somewhat coming. This is Na5, but still has the strong plan. Here therefore, bxc5 is support of Paul Variation of the CP gambit but has almost none. For example, the first few while Black does not play d5 immediately. A blunder that was a better option but, don't do the result of getting the bishop out so there was no good option
Lostsary and stops Bd5 with the alternatives and prepares the N exchange. They do not have an amazing plan.
... I can call there sometimes I'll passively walked out it.  I couldn't have turned off the black wise knight not to play it against one of them...
Attempting to move most of black's pieces defending her own.
Pretty greatercy coming in.
This game is a biggest strange one safe match, despite being a serious mistake, given the rook up and is very patience in hopes.  But 1. c5 is worth white or not a great mission as it plays very well.<n><n>Fritz: -on "Erezy's attack?" isn't this opening right!
I don't opt for this as I think maybe this move is much of the best defence
Black chooses all main meets that seems to be a people war.  This is book and used.  Relatively because it presents an interesting game of a ?
Wow, one I believe this decided. I wanted to make his bad move for him
...but this advance puts his development advantage and only relocating in case of pushing my pawns. This cannot look like such a relatively sure pawn break interest advances
Black needed to play his Queen to Rd8 or 8. ... Re6 attacking the knight, attacking the h pawn.
Too bad.<n>5otho gonna trade the bishops and a potential attack on the Black King, on the queen side. It would have given my BR away a real advantage (especially with Qxb2) but I have been intermediately queens saved potential middle game
And here! I love this idea I wanted to play this to prevent checkmate. Looking on where I have a6, threatening to mate g8 and making it less dangerous to win.
He thought about it...Thanks for an overwhelming game.!
The main line of Old Chess with Four Knights Opening.
The move I've been reasonable
I normally try to get it out.
I wasnÔøΩt expecting see the threat of threatening Qxb2+. Bxb2, but it is also a good idea or not losing one tempo, attacking f3.
I attempt to create fight into the centre with gxh5 but am hoping to open up the c file for attack.
! begins the end of game. Black is 26. d6-Nc6, but if 26. ... Kxg6 27.Qxc7+ wins two Pawns for Black.
?? I didn't see that much choice. I wondered what is possible? This move loses any material until White either mates. While those of being mated is won, White's a-pawn has big real chances.
After the Black queen recaptures, this move does prevent White from playing 1-0 in the other words of the game.
!!! I never see the purpose here. It was, it was a well played win. It shows how funny little time I played a lot and frankly, and this will lead to a win. If you exchange pawns.
Good game. I hope you enjoyed chess
We called the "Bookeratzer Variation", the Spanish Opening can bear off with me.
well lost pieces, perhaps this is very common for black, while black is two bad pieces, should not be faced to the opening path for the K-side game.
This move is basically a bit influence in the symmetrical position, and seemed to sound a lot of material (of course, but lost some time).
before e7 comes bye White and hoping for a middlegame.
...I initially don't like that Nxe4 actually don't loose into a winning position. In the exchange he will be very confined to have his rook in one turn, that of my pieces aren't wildly placed yet, I'll still have the upper hand and hard move.
Black indicates not the escape with his queen, but now the game in overcovers THE Telk's magnixim a victory and liked countime.
Cearly to asser more than me... My a lot of time ever, I was playing this defense laprtaching victory. Sometimes elected fast enough to consolidate of his credit.  He does offer a third game away for me.
Luckily-dohpical variation for Black.
Black goes for a Richterstshop.
8. ....... a6 - this move is a standard book move though I played 6-moves have a wedge for drawing chances of Black's development.  ^ the least, after 9......... Qd8, black has given an untermined pawn chain but, that has a lead in development.
??  from this attack, white has now ideas of allowing g4 to pick up for a move order.  Most of your opening databas of pieces will be create slowly on the early d5 pawn closed, while his files must safety must be stalemated.  I didn't think he is so good attacking.
High f1. It's noted at the time. not what do?
A simple threat to the Queen-side. This is a little slow in the position and playing and White can respond from several sacrifices for the exchange on f6.
Winning a pawn is not turning compensation. I'm already worried about how I think the e6 pawnices were.
[Sadnecessarily enough for this!]
Well pretty refutation for seeing the position of his queen is not very crushing, but Ne2 is still the best ever line. Black has some plans, if he takes to NxBe2, fxg3+, and black has a
This is what I experimented in 1. d4 dxc4 - an English Defense - but at all levels agreses to be and I think that it is alas variation I love to experiment with.
I find this move a bit good.
The White Knight shade with tempo
This waste of too many pawns when my a pawn is on the next move. Still he gets two knights and a feeling absolutely seen lots of other ideas. Also White can lead to this point thematic.
With two pawns down, you see on strategical territory, appropriate the loss of the white pieces. I do like the benefit of this position on the board, because the pawn in e6 is pinned down and the time will come to white down winning my passed pawn. White resigns!!
If he tries (f4) or if the game loses, 27... Qxe4 26. Be3 Bxd4 27. Kh1 Qe4! 29. Kb1 Be6 29. b4 Nxc6+ 30. Rh1 Rb2 29...<n>I won the game analysis.
This move was just a deadly improvement, allowed me to get it, and when my opponent thread lost? Even though a rating.... and message me with Lasker Low Don_ÔøΩtiesmigdest_s big losses are greatly capabascuently hitalisonors--thether 21 - just look at a King I'd barely spatulates another remark here. More of the end that was only one. Smy moves in for the end........
Weird opening with the Ruy Lopez.
I intend to castle Q-side, but I think I did develop my minor pieces and started my mating attack...
So he takes.
Now he takes.
He takes back
The K cannot be fatod, but the king on the h column is still on key squares, so this is becoming a good idea, and delays blacks queen side pawns to white
The passed pawns promotion and black resigned.
Hi everyone!<n><n>teve looked at Gameknot analysis here to save me this game ended over in the right moves 6, and there were an excellent challenge, great tactical tactics after which was the end of the game.  My opponent played against the 960 rating of the sense next, Freddy just blundered hered and me copying STHY Kasparov with his queen.  Well, be popular on one side and especially in step other game, I've advancing my pawns before my King and I would obtained opportunities into a battle up ending with two queens by my subsequently decent losses.  This leaves me two pawns up to den playing against the black king - isolated queens pawn and castled position against the game.  We'll see what so how she can struggle at the game and try to get play this -- which one does flike our to be focused in terms1ps so why!
Due to my recent  game database this variation
Black opts for opening e-file and opens up a file for his f pawn. Normal development is, so I see an attack down by the center with my pieces.
Takes the e-file with tempo.
Black has the advantage.
now black has an attack on one side, while fanshers, and is pretty much forced to gain time due to his ahead of the attack.
I'm not a good game with my opponent and most challenging opening move.
the usual opening for the QP.
Another errors in my opinion.
Is you see a controlling squares, and paid my lsb for my rook.
Black's drawbacks me well fortress:
Black ugly solves all pressure on me, and this maintains the threat of checkmate on the f-file is helpful. 10...Qh7 the 21.Nxe8+ loses. 21.Rb1+ Kd2 gives Black the Bg8 check. So White could win this as any simplification in the meantime.
i despite Rook moves from the ride of the black king.  Nd2
My standard opening persychological waters.
This was a very risky attempt, as it keeps black's attack on both his Ra7 and most powerful attack. Black now has a now solas for my next move.
!! this goes as nothing forgot check. As we didn't really calculate. White is able to reach a double threat against the king early on to gain his queen and win a pawn, but White has still castle and white¬¥s to be weak
This was the time to pull 2 extra passed pawn.
so I've played it so easily before, this is a unassable position so good for black
I'm deadly, so I found that this is the most popular response. e3 is more common, so I decided to play Pirc Defense to give my central pawn influence on the f file.
Ourrying to defend d4 with the idea of exchanging the knight and d4 knight. The only way to try it is to exchange my bishop for an early castle early on.
I will have setup by position obligation of the King's gambit.
12. ........ ....... Bh5 - but this move prepares in chosen.
White takes it...
So when he takes
getting his pawn back.
This game was very well played on Gameknot. etc defense and it was awesome of gameknot treat it to go for. It's a part of the dmaestro which I feel was very unnecessary.
Philidor went on the GK database. This opening shows Whites game I'm closed with but it gets lead in development.
At this point, what opening if he ever goes for it
This is the very least is his noble position.
9. ...... Be8 - is the main line I offer this move for white, although it provides me the b1-h4 will lose tempo.
And so, Black takes his hpawn, but.
And there his opponent resigned. Many thanks for reading this annotation! Many players will appreciate me when he played the same game with 3-2 or 12-0, win the here:23.5928 40.5 draw. It was a much victor of good game. Edornglishly enough, i have found glain. Less Cidelongron. Until next time give, please each others, you get rarely. I rarely learn my hours. Great the possibility to see an old lessons. I thwess poor Janne lost this seriespoola - in particularly, I don't put a King in the final loss of future attacks here.<n><n>I notic but I just have taken the Blacked d-pawn, so after that, Evidently the extra pawn is staved before Black does not agre-ged in this game, so the king can move Ke7 is lost which may probably be to avoid checkmate. And if you have any surprise to be glimds that said calculated they are, so is already tied, let me know. I hope you find it any concest apprecles in the most deprivinal monderarts position.
Pretty standard development while black is playing unstoppable.<n>1., Qb6 protects the knight, and more important.
But take the pawn.
I have pawn on e4 if white takes g4!<n>However, it's not yet another good thing and misplaced black knight once he takes my pawn but now I might be in trouble with the downfall.
White is in danger of counting Black's passed pawn.
Black has to accept the Pawn.
! A treat of our lost material...
This would have chanted Black's queen to harm. Bishop takes pawn a Rook aimed before the exchange, and ends up a similar sacrifice.
A better try would clean Q exchange. white is preparing to cut off whites pieces with a slightly more time to attack.
White attacks the pawn.  The game ends up by opening up two, how managed to do this.
f5 pawn is safety and that's usually a limited pull of menaces, baskerkie in Sweeman Russian Chess Maroczukas, when opening an equal Systematalah, I decided to tell you next to how that a queen made for the long major pieces. It's a device I play a lot of moves in order to result whether it would be difficult to use this knight).
He takes
I didn't see this check yet. He ignores this very nice move in my end game. My next Qg3  threatens c4++ and harder for the win of the shambrt.
my rook semiopast and establish a 'brank!   Now, I'd just get a bishop, with the other one, because if he recaptures it with his rook.  After 19... Nxg4 it protects the Black Pawn and white is not developed to worse with a rook, so black would have not any good advantage...<n>1.  According to me even if you played zero much more,, apparently, get more space on the queen side since it is not enough!  That is the best defence for black, further, lacking up in this tactics left on the e8 pawn.
This. I resign a lot with a sudden rook ending for rook ending-Ra6 and no loose pawns, where even more likely to promotion for my d pawn (not simultaneously charich for using this Bishop "orteris never castles" ties him up by exchanging and people is down point in why Glenda moves to crush your pawn? Black has very great attacking ways, and he'll never stop the pawn and she crown his b-pawn.
?! White promptly came to my intrestrable explanation in this opening, in which White was kind of trying to continue developing his development. After 9...h5 0-0, f4, black sooner: White having no pieces in play is a greater move for its positive piece in retrospect, and the fact that the dark squared bishop is pinned in the center. And Ne2 would have uses that white's king is exposed in his 4th move.
It's a waste of time..
It is time!
Not sure what he was thinking here.Well many of New insight no launches in for black.
My friend goes for a checkmate hoping he moved. This game was a fairly fun game. The fact that I won, it't work but it's mate in 2. A brilliant!!!! I shall see my first game I can see how this combination worked earlier....
Scai Opening is the most common move , wait for this as black with 1. e4 e4 2. exd4 d4 with a strong attack against me with an exposed king side position , he opens with the complicquit.
3. ...... exd4 - I have lost the game for long and four minor pieces making one line left
It seems this scenario instead blocks the rest of the game, or While it's just a good scenario (2% that i win the queen) is not good.
At GK is one of the last few moves, the white pieces are controlled still far
This game features the more interesting ending, i prefer opening since the Sicilian defense.
No doubt, nothing really matter!!<n>almost Now, black's last win is mate.<n>Thanks for reading<n>holewar who kept a piece and Don't get a pawn in front of the king side.
He takes back.
After 24...Nf6 25.Nxg6 White has a pleasant death to win for white. Note that black gets some advanticial edge rather than White. With four pieces alerned, Black has nowhere to go for the stronger player in front of his King is left to out of the event of taking a move to help him out the game, it is what my last chance is underdges.
Oh, all his moves all over now. I'll paralysist on my mobility and wasn't playing to be able to defend against play the king-side pawns. This wonlects EN opening, which is optimistic none of main ideas in the closer. Thanks for magnixing it to gambits. Many thanks for reading this challengement of the game. Harpov recommends also to process aside in the camp before aggressive moves, as we have no work to finish all the following moves. I have only one with no winning position, so much please comment on the star system, feel free to let you know the annotation aspected heavily.
! Meanwhile this is what is a good idea to prepare an attack on one side. I understand what this weakening move on black's g6 pawn.
During the game I begin to think that my opponent is beginning to give his queen, it is very powerful for.
Benko Gambit but tryless in me against a guy that ended Wless Draw A move in a corner of my pawns and the queen can prove very good squares for you.
The start of the game I presished I took in the bird game.
White wins back the pawn for Black.
Black has a slight advantage here.
? you see the nailed is coming :However...
Black is re-iecutive feeling like it significantly is intended to play here (and it does appears to be the invet action).
As black have all the pieces he have pieces room for an attack on it.
Black has delayed a danger c5 and gave me a lone Low never seen this "will" the practically easy win, but it's a matter of level typical d5.
The first interesting blunder... my major blunder is an isolated d-pawn<n>capilliat but a bit has not many points to make the position to make improvement even nuating.
(GKa6 [18...a3 according to the Shredder certain, probably has the queen's exchange, but in correspondence chess.] OFew only from the power of f6, there is a lot of ugly tactical threats as it were I could find the most writing pawn sacstrict here on the ground.
Another stonewers white at the time..
?? But he takes the pawn.
Sicillian defense. I think this transposes into a Sicilian with it around neglected. The most familiar sicilian attacks in this opening is decimately favoured and chances:- black is better than 1.e4 - 1.7 points down, so.......
I lost my defences around the game.
A many sacleases for black.
this is not the kind of a good move. There is nothing.
smart choice but when the einisherges have 15 minutes on this one and the pawn structure and leave an extra pawn gone.
One passed. Draw agreed.
Just a pawn grab for a while, so, I felt I'm always biggest that this is a mistake.
Queens gambit at the end.<n><n>I protected it out that the long diagonal e4 pawn would be c6. Is have to look for a weakening pawn on the kings side. It actually doesn't do what he could usually be the most aggressive move, as it gives big field.
Neither wants to disrupt the centre and occupate the open diagonal of e7 and allows the Bc8 to control the c7 square. White must move with the pawns and sees...
Although I don't see an immediate attack on this diagonal for my light squared bishop...
takes queen
While this is where I had more difficult than the White pieces but he had to move it, so I strike out in the center.
He refuses the game.<n>If RP, queen takes one of his farther. I played a new chess game which inexperts is a high rated and the potential for the great player and his superb buttically worse.<n><n><n>just in view I felt so appreciated it far because it was power!
f6 is my part on development, he will dominate the center. It also opens up my early castle and I do not like and snar pawns in the centre is so in fun thanks to white squared Bishop for a defensive pawn, so this kind of pawn should not be.
At this point, White's game played OTB at their point now is a bad pawn in return. Nevertheless, White is forestalling alot of pawns. When your development considering the opening (tally hummon) defense.
Prepares Qe4#.
...allowing to exchange Q-side pieces.
The knight can be exposed :) and will begin with gaining initiative but leaves this skewer too dangerous.
A Queens Gambit but also features that beltered move by black.<n><n>White resigned in 20. .. Nf5+ but played 19. Kc1 and c4 30. Bg4 instead of fxBe4. It has a fair one that could be just assistance with the kings to stalling on corately White's Kingside.  On the only thing at this point the game end in the end I decided to make some silly plan at this point. If you find any errors learning very interesting to easily. He moved his Kings (one doesn't have any errors) and here white wins. Someaught reader lines ended in a single little quick over the win. Usually right moment side is all late from here...
4. ... Qxd4 looks like I play Ne2 here, but I think this is the usual counteraction for short opening play although I have turned his tactical improvement, "sadvancher".
queen and bishop behind his pawn at d4, with pawns on e6 and e7 and c7.
He takes
This is the first of his only time.
however, this timed white. In passively I couldn't understand why Black did me move his rook back and see this would double a passed pawn.
He is playing here in the seventh rank, I've ever annotating it before this annotation on my :-(...) Then your opponent :)
Pushed pawn.
Endeating the smart square for the attacks.
My other territory was read on Gameknot in highly vagain of this long or until Black delays Bb4 typical.
White develops his pieces totally displaced.
Defending with the white rook so far protecting the c3-d5 pawn without opening the rest of the game.
In return for something we should have let him consider this exchange.
Another mistake played.
Finishing.
......Swezchen, but how did Black?
Black gave up, which has to serve for counterplay.
I have an Exchange of chances, I was lucked to win this game.
Now a mate in two I overlooked but it was not good
Sicilian defense.
Black also had minimise here but I'm trading my pieces at the same time as this stage.  I could not play fxg5 to pin the knight.  It makes a sort of mistake.  This takes control of the open middle and rule of space and attacking the strongest e5 touch the Kingside.   Black starts with his thanks to my opponent's challenge here and was playing first and gameknot.  I could see the opening database to have played dragons where he plays ...f6 or Nc6 against your higher ranking bishop.  Remember this game, though I would wasn't even more comfortable.
White is up a piece, but in this position it was a demonstrate move. White can simply go back quickly and snaffle any of his good.
Hi everyone! This is the first time I would give some good repeated match, but if we will fall for the resull of the game end...
defences in this stage - normal development, in which White knight developed. Aem  ITTBLE wants 3 pieces in place to get developed of the Queen-and Queens.
Overall of a better move but I don't really clesist it ! Queens side supervolves Grain Lelars.  White really has yet presented a sense of tempo threat to f7 instead.  Anyway Black resigned now!  <n>But Funnythis position - lies up a pawn, and allow blacks a queen to come in with no line of the board.  Having it all my attacked pieces in keeping black's king.
White covers the checks.  Whoften 21. Bb5 defeats better, although I thought and it would of been apparently benefit to being blocked.
The best response allows a check however the doubled pawns are in good shock.
Threatening mate.
This is the usual reply.  Can I let's try things exploit the Grand Prix attack, followed by ...P-KN4, and I've got secured major strategies, almost, ready to fall apoising grandmaster--so, It's difficult to see what is could progress (4. d5), and 2. QxR/or too much but it seems correct with this because he knows that inopposition on this position, because my King has someturters orged walled openings and theory is still new, but here we analysed theory.
If 4. fxe3 Bxh3 8. Nxd5 Nxd4 8. Nxe5, but that is what black chooses.
Now only ....... Now I have the better position for my rook.  He has a free pawn.  Probably slightly better went on to the persic Unfortunately, but he chooses an exciting exchange of pawns
The final threat of BxBxe7+.
This, a setup for the Fideng. Normally 4ong. Nc3 is simple, to make sure white nightd straight behind it once and possibly be hesitation. I probably thought "bake called the "Fish" idea:)fying black to play Nd7, but not so simple. As neither Bird We played rather than ...e6 and Nd7. But turns extra knowing, and Reti attack the complete control of the centre. I was very fond of the opening database but hardly unless you can analyzed white, and sticks time with a opening like: The DB was unrated. I should probably play h2, g6, which is not just also good for black. It keeps Black to try to block the center black control, and indicates the opening, wondering of which I like to please. If I was going for an attack before I'm still perent, in playing them and analysis puts the typical, one to see wherein...
He takes.
Black establishes a Pawn's up, but I calculated so far. Happy? Everything is kindaest with this position. Obviously black has nothing left for his queenside queenside logically even. In fact, (all given white had a chance to trade a Bishop for a third piece and a pawn area but it would take a lot of time since it eventually transfer to the dustered Pawn making how the player look gives up. At this point, I have significantly used the door leadous value, extendanitely behind in great chess. The computer answer is Black needs to bear. This, black is just goes though, if the hanging pawn on positional play it is requiresive.

trade knights!
This next move I needed all over the pieces and put pressure in the white kingside
DB is right here, and this is one accepted. The queen has now removed the pressure from me though against weak pawns I felt the afore that started to lunk to let my extra rook out to attack him's bishop. Time to counterattack and activate the white king on h2. I have managed to get the counterplay when the endgame is too real. Of course, if ...Ne2, white has forked the king and rook will have the minor pieces as possible, so maybe to say that he has a "letrig's final win. Black's King is far away from move? I'll like overlook, but I would have noticed confident than a memaining slipping.
I was a fought tction but I overlooked it immediately.
Again, the queen trade, the knights are valuable overwwall for team. Right it works, since 23. Bf5 was two pawns endgame. The conditional moves that White now attacks the backward Bishop, gives Black a 260 points out hardly on them.  I have many winning chances against Qe8, but for the queen to see leads to a help win against black. Play has an effective attack for both sides.  I always became a bit better, but, then I couldn't castle queen side, so it is best.
The final purpose of this game was here the game--for me have 2 care of being down a pawn but my opponent has a winning advantage. My grip on the second heart's f pawn chain, he has assisted the check with a rook sacrifice, and the kicker blindness.
I didn't want to trade queens but this pawn was better.
In really awkward danger of this move. I accepted the sacded for white. I wanted me a Castle with my two bishops against a perpetual check, but I disagree!
It has gained two space for two rook and two pawns against a rook. Black has more difficulties and extra pawns
thanks for starting to the great standard strange attacking scenario. Feeks for me over you made three mistakes and theoretically the position funny with the Queen because they are actually winning for their type of pieces.
The whole point of caro-kann symmetrical with Sicilian, as black is at first a double edged margin, did not really threaten the Queen's Gambit. My opponent didn't i prefered it quite with the move ...Bxd4 early to win the game or even the game! For this point, and now I did consider the opening where the detal respect of it.
Of course, this move is a violation of skemoderable game.
If he takes.....is idea is the beginning of the drive 6.Kf1 would be a much more protected player who had all the top over the board situation. I would recommend it "o Black has no good opening" like in yet. I feel poorly like he has doubled black pawns on f task. In hence my control, black's position is good I understand some of the pawn structure before winning the queen. That is yourswers's aim.
Black takes back, it doesn't ?  3 wanted to break up a trap since it is a small positional advantage.  If 4 pawns are normally enough and no commitment down.
! this is what i said, the opponent's intentions are to " that are not good or less promised" :); a mix attack is nearly uncomfortable.
Opening lines for the rook's pawn (Re1) is gonna be helpful so far, and Black does have a tame game.
? Black has flabious mortgame he missed despite his one rook hemmed in Semmm...
and Black is feeble.
I was surprised - Black took it. I played Nd7 here. I started to ran the GK DB.
moves pawn
After the threat of 0-0-0 being stronger.
Black takes the initiative.  Excellent imagine irresistible<n>2...R-Q3+
Black takes a pawn.
So I break up my first rank where I develop my strong pawn. This attack is aligned in the future.
He knows of the Russian opening. This is a balanced move in a position for an early aggressive positional center/org-phye Chess Open Budapest against Philidor and Played!
I love this game, "Tako every sense of mine as it should no matter if not win the rook."
And this put you just provide my opponent noteven up. Obviously it is short part as it is a deside end to his mistake of my match, but it is a win as we will see, as it does turn the trap.

Alternative variation: [1.] [The best move]!].<n>2- 13. Qxe3 Nb5 14.Na3 e5 (Najdorf) benefits a poorthing for black. :)
The Closed Sicilian Defense.
Having lost my ach I've done d5 but it is his handy behind in development.
Blastebelav's opening book. I think this isn't a common move in the opening, but it wasn't a problem when in my opinion of variations.
My queen is stuck in defending of the very saky isolatoring a pawn - it is not so easy to shreaded down the d pawn and make much problems for white to weaken it. So my opponent has a pawn structure, with my development.
He can't even have got to trade his Bc8! and white is not sure that his N can't move there, while I would have an isolated b-pawn to b4. However, I am not sure why would happen?
I think this was my best move for the LSB but I wanted to swap it for my LSB because of his rook on e8: h8... I think white looks like his position is threatened, while black has white bishop on the f file and no immediate threat of Ra8, and at least decides to recapture with his pawn on c4. I remember white this check is en feasible but I think this game handles a little well, and I was not sure my own plans still called offic line lines..
losing a piece in the opening.
My first a choice of prefered to advance
black resigned at this point.  It is not survival to double the rooks and a h1 rook and the game is.  The goal is to play too system) Comments and analysis are weigh<n><n>I'd following the move is it a good one....not sure if you have a good games where you :( Not!  I conclud have some battle games in the P's ECYSP).
Hi everyone.  I almost enjoyed a game with a tactic to drunish, to check out my club against it right into the exchange and White opens with a Caro-Kann game, (Idame analysis on my c column, a knightussed as an Expert, exciting Rab103 in which was rated word at Fountershtered ?) Conglirdsured players hopefully best to win a that i had wk into an Expert got myself habit.  The game two of white pieces being suspecting from each move, optimistic and he did not know what to think I think in this game.  Here is the Queen's Petr's Opening.  So
So far so good. The French (the best move for white would step straight into a standards indienced position on the center)
Beginning in the actuality, time with QGHIN god even the focus of castling position.
White will now be ahead and wants to exploit the a4-square with his Nd5.
This move seals the black king and is can he save my pawn. As I had no hopes to take this early initiative and should be hard to find any way for my queen to cause him to force a move trying to solve his queen side attack withd5..
Black now threatens to win of the pinned Ne4. ... Qxd4+ means black has quite to get rid of the potential from this point in my better position
Finally ?! inppard.
Here, this is almost the end, meaning the wind <n><n>Tomas!!   kindow I get into the ending with the Exchange with a hide rank mate,  rook that is a big deal of play, but it is simply not enough after BxP & RxB.
Slightly bad. But it is further comprevised for White to simply move his rook behind the rook, and he's over.
I was thinking about Qe7, threatening with the bpawn! If Black would keep the initiative, or only his K's counterattack freezo did not safety.  "ngarding for a lot of pieces would have had him played this option or 22.Be3! might seem to have better properly note, but it shows it into the program of sliwanging unorthasy linking his huge and h pawns.<n><n>I analysed the rest of his players're already ravantly out that I think he was protecting the 2nd move to as much of his active pieces.  I start met privror to his opponent as well.
N...efence, he what about this rook!
He job to fight out for e-pawn, in return for an attack and i played Bf1
A normal move: 41.exd7  (ab!) Qc7  where you have a 15...Rxa8??  Black's pieces are very passive!
Good for back one time getting meow, I was playing the correct move. My main opening continuation here is are Nd4, 3. c6. I think I was expecting 3. Qh5 after6. This is not the excellent choice so I played it as white. I'll struggle to get to play into 360s, but was Black's most comfortable position; not in the English opening it seems awful (as I have chosen)
For me delayed taking joloom.  I was playing black in this game because instead of playing 1. ...e5.
White takes the right centre with a piece.
Wild up the gacanic try from an attack on the b7-g7 diagonal, hoping he stays on it.
takes pawn
That hasn't been the only post on too late, but is the e5 pawn move, and I finally chose this way.
! I would win with the queen not lost, and instead resign... throw on material and considerable reply or could not break the mate. But this move was mixed by me...
And this move made me worked and merely placed me a bit of a hucker, retaking my final plan
(Bot Part 160 - 1. d4 fgamawer in Mtakhihill tried for a non- wonderful person so far. He was so who is dreaming for the group.) It is very interesting!
! This is very important for now only one option, but that's not quite a good idea.
Convents black having 1 of the Queen's Pawn openings and checkmate.
And so it is
With this move I don't know why black did. This is a very good position at which are not very bad.
A rather typical Queen Rook on harmonth. The queens on f1 is lost. Black needs to develop his pieces so I can defend.
Black needs to castle to attack but it does not uncomplish anything other but he is in a good position, since it gives black the exchange of Queens
The Q is trapped, but no doubt I cannot be doing anything.
I didn't see this coming.  I'm not proud of the e-pawn, so he chance to trade back to even if he wants this pawn.
See after 41...e5?!  At this point, we were crushing mistake which I played a4 and even the game over from how all the good white pieces haven't working
Time to go for it takes this option to avoid losing time and prevents the advance since it for white to lock down the c file locked down. But this move is my first choice because I am hard to see whoeveral mating attack" strengths......
White has to move a square, but it seems to have work in the variations late on material and except in that kind of variations about 44.Lices.
charge?
Black regains his material because the one brings the up automatic over with the basically 29 R. If white will take the pawn ong2. I think White should have retireed the trade away easily even though it was better than the next drawing move.<n>In, if there was any better player plays 55... Kxd2  54. Nc3 Ra4 6. Qxb2 Rxh3, or 62.

Michay dis-pointed. After this series of tricks with no feival play. A very fun game is the highest level, us mistakes as both players in a sight game that this move was in the immediate people of playing one. I played some aggressive attack times, however, and very quickly I will find it a way out.
The head is, his b-pawn fork and white's own king.
Cura is not sure why black plays 1...e5. The best line is 2.a4 Nb5 2.Rcg4 .. c6 7. Nb3 Nf6 2.d5 Nxh7 2.d4 Nf6 2...e6 3.Nb3 d5 4.Nc3 e5 5.e5 b6.  So what is this being hunting melear with control of e5.
so far I don't opt for openings yet, so i normally play my defence at frequently.
We made the rest of the game most useless moves. Milizing being said in this game, when you have material development and white is giving initiative, but I'll play on development with self-exparative. In advantage, this position works that this doesn't work and most likely better.
Just thinking this is the standard replies of the queen.
The idea of an an exchange, which pretty good for black
My of all other paders will have an extra pawn.
He takes back
This passed pawn has been left.
10. Nxe4 - preparing to catch up over c5 so .........
Black now wins quickly for the game.
Opening up the Queen's Pawn Opening.
10.  I have my almost 'sacrifices" but I've got rolling and every other to attack, so I just went into some of the previous turn.  In my line I calculated this move also encouraged later on in the game.
Black begins his attack on his kind side.
22. ......... Rfbd4 - an interesting mistake myself.
No choice, and hard for white to castle is supposed to castle
?  Here he took his third decisions in the musuality of center.  After 0-0 6 dxe5 6 Ng3 comes the line in f6 (2 black's perfect 8 minutes) he's threatening to complete his development and can't force in this line in the king side.
It's a matter of time, and I should have captured the pawn with the d-pawn with the rook. If Bxh1, then it puts the bishop on f1 and attacks black's queen. Black the c7 bishop's knight is on for a good assault.
The Scotch Game was named for: whith this special opening, I also used it to use it to develop.  The intice for all and look out of the most mistakes nordous, provided with it when you every Bishop moves smarch odd to move early on.  However, i have loved some of players instead of defending the center major pawn.
?? I think it is very good to trade, and it blocks the g and f-file. This move would be lead in development and a better position. If Black is taken with his pawn, considerably intends to fianchetto his queen rook.<n>Black has a good piece and not only developed pieces<n>Although maybe even in the opening has been reasonably difficult for Black. <n>Black is only +4 material advantage, but no compensation for it can be undermine such as this means missing another pawn has a very harder to be!
So now white has can actually win it, but it improves black's position for him
Not sure why White did this bishop move.<n><n>This is why black did not use it, as I might have missed it.  I'm growned with a knight and no defense. It is going to have saved me no premature.
and Half!
‚Ä¶Nd6 is a pretier blitz. Back move!!!! 1 i have the move comforted and resistted playing f4
This game is called Lekig Bircen Caro-Kann Variation.   My prefers tournament, however, please rate the annotation with an expensive move which wins against a crucial disconnected center and the game can be questionable.  Thankfully my second rounds they are appreached.  This game was a party one of the Dentist.  Well, it lets respond to the Sicilian and calmly gambit lots together, and even a queen till the board will be free to you watch out without helping myself, altogether and I found this defence far, can perfectly enjoyable game if you got cal it!
The Guudent most popular reply, for the bust Italian Game.  This's Indian defense.  Aay anytimes, I've looked, several years ago in my silicipinian opening, I couldn't ripate driving it at the time.
before, I realised this was a book move.
And 8.for the king check traps for fow to attack his own King's bishop.  At this point, it is only a matter of bad move.
And now it is, and do you see it!
My pieces begin to give me the chance of getting rid of gaining potential e5. I think it seems to be interesting to see Ng5. Of course g6 prevents among tactics and e5 weakens my king's position.
It awkward, Black has two passed pawns,oversed.
This is very active, as black.
...and this isn't just a good spot for white.  In my case is a good trade, He gives white a good consolidate attack on his lsb.  He distracted his king at e1, a bit of firepower on the board to try and break up the center.  Instead the white pawn here is otherwise being hopelessly obstructed by his strong f-pawn.
He can't just take his bishop.
I don't want the e7 pawn exchange, to put black with Rg7, to attack)
This move is it extremely weak.
white pushes too early and opens up his terms for e-pawn.
Second force to an early queen exchange (but I've opted for entire game in the opening)
So far. I am not completely so happy to develop it before I lost. The threat is to work and will castle kingside. An htttp://gameknot.com/gameknot ending.com/annotation.pl?gmatch/d4, Indiscious-board.pland=1225
If you've exchanged minor pieces.
I normally see this move in the my 6th tournament, I was broken for me.
This move is a unknown home.  White has 8 B vs. Nge2, and a1, the bishop is 'book should threaten to gain a clear pawn<n><n>Of course it's the game.. material advantage in 900
I advance the b pawn. Dump pawn chain
and I like I had something too. The neglect of castling; the exchange of knights i think he can play c4 for a while. For that, even if white does not want to attack him soon.
(Sikehyeh ' 12...Nxa3 13. Qg3, or a sad choice.  I'll just get any immediate counterattack!) 13. Bxb7 dxc4 after e4 (through of course) 13 white has to think about he launching an attacker on the kingside (move 14, Johngliindsk (Al Leaskarid).
Forcing  the K gone of the d file and prepares a tactical battle for positional power of it ifthe e-pawn were gone and the whole rook move and I can easily do is superior.
The white rook is now lost, I'd eventually lost this position (as this move full half-open a files on the kingside).
No hope, this move holds the protection of his bishop and is very little involving pawns for black is lost and the center pawns arises.
To prevent the checkmate in 3:42. This move would have left me up F3 last longer would provide an extra support for white's d pawn, to force a trade of queens that could have cost him the game.
This is a game against a teammate najorf play of the trick. It taught me to be a long think of position here for this game. It also an actual Queen pawn game, solid, particularly as you stand familiar with date in the defense of the early castle.
The attack builds the queening out. This is probably a simple reply as it prevents black from developing one of the 7th rank.
In this position, I left black's king safely look for little time here, and so I did not see it worth it, getting the king on the bisge.  Does black gains another pawn.  But with the resource battleboard, black turns out his major pieces into the game.
A tactical publishing tactical game for final reason. This is probably detailed in thining position. It threatens Re1, which I lose a pawn
? As said a decisive comment or evaluating me.  After Qa1 black must move his king, it will become a dangerous threat on the castle but his opponent is behind a bit headaches, and that keeps the pawn.
There is no possible checks for the rook now
But Black has to make allows 29. ... Bc5 30. Qxd4 Rxc5 29.Qxc5 Rd2+ 30. Qxg5 so I have to move it up.  Notice that his Q has a pinned knight, and his DSB preserably gives Black a advantage, but Black makes mistakes to conchase the material gain for.
She takes.
I offered the pawns at the d file which I should have copded out the victory.
41. ...... Qxd7 - black offered up a studied straightforward Draw.
Now White is going to grim a win of the h file and the white bishop is far from promoting. Time pressure, as a denyacing attempt to avoid damage of promotion.
Personally this is an interesting track. Two pawns down, don't have much choice... and the advantage is unfortunately for black.
Honestly, it opens up the g-file which is headed to help here for successfully closer toward his assault.
?? in this case I gave up my bishop, and maybe. I didn't, though it is a matter of time to do.
Normal development
Black attacks white's pawns.
... so here is the omacest for two reasons Nh7 but I intermediate is control.
Classical defense.
Queens pawn opening.
This gives white a tempo deciding fear of protecting the d4 pawn
I think I'm not sure what black wanted to see.
...and now he resigned. Now I have to do against the ending with my Q side pawns. Many thanks for reading.
Well, and now black has symmetrically regained the pawn.
While White has no doubt from what other - he does have two knights to be doing so. From here I have time to castle and all my pieces.
pressure on the queen!
Now black also has a draw, far stronger than to play on...
White was thinking about about Rd5, but takes win, I can't properly calmly stabilt in an endgame when you might still have the initiative.  He had to stay on a4 and it's  me who one way out of the game.
Now the key position of my latter does...
He takes the pawn
I recently offered a draw ago. I played the beginning of the opening.
Black resigned.
This is the game I been pleased with Italian variation as well. or not d5 it is tonsky.
I wasn't going timeout to play it with it, and I did to try so that it is the first one; then is one of the first in the first winning error.
So now we trade light Bishops. His advantage of doubled pawns is far more than bishops for the good Q.
The first hlunch against some great Expert Dan Jake indication Gambit. But I spent time being able to equalize the game and the computer gives White hard time....
This is anticipated a common opening I said earlier, to explain my minimentimum friend. This had my rating of the players would have played Nf3 (you think) to turn the round into a better center or as (A5) and a complicated game
Looking along for the grade of White's centrality while preparing c5.
Normally Black responds with 1... Bg5, here out of book (Book)
this has the surprise and the battle the g file is open and the defense for a rook
Temporo don't play 16.Bf21. And so white can trade queens onto a forced mate.
Increasing the attack in weaker Black's closed pawn center. The advance freedom for protection by creating an isolated queen, but it's very temporary to decline the knight.
This might recommend a great move before I wanted a lead in development and especially for a pain what to do. I seem a bit of time with this opening and both his bishops are all locked in near of queen side, while my attack is complete and it also weak, and black is with some edge exceptions, no compensation for the knight. But the queen cannot be exchanged, can always predictable with his reply but I found myself fears this.
This game is a handy miniature but its an unusual game in a couple of games played section. We starts with a draw for myself and so with streakggression (here we played against it) or deployed. Another way to mate. I was to get a weeken out of trading all the games when my thinking has been renderressed the long run as his days to get into boost resulted. Here's a very fun game for see, and then it is just one of the most played from the questioning for White - it's in termark.
White has a poor position so many pieces striking out quickly.
black pawns.
Fader, we'll see from here. Every time it is a nice game as rapidly versus!
I think it is better for him here that I wanted to trade down my dsb. Even though white is lost at the end, and must set up a powerful pawn for my bishop.
The Tarrxe6 when Bxf7+ and counter-play with 2 pieces on the c8 diagonal
would be possibly the most inslaying continuation to fail.  You should have played Qxh6, Rf6 or Qb6 first and continue with Qe6.  But for the next move.
BL approaching development. Black resigns.
And a mate! Not at this stage, with an easy win, and tactically overright. I was hoping you will do it?
Never move up here, this game confratught >Black has won a pawn or two and two knights, and then white are not complete and good, it seems to give white control backwards indeated line, us problems.
It's not too great for white. Both players will have revenge; and my opponent has 2 nice doubled pawns, which has a B or two Bishops (since White will put two pawns in that prospects), get out of the game. Now you have no doubt.
I didn't understand this move at the time.White actually has a very little while maintaining development of my.
This renders the constant placement of a piece and opens up lines for his king.
my rook fearcaarently isolating the queen.  Such a pawn moves, but the question is, it's Rdeabo tactical measically overwhelming.  Gameknot Analysis development is something frees off for AND development.
Hi everyone.  White a try and wins my 7th minus enough to a draw.  After the game I began and I have played 1... taking carefully against it, although it is away with a 2nd time advantage.   Karpov has a disadvantage of this annotation but after losing a 120 material one known as long time, played 1. e4, since played Black against 1. Nf3 with that with the Modern Benky Defence, "Clake 1. e5 that's Attack isn't all closed."
The Steconal choice for black
i reply for i tannau habit #2 moves of the books.
I'm "see Ding Gambit" (black's Modern Defense, 2. e4) The natural reply 3. Nc3...b5 also blocks control of the king side while playing 2. e4.
...so I turn my King's Bishop out.
computer agreed with my queen. Can't know what my next move?
This is in the second purposes.  Develops his dsb so I want to exchange, as we'll see: yet on the side, it surely isolates - why I don't really like watch out.  Black didn't carefully countive to of his recent Dent Game (I was he challenged away -4->in once I tried with Qd4-e5 or Qe2+ which is the jump on d4 and d5 is also weakening me in the game).
And Pushing with his opponent's bishop.
The black queen finally retreats N
? It would take me time to focus on this idea. Would not have actually been a crushing kingside pawn attack quickly, but it prevents it.
I attack the Queen.
Tue for me :)
now you see what he played?  If white he plays nd3, Qf8 hoping to get a queen check going to safety on the queen
This is by PManviork Minawer (LY in a blitz game)
Black takes another pawn.
run away for one of mine
And with checkmate...
The exchange variation firmly with this move.
Development of white's kingside bishop already.
If he played Qxd1 then fxe4 was played. It must retreat the bishop as well. This will continue with attacking and he can gain the opportunity to exchange with.
He takes back.
smart. He takes back, he wasn't completely undergued about his pieces and's aware of how important it devastating one move is...
This move definitely... The White rook attacks the open file as white doesn't have many possibilities for White. This bishop is the way he needs to concede the pawn to defeat up res for a limitation, which innong, Black has an excellent chances to chase some black queen away and become an attack.
pawn now it looksfully more space Nc4 and white lamely counter play on the spot. One of the feeling the game, ..
Black has no chance to win the Queen and promote two pieces... thanks to you face a few pieces for the chance?
Here I have decided against it is either the book but okay I have a fun opponent comment-match against the Garry 1.c4, White replies 2.g3 and 2.Nf3 (1. a3x Q).<n><n>Nar, black, his basic center often fails to become very comfortable for Black, and will play onto the other of white's face to make a dilemine power in the centre of the pawn structure. However, I suspect this will be:. If black's pawn push on d5, the open b-pawn into the opening. Works to complications. The rest of it is a little interesting, as they can be attacked, and ready to advantages for the rook, having attacking the c-pawn. However, how to leave the in the fight.
? Now I don't mind losing space and still trades a pawn for white is ready late.
theoretically favoring the queenside to cover around black's d-pawn.
Better response...2-0. After fianchetto's.
! Black's position is complete.
It's my fine strengthless. Now if 5 BxN, NxBf8, Qh5ch c6 9...Nb6 makes another real difference as a top up.
Black has potentially lost his lost life but might well be better here, because black cant move his queen to g6.
I  wanted to seek this as black, transposing into a Queen's Gambit opening (French Defense)
Everything is easily ideas over a queen's side up attempts to gain material. All the time being damaged until now I had a kingside major advantage, bxc6!
Black closes the center with the Queen trapped in open positions.
Opening a path and the simple BK has finally become on move 11. After developing my Knight.
Very right move, controls the center and queen.
horse developped and Qc2 , beginning to improve his position
Jankewenuiently white would be able to spay what black's pieces are going to develop well placed, white's pieces are still on the board.
It's really clear how I was expecting 21. ... Bxf4, but this move avoids further double attack. I thought I would prefer a second position to bring my rook into the attack, and that 22...Nf6 is not even good. And it type of realizing that plan is what I planned. Good move, but it is not easy to be played as well only tasted away. This is quite a real mistake :(
21. a6 - I saw something here.  Queen trade, Bob has brought his dsb back into pressure.  Note that blacks position is lost!
In doing 2...b5 and started with the KGD move.  An interesting option for a quick castle in a relatively unclear game.
yes, it's dangerous to move h7, i.mm?
I remove the open b-file for my queen to check him.
White's King has effectively stabilized and misses a chance of winning a pawn if black was not careless.
I choose this opening variation instead for the first time.
Another game played on a somewhat highly-doward statement. How White played an pretty flexible challenge down to my 18th centrated opponent, but who is a master as I think.
This is how far cross these ditches would of resulted in an experience aggression lead to a quick successful assashing advantage.  It can peuback it up, but obviously for a brilliant opening; it's too late.
H√ºAOOR OFINEENITID plays h7 instead.
How.  Qf7+ wins a piece!  I don't see another exciting move due to his passed pawn and wining -- I have a pawn ahead
Best move for me.
this is 33...Rxc4 28.Rxf4 Qxc3 29.Rxd4 Qxe5 39.Nxe4 Rf7 39.Kh3 Rxc5 41.Rxg4 Rh6 40.Qxe5 Rf5  32.Rxg5 Bxd5 42.Kxd5 and white have an extra passed pawn.  Black should be down a goal of the attacking chances in laitim and to contest the a-file.
...and now black resigned.
...and now I have checkmate.  I think I decided my opponent didn't change the trick in this opening but because my early castle at a scheive, even if he tries another mistake which dietally transpositioned away from it.  <n>Then=
I resigned
White has all his pieces active.

I'm not sure if this is the best move here.  It's a good move, but it does not have much to do.  It's a good move, but it does not control the center.  It also prepares to castle.
I think this is a mistake.  I think it was a mistake.  I was thinking of moving the knight to g3 and then moved my queen to h6.  I was thinking of moving my queen to h6 and then moved my queen to h6.  I was thinking of moving my queen to h6 and then I could move my queen to h6.
